Synthesis of virus-specific RNA in permeabilized murine coronavirus-infected cells,"Abstract We have developed a permeabilized cell system for assaying mouse hepatitis virus-specific RNA polymerase activity. This activity was characterized as to its requirements for mono- and divalent cations, requirements for an exogenous energy source, and pH optimum. This system faithfully reflects MHV-specific RNA synthesis in the intact cell, with regard to both its time of appearance during the course of infection and the products synthesized. The system is efficient and the RNA products were identical to those observed in intact MHV-infected cells as judged by agarose gel electrophoresis and hybridization. Permeabilized cells appear to be an ideal system for studying coronavirus RNA synthesis since they closely mimic in vivo conditions while allowing much of the experimental flexibility of truly cell-free systems.",-0.049651667,-0.01109364,-0.026801305,-0.002311198,0.042196438,0.021205124,-0.003560336,0.020746207,0.045433734,0.025883123,0.06997329,-0.002395676,-0.03294566,0.010639226,-0.012713101,-0.07007808,-0.06049483,0.06539715,0.03855952,0.02545983,-0.026354896,-0.045567665,-0.049462903,0.03121175,0.043762792,0.031182038,0.021026993,0.059215993,-0.01762353,-0.001876048,0.06470972,0.04651631,-0.003963826,-0.028001545,0.019406056,-0.008399116,-0.054083906,-0.033909284,0.011349063,0.025290316,0.066879556,-0.06337412,-0.035523828,-0.06246143,0.06347333,-0.03840245,-0.05347969,-0.061518896,0.06048059,-0.013056147,-0.04410281,0.068835706,-0.05463736,0.008012914,-0.062601134,0.06771306,-0.04292311,0.000120799,0.05709477,0.020141484,0.050126407,-0.01404067,0.03809046,-0.02352267,0.05452094,-0.05580645,0.04987506,-4.59E-05,0.051165033,-0.005473864,0.04245386,0.008300051,0.06004503,0.0166807,-0.048894655,0.026667967,0.066058904,-0.028216258,-0.06650547,0.06642414,-0.0639232,0.070222914,0.024374256,0.058304522,-0.030777084,0.05946568,-0.012989881,-0.03198621,-0.020899514,-0.014167438,0.015820542,-0.06300214,-0.060870014,0.031593774,0.006140176,0.059918657,0.03821387,0.06802362,0.070535935,-0.023014102,0.017103486,-0.003326771,0.052918453,0.02721757,0.018426083,0.066773325,0.014744438,0.002287396,-0.03696411,0.049769737,-0.048328876,0.06789453,0.026254324,0.057690725,0.014295844,0.000617836,-0.06417077,-0.02209489,-0.051360805,0.015264131,-0.019216642,0.052229177,-0.016252453,-0.061928052,0.03697846,0.04436779,-0.02423677,-0.001735552,0.04053955,0.04065855,0.015832147,0.070633866,0.053646203,0.006043614,0.03760824,-0.019165426,0.013392537,-0.05323363,-0.030079087,0.008452329,-0.031537045,0.07033636,-0.06239915,-0.03064739,-0.06492287,-0.049077313,-0.041873746,-0.06764844,0.05079102,-0.022268044,0.036729537,-0.06702608,-0.06125109,0.002376063,0.07063895,0.011360573,0.005083474,0.050035436,0.05355834,-0.043138795,0.001320399,0.01633003,-0.044634845,0.05478482,-0.02254037,0.025076188,-0.031055197,0.045601465,0.034776118,-0.051773958,-0.0480084,0.06531713,-0.007749636,-0.059650958,0.029871773,-0.026140142,0.004704297,-0.04230379,0.065900296,-0.039730288,-0.01588175,0.003191204,0.014749428,0.053847194,0.06681672,0.003698706,-0.058738332,0.01973299,0.000676041,0.00220211,0.06978759,0.001842036,0.014681602,0.020160396,0.07011077,-0.06366242,0.007439166,-0.06533565,-0.030142654,-0.064473405,-0.042931862,0.026055334,-0.018749721,0.04664705,0.05535705,-0.022914464,0.007229099,0.0596373,0.061371796,0.06401135,-0.04346135,0.06807338,0.008344042,0.042505667,-0.035319064,-0.05956158,0.03416275,-0.025935942,-0.018218072,-0.01138548,-0.018112909,-0.028065164,-0.01759408,-0.028869772,-0.013106692,0.024821162,-0.065917484,0.025833668,-0.035049543,0.033511844,0.023569645,0.060325135,-0.050407164,-0.070537835,0.06468378,0.06314438,-0.010991216,-0.045201663,-0.036855828,0.063252196,0.020882858,-0.005662684,-0.038014594,-0.01923867,0.05444192,-0.022299467,-0.050194204,0.006766661,0.059935056,-0.051623695,-0.07029664,0.043296825,-0.006030647,0.04454592,0.06863785,0.00875215,-0.03281576,0.0706369,-0.0495814,0.002583966,0.013907259,0.06459507,-0.023498613,0.01374729,0.03976333,0.010728867,0.021716509,0.04184455,-0.031776153,-0.001808406,0.043649834,0.058082882,0.019733112,0.03996681,0.016118761,-0.06710596,0.04762022,-0.012064326,0.06908959,0.018896244,-0.06595278,-0.03660878,-0.06121991,0.005772145,-0.054557987,0.006702229,-0.066511795,0.04454927,-0.05967184,-0.059656408,0.06989393,0.06466957,0.06178538,-0.015185315,0.043303825,-0.06600242,-0.032514643,0.020926263,-0.07020308,0.03376027,-0.014312745,0.06924921,0.054217093,0.026160218,-0.04873305,-0.010713653,-0.0146967,-0.061542712,-0.007492183,-0.06529607,-0.032379825,-0.016339095,0.058958292,-0.06749609,0.06989752,0.049437124,-0.000756432,-0.008767718,0.0352964,0.022856578,-0.04344117,0.043873668,-0.02346642,-0.049268395,-0.014126063,0.004565135,-0.000907526,-0.02989955,0.03654485,-0.008985567,0.009677754,0.048359737,-0.000854738,0.062857404,0.049227048,0.034335896,0.053324886,0.03043903,0.018138105,-0.06532365,-0.034101054,0.007504081,-0.02863384,0.045975834,-0.07063565,-0.07063816,0.034902483,0.053893305,0.026398722,-0.06491628,-0.018882368,-0.02925929,-0.06479466,-0.010387328,0.012750085,-0.046835627,-0.07052607,-0.056742586,-0.011847385,-0.03001551,0.038964417,-0.059690647,-0.069183156,0.047302444,-0.010708115,0.057395548,0.070466936,0.030919716,0.002970709,-0.044953883,0.042256683,-0.031583354,-0.041118916,-0.070640266,0.034494165,0.031885747,0.059108946,-0.04376606,-0.06096318,-0.05803777,-0.0705993,0.02473092,0.007133742,0.01351296,-0.029683707,-0.038626444,-0.032670707,-0.025062712,0.055566657,0.051100582,0.04298663,0.051572468,0.060132362,-0.04528795,0.018491294,-0.00402503,0.04552834,-0.06979359,0.046386234,-0.06323775,0.006050528,0.04804645,-0.02651209,-0.056882154,-0.046699464,-0.051657375,-0.036485437,-0.033139598,0.044658188,0.06260478,0.043288667,0.003512895,-0.005085001,-

Primary structure and post-translational processing of the berne virus peplomer protein,"Abstract The nucleotide sequence of the peplomer (P) protein gene of Berne virus (BEV), the torovirus prototype, was determined. The gene encodes an apoprotein of 1581 amino acids with an Mr of about 178K. The open reading frame was cloned behind the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and its translation product was identified as the BEV P protein precursor by in vivo expression and immunoprecipitation. The deduced amino acid sequence contains a number of domains which are typical for type I membrane glycoproteins: an N-terminal signal sequence, a putative C-terminal transmembrane anchor, and a cytoplasmic tail. Eighteen potential N-glycosylation sites, two heptad repeat domains, and a possible “trypsin-like” cleavage site were identified. The mature P protein consists of two subunits and their electrophoretic mobility upon endoglycosidase F treatment strongly suggests that the predicted cleavage site is functional in vivo. The heptad repeat domains are probably involved in the generation of an intra-chain coiled-coil secondary structure; similar inter-chain interactions can play a role in P protein oligomerization. Using a sucrose gradient assay the P protein was indeed shown to form dimers. The intra- and inter-chain coiled-coil interactions may stabilize the elongated BEV peplomers.",0.002379349,0.018184451,-0.040164325,-0.030493991,0.00833862,0.06166931,-0.012343804,-0.002477864,0.0365769,0.026190827,0.06449211,-0.015332178,-0.045427043,0.04759167,0.022340424,-0.06506494,-0.061264716,-0.040044505,0.03956641,0.017401773,-0.06162116,0.001405436,-0.05261289,0.037677005,0.027161146,0.032055154,0.064108305,0.024147166,-0.05506304,-0.054233026,-0.004287391,0.054627225,0.052345656,0.000809405,-0.015310911,-0.023039905,-0.04785764,0.06370965,-0.06390664,0.048606753,0.032235835,-0.03305925,0.012047735,-0.002613213,0.055289946,-0.04061495,-0.013136457,-0.045686252,0.042682566,-0.05527265,-0.033040874,0.03996655,-0.06442767,-0.061723355,-0.055160213,-0.014056211,-0.063637085,-0.018285312,0.061546065,-0.060006667,0.03136795,0.02051424,0.029465979,-0.022350935,-0.03259472,-0.06397993,0.060312133,-0.020306049,0.035009548,-0.036467332,0.062328905,0.048060775,0.029432993,0.050727755,0.009324661,-0.025190232,0.06437519,0.05918592,-0.016884804,0.045789108,-0.06338286,0.064466044,-0.00044449,-0.042174023,-0.052035615,0.05667984,-0.001377118,0.03302107,-0.05919926,0.06316344,-0.044170037,-0.016093494,-0.05832743,-0.029318238,-0.04928603,0.056106973,0.046941493,0.06390218,0.06511202,0.03492313,-0.062117796,0.033181366,-0.03566658,0.04894963,-0.04442023,0.044454556,0.026334206,0.009182451,-0.055227343,-0.06273554,0.033068996,0.063560635,0.02340004,0.056264993,0.03371452,-0.036960013,-0.059513073,0.043231726,0.02755525,0.029236658,-0.04191328,0.064717785,0.06439833,-0.033915248,0.040837087,0.059251808,-0.033207614,-0.040402845,0.005673143,0.049149074,-0.004428903,0.065163024,0.060441006,0.050011758,0.045736678,-0.048313804,0.015713805,0.04510831,-0.054386675,0.043496147,-0.049066074,0.06516313,-0.06306169,-0.04720543,-0.0635101,-0.06421509,0.001280278,-0.0623062,0.004663973,0.001800797,-0.06204161,-0.06491127,-0.043739665,0.010441702,0.06516401,0.015756594,-0.030353777,0.05830782,0.016233126,0.012060798,0.049366776,-0.030331912,-0.019388283,0.047030687,0.039429426,0.05036123,-0.056753594,-0.005695918,-0.06154455,-0.05361864,0.017373374,0.055837717,-0.003070424,0.042749137,0.05671823,-0.024633015,0.0408455,-0.027738761,0.06270538,0.010439471,-0.008259142,-0.006001114,-0.019043528,0.049745467,0.018676015,-0.058761902,-0.046927713,0.05978159,0.06414998,-0.026108798,0.06429918,-0.039972443,0.014193581,0.004062703,0.06493805,-0.019085255,0.004425925,-0.038649313,0.051818587,0.049620904,-0.055294905,-0.001147411,-0.007983327,0.017939039,0.060980875,-0.042933058,6.45E-05,0.06394962,0.012443371,0.0626156,0.02209529,0.054718006,0.020998059,0.04825944,-0.062480412,-0.059968323,0.04850288,0.05307178,-0.018377448,0.0568713,0.05153933,-0.043640688,0.019911407,-0.01605676,-0.026178457,-0.055268507,-0.06250535,-0.0550691,0.018571177,0.010916122,-0.009750956,0.057754148,-0.00896354,-0.065161765,0.06499976,0.054119192,0.049764242,-0.06485841,-0.027619742,0.018862769,0.053661026,0.030865617,-0.001002418,0.011163964,0.06289723,-0.00261973,-0.007755355,0.059300736,0.039748423,-0.019792156,-0.06512282,0.06307047,-0.03576986,0.013231183,0.0478876,-0.03797858,-0.051068056,0.06516403,-0.061897293,-0.023377566,0.04737541,0.060839493,-0.03869822,0.063319616,0.03930983,0.028315073,-0.023787081,-0.059631173,0.012963997,-0.03943749,0.050570183,0.064889275,-0.00997221,0.06169566,0.06071078,-0.047315236,-0.02851809,0.00517014,0.064164616,-0.0601579,-0.003340039,-0.039250106,-0.058810964,0.055503868,-0.020944579,-0.04696914,-0.052020576,0.045046277,-0.064403094,0.01239319,0.064767204,-0.04657938,0.062461037,-0.0530645,-0.039488394,-0.061895188,-0.053148903,0.03604237,-0.06451668,0.044086527,-0.022307191,0.064613335,0.063617274,0.057388965,-0.000218634,-0.014583164,-0.009825499,-0.01808348,0.050236195,-0.034770105,0.05815172,-0.036443386,0.03055987,-0.060543254,-0.03416108,0.059183292,-0.05442989,-0.061866652,0.023595769,-0.031054087,-0.040088896,-0.021173952,0.03486795,-0.059923586,0.008152257,-0.0100915,-0.035391983,-0.058690984,0.0025736,-0.000494178,0.036057226,0.017889487,0.05213447,0.061138492,0.04780935,0.029701583,0.057024125,-0.0450303,0.05737109,0.035091005,0.002111317,0.023156704,0.06393021,0.016819179,-0.06516336,-0.0651442,-0.046517357,0.028746465,-0.04141043,-0.032817204,-0.039304655,0.052287214,-0.059709676,-0.015057865,-0.018604789,-0.04837847,-0.06516178,-0.061483834,0.026837543,-0.058090467,0.027590029,-0.057439756,-0.064300455,0.010992412,0.04713576,-0.0530059,0.06511091,-0.015716048,0.06253985,0.056964543,0.04429137,-0.053818293,0.001536884,-0.065159224,0.03804664,0.012769851,0.04949809,0.015860409,-0.000765564,-0.06124083,-0.06291192,0.04256098,0.041644633,-0.05387418,-0.03603727,-0.06466377,-0.058537826,-0.058325168,0.057823386,0.02981145,-0.000767964,-0.030109571,0.060454853,-0.063536555,0.042741947,0.01658127,0.042106654,-0.034608472,-0.001572277,-0.022691194,0.02085362,-0.010424632,0.004499726,-0.003113966,0.04224931,-0.023003967,-0.03849341,0.019465607,0.054859094,0.05936787,0.023698106,-0.052096527,-0.

Comparison of the genome organization of toro- and coronaviruses: Evidence for two nonhomologous RNA recombination events during berne virus evolution,"Abstract Recently, toroviruses and coronaviruses have been found to be ancestrally related by divergence of their polymerase and envelope proteins from common ancestors. In addition, their genome organization and expression strategy, which involves the synthesis of a 3′-coterminal nested set of mRNAs, are comparable. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the genome of the torovirus prototype, Berne virus (BEV), has now revealed the results of two independent nonhomologous RNA recombinations during torovirus evolution. Berne virus open reading frame (ORF) 4 encodes a protein with significant sequence similarity (30–35% identical residues) to a part of the hemagglutinin esterase proteins of corona-viruses and influenza virus C. The sequence of the C-terminal part of the predicted BEV polymerase ORF1a product contains 31–36% identical amino acids when compared with the sequence of a nonstructural 30 32K corona-virus protein. The cluster of coronaviruses which contains this nonstructural gene expresses it not as a part of their polymerase, but by synthesizing an additional subgenomic

The complete sequence (22 kilobases) of murine coronavirus gene 1 encoding the putative proteases and RNA polymerase,"Abstract The 5′-most gene, gene 1, of the genome of murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), is presumed to encode the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. We have determined the complete sequence of this gene of the JHM strain by cDNA cloning and sequencing. The total length of this gene is 21,798 nucleotides long, which includes two overlapping, large open reading frames. The first open reading frame, ORF 1 a, is 4488 amino acids long. The second open reading frame, ORF 1 b, overlaps ORF 1 a for 75 nucleotides, and is 2731 amino acids long. The overlapping region may fold into a pseudoknot RNA structure, similar to the corresponding region of the RNA of avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The in vitro transcription and translation studies of this region indicated that these two ORFs were most likely translated into one polyprotein by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. Thus, the predicted molecular weight of the gene 1 product is more than 800,000 Da. The sequence of ORF 1 b is very similar to the corresponding ORF of IBV. In contrast, the ORF 1 a of these two viruses differ in size and have a high degree of divergence. The amino acid sequence analysis suggested that ORF 1 a contains several functional domains, including two hydrophobic, membrane-anchoring domains, and three cysteine-rich domains. It also contains a picornaviral 3C-like protease domain and two papain-like protease domains. The presence of these protease domains suggests that the polyprotein is most likely processed into multiple protein products. In contrast, the ORF 1b contains polymerase, helicase, and zinc-finger motifs. These sequence studies suggested that the MHV gene 1 product is involved in RNA synthesis, and that this product is processed autoproteolytically after translation. This study completes the sequence of the MHV genome, which is 31 kb long, and constitutes the largest viral RNA

De novo generation of defective interfering RNAs of tomato bushy stunt virus by high multiplicity passage,"Abstract Defective interfering (DI) RNAs were generated de novo in each of 12 independent isolates of tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) upon serial passage at high multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.) in plants, but not in any of 4 additional isolates after 11 serial passages at low m.o.i. The DI RNAs were detected in RNA isolated from virus particles and in 2.3 M LiCl-soluble RNA fractions isolated from inoculated leaves. Symptom attenuation leading to persistent infections was closely correlated with the passage in which DIs first developed. Comparisons of nucleotide sequences of 10 cDNA clones from 2 DI RNA populations and with a previously characterized TBSV DI RNA revealed the same four regions of sequence from the TBSV genome were strictly conserved in each of the DI RNAs: the virus 5′ leader sequence of 168 bases; a region of approximately 200–250 bases from the viral polymerase gene; approximately 70 bases from the 3′ terminus of the viral pl9 and p22 genes; and approximately 130 bases from the 3′terminal noncoding region. Conservation of the sequence motif present in all of the DIs suggests that there might be a common mechanism of DI formation as well as selection pressure to maintain sequences essential for

Evolutionary relatedness of the predicted gene product of RNA segment 2 of the Tick-Borne Dhori virus and the PB1 polymerase gene of influenza viruses,"Abstract The complete nucleotide sequence of the second largest RNA segment of Dhori/India/1313/61 virus was determined and the deduced amino acid sequence was compared with the polymerase (P) proteins of influenza A, B, and C viruses. RNA segment 2 (2224 nucleotides) of Dhori virus contains a single long open reading frame that can encode a 716-amino amid polypeptide (81.3 kDa). The predicted polypeptide shares between 27 and 31% sequence identities with the PB1 polypeptides of influenza A, B, and C viruses. Among the regions most highly conserved are the sequences around the Asp-Asp motif common to many RNA polymerases. In spite of the high level of sequence identity between the Dhori RNA segment 2 gene product and the influenza A, B, and C virus PB1 proteins the amino acid composition of the Dhori protein indicates an acidic charge feature at pH 7.0 in contrast to the basic nature of the PB1 proteins of the influenza viruses. We suggest that the Dhori PB1-like protein be designated the Pα protein of this virus.",-0.020472681,-0.037450306,-0.056957904,0.015770465,0.056150835,0.057135638,0.001060731,0.041244037,0.029191438,0.051917855,0.060039073,-0.058041938,-0.059965536,0.000476818,0.052560616,-0.059950758,-0.059886504,-0.057719346,0.050731726,0.04812178,-0.059095062,0.047075573,-0.04254218,0.05980494,0.031769868,-0.026018113,0.05921761,-0.031120244,0.022225477,-0.05842139,0.057755418,0.06004528,-0.03137725,0.02091832,0.003781798,0.006792273,-0.019578548,0.050452456,-0.059591427,0.046276968,0.047648672,-0.038932677,-0.035862237,-0.014900938,0.058828685,-0.056740128,-0.022004819,-0.052828524,0.021612957,-0.04499513,-0.02462729,0.05101233,-0.059488513,-0.051351868,-0.04879388,-0.00242329,-0.05850692,0.026588194,0.010448163,-0.051216874,0.006178754,0.028465934,0.054496948,0.052910578,0.001959143,-0.057059374,0.05960652,-0.05106871,0.059459694,-0.008781384,0.03608215,0.04540912,-0.011753349,0.059493586,0.049095713,-0.005141252,0.058304604,0.040945597,-0.056991573,-0.003655967,-0.04471119,0.05989649,-0.02652694,-0.053381845,0.005706251,0.058460083,0.000598575,0.006099705,-0.05816446,0.051615436,-0.045812167,-0.000511241,-0.052042775,0.05949271,0.017126663,0.05513208,0.049291737,0.05953701,0.059957225,0.04137054,-0.040548023,0.057046607,0.011214514,-0.018395817,-0.047099225,0.054759845,0.053243287,-0.027708987,-0.055041138,-0.01329566,-0.046425804,0.050107595,0.042186175,0.057226185,0.05854643,0.015764236,-0.059529852,0.03375762,-0.05784958,-0.0487816,-0.04340062,0.059786025,0.056665435,-0.03461855,0.031112706,0.047537442,0.050799053,0.026620578,-0.014431507,0.025112921,-0.028865034,0.060046237,0.05409757,0.04694378,0.03226142,-0.05648217,-0.042887405,0.056018233,-0.05759661,0.05073993,-0.03800731,0.059873287,-0.05096358,-0.040736634,-0.050124966,-0.059354138,0.024464622,-0.027786527,0.012227473,0.056970134,-0.04669247,-0.038448766,-0.037988506,0.004857757,0.06004632,0.013368747,0.029025286,0.035726164,0.023550134,0.04135772,0.026989091,-0.058646012,-0.03519962,0.058473706,0.054296408,0.027820222,-0.0589521,-0.007926279,0.014067284,-0.058716487,0.00227929,0.03627518,-0.05154046,0.050432514,0.051833645,-0.019377789,0.044053435,0.025942545,0.055787586,-0.049233157,0.019169524,0.047591377,0.002088393,0.05969504,0.05662033,-0.056985825,-0.059845943,0.05968697,0.04521164,-0.055071376,0.057741825,-0.05902365,0.035502113,-0.005407154,0.059943087,0.029154552,0.05349648,0.010226786,0.031925965,0.026568094,-0.049579524,0.05674169,-0.041195117,-0.02819618,0.02187292,-0.047817353,-0.022618115,0.05539545,-0.011967152,0.059991114,0.005720239,0.058893327,0.010297798,-0.014026827,-0.05335425,0.030580675,0.032724954,0.015260804,-0.048650123,0.043820288,-0.012923191,-0.043805033,0.05437757,0.028660873,-0.049684435,-0.03258637,-0.050643116,-0.05616166,0.059587263,-0.030422797,-0.049519975,0.053171605,0.050044533,-0.060041904,0.04632109,0.04134871,0.059841055,-0.060000896,-0.01973368,0.03903773,0.056000523,0.048999257,-0.03509338,-0.00275641,0.05970182,-0.029025253,-0.016924845,0.056559104,0.043791406,-0.040406466,-0.060010012,0.051748894,-0.00382564,-0.016957184,0.054398008,-0.026951756,-0.04408149,0.060045905,0.03817698,-0.018119268,0.04959926,0.057084765,-0.03639802,0.05861383,0.035709877,0.022410477,-0.031348776,0.009949172,-0.030978594,0.03735864,0.007113072,0.059791513,-0.003478293,0.046315044,0.048393194,-0.059868418,0.045301095,0.059693083,0.059973452,-0.038808923,-0.025600966,-0.046514954,-0.050909657,0.020610439,-0.002614259,-0.030526102,-0.058660295,0.025226528,-0.05935559,-0.02021309,0.05964681,-0.055661924,0.059756555,-0.020442193,-0.057990685,-0.032073494,-0.049593925,0.041620962,-0.06001782,-0.007331815,-0.029555514,0.059998214,0.037543193,0.05990025,-0.05940335,0.04173578,-0.010818791,-0.047569335,0.055383638,-0.03635208,0.059932917,-0.030357372,0.011363057,0.008162167,0.055713113,-0.00201622,0.047686595,-0.032695282,0.033712316,0.053012982,-0.012164762,0.021393903,0.05708462,-0.050490316,-0.0021535,0.055638384,-0.059199058,-0.024022523,-0.057716694,-0.04267297,0.040711988,0.018116998,0.030362297,0.055916212,0.05442684,-0.019957138,0.0592189,0.02565592,0.012907272,-0.021897914,0.004156502,-0.057205603,0.059978142,0.010548443,-0.060046144,-0.060043667,0.009356974,0.05527112,0.012555105,-0.056006193,-0.012424977,0.028599191,-0.055824302,0.022464229,0.05214223,-0.04942527,-0.06004074,-0.057529256,-0.019994702,-0.03622484,0.053269066,-0.05485741,-0.059879992,0.04130669,0.05474827,0.054711044,0.060034323,0.046502694,0.05264698,0.054154553,0.019434633,-0.007841333,-0.05225788,-0.060046088,0.051380176,0.012954495,0.053408705,0.05166323,-0.010448194,-0.057645407,-0.05955149,0.031246044,0.028875403,-0.056770135,-0.04369195,-0.04681267,-0.055003233,-0.06001994,-0.018862734,0.058979906,0.039006375,0.020834675,0.050936513,-0.05631808,-0.046360247,0.046829537,-0.044762727,-0.05077567,0.036120173,-0.050398745,-0.03241853,0.04989267,0.046398137,0.055626392,-0.008499619,-0.03537127,-0.05808735,0.024340607,0.039916374,0.05104517,0.05

Random nature of coronavirus RNA recombination in the absence of selection pressure,"Abstract RNA-RNA recombination is thought to occur preferentially at certain selected sites and in only a few RNA viruses; the mechanism for these restrictions is unknown. In this paper we report the development of a recombination assay for coronavirus, using polymerase chain reaction, in the absence of selection pressure. Our results showed that within a 1-kb region of the peplomer gene, RNA recombination occurred at almost every potential crossover site. Thus, coronavirus RNA recombination appears to be more random than previously realized. However, after serial passages of the recombinant viruses in tissue culture, the recombination sites among the progeny viruses became clustered in the region which contains the previously reported “hot spot” for coronavirus recombination. These results suggest that RNA recombination is common and random in nature, but only certain recombinants can be selected. Thus, the presence of recombinational “hot spots” for coronavirus or other RNA viruses most likely resulted from selection of certain recombinant viruses and not restriction on the occurrence of RNA recombination. The failure to detect recombinants in other RNA viruses may therefore be due to unfavorable properties of recombinant viruses. This approach can be used to detect recombinants in these viruses.",0.006487329,0.007852683,0.000121377,-0.049773082,0.043104533,0.058360573,-0.024946267,0.009214615,-0.001491139,0.027455252,0.0601431,-0.040163536,-0.044950176,0.051005434,0.056195818,-0.060064666,-0.059774473,-0.05224812,0.059487227,0.028452465,-0.04551696,-0.000634906,-0.05405405,0.05983782,0.04405968,0.05205054,0.059447467,0.015276262,0.004180972,-0.053037334,0.055821937,0.060129866,-0.011007569,-0.005543507,0.00644695,0.050896317,-0.050743308,0.046997234,-0.059761222,0.056714535,0.038553096,-0.019381821,0.02643771,-0.056007847,0.04987304,-0.05454383,0.00955464,-0.05782178,0.049316984,-0.041264795,0.004621325,0.001861968,-0.05595913,-0.027294997,-0.048865713,-0.007083013,-0.056424584,0.01769162,0.04954616,0.005442087,-0.049868047,-0.010514395,0.0352731,-0.050095536,0.008229826,-0.06009152,0.051241916,-0.05578762,0.049895067,-0.005154186,0.052086633,0.05095304,0.04276479,0.059873063,-0.04258178,0.02604671,0.059659276,0.027632518,-0.06002881,0.056541704,-0.054555785,0.06011808,-0.028075844,-0.023344994,-0.05960487,0.05951053,0.05792151,0.052171566,-0.058729343,-0.047477994,-0.01013149,0.002076915,-0.0599315,0.039912056,-0.003818346,0.053195935,0.057748638,0.059432536,0.06014286,-0.039401084,0.003182818,0.054826163,-0.049363762,0.029151108,-0.03751869,0.057189256,0.044103827,-0.053278357,-0.050981544,-0.054013617,-0.014093495,0.037759904,0.022664052,0.050293688,0.060023826,0.013034497,-0.052926943,-0.003508552,0.022144504,0.025068501,-0.05931348,0.060105566,0.042314906,0.026101006,0.029002218,0.038145546,0.045060545,-0.011045096,-0.050636567,0.058774922,-0.001610219,0.060146198,0.050629787,0.012215515,-0.0482443,-0.05770161,-0.03344618,0.059171826,-0.0445488,0.016376538,0.046115123,0.06008717,-0.058776572,-0.03370231,-0.013576125,-0.05902067,0.025899878,-0.059630506,0.00851386,0.05283632,0.052818354,-0.053070765,-0.020822894,-0.057192795,0.060146414,-0.0104227,0.036737014,0.03924367,-0.030802613,0.037873484,-0.011174165,-0.05834322,-0.053286288,-0.014249685,-0.001680561,0.0344956,-0.027873624,0.044352606,-0.05452773,-0.05614168,-0.024245549,-0.058761157,-0.0464909,0.052443266,0.05400285,-0.014350028,0.007358513,-0.04296729,0.05873428,-0.031844307,0.03915292,-0.00616871,-0.052169163,0.042010732,0.04049759,-0.059227344,-0.059591807,0.055342328,0.058911715,-0.04879871,0.059356034,-0.057456598,0.05080226,0.048331566,0.059955377,0.056500565,0.048309084,0.048208393,0.024969798,-0.007847729,-0.04783561,0.059978455,-0.047176935,-0.053367693,0.05722842,-0.03517772,-0.029623888,0.059137896,0.04960221,0.060105447,0.019912815,0.050932407,0.059829105,0.03371852,-0.040492184,-0.008202495,0.059303373,0.003420474,-0.05688463,-0.02718388,0.029080855,-0.05965061,0.030647317,0.059816815,-0.026326803,0.040637814,-0.05956807,-0.05948866,0.047391225,-0.004430364,-0.032874804,0.048089102,0.04805245,-0.06014393,0.048811477,0.05621201,0.055212706,-0.059014883,0.017577445,-0.049214907,0.010718772,-0.025700284,-0.035945427,0.025782265,0.05746678,-0.051836126,-0.05184317,0.039953243,0.005318643,-0.033300873,-0.06011944,0.02413105,-0.042172115,-0.04110445,0.059396908,0.019531103,-0.056679428,0.060146425,-0.048516218,-0.051865462,0.033476293,0.047045328,0.043420095,0.05641848,0.003168143,0.005601249,-0.052325014,-0.026532225,0.044286065,-0.016670683,0.010647943,0.055186667,-0.040216923,0.040066082,0.029909678,-0.05808679,0.032555982,0.05344445,0.060075797,-0.046434253,-0.05049113,-0.048429754,-0.05173512,0.057177585,-0.05242471,-0.002253799,-0.05961027,0.045490567,-0.056715347,0.00366155,0.06012028,-0.054968018,0.060023483,0.03068438,-0.051054902,-0.051724475,-0.032392614,-0.03103249,-0.060071815,0.007359977,-0.03764466,0.059992425,0.002117351,0.059222966,-0.05767243,0.056911144,-0.04408725,-0.006519936,0.032413427,-0.05292459,0.059249844,0.008271219,0.008449823,-0.06009305,0.057980932,-0.020974288,0.026819548,-0.025612883,0.059070043,0.034274276,-0.035925515,0.038084865,0.033743445,-0.028397353,0.006069133,0.056282572,-0.049233843,-0.05336511,0.04494644,-0.025290566,0.03611103,0.029678822,0.051097747,0.05836668,0.013639895,0.035015754,0.05615627,0.05009512,0.005161791,0.02455696,0.025755515,-0.03723293,0.056184825,0.011668994,-0.060145926,-0.059546564,-0.018948583,0.059611745,0.049406335,-0.055050842,-0.028594138,0.010772307,-0.02383513,0.023794532,0.029999407,0.021505719,-0.060143553,-0.05948006,-0.055009566,-0.04185668,0.002107286,-0.060034823,-0.0586682,0.059567638,-0.024883345,-0.007119543,0.06013464,0.059729405,0.053738166,-0.047259927,0.022340061,-0.050490305,-0.05509661,-0.060121693,0.055368576,-0.042116623,0.058161177,-0.000166892,-0.016657706,-0.05724044,-0.05908363,0.04125685,0.050427046,0.00092893,0.054868847,-0.047712408,0.04825666,-0.06004976,-0.02716968,0.04765882,0.054273322,-0.054176796,0.056447573,-0.04969827,-0.057168346,0.053948723,0.000373288,-0.05649761,-0.01820845,-0.053993847,0.04045499,0.05615145,0.016763996,-0.023130747,0.014860456,-0.048486017,-0.056768823,-0.006795708,-0.04087353,0.054370876,0.056498

Sequence analysis of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus genome segment B and its encoded VP1 protein: A putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase lacking the Gly-Asp-Asp motif,"Abstract The genome segment B sequence of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus was determined for both the Jasper and Sp serotypes. The sequences are 2784 and 2630 by long, respectively, and contain a single large open reading frame encoding the VP1 protein, the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of IPNV. The proteins exhibit an 88% homology with each other, but only 41% with infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) VP1, another member of the Birnaviridae. Despite the low overall homology between the IPNV and IBDV VP1 proteins, homologous regions were detected within the central portion of the proteins. The carboxy-proximal regions of the VP1, which contain very low amino acid homology, displayed evidence of conservation in structural features such as a hydrophilic, highly basic domain.

Cloning and sequencing of the matrix protein (M) gene of turkey rhinotracheitis virus reveal a gene order different from that of respiratory syncytial virus,"Abstract Several biochemical properties and the sequence of the fusion glycoprotein (F) have indicated that turkey rhinotracheitis virus (TRTV) is a pneumovirus, subfamily Pneumovirinae of the Paramyxoviridae family. As TRTV was known to generate polycistronic mRNAs, cDNA was generated from TRTV strain U K/3 BV/85-infected Vero cell mRNAs using an oligonucleotide primer corresponding to a region of the F gene. Sequencing of four cDNAs revealed that the gene adjacent to the beginning (3′ end) of the F gene was that for the matrix (M) protein, i.e., that TRTV had the partial gene order 3′-M-F-5′. This was unexpected as human respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, the type species of the genus Pneumovirus, has the partial gene order 3′-M-SH-G-F-5′, where SH and G are the small hydrophobic protein and attachment glycoprotein, respectively. Instead TRTV resembled the Morbillivirus and Paramyxovirus genera of the Paramyxoviridae (subfamily Paramyxoviridae) which have the partial gene order 3′-M-F-5′. Two further oligonucleotides, one corresponding to a sequence near the end of the M gene and the other (oligo B) to a sequence near the beginning of the F gene, with their 5′ ends spaced 300 nucleotides apart on the basis of the cDNA sequence, were used in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using genomic RNA as template. Only a PCR product of 0.3 kb was obtained. The same sized product was also obtained using these oligonucleotides and genomic RNA from three other TRTV strains (SA/91 /78, UK/8544/85, and SA/2381/88) which had been grown in chicken tracheal organ cultures. In addition PCR was performed using genomic RNA from TRTV-3BV and SA/2381/88 with oligo B and another oligonucleotide near the 5′ end of the gene upstream from M, spaced 1141 nucleotides apart on the basis of the sequence data. Only a 1.14-kb PCR product was obtained. Larger products would have been expected if another gene had been situated between M and F. The absence of such larger products, plus the demonstration that infected cells contained M-F dicistronic mRNAs, supported the conclusion that in the TRTV genome the M gene is adjacent to the F gene in the order 3'-M-F-5′. The 5′ termini of the M and F mRNAs were confirmed by mRNA mapping. The TRTV M gene encoded a protein of 254 amino acids, very similar to that of RS virus (256 residues; 37% amino acid identity) but very different from that of the morbilliviruses and paramyxoviruses (approximately 350 residues). Thus, on the basis of the sequences of both the M and the F genes, TRTV is more closely related to the pneumoviruses than to the paramyxoviruses and morbilliviruses.",-0.035625346,-0.007881071,-0.038216498,-0.008086083,0.03390955,0.056889065,0.037140325,0.02287308,0.037664108,0.05584273,0.057761602,-0.028474912,-0.030852027,0.049424063,0.057303157,-0.057810683,-0.057269294,-0.04289015,0.05433766,0.03224842,-0.05542444,-0.034234677,-0.042787366,0.05705725,0.03010825,0.030536538,0.05790614,0.039204538,0.025387296,0.048966408,0.057908073,0.05775329,-0.007629333,-0.04131843,0.05775621,0.043212794,-0.050507344,0.05090352,-0.057642303,0.019931857,0.05277664,-0.04264513,0.04912383,-0.03766851,0.046815984,0.023086825,-0.055984195,-0.050727624,0.04450879,-0.049497273,0.013586345,0.052280426,-0.057658385,-0.057745695,-0.04651397,0.04216586,-0.057911545,0.026732203,0.032812566,0.02876012,0.051518172,0.04302597,0.045579936,0.033714797,-0.053573493,-0.05774241,0.05593861,-0.049518533,0.057310548,0.04622596,0.017623482,0.054958273,0.056707423,0.057712015,-0.011702144,0.03578794,0.057724066,-0.01088994,-0.053260524,-0.02288175,-0.054367904,0.057848208,-0.02195734,-0.05137788,-0.03780083,0.05789129,0.017710231,0.002898267,-0.051529262,-0.004029546,-0.054847904,-0.018746415,-0.05681778,0.05672437,0.040501345,0.045398206,0.044849936,0.057241444,0.057935733,0.046977866,-0.051592294,0.05647305,0.016233945,0.044381056,0.04692218,-0.034840394,0.0457495,-0.010762353,-0.030141886,0.03025491,-0.03518575,0.049190897,0.011210383,0.05736822,0.05157094,-0.020824578,-0.057879217,0.02806312,-0.03720938,0.055669412,-0.05366248,0.057912003,0.056756176,-0.054226182,0.023935618,0.026459513,0.028748382,-0.02737127,-0.048813786,0.05695586,0.042746346,0.057937,0.057201687,0.04437768,-0.012831377,-0.040806234,-0.055384383,0.057897154,-0.052909527,-0.010696738,-0.010910873,0.057937007,-0.05740237,-0.02211038,-0.05276993,-0.057762653,0.04638108,-0.05260086,0.0575117,0.049023144,-0.05156827,-0.047714204,-0.05133957,-0.011335714,0.05793701,0.057338793,-0.002130115,0.048595414,0.0557428,0.04491984,-0.04310119,-0.023778057,-0.052298,0.057422347,-0.009795558,0.05434707,-0.05767589,0.007556653,-0.04797849,-0.053994335,-0.024181198,0.0550241,-0.040543187,0.056788366,-0.014950542,-0.021867853,0.018256564,0.055945367,0.055245962,-0.05174037,0.041575804,-0.05401653,-0.04822863,0.033013213,0.022303434,-0.055735625,-0.054503687,0.057751708,0.04504708,-0.047898993,0.05790704,-0.032212514,0.035017554,0.005808758,0.05793116,0.03201183,0.032790575,-0.016399343,0.054501824,0.001390254,-0.05010886,-0.002290146,-0.03417147,-0.017904187,-0.01271777,-0.004733239,0.006134139,0.057712972,0.03456804,0.05726746,0.015293528,0.05399925,0.051259242,0.022277476,-0.057309262,0.046810504,0.051522303,0.048729073,-0.025527162,0.052334666,0.03300346,-0.057653584,0.015608074,0.02947724,0.0434428,-0.05737476,-0.057311147,-0.054844294,-0.039264303,-0.042951647,-0.009520598,0.05625862,0.014755474,-0.057937007,0.057859235,0.034596607,0.057718158,-0.05525308,-0.048659656,0.04774141,0.05358624,0.0536293,-0.057170097,-0.026283052,0.05790137,-0.027213925,-0.052432656,0.031332396,0.006763381,-0.021556599,-0.057482067,0.05512691,-0.03614182,0.017141553,0.052865084,-0.021338824,0.028529285,0.05793701,0.056907315,0.020275863,0.055446375,0.016450109,-0.005676173,0.057713185,0.033139218,0.036422223,0.046542913,0.015372119,-0.027309218,0.020820668,0.035986304,0.057935547,0.05258105,0.053168412,0.05267597,-0.057432417,-0.021078773,0.05632146,0.057907145,-0.04729268,0.02198146,-0.01654177,-0.057697646,0.014844841,0.04025256,-0.04146515,-0.044222254,0.05639873,-0.05540054,-0.047475915,0.057936016,-0.0567214,0.05790676,-0.056986645,-0.057478208,-0.055222545,-0.05707941,0.049299464,-0.057936214,0.04658141,-0.037201017,0.05727505,0.054225456,0.03877847,-0.057318944,0.04584064,-0.024340633,-0.0513312,0.056920864,0.031766072,0.05416001,-0.031084614,0.039323334,-0.057882216,0.00644452,-0.022996241,-0.044520043,-0.051727377,0.050964214,0.05350268,-0.054024167,0.05749482,-0.011035191,-0.034300443,-0.051562138,-0.053628143,-0.05630909,-0.05744542,-0.057551317,-0.017260965,0.050316755,-0.051893488,0.051329996,0.057592582,0.011290992,0.046539977,0.049096175,-0.022704713,0.037376404,-0.057252996,0.018145388,0.005116378,0.057881907,-0.022180086,-0.057937007,-0.05790629,-0.00541608,0.031268783,0.054599546,-0.05102374,-0.04359532,0.04064951,-0.053077314,0.03059886,-0.014232914,-0.010902882,-0.057936966,-0.046179794,-0.03240302,-0.05606923,0.05446058,-0.037238706,-0.05493517,0.053162973,0.057040684,0.04720039,0.05793657,0.01685285,0.055259362,-0.044090245,0.033885248,-0.055038728,0.002262276,-0.057936706,0.057048634,0.05599511,-0.014656285,0.053918123,-0.014676886,-0.057919614,-0.05757088,-0.052234665,0.048465244,-0.056864295,-0.035015438,-0.0491653,-0.057798292,-0.055374462,0.010918884,0.03733757,0.015713645,0.037101455,0.021134019,-0.021779848,-0.03420683,0.0557254,-0.032149773,-0.057375204,0.043279108,-0.05790569,0.027968809,0.042773746,0.03638621,-0.011508731,0.020950882,0.005547226,-0.006663638,-0.054049402,0.051666502,0.03594045,-0.001275414,0.042065654,-

The 9-kDa hydrophobic protein encoded at the 3′ end of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus genome is membrane-associated,"Abstract The open reading frame potentially encoding a 78 amino acid, 9101 Da hydrophobic protein (HP) and, mapping at the 3′ end of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) genome, was shown to be expressed during virus replication. The cloned HP gene was placed in a plasmid under control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and in vitro translation of transcripts generated in vitro yielded a 9.1-kDa protein that was immunoprecipitable with porcine hyperimmune anti-TGEV serum. Antiserum raised in rabbits against a 31 amino acid synthetic polypeptide that represented the central hydrophilic region of HP specifically immunoprecipitated HP from TGEV-infected cells. HP was further shown to become associated with microsomal membranes during synthesis in vitro and was found to be closely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and cell surface membranes in infected cells. The intracellular location of HP suggests that it may play a role in the membrane association of replication complexes or in virion

Human coronavirus gene expression in the brains of multiple sclerosis patients,"Abstract Total RNA extracted from both white and gray matter of brain tissue from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and controls was analyzed using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for the presence of the nucleic acid of human coronavirus (HCV) 229E and OC43, the two strains characterized to date and associated with respiratory infections. HCV-229E viral RNA was detectable in the central nervous system tissue of 4 of 11 MS patients and in none of 6 neurological and 5 normal controls. No HCV-OC43 nucleic acid was detected in any of the specimens. These results suggest a neurotropism on the part of the 229E strain of human coronavirus and underline the importance of further studies on its tissue distribution. The fact that it was detected only in tissue from MS patients illustrates the need for continued studies on the possible role of coronaviruses in the etiology of

Evidence for variable rates of recombination in the MHV genome,"Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus has been shown to undergo RNA recombination at high frequency during mixed infection. Temperature-sensitive mutants were isolated using 5-fluorouracil and 5-azacytidine as mutagen. Six RNA+ mutants that reside within a single complementation group mapping within the S glycoprotein gene of MHV-A59 were isolated which did not cause syncytium at the restrictive temperature. Using standard genetic techniques, a recombination map was established that indicated that these mutants mapped into two distinct domains designated F1 and F2. These genetic domains may correspond to mutations mapping within the S1 and S2 glycoproteins, respectively, and suggest that both the S1 and S2 domains are important in eliciting the fusogenic activity of the S glycoprotein gene. In addition, assuming that most distal is alleles map roughly 4.0 kb apart, a recombination frequency of 1 % per 575–676 by was predicted through the S glycoprotein gene. Interestingly, this represents a threefold increase in the recombination frequency as compared to rates predicted through the polymerase region. The increase in the recombination rate was probably not due to recombination events resulting in large deletions or insertions (>50 bp), but rather was probably due to a combination of homologous and nonhomologous recombination. A variety of explanations could account for the increased rates of recombination in the S

Coronavirus mRNA synthesis: Identification of novel transcription initiation signals which are differentially regulated by different leader sequences,"Abstract The mRNA synthesis of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) has been proposed to be the result of interaction between the leader RNA and the intergenic sites. Previously, we have identified a transcription initiation site (for mRNA 2-1), which is more efficiently transcribed by viruses containing two copies of UCUAA sequence in the leader RNA than by those with three copies. In this study, we have identified several sites which are regulated in the opposite way, namely, they are efficiently transcribed by the leader RNA with three UCUAA copies but not by those with two copies. These sites were characterized by primer extension and amplification by polymerase chain reaction. One of these sites is in the gene 3 region of a recombinant virus between A59 and JHM strains of MHV. Another is in the gene 2 region of MHV-1 strain. Both of these sites have a sequence similar to but different from the consensus transcription initiation signal (UCUAAUCUAUC and UUUAAUCUU, as opposed to UCUAAAC). These two novel intergenic sequences are not present in the genome of the JHM strain, consistent with the absence of these mRNAs in the JHM-infected cells. The discovery of this type of transcription initiation site provides additional evidence for the importance of the leader RNA in the transcription initiation of MHV

Prevalence of group A and group B rotaviruses in the feces of neonatal dairy calves from California,"Abstract 136 fecal samples, collected from 47 dairy calves on a calf ranch and in a dairy herd in California, were tested for the presence of group A and group B rotaviruses by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Samples were collected from each calf at days 1, 7 and 14. Within the 14 day period, 44 calves (94%) were positive for group A rotavirus and an unexpectedly high number of calves (38 calves, 81%) were positive for group B rotavirus. When these samples were examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), rotavirus was found in 21 calves and all of them had group A electropherotype. Among 25 PAGE positive samples from 21 calves, 17 (68%) were of short electropherotype, 4 (28%) were of long electropherotype and 4 (28%) contained both short and long electropherotype rotaviruses. Group B and short and long electropherotype group A rotaviruses were found in both normal and diarrheic

"Cloning, expression and characterization of biologically active feline tumour necrosis factor-α","Abstract We report the cloning, expression and characterization of biologically active feline tumour necrosis factor-α (fTNF-α). Messenger RNA was extracted from feline peritoneal macrophage cultures and used to synthesize cDNA for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The PCR products were cloned into the plasmid vector pCRII and sequenced, showing 99.3% homology with a published fTNF-α gene sequence. Subcloning into the vector pGEX-2T and subsequent expression resulted in a 43 kDa fusion protein of fTNF-α and glutathione S-transferase (GST). Thrombin cleavage of the fusion protein yielded a 17 kDa protein. This protein cross-reacted with a monoclonal anti-human TNF-α antibody in Western blotting, but not with a polyclonal anti-murine TNF-α serum. Recombinant fTNF-α (rfTNF-α) and rfTNF-α-GST had a CD50 of 15 ng ml−1 and 230 ng ml−1, respectively, in the L929 cytotoxicity assay.

Polymerase chain reaction for probe synthesis and for direct amplification in detection of bovine coronavirus,"Abstract The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to synthesize ds and ss probes for the detection of bovine coronavirus (BCV) using recombinant plasmids as template molecules. The ds probes detected a minimum of about 2 × 105 viral genomes after exposure for 1 h, a detection limit similar to nick-translated probes after exposure of the films for 60 h. More than 8 h exposure to blots probed with these ds probes resulted in complete darkening of the film. The ss probes, synthesized by asymmetric PCR on linearized plasmids, permitted the detection of 5 × 104 genomes, which equalled the capacity of random-primed probes. Prolonged exposure did not increase the background as in case of ds PCR-probed blots. Probes, synthesized by asymmetric PCR and random-priming were labeled to similar specific activities and were better in terms of sensitivity and detectability as opposed to nick-translated probes. However, the specificity of detection with ss probes as to random primed probes was increased further. About 10 viral genomes, after fragment-specific amplification by PCR, were detected by agarose-gel analysis. PCR-probe synthesis was simple, highly reproducible, and allowed the synthesis of probes for specific

An appraisal of different methods for the detection of the walnut strain of cherry leafroll virus,"Abstract Three methods were evaluated for the detection of cherry leafroll virus: ELISA, dot-blot and reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Dot-blot and RT-PCR were carried out in crude plant extracts without any further RNA purification. Dot-blot hybridization using a 32P-labelled DNA probe was as sensitive as previously reported ELISA results for cherry leafroll virus detection. The most sensitive method was RT-PCR, which amplified a specific fragment of 448 bp from the 3' untranslated region of both viral genomic RNAs. RT-PCR was used to detect cherry leafroll virus in infected walnut buds and

Genic amplification of the entire coding region of the HEF RNA segment of influenza C virus,"Abstract In order to provide an easy and powerful analysis of influenza C viral HEF RNA segment of a recent strain, a combination of reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction was used. We amplified the entire coding region of the HEF gene of a laboratory strain of virus called C/Johannesburg/1/66, widely used for binding and esterase activity studies as well as that of a strain isolated in 1991 (C/Paris/145/91) from a patient suffering from severe flu syndrome. The sequences we amplified were about 2 kilobases long. In this work, we show that the forward ‘universal primer’ Unil, which has been used for influenza A and B viruses cDNA syntheses can also be used for influenza C virus. The PCR primers were designed to contain restriction sites to make the PCR products ready to be used for further purposes.

Sequence of the S gene from a virulent British field isolate of transmissible gastroenteritis virus,"Abstract Subgenomic mRNA from a virulent field isolate of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), strain FS772/70, was used to produce cDNA. The cDNA from three overlapping clones was sequenced by the chain termination method and two open reading frames (ORFs) were identified. The largest ORF, 4350bp, encoded a polypeptide of 1449 amino acids of relative molecular mass (Mr) 159811, which contained 33 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, a cysteine-rich region, and a potential transmembrane region. The C-terminal half of this ORF showed homology to the S proteins of four other coronaviruses. The other ORF consisted of the 3'-end of a gene with homology to the carboxyl terminus of the F2 subunit of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) RNA

The cloning and sequencing of the virion protein genes from a British isolate of porcine respiratory coronavirus: comparison with transmissible gastroenteritis virus genes,"Abstract Previous analysis of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) mRNA species showed that mRNAs 2 and 3 were smaller than the corresponding transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) mRNA species (Page et al. (1991) J. Gen. Virol. 72, 579–587). Sequence analysis showed that mRNA 3 was smaller due to the presence of a new putative RNA-leader binding site upstream of the PRCV ORF-3 gene. However, this observation did not explain the deletion observed in PRCV mRNA 2. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to generate cDNA from the 3' coding region of the putative polymerase gene to the poly (A) tail of PRCV for comparison to the equivalent region from TGEV. The PRCV S protein was found to consist of 1225 amino acids, which had 98% similarity to the TGEV S protein. However, the PRCV S gene contained a 672 nucleotide deletion, corresponding to 224 amino acids (residues 21 to 245 in TGEV S protein), 59 nucleotides downstream of the S gene initiation codon. The PRCV genome from the ORF-3 gene to the poly (A) tail was sequenced for comparison to TGEV in order to identify other potential differences between the two viruses.

Sequence analysis of human coronavirus 229E mRNAs 4 and 5: evidence for polymorphism and homology with myelin basic protein,"Abstract Human coronaviruses (HCV) are important pathogens responsible for respiratory, gastrointestinal and possibly neurological disorders. To better understand the molecular biology of the prototype HCV-229E strain, the nucleotide sequence of the 5'-unique regions of mRNAs 4 and 5 were determined from cloned cDNAs. Sequence analysis of the cDNAs synthesized from mRNA 4 revealed a major difference with previously published results. However, polymerase chain reaction amplification of this region showed that the sequenced cDNAs were produced from minor RNA species, an indication of possible genetic polymorphism in this region of the viral genome. The mutated messenger RNA 4 contains two ORFs: (1) ORF4a consisting of 132 nucleotides which potentially encodes a 44-amino acid polypeptide of 4653 Da; this coding sequence is preceded by a consensus transcriptional initiation sequence, CUAAACU, similar to the ones found upstream of the N and M genes; (2) ORF4b of 249 nucleotides potentially encoding an 83-amino acid basic and leucine-rich polypeptide of 9550 Da. On the other hand, mRNA 5 contains one single ORF of 231 nucleotides which could encode a 77-amino acid basic and leucine-rich polypeptide of 9046 Da. This putative protein presents a significant degree of amino acid homology (33%) with its counterpart found in transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). The proteins in the two different viruses exhibit similar molecular weights and are extremely hydrophobic. Interestingly, a sequence homology of five amino acids was found between the protein encoded by ORF4b of HCV-229E and an immunologically important region of human myelin basic

The membrane glycoprotein G1 of Uukuniemi virus contains a signal for localization to the Golgi complex,"Abstract Members of the Bunyaviridae family acquire their envelopes by budding into the Golgi complex (GC). The accumulation of the membrane glycoproteins G1 and G2 in the GC probably determines the site of maturation. Here we have studied the intracellular transport and targeting to the GC of G1 and G2 of Uukuniemi virus, a member of the Phlebovirus genus, and report on their expression from cloned cDNAs either together or separately by using a T7 RNA polymerase-driven vaccinia virus expression system. When G1 and G2 were expressed together from a full-length cDNA as the p110 precursor, both proteins were localized to the Golgi complex, as evidenced by colocalization with the Golgi marker enzyme mannosidase II. Immunofluorescent staining indicated that G1 expressed alone also localized to the GC. However, pulse-chase experiments showed that G1 remained endoglycosidase H sensitive. G2 expressed alone remained associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). G2 could be rescued from the ER and transported to the GC by coexpression with G1 from separate mRNAs. Coexpression also increased the efficiency of G1 transport to the GC. With none of the constructs could the glycoproteins be observed on the cell surface. These results show that efficient export of G1 and G2 from the ER requires coexpression of both proteins, in conformity with our previous results showing that G1 and G2 from heterodimeric complexes in the ER. Since G1 expressed alone is retained in the GC, we conclude that G1 contains a retention signal for localization to the GC. G2 might thus become associated with the GC indirectly via its interaction with

Cloning and sequencing of a 8.4-kb region from the 3′-end of a Taiwanese virulent isolate of the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus,"Abstract The nucleotide sequence (8396 nucleotides) was determined, from the 3′-end of the putative polymerase gene to the poly(A) tail, for a Taiwanese virulent isolate, TFI, of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). The TFI nucleotide sequence had very high identity to the British virulent field isolate FS772/70 (98.3%), the attenuated Purdue 115 (96.7%) and from the S gene to ORF-4 gene region, to the low passaged virulent Miller (98.3%) strains of TGEV. Comparison of the TFI S protein sequence with those determined from other TGEV strains and those of the TGEV variant, porcine respiratory coronavirus, isolated from Europe and North America showed that they had changed very little over a period of 4 decades.

Enhancement of the vaccinia virus/phage T7 RNA polymerase expression system using encephalomyocarditis virus 5'-untranslated region sequences,"Abstract A recombinant vaccinia virus producing the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase was used to express foreign genes in eukaryotic cells. Translation efficiency in this expression system was enhanced significantly by employing the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 5'-untranslated region (UTR) which confers cap-independent translation by directing internal initiation of translation. The enhancement was accomplished by fusing open reading frames (ORFs) to the N terminus of the EMCV polyprotein coding region, thus utilizing its highly efficient translation initiation site. Expression vectors were constructed to allow cloning in all three reading frames. As reporter genes, we used the lacZ gene and a number of genes encoding coronavirus structural proteins: among others the genes encoding glycoproteins with N-terminal signal sequences. The signal sequences of these glycoproteins are located internally in the primary translation product. We demonstrated that this did not interfere with translocation and glycosylation and yields biologically active proteins. The usefulness of sequences that direct internal initiation was extended by using EMCV UTR s to express two and three ORFs from polycistronic

Mapping of a region of dengue virus type-2 glycoprotein required for binding by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody,"Abstract Envelope glycoprotein E of flaviviruses is exposed at the surface of the virion, and is responsible for eliciting a neutralizing antibody (Ab) response, as well as protective immunity in the host. In this report, we describe a method for the fine mapping of a linear sequence of the E protein of dengue virus type-2 (DEN-2), recognized by a type-specific and neutralizing monoclonal Ab (mAb), 3H5. First, an Escherichia coli expression vector containing a heat-inducible λ p l promoter was used to synthesize several truncated, and near-full length E polypeptides. Reactivities of these polypeptides with polyclonal mouse hyperimmune sera, as well as the 3H5 mAb revealed the location of the 3H5-binding site to be within a region of 166 amino acids (aa) between aa 255 and 422. For fine mapping, a series of targeted deletions were made inframe within this region using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The hydrophilicity pattern of this region was used as a guide to systematically delete the regions encoding the various groups of surface aa residues within the context of a near-full-length E polypeptide by using PCR. The 3H5-binding site was thus precisely mapped to a region encoding 12 aa (between aa 386 and 397). A synthetic peptide containing this sequence was able to bind to the 3H5 mAb specifically, as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, we show that rabbit Abs raised against the synthetic peptide of 12 aa were able to bind to the authentic E protein, and to neutralize DEN-2 virus in a plaque reduction

Molecular biology of transmissible gastroenteritis virus,"Abstract The causative agent (TGEV) of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis belongs to the Coronaviridae, a family of enveloped viruses with a positive, single-stranded RNA genome. Important progress has recently been made concerning the molecular biology of TGEV. The research work of our group has been focused on two main aspects: genome structure and functional domains of the envelope proteins. TGEV genomic RNA is organised into seven regions. The sequence of six of them, i.e. the 3′ most 8300 nucleotides, has been established from cDNA clones. Three genes encoding the structural proteins, the peplomer protein E2, the transmembrane protein E1 and the nucleoprotein, have been identified. Additional open reading frames allowed for the prediction of four non-structural polypeptides, the role of which remains to be discovered. The remaining part of the genome (estimated length 20 kb) is thought to encode the polymerase. Expression of TGEV genes involves the production of six subgenomic mRNAs, which together with the virion RNA, form a 3′ terminal nested set. The peplomer glycoprotein E2 (220 kDa) is 1431 residues long and highly glycosylated. Several domains were identified, including a C-terminal anchoring region and at least four major antigenic sites, which cluster in the amino half part of the molecule. Two sites containing most of the critical neutralisation determinants are highly conserved among TGEV strains. The glycoprotein E1 (29kDa) is mostly embedded in the membrane and plays a crucial role in the virion architecture.

CHAPTER 28 Coronaviridae,"Publisher Summary Coronaviruses are ssRNA viruses that infect a wide range of mammalian and avian species; they are important causes of respiratory and enteric disease, encephalomyelitis, hepatitis, serositis, and vasculitis in domestic animals. In humans, coronaviruses are one of several groups of viruses that cause the common cold. The prototype of the family, avian infectious brochitis virus, is one of the most infectious of all viruses and causes an acute respiratory disease, which in young chicks can cause very high mortality. Outbreaks can be explosive, involving nearly every bird in the flock at about the same time, because of respiratory transmission and a very short incubation period. In many ways, transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine and mouse hepatitis virus behave similarly, affecting young animals most severely, spreading very quickly to all animals at risk, and causing major economic losses before control strategies can be put into place. The strategy of expression of the coronavirus genome is unique. The input virion RNA molecule is translated directly, one of the products being an RNA polymerase that then transcribes a full-length (—) sense copy RNA, from which in turn is transcribed a 3′-coterminal nested set of subgenomic mRNAs. The nested set comprises six overlapping species of mRNAs that extend for different lengths from a common 3′ terminus. Only the unique sequence toward the 5′ end, which is not shared with the next smallest mRNA in the nested set, is translated, each product, therefore, being a unique

Diagnostic Techniques: Serological and Molecular Approaches,"Virus laboratory diagnostics has an increasingly important role in modern patient care. Virological methods are needed to investigate the etiology of acute viral infection or the reactivation of a latent infection, as well as to follow virus load in antiviral treatments. Serological assays are also used for screening of blood products for the risk of certain chronic infections, evaluation of the immune status, and need for prophylatic treatments in connection with organ transplantations. For diagnostic purposes the following approaches can be used: demonstration of presence of infectious virus or its structural components directly from a patient's specimens or investigation of specific antibody response in serum specimes. Virus isolation is used to demonstrate infectious virus in a patient's specimens, whereas nucleic acid amplification techniques, like polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are widely used to detect virus nucleic acids. Virus antigens are investigated by antigen detection assays. Serological diagnosis is based on either the demonstration of the presence of virus-specific IgM antibodies or a significant increase in the levels of specific IgG antibodies. Immunoassays are the most commonly used serological assays. Point-of-care tests (POC tests), both for antigens and antibodies, are also becoming more and more common in diagnostic use. In order to reach the best diagnostic efficiency for each patient it is important to select the most suitable method using the right sample collected at the right

Leader Sequence,"Abstract The region of a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule that precedes the coding sequence of a gene is called the ‘leader sequence’. This region is also known as the ‘five prime untranslated region’ (Figure 1) of the mRNA. Leader sequences have the propensity for forming secondary structures (stem-loops) by base pairing of complementary sequences. They are involved in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In eukaryotes, the leader sequence may vary from few nucleotides to more than 1000 nucleotides. In prokaryotes, the leader sequences are usually short and at times contain an attenuator segment that is translated to a short-leader peptide. The leader peptide functions to terminate transcripts before the RNA polymerase reaches the first structural gene of the operon. The leader sequences in viruses have been shown to play an important role in the regulation of gene expression, replication, and pathogenicity. Mutations in the leader sequences of cellular mRNAs can have implications for disease and

13 General Mechanisms of Antiviral Resistance,"This review explores the broad mechanisms of virus resistance. This will go beyond the generally accepted concept of antiviral resistance by summarizing those evolutionary outcomes that have enabled human viruses to resist mankind’s best efforts at control. The review then focuses on how viruses acquire resistance to compounds that specifically target a virus protein (e.g., polymerase, protease, integrase, sialidase). All viruses have a principle mechanism of acquiring resistance, random point mutations. Those viruses, which have segmented genomes, have an additional mechanism, genetic reassortment. For antiviral compounds that target a key virus enzyme, there is usually a stepwise evolution of resistance. For the therapy of chronic viral infections, such as HIV, the concept of increasing the genetic barrier has been important for optimizing drug combinations for effectively delaying the appearance of resistance. In some cases, the price to the virus for gaining resistance may be reduced “fitness” but there may also be other unexpected effects. Conceptually, one way to avoid virus resistance is to use a compound to target a host protein rather than a viral protein. Such an approach seems to risk causing unacceptable toxicity, however, some instances have been identified where there can be specificity for the virus-infected cell. We end by asking the question, how will viruses respond to such an indirect

Chapter fifteen Enzymatic Assembly of Overlapping DNA Fragments,"Abstract Three methods for assembling multiple, overlapping DNA molecules are described. Each method shares the same basic approach: (i) an exonuclease removes nucleotides from the ends of double-stranded (ds) DNA molecules, exposing complementary single-stranded (ss) DNA overhangs that are specifically annealed; (ii) the ssDNA gaps of the joined molecules are filled in by DNA polymerase, and the nicks are covalently sealed by DNA ligase. The first method employs the 3′-exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase (T4 pol), Taq DNA polymerase (Taq pol), and Taq DNA ligase (Taq lig) in a two-step thermocycled reaction. The second method uses 3′-exonuclease III (ExoIII), antibody-bound Taq pol, and Taq lig in a one-step thermocycled reaction. The third method employs 5′-T5 exonuclease, Phusion® DNA polymerase, and Taq lig in a one-step isothermal reaction and can be used to assemble both ssDNA and dsDNA. These assembly methods can be used to seamlessly construct synthetic and natural genes, genetic pathways, and entire genomes and could be very useful for molecular engineering

Principles of Diagnosis of Infectious Diseases,"Abstract Infectious diseases are diagnosed by detection of a bacterium, virus, fungus, protozoan, or helminth in a patient with a compatible clinical illness. The methods of detection include cultivation of bacteria and fungi on growth medium, isolation of viruses in cell culture, and identification of the agent biochemically, antigenically, or genetically. Infectious diseases can also be identified by detection of a specific immune response, usually antibodies, that develop during the course of illness. Visualization of an agent in infected tissue can provide a diagnosis based on specific morphological characteristics or identify the category of organism, for example, gram-positive or gram-negative bacterium or virus (e.g., eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in neurons in rabies virus infection). Methods that detect and allow visualization of antigens (immunohistochemistry) or nucleic acid sequences (in situ hybridization) provide more specific diagnoses. Detection of specific nucleic acid sequences amplified by polymerase chain reaction is a powerful molecular diagnostic tool. Since the elucidation of the etiology of the first infectious disease, anthrax, more than 135 years ago, Koch's postulates have been applied and modified as novel technologies and agents have emerged. During the last 45 years, more than 70 previously unknown agents of infections have been identified in emerging infectious diseases, a phenomenon that is likely to

Chapter 2 Recent Advances in Hantavirus Molecular Biology and Disease,"Abstract Hantaviruses are emerging zoonotic pathogens that belong to the Bunyaviridae family. They have been classified as category A pathogens by CDC (centers for disease control and prevention). Hantaviruses pose a serious threat to human health because their infection causes two highly fatal diseases, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). These pathogens are transmitted to humans through aerosolized excreta of their infected rodent hosts. Hantaviruses have a tripartite-segmented negative-sense RNA genome. The three genomic RNA segments, S, M, and L, encode a nucleocapsid protein (N), a precursor glycoprotein that is processed into two envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively. N protein is the major structural component of the virus, its main function is to protect and encapsidate the three genomic RNAs forming three viral ribonucleocapsids. Recent studies have proposed that N in conjunction with RdRp plays important roles in the transcription and replication of viral genome. In addition, N preferentially facilitates the translation of viral mRNA in cells. Glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, play major roles in viral attachment and entry to the host cells, virulence, and assembly and packaging of new virions in infected cells. RdRp functions as RNA replicase and transcriptase to replicate and transcribe the viral RNA and is also thought to have endonuclease activity. Currently, no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available for the treatment of hantavirus-associated diseases. Understanding the molecular details of hantavirus life cycle will help in the identification of targets for antiviral therapeutics and in the design of potential antiviral drug for the treatment of HFRS and HCPS. Due to the alarming fatality of hantavirus diseases, development of an effective vaccine against hantaviruses is a

Chapter 12 Synthesis,"Abstract The preceding chapters have described in detail specific examples of viruses that have emerged or re-emerged from animal sources. Most, although not all, are zoonotic and have caused significant human morbidity and mortality. This final chapter will attempt to bring together a number of the common themes raised by these examples. These include the role of historical events in shaping the emergence of viruses in the present, the ability to retrospectively test samples to trace the emergence of disease and the technologies used to detect viruses. Technologies such as the polymerase chain reaction and mass sequencing have revolutionized virus detection and enabled the rapid identification and characterization of viruses. The application of these methods has led to the identification of new groups of viruses in samples obtained from a range of animal species without the need for invasive sampling or the recovery of live virus. However, with the detection of such a large range of viruses that exist asymptomatically with other species, the challenge now becomes the identification of those with the potential to become pathogenic for humans.",0.00178091,0.02168412,-0.026293108,-0.056121152,0.035667375,0.04444235,0.023472868,0.056890503,-0.052753262,-0.012146085,0.064529285,-0.03970277,0.029444398,-0.057895146,-0.001872231,-0.0640585,-0.060188,-0.059358515,0.056295745,-0.05674173,-0.043181278,0.049780212,-0.06289627,0.06425052,0.019764403,0.060260493,0.03531516,-0.042305075,-0.004631781,-0.059334338,0.033694983,0.06389865,-0.020116404,0.021981012,0.0357634,0.044682905,-0.06241216,-0.011899823,-0.063619554,0.014815588,0.00795763,-0.058104947,0.011779404,-0.042932954,-0.06367148,-0.018059662,0.043999344,-0.059291717,0.003246626,-0.041262653,0.05425986,0.05887666,-0.06301541,0.006641685,-0.06242186,-0.04218682,-0.063671336,0.029932518,0.025758944,-0.047241036,-0.035101354,-0.019953184,0.032996826,-0.032330092,0.03903118,-0.06346206,0.062965654,0.011015407,0.026258046,0.00242661,-0.062446583,0.034399606,0.030498296,0.06309705,-0.022173708,-0.014050256,-0.011337,-0.01226818,-0.06414479,0.058142707,-0.044624496,0.060579646,0.029963633,-0.04387874,-0.017988125,0.06354896,0.021161309,0.05286569,-0.055707708,0.029008713,0.002912191,-0.048183538,-0.045542184,0.005087612,0.012509037,0.054261982,0.0607983,0.06438943,0.06452774,-0.030555101,-0.056814317,-0.007254107,-0.063561864,0.002011291,0.04903107,0.026948368,0.029905189,-0.060948703,0.012792324,0.054007947,-0.05757937,0.051490415,0.02030885,-0.002924079,0.06236864,0.00459154,-0.03342338,0.023670077,0.001543855,0.03762252,-0.036920108,0.04545089,0.006602299,0.035819113,-0.05434894,0.020675723,0.008954718,-0.041296266,0.041546848,0.030143222,0.0451149,0.06452898,0.043194093,-0.042009544,0.004327991,-0.06066103,-0.01898002,0.044626217,-0.05586833,-0.062608264,0.025117714,0.06326145,-0.043811478,0.009481154,0.058884963,-0.059886318,0.060857132,-0.055584393,0.055312656,0.006173569,0.02712388,-0.06376793,-0.056646727,-0.056635987,0.063876554,-0.06198184,0.06293071,0.048621487,0.004553214,0.056541093,0.044190556,-0.05651361,0.014656381,0.042695038,0.037645474,0.018023388,-0.038466197,0.005903594,-0.060835756,-0.059417915,-0.030495003,-0.05558546,0.009143921,0.03954503,0.018188495,-0.013456212,-0.05575444,0.009235131,0.05929453,0.017029079,0.0489048,0.04037453,-0.019767128,0.008408356,0.0593093,-0.039707325,-0.06393261,-0.03156163,0.045562733,-0.015057997,0.062440377,0.010257357,0.0569944,0.030370167,0.061683103,0.001597795,0.062357787,0.06041178,-0.028176453,-0.055331066,-0.029278528,0.054718126,0.016129958,-0.034528635,0.05859446,-0.05694426,0.013406043,0.06428131,0.022760745,0.06404675,0.03895953,0.06353643,0.060786273,0.028166216,0.008574017,0.027858838,-0.012714772,0.049468834,-0.036173854,-0.045111325,0.023401128,-0.004847046,-0.013154358,0.015911976,-0.06042224,0.018287718,-0.06323607,-0.063904405,0.056791756,0.03119667,0.05937113,0.063456,0.020040689,-0.06446396,-0.059917916,0.053304337,0.03266718,-0.06348596,0.054503497,-0.04724905,0.05205862,-0.01888997,0.050332375,-0.057165287,0.034593623,-0.057678852,0.039323892,0.023395175,0.063270554,0.012520894,-0.043464974,-0.043624878,0.006514221,-0.035475906,0.06436378,0.03775763,-0.062319536,0.064530045,-0.030644767,-0.06130768,0.017716464,0.047611497,0.06357872,0.049097244,-0.025055509,-0.05558722,-0.04592239,-0.0277929,0.029911702,0.01576274,-0.010117075,0.048724376,-0.05529188,-0.00655091,-0.037104458,-0.05793694,0.007902178,-0.009935977,0.064181164,-0.03663009,-0.06339634,-0.06194037,-0.02692147,0.050504543,-0.046338562,0.027618367,-0.056505807,0.06437418,-0.04430178,0.02497148,0.06278614,-0.02125326,0.06124504,0.009936126,0.033054586,-0.053271297,-0.011799695,0.01438366,-0.06418506,0.05447233,-0.002702039,0.05949196,0.060994107,-0.005575492,-0.06293875,0.046084706,-0.000824636,-0.048290756,0.004047474,-0.05592928,0.020108577,0.023341471,-0.018695457,-0.002445407,0.054405063,-0.04374922,0.0595568,0.05691939,0.06430262,0.052091368,0.017185701,0.054616377,0.0583695,-0.03254727,-0.030626843,0.06443583,-0.024456387,0.03953967,0.016082041,-0.055736497,0.03996836,0.061160468,0.054057468,-0.006856312,0.008747197,0.04954518,-0.000839977,-0.05598645,-0.028281024,-0.03311313,-0.0300341,-0.05991003,0.053235807,-0.013132708,-0.06449402,-0.06301623,0.029066691,0.057658896,-0.051735424,-0.031716526,0.02185383,-0.009759081,0.050593358,0.002612503,0.035926547,0.035485134,-0.06452703,-0.045652118,-0.049871277,-0.053565938,-0.020439524,-0.055144496,-0.061322983,0.05032427,-0.007786323,-0.041116685,0.06440443,0.05673512,0.029969757,0.005667731,0.012708407,0.052653488,-0.037272636,-0.061823342,0.054153334,0.0208626,0.031339493,0.05868863,-0.046942916,0.027497252,-0.022405365,0.0508614,0.007067688,0.057468038,-0.03948096,-0.004934758,0.048595995,-0.06249386,-0.04493447,0.03301367,0.015172136,-0.04897715,0.053681355,0.030084265,-0.048798323,0.024419416,-0.044212643,-0.056727502,0.04895773,-0.062031716,-0.037020452,0.004341603,-0.026787957,0.06299238,0.004321028,-0.016625308,-0.007467761,-0.022061445,0.005576097,6.46E-05,0.032038037,0.032804508,-0.050214022,-0.049774308

"Chapter Four Next-Generation Molecular-Diagnostic Tools for Gastrointestinal Nematodes of Livestock, with an Emphasis on Small Ruminants A Turning Point?","Abstract Parasitic nematodes of livestock have major economic impact worldwide. Despite the diseases caused by these nematodes, some advances towards the development of new therapeutic agents and attempts to develop effective vaccines against some of them, there has been limited progress in the development of practical diagnostic methods. The specific and sensitive diagnosis of parasitic nematode infections of livestock underpins effective disease control, which is now particularly important given the problems associated with anthelmintic resistance in parasite populations. Traditional diagnostic methods have major limitations, in terms of sensitivity and specificity. This chapter provides an account of the significance of parasitic nematodes (order Strongylida), reviews conventional diagnostic techniques that are presently used routinely and describes advances in polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods for the specific diagnosis of nematode infections.

Chapter 34 Antiviral Drugs,"Abstract Viruses are major pathogenic agents causing a variety of serious diseases in humans, other animals, and plants. Drugs that combat viral infections are called antiviral drugs. There are no effective antiviral drugs for many viral infections. However, there are several drugs for influenza, a couple of drugs for herpesviruses, and some new antiviral drugs for treatment of HIV and hepatitis C infections. The arsenal of antivirals is complex. As of March 2014, it consists of approximately 50 drugs approved by the FDA, approximately half of which are directed against HIV. Antiviral drug creation strategies are focused on two different approaches: targeting the viruses themselves or targeting host cell factors. Direct virus-targeting antiviral drugs include attachment inhibitors, entry inhibitors, uncoating inhibitors, protease inhibitors, polymerase inhibitors, nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, and integrase inhibitors.

Chapter 42 Group IV Viruses Single-Stranded (+)Sense RNA,"The Group IV viruses have a positive sense genome. Positive sense RNA can be translated directly into protein, without a DNA intermediate and without creating a complementary RNA strand. To replicate its genome, though, a complementary DNA strand is required. The positive RNA strand serves as a template for an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, yielding a complementary RNA strand, to form a dimer with the template strand. The double-stranded RNA subsequently serves as the template for a new positive sense genome. The positive strand RNA genome is independently infectious, for most Group IV viruses. This means that in the absence of a capsid, envelope, or enclosed proteins, the RNA molecule, when inserted into a cell, is capable of using host cell machinery to construct additional viruses. There are six subclasses of the Group IV single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses: Picornaviridae, Togaviridae, Coronaviridae, Hepeviridae, Caliciviridae, Flaviviridae, and Astroviridae. As expected, within each class, viruses share structural similarities; but there are no properties, other than the defining property of a (+)-sense single stranded RNA genome, that extends to all six classes of the Group IV viruses.

Chapter 7 Long-Term Virus Evolution in Nature,"Abstract Viruses spread to give rise to epidemics and pandemics, and some key parameters that include virus and host population numbers determine virus persistence or extinction in nature. Viruses evolve at different rates of evolution depending on the polymerase copying fidelity during genome replication. Calculated rates of evolution in nature vary depending on the time interval between virus isolations. In particular, intra-host evolution is generally more rapid that inter-host evolution and several possible mechanisms for this difference are considered. The mechanisms by which the error-prone viruses evolve render very unlikely the operation of a molecular clock (constant rate of incorporation of mutations in the evolving genomes). Several computational methods are reviewed that permit the alignment of viral sequences and the establishment of phylogenetic relationships among viruses. The evolution of virus in the form of dynamic mutant clouds in each infected individual, together with multiple environmental influences, render the emergence and reemergence of viral pathogens an

Chapter 3 Features of Host Cells Cellular and Molecular Biology Review,"Abstract As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses are completely dependent upon a host cell for their replication. They use energy generated by the host cell, and they exploit the host's machinery to manufacture viral proteins. Many of the cell's organelles, as well as the plasma membrane, are involved in viral replication processes. The organelles involved in protein synthesis, processing, and transport—namely the ribosome, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi complex—are utilized in the manufacture of viral proteins, as well, and viruses use ATP generated by the host cell's mitochondria. The plasma membrane, made of a phospholipid bilayer, is the cell's primary zone of contact with the extracellular world. As such, it is the first obstacle that a virus must overcome for entry into a cell. The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology states that DNA is replicated to create more DNA, DNA is transcribed into mRNA, and mRNA is translated by ribosomes to create proteins. All viruses are dependent upon the host's translation machinery, and many viruses will use other portions of the cell's replication and transcription mechanisms. DNA polymerase is the major enzyme involved in DNA replication, while RNA polymerase creates messenger RNA. Host ribosomes translate the messenger RNA into proteins, composed of amino acids. Viruses also have many unique strategies to ensure the translation of their proteins over host

Diagnostic Techniques: Serological and Molecular Approaches☆,"Abstract Virus laboratory diagnostics has an increasingly important role in modern patient care. Virological methods are needed to investigate the etiology of acute viral infection or the reactivation of a latent infection, as well as to follow virus load in antiviral treatments. Serological assays are also used for screening of blood products for the risk of certain chronic infections, evaluation of the immune status, and need for prophylactic treatments in connection with organ transplantations. For diagnostic purposes the following approaches can be used: demonstration of presence of infectious virus or its structural components directly from a patient's specimens or investigation of specific antibody response in serum specimens. Amplification techniques, most commonly polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is currently the workhorse of nucleic acid testing for the detection and quantitation of virus genomes. Virus isolation is used to demonstrate infectious virus in a patient's specimens, whereas virus antigens are investigated by antigen detection assays. Serological diagnosis is based on either the demonstration of the presence of virus-specific IgM antibodies or a significant increase in the levels and/or avidity of specific IgG antibodies. Immunoassays are the most commonly used serological assays. Point-of-care tests (POC tests), for antigens, antibodies, and also nucleic acids are also becoming more and more common in diagnostic use. In order to reach the best diagnostic efficiency for each patient it is important to select the most suitable method using the right sample collected at the right

Severe Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) Pneumonia,"Abstract Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection, which ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia and multiorgan failure, caused by a novel coronavirus named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Majority of cases have been reported from Saudi Arabia. MERS cases occur as sporadic cases or as clusters or hospital outbreaks. Dromedary camels are thought to be a host for MERS-CoV. Direct contact with dromedary camels within 14days prior to infection was identified as an independent risk factor for MERS. Diagnosis of MERS is based on a positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), obtained from a respiratory specimen. The mainstay of management of MERS-CoV infection is supportive care. There is no specific antiviral therapy for MERS-CoV infection at present, although several modalities of treatment options have been examined or are under

Chapter 9 Respiratory viral infections,"Abstract Molecular analysis of respiratory viruses and the host response to both infection and vaccination have transformed our understanding of these ubiquitous pathogens. Polymerase chain reaction for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral infections has led to a better understanding of the epidemiology and impact of many common respiratory viruses and resulted in better patient care. Over the past decade a number of new respiratory viruses including human metapneumovirus and new coronaviruses have been discovered using molecular techniques such as random primer amplification, pan-viral array and next generation sequencing.

Chapter 17 Family Coronaviridae,"Abstract Members of the family Coronaviridae are large, enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses. They are the largest known RNA viruses, with genomes ranging from 25 to 32kb and virions of 118–140nm in diameter. The family is divided into two subfamilies, the Coronavirinae and the Torovirinae. They can be distinguished on the basis of their nucleocapsids as the toroviruses have unique doughnut-shaped nucleocapsids. Virions are roughly spherical and are notable for the large spike (S) glycoprotein that extends from the virus envelope. Current taxonomy places the family in the order Nidovirales. Within the subfamily Coronavirinae are four genera, the alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and deltacoronaviruses. All family members share the same unique strategy for mRNA synthesis whereby the polymerase complex jumps or moves from one region of the template to a more distant region. The need for the polymerase complex to dissociate from the template may explain the high rate of RNA recombination that occurs during genome replication. Both the coronaviruses and toroviruses are enteric and respiratory tract pathogens, usually associated with only mild disease (or inapparent infection). However the human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus cause severe respiratory

Chapter 2 Genetic Instability of RNA Viruses,"Abstract Despite having very limited coding capacity, RNA viruses are able to withstand challenge of antiviral drugs, cause epidemics in previously exposed human populations, and, in some cases, infect multiple host species. They are able to achieve this by virtue of their ability to multiply very rapidly, coupled with their extraordinary degree of genetic heterogeneity. RNA viruses exist not as single genotypes, but as a swarm of related variants, and this genomic diversity is an essential feature of their biology. RNA viruses have a variety of mechanisms that act in combination to determine their genetic heterogeneity. These include polymerase fidelity, error-mitigation mechanisms, genomic recombination, and different modes of genome replication. RNA viruses can vary in their ability to tolerate mutations, or “genetic robustness,” and several factors contribute to this. Finally, there is evidence that some RNA viruses exist close to a threshold where polymerase error rate has evolved to maximize the possible sequence space available, while avoiding the accumulation of a lethal load of deleterious mutations. We speculate that different viruses have evolved different error rates to complement the different “life-styles” they possess.",-0.000733281,-0.05422865,-0.050602112,0.02214946,0.057290472,0.05208225,0.02579599,0.025109112,-0.06105645,0.039829798,0.06187485,0.007414669,-0.032085568,-0.022558652,0.060121562,-0.061476666,-0.06176394,-0.047257453,0.06163785,-0.0190966,-0.058427308,0.048512105,-0.025385378,0.06183118,0.03196286,0.058924314,0.0570938,0.035554297,-0.04136671,-0.059706446,0.060752574,0.061866768,-0.048730366,-0.016853962,-0.017491758,-0.033684473,-0.05885444,0.03294335,-0.060757358,0.048165746,0.011812904,-0.050096966,-0.02037844,-0.05474608,0.018471684,-0.046977255,0.03128955,-0.040411696,0.045391876,0.013235047,0.040680464,-0.021860644,-0.05510439,0.048629254,-0.059635192,-0.010033991,-0.025256071,-0.030411964,0.06031074,-0.03903478,-0.05422593,-0.036730237,0.001791658,-0.016313165,-0.04056096,-0.06169878,0.055584326,-0.007333434,-0.01129389,0.034000173,-0.05517761,0.05615053,0.042223506,0.061052572,-0.05116926,-0.005209974,0.059869215,0.033375677,-0.060613893,0.061486896,-0.054473042,0.06186087,0.029564155,-0.04023948,-0.052915584,0.04388936,0.014228378,0.02685497,-0.050009713,-0.051754754,0.009355602,0.011378283,-0.04692114,0.050060257,-0.005527897,0.05028635,0.03916492,0.06187107,0.061874747,-0.04203124,-0.014131674,-0.05673097,-0.060928512,0.017660528,-0.0373106,0.04666301,0.031712513,-0.053285636,-0.04640773,0.01226061,0.015022707,-0.019606428,-0.012923485,0.058430545,0.06171963,0.017055266,-0.058388427,-0.040994544,-0.039502136,-0.022943422,-0.053739134,0.0609971,0.050567616,0.005105119,0.006186542,0.030774716,-0.013070972,-0.039799236,0.018888196,0.050731067,-0.038084697,0.06187505,0.012015991,-0.041245256,-0.03770757,-0.024809973,0.03298033,0.05298507,0.009258727,0.000901802,0.058379967,0.06181167,-0.0586532,0.013790299,0.03833629,-0.06096524,0.02236466,-0.05755878,0.05251797,0.041467242,-0.003808106,-0.0550029,-0.003817067,-0.03550719,0.06187459,-0.05588881,0.025879646,0.027108185,0.012173767,0.029277664,-0.022461614,-0.02823222,-0.003790724,0.060759347,-0.055258267,0.006048712,-0.06151718,0.055298854,-0.044502582,-0.059770215,-0.05887404,-0.060931057,-0.021195285,0.059049666,0.05654506,0.015297226,0.029279614,-0.024788592,0.060829014,-0.041731548,0.054782934,0.04516483,0.044824377,-0.032994796,-0.005126055,-0.06050738,-0.06153195,-0.000340202,0.05924524,-0.036290426,0.057859387,-0.045209717,-0.013922481,0.046642452,0.06163907,-0.036812965,0.05480612,0.037472166,-0.009826865,-0.05124425,-0.017461758,0.060640633,-0.03362049,-0.058850363,0.04786195,-0.05445087,-0.044028766,0.061649878,0.016372701,0.0617112,0.052564904,0.061407357,0.05683621,0.008961735,-0.012536114,0.04327031,0.061227873,-0.010261308,-0.05693837,-0.019135352,0.032364067,-0.03210123,0.009402643,0.04093611,-0.060680494,0.027830794,-0.05887178,-0.061732493,0.055835046,0.023099564,0.006165626,0.060371798,0.054394852,-0.06186503,0.054731254,0.055859078,0.016938653,-0.060333475,-0.004436938,0.04909421,0.009811121,0.024095077,-0.060330547,-0.037088737,0.057123166,-0.056553867,-0.014277509,0.032914598,0.060888935,0.042704448,-0.061458517,-0.039686907,0.031041816,0.032740124,0.061774846,0.031904865,-0.055061545,0.061875045,0.006800282,-0.030984608,0.006473403,0.04459397,-0.011756481,0.057516582,0.027201213,-0.033119135,-0.05604092,-0.054760497,0.03850221,-0.001482427,-0.041142993,-0.009930238,-0.041288294,0.035429914,-0.048427057,-0.060264226,0.03323721,0.061153613,0.061597575,0.042151526,0.029696623,-0.061345957,0.007607248,0.058696505,-0.05905673,0.011364103,-0.05807182,0.04602112,-0.048681043,-0.019072691,0.061765682,0.000368906,0.061642215,-0.007272651,0.051882423,0.006208923,0.034251157,-0.02565701,-0.061867885,0.05305521,-0.060057685,0.060757253,0.039310776,0.061547596,-0.060312238,0.02402819,-0.030179087,-0.02475444,0.023104534,-0.054792084,0.059965905,0.02176166,0.006850623,-0.06174741,0.05817007,-0.028277045,0.050737638,-0.005697904,0.06187455,0.057177234,-0.006144528,0.05170644,0.014009324,-0.060446326,-0.047924414,0.060238898,-0.046048667,-0.055486396,0.001735096,-0.051378455,0.03572407,0.015656227,0.054735865,0.06128042,-0.026432948,-0.009687286,0.054182913,-0.013487392,-0.029769106,0.003349616,-0.021454897,-0.048337795,0.06056675,0.039509773,-0.06187046,-0.06047441,0.046153594,0.056867592,0.04609555,-0.061475825,-0.031913884,0.006175104,-0.0329387,-0.012009141,0.014911862,0.018291725,-0.06187343,-0.058834217,-0.019119155,-0.022899592,-0.03275355,-0.061586175,-0.057726197,0.060996838,-0.034042317,-0.03322749,0.061854977,0.051922943,0.050656773,-0.054282222,-0.019380732,-0.043538734,-0.04534784,-0.061868493,0.05876871,-0.021790002,0.05190215,0.056010254,-0.011585852,-0.05417463,-0.057780087,0.061519906,0.043443996,-0.040773746,0.019862097,-0.026471047,0.057574015,-0.06112924,0.05044956,0.038619213,0.05188361,-0.009519958,0.058960628,-0.041465376,-0.03797118,0.060102843,-0.028042948,-0.05126493,-0.03023366,0.038052525,-0.058857944,0.006925735,-0.02912159,0.023056138,-0.030903563,-0.009463211,-0.06054862,-0.053527378,-0.022161866,0.03766

Chapter 12 CSF in acute and chronic infectious diseases,"Abstract Infections of the nervous system are an important and challenging aspect of clinical neurology. Immediate correct diagnosis enables to introduce effective therapy, in conditions that without diagnosis may leave the patient with severe neurological incapacitation and sometimes even death. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a mirror that reflects nervous system pathology and can promote early diagnosis and therapy. The present chapter focuses on the CSF findings in neuro-infections, mainly viral and bacterial. Opening pressure, protein and glucose levels, presence of cells and type of the cellular reaction should be monitored. Other tests can also shed light on the causative agent: serology, culture, staining, molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction. Specific examination such as panbacterial and panfungal examinations should be examined when relevant. Our chapter is a guide-text that combines clinical presentation and course with CSF findings as a usuaful tool in diagnosis of

Chapter 5 Advance detection technologies for select biothreat agents,"Abstract This chapter provides a comprehensive update about various technological developments in the field of biothreat agent detection. We have attempted to provide the reader with all the basic information starting with the culture considered as gold standard of diagnosis, immunological assays like the immunochromatographic test (ICT) which includes the lateral flow rapid strip test, flow through spot test and molecular assays, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time RT-PCR, isothermal gene amplification assays, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, etc. One major highlight of the chapter includes bio-monitoring and aerosol generation technologies.

Chapter 3 Infectious Bronchitis Virus in Poultry: Molecular Epidemiology and Factors Leading to the Emergence and Reemergence of Novel Strains of Infectious Bronchitis Virus,"Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a coronavirus that causes an acute and highly contagious disease in chickens. The virus can cause substantial economic losses throughout the poultry industry worldwide. It can affect the upper respiratory tract and the reproductive tract, and some strains can cause nephritis. The causative agent IBV is an RNA virus with great ability for mutation and recombination, thus capable of generating new virus strains that are difficult to control. There are many IBV strains found worldwide, including the Massachusetts, 4/91, D274, and QX-like strains that can be grouped under the classic or variant serotypes. In addition, new types of the virus continue to arise due to mutations and recombination events in the viral genome and even more factors, making this virus difficult to identify and extremely difficult to control. Surveillance and identification of IBV types are extremely important for control of the disease and the advancement of molecular methods has aided in this pursuit. Genetic typing of IBV, which involves reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequence analysis of the S1 glycoprotein gene, has revolutionized diagnosis and identification of this virus by making it possible to type and compare the relatedness of a large number of virus isolates in a short period of time. Several conventional and molecular diagnostic methods have been described for the diagnosis of IB in chickens. “All-in/all-out” operations of rearing along with good biosafety measures form the basis of prevention, whereas vaccination forms the backbone of IB control program. Both live and inactivated (oil emulsified) conventional vaccines are available. The new generation vaccines (recombinant and vector-based) developed against locally prevailing IBV strains may be more helpful and avoid the reversion of virulence in live vaccine

"Chapter 10 Polymerases of Coronaviruses Structure, Function, and Inhibitors","Abstract Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a major group of viruses known to be responsible for wide spectrum of diseases in multiple species. The CoVs affecting human population are referred to as human coronaviruses (HCoVs). They lead to multiple respiratory diseases, such as common cold, pneumonia, bronchitis, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome. CoVs are RNA viruses that require RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) for various steps in their life cycle. Action of RdRP is needed in several steps in the life cycle of CoVs and thus RdRPs constitute potential targets for drugs and other therapeutic interventions for the treatment of diseases caused by CoVs. The chapter therefore presents a detailed discussion on the structure and functions of CoV polymerases and the development of their potential inhibitors.",0.016635101,-0.0025915,0.045938656,-0.021954976,0.043455813,-0.021634124,0.029332828,-0.033724636,-0.033406854,-0.055229638,0.06958605,-0.02728136,-0.0580865,-0.05540561,0.06423317,-0.06763859,-0.06958125,-0.03656903,-0.005776878,-0.021528313,-0.06880543,0.003782682,-0.010699814,-0.012756007,-0.00946509,-0.04745928,0.06338534,0.006626458,-0.051696427,-0.056531146,0.002127326,0.06958568,0.032259833,0.04978168,0.040095836,-0.06446837,0.016391955,-0.009271444,-0.06691121,0.031852797,0.014215443,-0.000701787,0.047617663,0.04106268,-0.039212473,0.017777942,-0.043383654,-0.065150335,0.033874266,0.019497477,-0.03309066,0.06044796,-0.04903921,0.058068555,-0.05502429,-0.020357024,-0.015769321,0.043623343,0.06726434,0.026145328,-0.05305255,-0.028255008,0.043424346,0.030999176,0.025972228,-0.06826567,0.060719837,-0.053377546,-0.03685192,-0.02312071,0.004292772,0.009184844,0.047295492,0.057680342,0.012389168,-0.029214235,0.002216563,-0.017928747,-0.040654257,0.055420067,0.057593685,0.06669301,0.067723416,0.05344924,-0.025706157,0.031366408,0.033874158,0.015182529,-0.039944388,-0.06726396,-0.014638998,-0.05786153,0.06303657,0.024292758,-0.049707923,0.06797615,0.011018753,0.06933987,0.069440946,-0.032537177,-0.059635445,-0.009349613,-0.009485543,0.017373184,-0.031518098,0.022996508,0.023429306,-0.057837117,0.03384543,-0.01418275,-0.050508693,-0.03259434,-0.022112599,0.007335595,0.058590338,0.04910522,-0.05877597,0.021432763,-0.052800186,0.04619524,-0.005599292,-0.011528573,-0.002836618,-0.004919437,0.048864327,0.0465977,-0.006107933,0.012733136,0.003169862,-0.04043297,-0.05514646,0.06958631,0.032505915,0.021129344,0.04544621,-0.048381437,0.047077186,0.013936419,-0.032589853,-0.019970711,-0.005223554,0.066994876,-0.04363645,-0.04529992,-0.029673701,-0.06462236,-0.01937897,-0.01713641,0.064271756,-0.038301513,0.028594892,-0.066481106,-0.049206167,-0.06878678,0.06950952,-0.06817087,0.022465048,0.005967635,0.02881209,-0.000763555,0.048708174,0.043102115,-0.000324043,0.06546191,0.011035218,-0.004141449,-0.047701385,0.002996232,-0.04120769,-0.059618328,-0.036787003,-0.068651125,0.05286903,0.04403324,0.056865275,0.01460829,-0.013665073,-0.06496144,0.066237934,-0.04747121,-0.002357952,0.053416222,0.0165952,0.014853668,0.062010914,-0.035890598,-0.06715426,-0.03812919,0.059991013,-0.062472917,0.023422629,-0.040655486,-0.0346429,0.016081056,0.06278731,-0.0434261,0.03757582,0.012782847,0.003250374,-0.035880983,-0.053027343,-0.015071209,-0.042629793,-0.041405827,-0.011805721,0.035636008,0.01643391,0.050837744,0.005690853,0.067726366,0.049829397,0.06250351,-0.008020711,0.042994224,0.04244041,0.047861885,-0.04655561,-0.016808067,-0.019170817,0.00704044,-0.031280134,-0.021717176,0.030559218,-0.05013237,-0.017057693,-0.05185102,-0.05658278,-0.060546737,0.028097115,0.04458688,0.040409975,0.065336525,0.05922584,-0.068806976,0.065924704,0.04565894,0.018687384,-0.05156762,-0.014219963,0.010779124,0.027888687,0.059696868,-0.02248567,-0.045199964,0.04722583,-0.056044262,-0.04659143,0.06530292,0.03740459,-0.05080983,-0.030337643,0.007976147,0.03189315,0.0419014,0.066952534,-0.016564623,0.03266573,0.06957654,-0.02030012,-0.06738224,0.05929278,0.05992305,-0.06751753,0.013190332,0.000695114,0.002865533,-0.045226816,-0.053999245,0.051505335,0.044668637,0.003721342,0.026067175,-0.030193402,-0.021841094,0.021679739,-0.046367396,0.01637864,0.06567062,0.066087596,0.057011377,0.055390216,-0.020385334,-0.019627366,0.03407424,0.039444253,-0.0176472,-0.014852757,0.021564744,-0.023850473,0.050141335,0.015673842,0.018748414,0.06806583,-0.06634199,0.065765426,-0.06047877,0.020810438,-0.03547111,-0.042416207,0.038394634,-0.038926344,0.003594089,0.058517568,0.05849879,-0.031587042,0.009316637,0.027902596,0.032805633,0.05728048,-0.03489084,-0.05247616,-0.029537572,-0.009886785,-0.030741291,0.067823544,-0.059885424,0.03282533,0.03083415,0.0687403,0.034282435,-0.04344994,0.03370909,0.05220493,-0.06534099,-0.04550355,0.069179654,-0.019837799,-0.04719092,0.04220362,-0.037863176,-0.014285297,0.05994836,-0.037174974,0.04624924,0.0563648,0.05014052,0.029213687,0.04818747,0.010155966,-0.031170882,0.0053127,-0.04437761,0.06943631,0.006171646,-0.06839691,-0.06958307,0.033371728,0.010295255,0.015661743,-0.0658811,-0.022262188,-0.014000384,0.000503327,0.052223273,0.025891177,0.011486878,-0.06956971,-0.06561348,-0.054930646,0.034042034,0.03661102,-0.014966021,-0.06894284,0.03690553,-0.055379033,-0.012941266,0.0693754,0.033015516,-0.001608913,-0.06245016,0.043957613,0.050528087,-0.0530363,-0.06427758,0.056325518,0.005158703,0.058139507,0.06358721,-0.026536684,-0.05572168,-0.054756057,0.06726849,0.035862267,0.026433093,-0.05381265,-0.027209748,0.009680696,-0.0690962,-0.025549045,0.06319189,0.054044336,0.05296011,0.029218273,-0.039925385,0.02362227,0.044549122,-0.030926501,0.004846424,0.05641425,0.053624313,-0.06714118,-0.025586769,-0.007384295,0.054267053,-0.022580257,-0.009483617,-0.008582788,-0.013565291,0.04346512,0.05566949,0.066057414,-0.03163813,-0.056384224

Chapter 7 Long-term virus evolution in nature,"Abstract Viruses spread to give rise to epidemics and pandemics, and some key parameters that include virus and host population numbers determine virus persistence or extinction in nature. Viruses evolve at different rates depending on the polymerase copying fidelity during genome replication and a number of environmental influences. Calculated rates of evolution in nature vary depending on the time interval between virus isolations. In particular, intrahost evolution is generally more rapid that interhost evolution, and several possible mechanisms for this difference are considered. The mechanisms by which the error-prone viruses evolve are very unlikely to render the operation of a molecular clock (constant rate of incorporation of mutations in the evolving genomes), although a clock is assumed in many calculations. Several computational tools permit the alignment of viral sequences and the establishment of phylogenetic relationships among viruses. The evolution of the virus in the form of dynamic mutant clouds in each infected individual, together with multiple environmental parameters renders the emergence and reemergence of viral pathogens an

Chapter 13 Biotechnological innovations in farm and pet animal disease diagnosis,"Abstract The application of innovative diagnostic technologies for the detection of animal pathogens at an early stage is essential in restricting the economic loss incurred due to emerging infectious animal diseases. The desirable characteristics of such diagnostic methods are easy to use, cost-effective, highly sensitive, and specific, coupled with the high-throughput detection capabilities. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are still the most common assays used for the detection of animal pathogens across the globe. However, utilizing the principles of ELISA and PCR, several serological and molecular technologies have been developed to achieve higher sensitivity, rapid, and point-of-care (POC) detection such as lateral flow assays, biosensors, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, recombinase polymerase amplification, and molecular platforms for field-level detection of animal pathogens. Furthermore, animal disease diagnostics need to be updated regularly to capture new, emerging and divergent infectious pathogens, and biotechnological innovations are helpful in fulfilling the rising demand for such diagnostics for the welfare of the society. Therefore, this chapter primarily describes and discusses in detail the serological, molecular, novel high-throughput, and POC assays to detect pathogens affecting farm and companion

Chapter 19 Advances in structure-assisted antiviral discovery for animal viral diseases,"Abstract The latest advancements in drug development are structure-assisted and computer-aided identification, design, and synthesis of target-specific antiviral. Structural virology of animal viruses has made valuable contribution to our understanding of viruses in general, replication, evolution, and interaction with the host. Structure–function relation studies are definitely the need of the hour for rational design of drugs and vaccines to effectively treat animal viral diseases. These studies are important for economical, veterinary, and human medical perspectives. X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and cryo-electron microscopy techniques elaborate the structure–function relation studies by utilizing various computational approaches for structure-assisted designing of drug molecules and antiviral against viruses. Availability of protein three-dimensional structures, high-performance computing, data management software, and internet are enhancing the modern day drug discovery process. Computational tools offer the advantage of delivering new drug candidates more quickly and at a lower cost. Various viral proteins that are necessary for the survival of the virus inside the host are discussed in this chapter such as viral polymerase, helicase, protease, etc. Various antiviral drug molecules identified and designed on the basis of the structure of viral proteins which are highlighted, and disclosed details of the available inhibitors and potential antiviral are discussed. Further improvement in identified inhibitors, the need of novel structure-based drugs and their clinical testing is emphasized. This chapter describes briefly the structural techniques and advances made in animal virology toward structure-based identification and development of antiviral for treatment of animal viruses. In the future, the studies discussed may serve as the basis for development of potential antiviral against animal viral

Chapter 19 Disease resistance for different livestock species,"Abstract This chapter deals with progress in disease resistance for the livestock population species-wise and describes the progress that occurred globally. Certain genes were identified for mastitis resistance and the strategies for genomic control of mastitis are discussed. Gene-edited tuberculosis-resistant cattle were developed for the first time with CRISPR/Cas 9 technology with NRAMP gene insert. Similarly studies are in progress for the development of trypanosomiasis-resistant cattle at ILRI. Genomic insights were discussed for disease resistance for goat against gastrointestinal nematode infestation, coccidiosis, peste des petits ruminants, and scrapie. Similarly genomic resistance was also discussed for sheep, discussing the mechanism of disease resistance with MHC, antibody and T cell response, cytokines, and receptors. Genes identified for bacterial diarrhoeal resistance as K88, F18 (an intestinal receptor) for resistance to bacterial infection in pig. Gene-edited pigs were developed against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and transmissible gastroenteritis caused by corona virus using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Insights on the omics technologies developed and studied were discussed for livestock species. Genomic control on various diseases of poultry is discussed as salmonellosis, avian influenza, Marek’s disease, Newcastle disease with advanced genomic and allied techniques for its control as RNA interference, flow cytometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, transcriptomics, etc. A new concept on natural antibodies was

28 New and Emerging Infections of the Lung,"Abstract In this era of rapid globalization and frequent travel, emerging viral infections have gained an immense potential to spread at an unprecedented speed and scale compared with the past. This poses a significant challenge to coordinated international efforts in global surveillance and infection control. Significantly, respiratory viral infections, spread mostly via droplet transmission, are extremely contagious and have caused significant morbidity and mortality during outbreaks in the last decade. Molecular diagnostics via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been key in the rapid diagnosis of most of these viral infections. However, a high index of suspicion and early institution of appropriate isolation measures remain as the mainstay in the control and containment of the spread of these viral infections. Although treatment for most of the viral infections remains supportive, efficacious antiviral agents against influenza infections exist. The infections discussed in this chapter include those first described in the 2000s: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and metapneumovirus and rhinovirus C as well as those that have been described in the past but have reemerged in the last decade in outbreaks resulting in significant morbidity and mortality, including adenovirus, influenza virus, and enterovirus D68 (EV-D68).",-0.06115592,0.06049581,-0.0406512,-0.052855443,-0.008380516,0.05799583,0.060429472,-0.017312627,0.054400306,-0.017508544,0.06349412,-0.04630227,0.010456387,-0.06276003,0.0630109,-0.05879905,-0.063485846,-0.057334278,0.039915323,-0.04317013,-0.001324554,-0.024937226,-0.039674174,0.04500751,-0.012758437,0.054198343,0.0377436,-0.04477723,-0.0596942,-0.051322732,0.061937906,0.06349481,0.000128654,0.01932057,0.057239827,-0.007143385,-0.0625287,0.011552971,-0.057488788,-0.043936327,-0.010861388,-0.000374727,0.046495218,0.006635054,0.03174715,0.020242417,-0.035761323,-0.022452138,0.047152996,0.048949707,-0.059192337,0.030897073,-0.06304708,-0.02137419,-0.05463994,-0.043055616,-0.061557006,-0.002228905,0.057873745,0.040418856,-0.052400865,0.018760659,0.060237948,0.024612166,-0.029666556,-0.053489618,0.0621903,0.035134874,-0.030542089,-0.035838272,-0.04953954,-0.02515095,-0.007261141,0.0601906,0.048452605,0.003549278,-0.06285293,-0.012499182,-0.06346572,0.051912747,0.004314528,0.028862065,0.05371871,0.04396452,-0.045389533,0.03710877,0.021453567,0.043931145,-0.048746187,-0.05589075,-0.05431289,-0.019010095,-0.03211733,-0.059233617,0.028545879,0.05363424,0.06063787,0.06265198,0.06295458,-0.009922491,-0.057970326,-0.054046612,-0.014739475,0.026961531,0.020700162,0.053485103,0.049416192,0.002257546,0.058335878,0.014240411,-0.062745996,0.011548801,0.004881222,0.03262142,0.0632918,0.031443466,-0.039308965,0.008912562,-0.0339909,0.03590863,-0.005325261,-0.013178785,0.04742853,0.015066087,-0.03694413,-0.020342333,0.043068994,0.024750708,0.006945405,-0.004676898,-0.01854487,0.06349405,0.0567263,-0.044112917,0.045158934,-0.041938487,0.058833655,0.03819268,-0.0416269,-0.061067827,0.023920448,0.06348125,-0.029854506,-0.027449539,0.05521448,-0.0479612,0.05234262,-0.06334797,0.05340211,-0.048819877,0.030075284,-0.06255156,-0.048661903,-0.037260577,0.046522435,-0.05860756,0.05800357,-0.02603048,0.059943587,0.055630352,0.043550476,0.020326747,-0.015843363,0.059770305,0.06048412,-0.060848635,0.002663018,0.04593905,-0.049223192,-0.04528415,0.006309412,-0.06346386,-0.011503953,-0.02331571,0.037888613,0.008948699,0.010797934,-0.012384562,0.03977968,0.006725094,0.009121135,0.04394341,-0.003593712,0.052451197,0.061388183,-0.000964253,-0.06318443,-0.058916356,-0.02938142,-0.027138753,-0.010918908,-0.031532183,-0.029421475,0.011884924,0.062993035,-0.05236558,0.04166338,0.039399676,-0.049148966,-0.020627452,-0.057082135,0.0472407,0.012321801,0.03196496,0.022089167,-0.02284675,0.038016718,0.03018709,0.048865136,0.06339927,0.046389002,-0.057794616,0.004060785,0.06181539,-0.035878256,0.05496879,0.03360159,0.061150156,-0.057022154,0.021988682,-0.034708522,-0.006140713,0.017908318,-0.009976609,0.020852786,0.029903851,-0.0615457,-0.063448384,0.059961844,0.062497716,0.018020436,0.0594474,0.031155964,-0.057259873,0.048744336,0.049240988,-0.044876296,-0.06289303,0.048890173,0.046733998,-0.04673011,-0.014585227,0.03624732,-0.048676286,0.0468028,-0.058161523,-0.05425625,0.057595283,0.045062725,-0.063277,0.051295366,-0.058547005,-0.04911343,-0.05679764,0.06084568,0.05452754,-0.058039617,0.063494116,-0.05615895,-0.048932374,0.034267504,0.05142754,0.016901555,0.029693507,-0.04200419,-0.04767606,0.028972626,0.04536443,0.048239548,0.04704883,0.056751173,0.061574075,-0.06274271,-0.060748402,0.01698048,-0.04727567,0.048221514,0.041897938,0.057198875,-0.044956863,-0.046555426,-0.02395743,-0.003298827,0.0163329,-0.03212457,0.032539498,-0.06323807,-0.038664974,-0.059820242,0.0547146,0.053576574,0.045475673,0.04301998,-0.061320774,0.021637017,-0.06165554,0.02440049,-0.04216995,-0.02895674,0.05894168,-0.03976918,0.04941297,0.05806777,-0.02524346,-0.05508183,0.030999029,0.045997135,-0.027590962,0.060582798,-0.058128174,-0.027751295,-0.011216392,-0.06224515,0.061646674,0.06320374,0.013416128,0.06002706,0.022270499,-0.0219155,0.048134428,-0.048896246,0.062043257,0.057838015,-0.058198653,-0.0506677,0.063485265,-0.0432656,-0.00603964,-0.0549759,-0.06060324,0.026778642,0.06277756,0.020653112,0.015383619,-0.000819547,0.015383164,-0.023970222,0.053637695,-0.041306883,0.019006532,0.033190913,-0.061571147,0.048187163,0.005190806,-0.05662716,-0.06348788,0.04335009,0.058929738,0.021126192,-0.063420415,-0.025366466,0.011388899,0.017562103,0.053411204,0.057569638,0.056166034,-0.06345538,-0.047494236,-0.056371063,0.014134996,0.041251916,-0.045583706,-0.05239697,-0.021771407,-0.040275533,0.019554378,0.06341613,0.009902841,0.018187769,-0.006563472,0.026312703,0.060151726,-0.05146929,-0.005163986,0.062042437,0.054316763,0.06327142,0.030568939,-0.014963347,-0.014699852,-0.03829811,0.014515669,0.06242826,0.06328969,0.021740396,0.019684276,-0.01481869,-0.06317409,-0.044160552,0.041286673,0.015305266,0.019483864,0.050461166,0.019351566,-0.047214683,0.027325284,0.033388704,-0.05295922,0.057968237,-0.05207395,0.0429512,-0.01590229,-0.006836877,0.062429994,0.030972088,0.039281044,-0.016298657,-0.013465229,0.050912466,-0.019876402,0.023468643,0.04091682,-0.048414223,-0.0624298

Chapter 5 Laboratory diagnosis of viral infection,"Abstract Since the last Handbook of Clinical Neurology volume on this topic, viral diagnosis has made tremendous strides, moving from the margin to the mainstream of clinical care. For many years, conventional virus isolation was the mainstay of viral diagnosis since it was sensitive and “open-minded.” However, growth in conventional cell culture entails an inherent delay that limits its clinical impact. Although rapid culture and viral antigen methods detect fewer pathogens and are less sensitive than conventional culture, both require less expertise and have greatly reduced time to result. Polymerase chain reaction has ushered in a new era in virology, especially in the diagnosis of neurologic diseases. Molecular amplification methods are rapid, highly sensitive, can be automated, quantitative, and detect viruses not amenable to routine culture. User-friendly, walk-away tests with results in an hour, as well as multiplex tests that can detect 20 viruses in a single reaction, are now a reality. As the variety of test methods and commercial products proliferate, the challenges for clinicians and laboratories are selecting which tests to utilize in which clinical scenarios, and understanding how to interpret the results. The advantages and limitations of each method are discussed in this chapter, with special attention to neurologic

2009 H1N1 Influenza: A Twenty-First Century Pandemic With Roots in the Early Twentieth Century,"Abstract A swine-origin H1N1 triple-reassortant influenza A virus found to be a distant relative of the 1918 “Spanish flu” virus emerged in April 2009 to give rise to the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century. Although disease was generally mild and similar to seasonal influenza, severe manifestations including respiratory failure were noted in some, particularly those with underlying conditions such as asthma, pregnancy and immunosuppression. Children and younger adults accounted for most cases, hospitalizations and deaths. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay was superior to antigen-based rapid tests for diagnosis. All 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza strains were susceptible to 1 or more neuraminidase inhibitors. Monovalent, unadjuvanted 2009 H1N1 vaccines were licensed in the United States in September 2009 and initially targeted to younger individuals, pregnant women, caretakers of infants and healthcare providers. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic highlights the need for modernization of influenza vaccines, improved diagnostics and more rigorous evaluation of mitigation

Detection of nucleic acids of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in the lungs of naturally infected piglets as determined by in-situ hybridization,"Summary Replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was studied in formalin-fixed paraffin wax-embedded lung tissues from seven naturally infected piglets by in-situ hybridization with a non-radioactive digoxigenin-labelled probe. A 433 base pair cDNA probe for the viral RNA encoding the nucleocapsid proteins of a Korean PRRSV isolate was generated by the polymerase chain reaction. All seven piglets infected with PRRSV showed a distinct, positive signal, scattered throughout the alveolar septa and spaces. Positive cells typically exhibited dark brown staining deposits in the cytoplasm without background staining. In-situ hybridization demonstrated that PRRSV replicated primarily in interstitial and alveolar macrophages, and occasionally in type 2 pneumocytes. The bronchial or bronchiolar epithelium did not exhibit a hybridization signal for PRRSV nucleic acids. The anterior and middle lobes of the lung were more reliable than the caudal or accessory lobes for the detection of PRRSV nucleic acids. The in-situ hybridization technique used was rapid, specific and sensitive, and may prove useful for the diagnosis of PRRSV infection in routinely fixed and processed

The Palm Subdomain-based Active Site is Internally Permuted in Viral RNA-dependent RNA Polymerases of an Ancient Lineage,"Abstract Template-dependent polynucleotide synthesis is catalyzed by enzymes whose core component includes a ubiquitous αβ palm subdomain comprising A, B and C sequence motifs crucial for catalysis. Due to its unique, universal conservation in all RNA viruses, the palm subdomain of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) is widely used for evolutionary and taxonomic inferences. We report here the results of elaborated computer-assisted analysis of newly sequenced replicases from Thosea asigna virus (TaV) and the closely related Euprosterna elaeasa virus (EeV), insect-specific ssRNA+ viruses, which revise a capsid-based classification of these viruses with tetraviruses, an Alphavirus-like family. The replicases of TaV and EeV do not have characteristic methyltransferase and helicase domains, and include a putative RdRp with a unique C–A–B motif arrangement in the palm subdomain that is also found in two dsRNA birnaviruses. This circular motif rearrangement is a result of migration of ∼22 amino acid (aa) residues encompassing motif C between two internal positions, separated by ∼110aa, in a conserved region of ∼550aa. Protein modeling shows that the canonical palm subdomain architecture of poliovirus (ssRNA+) RdRp could accommodate the identified sequence permutation through changes in backbone connectivity of the major structural elements in three loop regions underlying the active site. This permutation transforms the ferredoxin-like β1αAβ2β3αBβ4 fold of the palm subdomain into the β2β3β1αAαBβ4 structure and brings β-strands carrying two principal catalytic Asp residues into sequential proximity such that unique structural properties and, ultimately, unique functionality of the permuted RdRps may result. The permuted enzymes show unprecedented interclass sequence conservation between RdRps of true ssRNA+ and dsRNA viruses and form a minor, deeply separated cluster in the RdRp tree, implying that other, as yet unidentified, viruses may employ this type of RdRp. The structural diversification of the palm subdomain might be a major event in the evolution of template-dependent polynucleotide polymerases in the RNA–protein

"Polymerase chain reaction–based detection of rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and coronavirus in otitis media with effusion","Abstract Objectives: To study the association of human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human coronavirus infections in children aged 6 months to 12 years with otitis media with effusion (OME). To determine how long HRV RNA can be detected after HRV infection. Methods: Middle ear effusion (MEE) samples collected at the time of tympanostomy tube placement from 100 children with OME were examined. Viral RNA was detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. For HRV the results were compared with virus isolation in cell culture. In vitro studies of the persistence of HRV infectivity and RNA were conducted by combining ~105 median cell culture infectious doses of HRV with pooled MEE at 37°C and assaying serial samples for 12 weeks. Results: Virus RNA was detected in 30 children. HRV was detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 19 children with OME and by virus isolation in 5 children. RSV RNA was found in 8 and HCV in 3 children with OME. No dual viral infection was found. Bacterial pathogens were isolated from 35 MEE samples and were associated with viral RNA in 11 cases, most often with HRV (9 cases). Under in vitro conditions, HRV culture positivity declined rapidly (<2 days), but RNA was detectable for up to 8 weeks. Conclusions: These results suggest that virus infection, particularly HRV infection, either alone or concurrent with bacteria, is present in a larger percentage of children with OME than previously suspected. It remains to be determined how often the presence of viral RNA in MEE represents persistent RNA, ongoing viral replication, or recurrent infection.

Molecular diagnosis of respiratory viruses,"Summary The increasing availability of nucleic acid amplification tests since the 1980s has revolutionised our understanding of the pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory aspects of known and novel viral respiratory pathogens. High-throughput, multiplex polymerase chain reaction is the most commonly used qualitative detection method, but utilisation of newer techniques such as next-generation sequencing will become more common following significant cost reductions. Rapid and readily accessible isothermal amplification platforms have also allowed molecular diagnostics to be used in a ‘point-of-care’ format. This review focuses on the current applications and limitations of molecular diagnosis for respiratory

Oral Mutian®X stopped faecal feline coronavirus shedding by naturally infected cats,"Abstract Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is common among cats living indoors in groups. In about 10% of infected cats, a potentially lethal disease, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) occurs. Virus transmission is faecal-oral. Mutian® X is a product marketed to treat cats with FIP but is also being used to stop virus shedding, although no clear guidelines exist for its use for this purpose. The aim of this study was to establish the minimum dose and treatment duration required to ensure viral clearance from the faeces of asymptomatic virus-shedding cats. In five multicat households, 29 cats naturally infected with FCoV and actively shedding virus in the faeces were given Mutian X pills. Virus shedding was monitored using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) controlled for faecal inhibitors to ensure sensitivity. Mutian X given orally cleared the virus in 29 cats; although four cats required a repeated course to finally stop virus shedding. A dose of 4 mg/kg q24 h for four days was found to be the optimal treatment protocol: 2 mg/kg cleared only 80% of cats. Post-treatment using a sensitive RT-qPCR test was essential to ensure that virus clearance had been achieved, since failure to clear even one cat can result in re-infection of the others. Records of virus shedding by cats before treatment provided a retrospective control: significantly more cats stopped shedding virus after Mutian X than recovered from infection during the control period (p < .00001). This is the first report of the successful elimination of faecal FCoV shedding in chronically infected cats.",-0.046019416,-0.053004872,0.055765964,-0.044148836,0.048809562,-0.027889756,-0.052385926,0.000302906,0.032803748,0.053329814,0.05952362,0.05951831,0.03088156,-0.001855435,0.047387283,0.04155547,-0.059521154,-0.058489062,-0.021121219,0.051280946,-0.059468552,-0.029533267,-0.0444425,0.052910067,0.049126804,-0.03489025,-0.052773245,-0.05268236,-0.038168155,0.049884517,0.0327845,0.059523623,0.012394529,-0.049769845,0.05730143,0.045645397,-0.051317398,-0.030260744,0.01055394,-0.01573928,-0.017062178,0.023979325,0.057841983,-0.015513082,-0.05952361,-0.004908058,0.046677444,0.037070155,0.038936898,0.04668481,-0.043829728,-0.003905166,-0.057014965,-0.016277913,-0.04330586,0.029712362,-0.025265519,-0.018612344,0.05946085,-0.059522342,0.003329291,0.05742259,-0.05942755,-0.046126172,0.05952361,-0.058069877,0.05501765,-0.040324412,-0.002953698,0.010395505,0.012983899,0.052966267,0.032785773,0.059292078,0.045638114,0.02143623,-0.012739183,-0.040677264,-0.059520237,0.0198711,-0.054518744,0.038068898,0.05856776,-0.036161102,-0.03255039,0.04774076,-0.003426897,0.059494764,-0.012227133,-0.0593689,-0.02886362,-0.022290794,-0.047365766,0.040486366,0.058345355,0.040708013,0.050156683,0.059381805,0.05907439,-0.05907238,-0.048526306,-0.04438509,-0.041966088,0.04880804,0.046520337,0.02992979,0.059512768,-0.021337032,-0.05261818,-0.006076683,-0.05405735,-0.057833012,0.051381007,-0.02044636,0.052469555,0.015593905,-0.010521801,-0.02359565,0.007040554,-0.032900058,-0.01227466,0.044960175,-0.04856823,-0.025442118,0.054559216,0.039495986,-0.038148306,0.004971607,0.022147445,0.059523556,0.022806603,0.059523623,0.053304475,-0.05529395,0.043429527,-0.058048792,-0.001354037,0.030865133,0.012072015,-0.03530891,0.043596037,0.05952359,-0.057673864,0.005402871,0.050665494,-0.043245357,-0.01687451,-0.000480345,0.051535293,-0.047577932,0.044221666,-0.042307917,-0.05156456,0.05528336,0.058411676,0.036454752,0.058118053,0.047177367,-0.024388868,-0.014167557,-0.007974313,-0.004079073,-0.05158728,0.05482474,-0.01083483,-0.059523623,-0.048753142,0.002034742,-0.055611912,-0.05919673,-0.007632353,-0.05952356,-0.019063674,-0.049947742,0.010838885,0.05780477,0.008612299,-0.026787393,0.046867866,-0.055847835,0.04288354,-0.008036752,0.040993582,-0.04968085,0.053877655,0.034231465,-0.055530787,-0.006786838,-0.009282321,0.04555276,0.043582,-0.05502126,-0.001997262,0.045232892,0.059050605,0.024371015,0.043823995,0.041329272,0.05108437,-0.047548387,-0.053583067,0.059388753,-0.056165412,-0.04002326,0.02295943,-0.057088476,-0.036283348,0.05952362,0.04745578,-0.059492406,0.038036954,0.059523623,0.05896895,0.040927593,-0.0586412,0.05321939,0.01556668,0.058865238,-0.048394307,-0.05289908,0.03348089,0.01448261,0.0310627,-0.0588838,0.054892506,0.033497598,-0.03631655,-0.046084344,-0.021359347,-0.050963804,0.031174593,0.036467552,0.05901596,-0.05952362,0.04881504,-0.02624561,0.020972,-0.037839074,-0.039001517,-0.039357558,0.040322706,0.05949619,0.029347824,-0.001903257,0.059491407,-0.032475673,-0.057607476,0.017739285,0.004336214,-0.045802373,-0.027326334,-0.017575474,-0.047507912,-0.040422894,0.048452906,0.029338874,0.045869116,0.059523623,-0.009914393,-0.030996162,0.0576067,0.057169452,-0.05086536,0.024532238,-0.014315643,-0.059523623,-0.030348334,-0.041799914,-0.014122632,0.058044527,-0.0491334,0.052044272,-0.059093468,-0.059519283,-0.033747114,-0.058084972,0.05900508,0.004367127,0.05926322,0.055044938,0.042217717,-0.029781772,0.028211396,0.050629374,0.058817264,-0.050984956,-0.045102187,0.0595236,0.018211208,0.056568563,0.03567502,-0.027331151,0.059523623,-0.059523396,0.009788387,-0.051476154,-0.046195123,-0.052483868,-0.05950388,0.05450502,-0.010320563,0.058266528,0.010418651,0.018417161,-0.058732763,-0.018734839,-0.00434975,-0.04854226,0.028343229,-0.006684201,-0.044028293,-0.045473825,-0.032689624,0.054884043,0.059511367,-0.051629167,0.058418225,-0.017885284,0.058708142,0.0408703,-0.058961205,0.040219698,0.04486178,-0.014138767,-0.05858881,0.05951657,-0.05687109,-0.047935374,-0.055747777,-0.04362874,0.043803297,0.04367853,-0.059517704,0.059139088,-0.016730577,0.043685306,0.037807405,0.011712801,-0.04838444,0.004822338,0.050648063,-0.053043712,-0.010289163,0.057951543,-0.05869056,-0.05952151,0.047470454,0.022033265,-0.038345013,-0.05298119,0.05526488,0.03247717,0.052999526,0.0330936,0.038953587,0.046456642,-0.05952183,-0.05712239,0.04970848,-0.034661092,0.034660257,-0.05900555,0.004103319,0.058732443,-0.010194461,-0.018531997,0.05904636,0.03754961,0.040826757,-0.05539724,-0.037174974,0.054609723,-0.054983065,-0.021919806,0.050391085,0.052956153,-0.025397927,-0.05952307,0.05951411,0.036372103,-0.014374172,0.012987338,0.040435687,0.05906036,-0.037584983,-0.030755695,-0.04358287,-0.059382197,-0.018540226,0.023432495,0.051695567,-0.022919968,0.049957275,-0.029107524,-0.049543213,0.026845973,-0.051565096,-0.05425499,-0.047949627,-0.058930967,-0.026157584,0.000725294,0.04939201,0.026246607,0.05000371,-0.051256265,-0.049608104,-0.032241628,0.04343414,0.05873649

Emergence of a coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus mutant with a truncated 3b gene: functional characterization of the 3b protein in pathogenesis and replication,"Abstract The subgenomic RNA 3 of IBV has been shown to be a tricistronic mRNA, encoding three products in IBV-infected cells. To explore if the least expressed ORF, ORF 3b, which encodes a nonstructural protein, is evolutionarily conserved and functionally indispensable for viral propagation in cultured cells, the Beaudette strain of IBV was propagated in chicken embryonated eggs for three passages and then adapted to a monkey kidney cell line, Vero. The 3b gene of passage 3 in embryonated eggs and passages 7, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 50, and 65 in Vero cells were amplified by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The results showed that viral RNA extracted from passages 35, 50, and 65 contained a single A insertion in a 6A stretch of the 3b gene between nucleotides 24075 and 24080, whereas the early passages carried the normal 3b gene. This insertion resulted in a frameshift event and therefore, if expressed, a C-terminally truncated protein. We showed that the frameshifting product, cloned in a plasmid, was expressed in vitro and in cells transfected with the mutant construct. The normal product of the 3b gene is 64 amino acids long, whereas the frameshifting product is 34 amino acids long with only 17 homogeneous amino acid residues at the N-terminal half. Immunofluorescent studies revealed that the normal 3b protein was localized to the nucleus and the truncated product showed a “free” distribution pattern, indicating that the C-terminal portion of 3b was responsible for its nuclear localization. Comparison of the complete genome sequences (27.6 kb) of isolates p20c22 and p36c12 (from passages 20 and 36, respectively) revealed that p36c12 contains three amino acid substitutions, two in the 195-kDa protein (encoded by gene 1) and one in the S protein, in addition to the frameshifting 3b product. Further characterization of the two isolates demonstrated that p36c12 showed growth advantage over p20c22 in both Vero cells and chicken embryos and was more virulent in chicken embryos than p20c22. These results suggest that the 3b gene product is not essential for the replication of

Detection of a group 2 coronavirus in dogs with canine infectious respiratory disease,"Abstract An investigation into the causes of canine infectious respiratory disease was carried out in a large rehoming kennel. Tissue samples taken from the respiratory tract of diseased dogs were tested for the presence of coronaviruses using RT–PCR with conserved primers for the polymerase gene. Sequence analysis of four positive samples showed the presence of a coronavirus with high similarity to both bovine and human coronavirus (strain OC43) in their polymerase and spike genes, whereas there was a low similarity to comparable genes in the enteric canine coronavirus. This canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCV) was detected by RT–PCR in 32/119 tracheal and 20/119 lung samples, with the highest prevalence being detected in dogs with mild clinical symptoms. Serological analysis showed that the presence of antibodies against CRCV on the day of entry into the kennel decreased the risk of developing respiratory

Characterization of proteins encoded by ORFs 2 to 7 of Lelystad virus,"Abstract The genome of Lelystad virus (LV), a positive-strand RNA virus, is 15 kb in length and contains 8 open reading frames (ORFs) that encode putative viral proteins. ORFs 2 to 7 were cloned in plasmids downstream of the Sp6 RNA polymerase promoter, and the translation of transcripts generated in vitro yielded proteins that could be immunoprecipitated with porcine anti-LV serum. Synthetic polypeptides of 15 to 17 amino acids were selected from the amino acid sequences of ORFs 2 to 7 and antipeptide sera were raised in rabbits. Antisera that immunoprecipitated the in vitro translation products of ORFs 2 to 5 and 7 were obtained. Sera containing antibodies directed against peptides from ORFs 3 to 7 reacted positively with LV-infected alveolar lung macrophages in the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay. Using these antipeptide sera and porcine anti-LV serum, we identified three structural proteins and assigned their corresponding genes. Virions were found to contain a nucleocapsid protein of 15 kDa (N), an unglycosylated membrane protein of 18 kDa (M), and a glycosylated membrane protein of 25 kDa (E). The N protein is encoded by ORF7, the M protein is encoded by ORF6, and the E protein is encoded by ORF5. The E protein in virus particles contains one or two N-glycans that are resistant to endo-β-N-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase H. This finding indicates that the high-mannose glycans are processed into complex glycans in the Golgi compartment. The protein composition of the LV virions further confirms that LV is evolutionarily related to equine arteritis virus, simian hemorrhagic fever virus, and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating

Lung pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): a study of 8 autopsy cases from Singapore,"Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious condition caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a new member in the family Coronaviridae. To evaluate the lung pathology in this life-threatening respiratory illness, we studied postmortem lung sections from 8 patients who died from SARS during the spring 2003 Singapore outbreak. The predominant pattern of lung injury in all 8 cases was diffuse alveolar damage. The histology varied according to the duration of illness. Cases of 10 or fewer days’ duration demonstrated acute-phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), airspace edema, and bronchiolar fibrin. Cases of more than 10 days’ duration exhibited organizing-phase DAD, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, multinucleated giant cells, and acute bronchopneumonia. In acute-phase DAD, pancytokeratin staining was positive in hyaline membranes along alveolar walls and highlighted the absence of pneumocytes. Multinucleated cells were shown to be both type II pneumocytes and macrophages by pancytokeratin, thyroid transcription factor-1, and CD68 staining. SARS-CoV RNA was identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 7 of 8 cases in fresh autopsy tissue and in 8 of 8 cases in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue, including the 1 negative case in fresh tissue. Understanding the pathology of DAD in SARS patients may provide the basis for therapeutic strategies. Further studies of the pathogenesis of SARS may reveal new insight into the mechanisms of

Rna Viruses Redirect Host Factors to Better Amplify Their Genome,"Publisher Summary This chapter provides an updated view of the host factors that are, at present, believed to participate in replication/transcription of RNA viruses. One of the major hurdles faced when attempting to identify host factors specifically involved in viral RNA replication/transcription is how to discriminate these factors from those involved in translation. Several of the host factors shown to affect viral RNA synthesis are factors known to be involved in protein synthesis, for example, translation factors. In addition, some of the factors identified to date appear to influence viral RNA amplification as well as viral protein synthesis, and translation and replication are frequently tightly associated. Several specific host factors actively participating in viral RNA transcription/replication have been identified and the regions of host protein/replicase or host protein/viral RNA interaction have been determined. The chapter centers exclusively on those factors that appear functionally important for viral amplification. It presents a list of the viruses for which a specific host factor associates with the polymerase, affecting viral genome amplification. It also indicates the usually accepted cell function of the factor and the viral polymerase or polymerase subunit to which the host factor

The Molecular Biology of Coronaviruses,"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the manipulation of clones of coronavirus and of complementary DNAs (cDNAs) of defective-interfering (DI) RNAs to study coronavirus RNA replication, transcription, recombination, processing and transport of proteins, virion assembly, identification of cell receptors for coronaviruses, and processing of the polymerase. The nature of the coronavirus genome is nonsegmented, single-stranded, and positive-sense RNA. Its size ranges from 27 to 32 kb, which is significantly larger when compared with other RNA viruses. The gene encoding the large surface glycoprotein is up to 4.4 kb, encoding an imposing trimeric, highly glycosylated protein. This soars some 20 nm above the virion envelope, giving the virus the appearance-with a little imagination-of a crown or coronet. Coronavirus research has contributed to the understanding of many aspects of molecular biology in general, such as the mechanism of RNA synthesis, translational control, and protein transport and processing. It remains a treasure capable of generating unexpected

Clinical Virology of Rhinoviruses,"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the various aspects of the clinical virology of rhinoviruses. Some attributes of the virus and epidemiology of disease that have clinical relevance, the efficiency of methods for detecting the presence of the virus in the human respiratory tract, and the means by which symptomatic illness is produced by rhinovirus infection of the respiratory tract are described Rhinoviruses cause more infections in humans than any other microorganism. The chapter also discusses the attributes of virus and the epidemiology of disease. These acid-sensitive picornaviruses infect epithelial cells following inoculation onto the nasal mucosa and are detected reliably in nasopharyngeal secretions. Rhinovirus colds occur year round, with a peak of illness in the fall. Type-specific serum antibody correlates with protection against infection. The fact that there are at least 100 different immunotypes makes development of an effective vaccine unlikely. The chapter presents various techniques for the detection of rhinovirus, such as sampling and cell culture, and polymerase chain

The Molecular Biology of Coronaviruses,"Publisher Summary Coronaviruses have recently emerged as an important group of animal and human pathogens that share a distinctive replicative cycle. Some of the unique characteristics in the replication of coronaviruses include generation of a 3' coterminal-nested set of five or six subgenomic mRNAs, each of which appears to direct the synthesis of one protein. Two virus-specific RNA polymerase activities have been identified. Many of the distinctive features of coronavirus infection and coronavirus-induced diseases may result from the properties of the two coronavirus glycoproteins. The intracellular budding site, which may be important in the establishment and maintenance of persistent infections, appears to be due to the restricted intracytoplasmic migration of the E1 glycoprotein, which acts as a matrix-like transmembrane glycoprotein. E1 also exhibits distinctive behavior by self-aggregating on heating at 100°C in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and by its interaction with RNA in the viral nucleocapsid. The E1 of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is an O-linked glycoprotein, unlike most other viral glycoproteins. Thus, the coronavirus system may be a useful model for the study of synthesis, glycosylation, and transport of O-linked cellular

Conventional and nonconventional roles of the nucleolus,"Abstract As the most prominent of subnuclear structures, the nucleolus has a well-established role in ribosomal subunit assembly. Additional nucleolar functions, not related to ribosome biogenesis, have been discovered within the last decade. Built around multiple copies of the genes for preribosomal RNA (rDNA), nucleolar structure is largely dependent on the process of ribosome assembly. The nucleolus is disassembled during mitosis at which time preribosomal RNA transcription and processing are suppressed; it is reassembled at the end of mitosis in part from components preserved from the previous cell cycle. Expression of preribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) is regulated by the silencing of individual rDNA genes via alterations in chromatin structure or by controlling RNA polymerase I initiation complex formation. Preribosomal RNA processing and posttranscriptional modifications are guided by a multitude of small nucleolar RNAs. Nearly completed ribosomal subunits are exported to the cytoplasm by an established nuclear export system with the aid of specialized adapter molecules. Some preribosomal and nucleolar components are transiently localized in Cajal bodies, presumably for modification or assembly. The nonconventional functions of nucleolus include roles in viral infections, nuclear export, sequestration of regulatory molecules, modification of small RNAs, RNP assembly, and control of aging, although some of these functions are not well established. Additional progress in defining the mechanisms of each step in ribosome biogenesis as well as clarification of the precise role of the nucleolus in nonconventional activities is expected in the next decade.",0.000814404,-0.010173314,-0.03861926,-0.02896388,-0.015487412,0.051864505,-0.010857476,0.04175973,0.030727187,0.028923636,0.059356164,-0.02370155,-0.055869035,0.008554213,0.048470266,-0.05960778,-0.055905066,0.05159969,-0.014688758,0.005693763,-0.034412764,0.052844487,-0.032617807,0.050141167,0.04932472,0.015786955,-0.002103798,0.045548122,-0.059230722,0.039557204,0.038924687,0.038105737,-0.045833472,-0.051868755,0.047513325,0.049661677,-0.022454394,0.047989525,-0.054746754,0.021591006,0.05428962,-0.058961004,0.024365863,-0.051024217,0.0591695,-0.051517673,-0.034107655,-0.059524745,0.044897467,-0.020737216,-0.05452336,0.05238216,-0.04604866,-0.03436852,-0.033929773,0.05347935,-0.05855155,0.05947969,0.0589813,-0.056171194,0.016622387,-0.054919675,0.059473924,0.043929845,-0.014473448,-0.059350435,0.05643446,-0.04483714,0.051259127,-0.008637639,-0.0094151,0.02901998,0.041947424,-0.01832249,-0.051931698,0.009285487,0.056687348,0.048165157,0.0380369,0.0509421,-0.058549434,0.059662163,-0.035759117,-0.023207657,0.008540205,0.048127774,-0.003954532,-0.046853215,-0.05280518,0.05486126,0.022382692,-0.053163618,-0.013769624,0.015312838,0.023387816,0.056800384,0.02147961,0.057080925,0.05967567,-0.026262311,-0.038975462,0.029932419,-0.04458396,-0.04295711,-0.056727488,0.04532201,-0.046559025,-0.05766722,0.024421578,0.056988284,-0.05920742,0.028929688,-0.050386384,0.050331168,0.045576,0.011659498,-0.059328597,0.004318384,-0.05940801,-0.039289728,-0.059566937,0.054784924,0.057069432,0.006127322,0.021724299,0.055515084,0.038518816,0.019122234,0.030254854,-0.001244449,0.03968196,0.059676852,0.05150367,0.003212893,0.04995331,-0.057404052,-0.018245384,-0.05015223,-0.028722998,0.02123173,0.007604427,0.059658132,-0.04926437,-0.05194575,-0.048544485,-0.058954816,0.027843256,-0.05722899,0.032636676,0.04326865,-0.023793794,-0.059619132,-0.03882518,-0.0412237,0.059677046,-0.0244755,-0.028614359,0.05443991,0.05376055,0.057169344,0.02301179,0.04387808,0.014518326,0.04753966,-0.005821374,0.05007891,-0.05083502,-0.01678202,0.049305953,-0.055805657,-0.000732437,0.05305898,0.006739079,-0.04078759,0.055189375,-0.03723182,-0.02484338,0.001996356,0.05509166,-0.05672727,-0.004670152,-0.012529639,-0.05076354,-0.04495077,0.059493467,-0.000686668,-0.05909202,0.057142824,0.051128685,-0.016723808,0.04979809,0.00122616,0.041530844,0.053856973,0.059540354,-0.04720125,0.029871264,-0.058199722,-0.031169109,-0.05258555,-0.034923498,-0.035390485,-0.01667431,-0.04778471,0.028777407,0.05886381,0.002486133,0.059157338,-0.012139223,0.05292095,-0.022972075,0.057222225,0.05546083,0.035588633,-0.055871006,-0.037458055,-0.010391583,0.008793821,-0.054545637,0.055219553,0.000877726,-0.05881669,0.032089636,0.02696906,-0.027441164,-0.047070425,-0.056116007,-0.052844536,-0.020113934,0.05757139,-0.057353422,0.058508486,-0.05685856,-0.05967627,0.059568703,0.0482704,0.054742046,-0.058325585,-0.024792368,0.0551471,-0.039568715,-0.014752897,-0.057181854,0.047848385,0.05830321,-0.05606367,0.009017766,0.058210876,0.055281762,0.014023484,-0.059642717,-0.024776116,0.04648993,-0.035472147,0.05936193,0.011197836,-0.051169366,0.059677046,-0.053030215,-0.018694006,0.057942457,-0.03305341,-0.016673382,0.057462815,0.052928276,0.059577104,-0.05806513,-0.05604812,0.049914606,0.009297501,0.055201456,0.049477797,0.031069292,0.0592862,0.016433323,-0.028247848,-0.0369765,0.054646038,0.059662458,-0.014478936,-0.020502077,-0.000393295,-0.05684676,0.05922993,-0.055381056,0.017919607,0.003247331,0.033999544,-0.056461923,-0.052542225,0.05961979,-0.053019524,0.058887433,0.032085903,0.044377606,-0.051943492,0.026197592,-0.025307834,-0.059147637,0.018061073,-0.035802696,0.0595697,0.051560156,0.05922084,-0.027904669,-0.023464954,-0.015965985,-0.044862214,-0.021310287,-0.05006684,0.056302197,-0.055030107,-0.003869407,-0.057981372,0.047388364,0.058538727,-0.035188645,0.033725157,0.05787311,-0.008778863,-0.014490845,0.057054278,-0.03141707,-0.057560243,0.025270771,-0.053144082,-0.057975177,-0.050223704,0.057912458,-0.05758644,0.05305612,0.019552225,-0.0427821,0.056259677,0.02814067,-0.02961517,0.051910944,-0.021339696,0.057743777,-0.05871256,-0.039226122,-0.057651352,0.056362383,0.023039341,-0.059677042,-0.059604146,0.008048217,0.038647253,-0.010986939,-0.055453595,0.03597367,0.051259816,-0.05642541,-0.02327262,-0.008336269,-0.04667281,-0.059676796,-0.05622238,-0.053641587,0.046551112,0.048304334,-0.055860773,-0.05851642,0.03895463,-0.001611098,0.029913884,0.05967319,0.019266494,0.037231896,0.012369796,-0.005144815,-0.05394104,0.007010907,-0.05967705,0.03635733,0.041089877,0.054327503,-0.01316623,0.042612046,-0.04958583,-0.05967699,0.037926156,0.030149145,-0.040254172,0.03387514,-0.020000529,-0.016518231,-0.038015004,0.058053177,0.036267456,0.05196656,0.054637402,0.04419057,-0.05625899,0.001294115,0.052017596,0.051944345,-0.048963,0.05176279,0.022444839,0.009760364,-0.054523848,-0.03224282,-0.015066894,-0.01735005,-0.055624835,-0.047601987,-0.0181192,0.038566846,0.056045897,0.04324167,-0.

Postexposure protection of non-human primates against a lethal Ebola virus challenge with RNA interference: a proof-of-concept study,"Summary Background We previously showed that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV) RNA polymerase L protein formulated in stable nucleic acid-lipid particles (SNALPs) completely protected guineapigs when administered shortly after a lethal ZEBOV challenge. Although rodent models of ZEBOV infection are useful for screening prospective countermeasures, they are frequently not useful for prediction of efficacy in the more stringent non-human primate models. We therefore assessed the efficacy of modified non-immunostimulatory siRNAs in a uniformly lethal non-human primate model of ZEBOV haemorrhagic fever. Methods A combination of modified siRNAs targeting the ZEBOV L polymerase (EK-1 mod), viral protein (VP) 24 (VP24-1160 mod), and VP35 (VP35-855 mod) were formulated in SNALPs. A group of macaques (n=3) was given these pooled anti-ZEBOV siRNAs (2 mg/kg per dose, bolus intravenous infusion) after 30 min, and on days 1, 3, and 5 after challenge with ZEBOV. A second group of macaques (n=4) was given the pooled anti-ZEBOV siRNAs after 30 min, and on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 after challenge with ZEBOV. Findings Two (66%) of three rhesus monkeys given four postexposure treatments of the pooled anti-ZEBOV siRNAs were protected from lethal ZEBOV infection, whereas all macaques given seven postexposure treatments were protected. The treatment regimen in the second study was well tolerated with minor changes in liver enzymes that might have been related to viral infection. Interpretation This complete postexposure protection against ZEBOV in non-human primates provides a model for the treatment of ZEBOV-induced haemorrhagic fever. These data show the potential of RNA interference as an effective postexposure treatment strategy for people infected with Ebola virus, and suggest that this strategy might also be useful for treatment of other emerging viral infections.

"New methodologies for the pathologic diagnosis of placental infections-immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, in situ nucleic acid hybridization and polymerase chain reaction A review","Summary A variety of highly sensitive laboratory techniques is now available for the detection and localization of infectious agents in the placenta. This communication discusses, the role of immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, in situ nucleic acid hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction for infectious disease diagnosis in formalinfixed placental tissues. These techniques, as well as other sophisticated molecular methods currently in development, will greatly facilitate characterizing the role of infectious agents in a variety of perinatal and pediatric conditions, including birth defects, intrauterine growth retardation, and

"Natural bovine lentiviral type 1 infection in Holstein dairy cattle. I. Clinical, serological, and pathological observations","Abstract Clinical, serological, and pathological abnormalities observed in Holstein cows naturally infected with bovine lentivirus 1 bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) and other infections were progressive and most commonly associated with weight loss, lymphoid system deficiency, and behavioral changes. Clinical evidence of meningoencephalitis was dullness, stupor, and occasional head or nose pressing postures. The polymerase chain reactions associated the BIV provirus with the lesions in the central nervous system and lymphoid tissues. Multiple concurrent infections developed in retrovirally infected cows undergoing normal stresses associated with parturition and lactation. A major functional correlate of the lymphoreticular alterations was the development of multiple secondary infections which failed to resolve after appropriate antibacterial therapy.

Antibody and cytokine responses in kittens during the development of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP),"Abstract Two recombinant FIPV spike proteins were assessed for their immunogenic properties in 8-week-old kittens, which were then challenged intranasally with FIPV 79-1146. Humoral responses were assessed by ELISA and serum neutralisation test. Changes in PBMC cytokine mRNA levels were detected by a reverse transcription, semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-sqPCR), assessing IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IFNγ. All of the kittens developed clinical signs typical of FIP, which were confirmed on gross post mortem examination. The recombinant proteins induced little or no specific antibody response prior to challenge, and failed to alter the course of disease compared to controls. One week after virus challenge, the stimulated PBMCs showed small increases in the expression of IL-6 and IFNγ mRNA, which correlated with a transient pyrexia. After this time expression of IL-6 mRNA remained unaltered but, as FIP developed, mRNA levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and IFNγ became markedly depressed.",-0.049460433,-0.03463145,-0.019047001,-0.05916737,-0.000661464,0.059170544,-0.03277502,-0.056695156,-0.012095378,0.060459673,0.06497324,0.055261068,-0.02175441,0.044503372,0.038472794,-0.06421619,-0.06421829,-0.001866835,0.055150546,0.010799487,-0.044344805,0.029168496,-0.060245022,0.056046125,0.046497826,0.059392203,-0.00684518,0.016441837,-0.053744417,0.039602026,0.02072699,0.06463584,0.014313128,-0.031296253,-0.054231945,0.004242779,-0.04906896,-0.016368654,-0.025266338,-0.006447559,-0.002005452,0.01649247,0.001130465,-0.059684705,-0.05793978,0.005110965,-0.010566992,0.034598246,0.02731167,0.037977014,0.057553366,-0.008840197,-0.06479107,-0.05681884,0.014985868,0.004634392,-0.044877995,0.02687766,0.06403349,-0.06482759,-0.047298875,-0.001707033,0.039469652,-0.028233876,0.025675375,-0.06445756,0.06057079,0.043279164,0.05907698,0.018129487,0.04245424,0.011755201,0.04124614,0.06218067,-0.054998774,0.039969932,-0.005018634,0.04747112,-0.05904791,0.005752339,-0.06461202,0.06450025,-0.02402125,0.04480515,-0.004482161,0.06446198,0.02679236,0.053908434,-0.05132138,-0.03299353,0.036027215,0.005184494,-0.053712428,-0.043596677,0.05749908,0.05897246,0.02365632,0.05791024,0.06431256,-0.035508968,-0.061574325,0.017667053,0.003752078,0.044759896,0.04202894,-0.043752413,0.034962755,0.021730196,-0.05932653,-0.029740058,-0.04872139,-0.036402,-0.001070287,-0.029904902,0.058403675,-0.040778358,-0.06402632,-0.011707181,-0.016351579,0.041574493,-0.026357964,0.048724722,0.03411387,0.021868285,0.03629005,0.05822145,0.019070186,-0.031987377,-0.018931719,0.05928633,-0.028672162,0.06497484,0.06319571,-0.04897444,-0.004430668,-0.06285244,-0.00611132,-0.04194076,-0.01317878,-0.015263689,0.035325415,0.06497307,-0.061543096,-0.04064542,-0.053582113,-0.041918147,-0.003626488,-0.06017314,-0.016663332,0.05980443,0.061257683,-0.03402668,-0.056170374,-0.029568186,0.06496888,-0.009299188,-0.027496697,0.04929656,-0.043148268,-0.04721297,0.023572043,-0.021641718,-0.04241149,0.047413327,0.030524716,-0.05145565,-0.06219101,-0.050042693,-0.014307651,-0.049313266,0.00345804,-0.056917056,-0.04824803,0.015682282,-0.018448316,-0.04750782,0.01759486,-0.059166055,0.06167683,-0.03205521,-0.03738806,-0.025521906,-0.023817394,-0.036733806,0.063943975,-0.037127323,-0.045942537,0.04605817,0.054689884,0.030053917,0.064654104,-0.059337035,0.036820956,0.030907774,0.06460538,-0.03222837,0.034649856,-0.033780552,0.025626317,-0.009763175,-0.04903663,0.060760632,0.012321605,-0.012756909,0.0515746,-0.00366703,-0.013322631,0.064931415,0.004004397,0.057217907,0.003547119,0.06491538,-0.025886444,0.054618612,-0.06480493,-0.047649812,0.056696378,0.050448086,0.003902243,0.053867035,-0.05395126,-0.051637895,-0.04326803,-0.02463453,-0.005339583,-0.037870716,-0.048006576,-0.062438592,0.01435512,0.043980956,-0.001943491,0.061124705,-0.042449005,-0.06496959,0.06346082,0.024468573,0.049753416,-0.060828414,-0.061376892,0.054393567,0.04911435,0.023330785,0.013465281,-0.025970208,0.002909568,-0.03757669,-0.032437317,-0.013643043,0.06266855,-0.062393084,-0.04668756,0.036345422,-0.00383198,-0.028101172,0.063980855,-0.02560508,-0.054274328,0.06497525,-0.020426137,0.038876172,0.04234853,0.017365953,-0.05103692,0.059007064,-0.029477935,-0.04531241,-0.060377475,0.032841302,-0.05734336,-0.013209004,-0.001733477,0.06452638,0.025383316,-0.04256237,-0.047889028,-0.06410169,-0.056482367,-0.011582144,0.06362389,-0.050833393,-0.06278944,-0.045700878,-0.003600506,0.05344133,0.017357858,-0.022984404,0.013363007,0.06495407,-0.00345891,0.048835076,0.0646355,-0.046135,0.06322512,-0.0588932,-0.04138541,-0.04658104,-0.043021787,-0.03211613,-0.06431929,0.0427207,0.047574762,0.057163898,0.038075525,-0.004411805,-0.053021472,0.058858525,-0.038551964,-0.050027266,0.063570686,-0.042876814,0.017882561,-0.040409155,0.025647104,-0.059636537,0.044108342,0.05636271,-0.06277482,0.01862847,0.060030594,0.014526795,-0.05507465,-0.002279456,0.063238055,-0.06294094,-0.044207353,-0.04370964,-0.061789192,-0.050278764,-0.05499012,-0.06427646,0.060185067,-0.029207313,0.024176586,0.06287577,0.054674517,-0.04402045,0.055995803,0.000993392,-0.036245197,0.002080841,0.009481562,-0.027668286,0.062291086,0.053224698,-0.06492077,-0.061334047,-0.05189822,0.043587558,-0.000215691,-0.062133797,0.007434042,0.062495437,-0.059383947,0.04229753,0.049901843,0.003950092,-0.06495374,-0.05325041,-0.049500376,-0.0648123,0.031027863,-0.05935302,-0.06088167,-0.057256848,0.05331033,-0.034073424,0.06441881,0.03380279,0.018570237,0.05268149,0.005932713,-0.0522225,-0.046892364,-0.064768456,0.061847016,0.041762937,-0.004370466,-0.027398102,-0.000121154,-0.052248772,-0.05407719,0.024044564,-0.012939544,0.035437003,0.03223885,-0.058962055,-0.05647643,-0.044917025,0.04379179,0.052645847,0.016700877,0.018177634,0.050826207,-0.06365459,-0.03517796,0.014602444,0.038895167,-0.06421488,0.025941186,-0.06494217,0.06438059,-0.021365507,-0.022878027,0.04313339,0.015489074,-0.044708297,-0.054650486,-0.028271079,0.03810989,0.05478986,-0.03881019

Quantitative real-time PCR for the measurement of feline cytokine mRNA,"Abstract We have developed real-time PCR systems to quantitate feline cytokine gene expression. The method is based on the cleavage of fluorescent dye-labelled probes by the 5′–3′ exonuclease activity of the Taq DNA polymerase during PCR and measurement of fluorescence intensity by a Sequence Detection System. The feline-specific TaqMan probes were designed to encompass an intron, thus allowing differentiation of complementary DNA versus genomic DNA amplification products. Quantitative analysis of cytokine cDNA concentrations was performed in comparison to feline GAPDH. Messenger RNA (mRNA) from the universally expressed housekeeping gene GAPDH proved to be useful as an amplification control and allowed for correction of variations in the efficiencies of RNA extraction and reverse transcription. GAPDH mRNAs were readily detectable in cDNAs prepared from unstimulated feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and from frozen cell pellets, while cytokines (Interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-12 p35, IL-12 p40, IFNγ, IL-16) were expressed at variable amounts. IFNγ transcription was found to be upregulated in stimulated PBMCs and feline cell lines. The synthesis of cDNA and the performance of the PCR in separate tubes proved to be of superior sensitivity compared to a single-tube based system. The assays described are highly reproducible, require no post-PCR manipulation of the amplicons and permit the analysis of several hundred PCR reactions per day. With this method it is possible to detect and quantify cytokine mRNA expression reliably in small amounts of cells even after storage of samples for at least 5 years.",-0.03564137,0.002821007,-0.002162284,-0.026483102,0.034819618,0.035154328,-0.029625086,-0.018205887,0.04085779,0.04052812,0.060933217,-0.019258272,0.040893294,0.049859587,0.017886806,-0.060818277,-0.03370113,0.05596916,0.036815096,0.05134074,-0.057257377,-0.023173545,-0.052519176,0.036604993,-0.046091426,0.059275635,0.02451407,0.028301314,-0.028760146,0.039276447,0.060455948,0.04410446,-0.04839329,-0.016956408,0.017988048,0.032483693,-0.06074554,-0.030033346,-0.058600962,-0.052643027,0.058949325,0.014560586,-0.027069874,-0.050311036,0.001160748,-0.028025027,-0.058895547,-0.010573433,0.038305905,-0.022309411,-0.03522712,-0.004983389,-0.060693417,-0.05923555,-0.060430232,0.060751047,-0.05743805,0.047325,0.057775274,-0.045215413,0.02777839,0.002361703,0.04539582,-0.011255673,0.05107667,-0.06031046,0.04942579,0.037343908,0.057351932,-0.050822318,0.0488014,0.044673324,0.056173615,0.04500476,-0.033006757,0.018017383,0.060454108,-0.03824252,-0.060165957,0.03956611,-0.059451003,0.060886048,0.003971864,-0.010422288,-0.017525692,0.060755745,-0.010164387,-0.042920485,-0.007745698,0.038951077,0.04014871,-0.019922648,-0.059228066,0.05051087,0.030161701,0.026001634,-0.00183405,0.059569303,0.060939025,-0.044333078,-0.037263464,0.04590962,-0.02245291,0.020672828,-0.026568247,0.048723195,0.015045177,0.006410786,-0.014714455,0.03291426,-0.040274017,0.057612877,0.04373024,0.023974204,0.038051467,-0.016445365,-0.06057645,-0.020703357,-0.000143059,0.03701629,-0.05629809,0.059829164,0.05325969,-0.058351956,0.00887419,0.058467608,0.008139998,-0.050108563,0.009892488,0.05980348,-0.037685044,0.060855404,0.054082923,-0.011544632,-0.054461353,-0.05376682,0.034903046,0.013884042,-0.010546128,0.0105131,0.0289029,0.06094439,-0.05697019,-0.047583103,-0.054766867,-0.020145088,0.021475146,-0.06093153,0.057672653,0.057322964,0.052408874,-0.048738576,-0.050401784,-0.054740716,0.060947333,0.007857122,0.008698077,0.022702552,0.037346978,0.040589686,0.054270014,-0.028178774,-0.04983382,0.038745522,-0.003665708,-0.046458714,-0.06048755,0.015671685,-0.052212425,-0.009249934,-0.058707777,0.060252085,-0.048901796,-0.018965272,-0.005337499,-0.026786795,0.031598218,-0.00948856,0.058013428,0.003236461,-0.052257746,-0.037396815,0.039464623,0.036837704,0.060836118,-0.03390685,-0.05527783,0.05563435,0.051585447,0.0001574,0.060845897,-0.00751107,0.014234531,0.011742672,0.06037785,-0.052507985,-0.04255723,-0.052704155,0.028311692,-0.05710136,-0.045389332,0.05355298,0.020926977,0.048634976,0.04236666,0.023829503,0.04401324,0.06015478,-0.020308359,0.05856778,0.04019999,0.06079711,0.021786626,0.05000007,-0.05508658,-0.052394453,0.052934833,0.056756824,-0.04898666,-0.0177131,0.011998644,-0.058294393,-0.048608225,0.022973608,-0.036327906,-0.000688349,-0.06059479,-0.05843402,0.010007251,-0.004793447,-0.022284312,0.059898425,-0.05175047,-0.060936462,0.06044294,0.047112316,0.056938767,-0.053417284,-0.05438439,0.060412098,0.004437356,-0.053157844,-0.03331393,-0.045428775,0.06069852,-0.053983856,-0.053623185,0.011399683,-0.028067164,-0.05808091,-0.060892608,-0.024942743,0.02279612,0.019033663,0.05950474,-0.05241549,-0.041916285,0.060947895,0.007934317,-0.029978538,0.04074438,0.027659182,-0.058744557,0.05659975,0.021451816,-0.01596917,-0.054263193,-0.04442208,-0.04936961,0.052829873,0.037363194,0.057013746,-0.017998535,-0.002742446,-0.021607162,-0.058998402,-0.008259763,-0.051183756,0.060629208,-0.017151162,-0.060903873,-0.052427154,-0.05725867,0.05903981,-0.05839508,-0.001801348,-0.024292286,0.060850713,-0.05407587,-0.05677442,0.06094445,0.013650191,0.05271165,-0.06011665,0.013713562,-0.032841202,-0.06077939,0.04128493,-0.060926866,0.0584407,-0.049584247,0.060765393,0.058632575,0.047780246,-0.060220055,0.019441701,-0.011962646,-0.05919331,0.056220952,-0.02747138,0.054926615,-0.025301088,0.046736173,-0.060535617,0.05899464,0.055942535,-0.053711332,-0.024634195,0.044577345,0.002195246,-0.058433194,0.05171983,-0.0454485,-0.058946867,-0.029182805,-0.03891011,-0.037774395,-0.0601745,-0.0605581,-0.054839864,0.052970827,-0.003399245,0.059259284,0.060805455,0.040695444,0.051790442,0.060023777,0.011033604,0.00853021,-0.027477557,-0.037103444,0.04334181,0.05459489,0.057293173,-0.060947582,-0.060935836,0.04181556,0.052186817,0.000643984,-0.060823966,-0.012266758,0.0514409,-0.04431398,0.040967416,-0.014816321,0.02772248,-0.06094379,-0.04201263,-0.001506475,-0.048273638,0.014992831,-0.06070972,-0.059921846,-0.044486605,0.047189087,0.015555597,0.060938004,0.052996278,0.04410311,0.049996637,0.041247826,-0.02594482,-0.01731449,-0.060947854,0.05867974,0.058853596,0.03483469,-0.04266072,-0.03271014,-0.059192095,-0.06094428,-0.05306815,-0.031169184,-0.039615966,-0.02811892,-0.060615722,-0.05915632,-0.006466962,0.04710923,0.016237264,0.03773562,0.027159559,0.051367067,-0.041887913,-0.015970767,0.052151687,0.055189643,-0.060852244,0.049586345,-0.059729308,0.056304753,0.037372705,-0.029756512,-0.039004847,0.02426442,-0.05644539,-0.046654124,0.004915485,0.05759502,0.04074473,0.051

Development of an RT-PCR diagnostic test for an avian astrovirus,"Abstract Astroviruses are small round viruses that cause enteric disease in the young of several species. Detection and diagnosis of astrovirus infection in non-human hosts relies heavily on electron microscopy and fluorescent antibody tests. Recently, our laboratory isolated and sequenced an avian astrovirus from poult enteritis mortality syndrome affected turkeys.

A rapid RT-PCR method to differentiate six established genotypes of rabies and rabies-related viruses using TaqMan™ technology,"Abstract A rapid and sensitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay incorporating TaqMan™ probes has been developed that can distinguish among the six established rabies and rabies-related virus genotypes. TaqMan™ probes were designed and validated against 106 rabies and rabies-related virus isolates, one isolate of the Australian bat Lyssaviruses (genotype 7), and 18 other non-rabies viruses important in the veterinary field. The N gene was used as the target for the probes as it is well conserved and has been intensively used to genotype rabies isolates. Additionally, it was found to contain regions specific to each genotype conducive to probe design. The RT-PCR assay described amplifies a portion of the nucleoprotein gene of all 107 rabies and rabies-related viruses, but none of the other viruses tested. Inclusion of TaqMan™-genotype-specific probes in the RT-PCR assay permits rapid identification of the virus present. By combining RT-PCR with TaqMan™ genotyping probes suspect rabies virus isolates can be identified in a single closed tube system that prevents potential PCR-product carry over

Evaluation of the NucliSens® Basic Kit assay for detection of Norwalk virus RNA in stool specimens,"Abstract Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) are a genetically diverse group of human caliciviruses that are the most common cause of epidemic gastroenteritis and are detected typically in stool by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR or electron microscopy (EM). The application of a rapid nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) assay for the detection of NLV RNA in stool is described using the NucliSens® Basic Kit. Primers and probes for the NLV Basic Kit assay were based on the RNA polymerase region of the prototype NLV, Norwalk virus (NV) genome and could consistently detect 104 RT-PCR detectable units of NV RNA in a stool filtrate. When compared directly with RT-PCR on a dilution series of NV stool filtrate, the NucliSens® Basic Kit assay was equally sensitive. Cross-reactivity studies with a representative panel of other enteric pathogens were negative. When applied to 15 stool specimens from NV-challenged volunteers, the NASBA Basic Kit application for NV detection yielded 100% sensitivity, 50% specificity, and 67% concordance, using RT-PCR as the ‘gold standard’. Despite the specificity of the NASBA primer/probe sequences for NV, other representatives from both NLV genogroups I and II could be detected by the Basic Kit assay in outbreak stool specimens, although the results were inconsistent. Our results suggest that the NucliSens® Basic Kit assay provides a rapid and sensitive alternative to RT-PCR for detecting NV RNA in stool specimens. However, improvements in test specificity and primer design will be needed before the assay can be used routinely in the clinical

Rapid diagnosis of avian infectious bronchitis virus by the polymerase chain reaction,"Abstract A simple, sensitive and specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure was developed in order to detect infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) directly in tissue samples. Viral RNA was extracted from allantoic fluids and cell cultures infected experimentally with different strains of IBV and from tissues of naturally infected birds. Viral RNA was then amplified and identified by a nested RT-PCR assay using two sets of primers flanking a well-conserved region of the nucleocapsid gene. The selected IBV nucleocapsid sequence was detected successfully by simple direct electrophoresis of amplified

Comparison of immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies and RT-PCR for the detection of human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 in cell culture,"Abstract Human coronaviruses, with two known serogroups named 229E and OC43, cause up to one third of common colds and may be associated with serious diseases such as nosocomial respiratory infections, enterocolitis, pericarditis and neurological disorders. Reliable methods of detection in clinical samples are needed for a better understanding of their role in pathology. As a first step in the design of such diagnostic procedures, the sensitivities and specificities of two viral diagnostic assays were compared in an experimental cell culture model: an indirect immuno-fluorescence assay using monoclonal antibodies and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification of viral RNA from infected cells. Immunofluorescence detected human coronaviruses in cells infected at a MOI as low as 10−2 (log TCID50/ml=4.25 for HCV-229E and 2.0 for HCV-OC43; log PFU/ml=4.83 for HCV-229E and 1.84 for HCV-OC43) versus 10−3 (HCV-OC43) or 10−4 (HCV-229E) for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification (log TCID50/ml=1.75 for HCV-229E and 1.5 for HCV-OC43; log PFU/ml=2.3 for HCV-229E and 1.34 for HCV-OC43). There were no false positive signals with other human respiratory pathogens: influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus. Moreover, each assay was coronavirus serogroup-specific. These results demonstrate the potential usefulness of immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction RNA amplification for the rapid detection of human coronaviruses in infected cell cultures. Both methods could be applied to clinical specimens for the diagnosis of human infections.",-0.00812331,0.029734707,-0.002112588,-0.0417248,0.0542004,0.04455573,-0.012570446,-0.0518705,-0.006533667,-0.020487566,0.06312337,-0.049190655,0.009559981,-0.01628598,0.056781612,-0.06200092,-0.06312253,-0.056755446,0.04562632,-0.047539614,-0.008633923,-0.022141125,-0.060542945,0.05064795,-0.045757376,0.05624276,-0.033821378,-0.01782558,0.025431383,0.01486225,0.053898703,0.063123345,0.022347076,-0.044579063,0.011017592,0.007443986,-0.06089348,-0.059423972,-0.05864232,-0.04025808,0.043932233,-0.04300604,0.001371561,-0.03578829,0.002760321,-0.001377024,-0.035964448,0.012592571,0.051705927,0.05214015,-0.060355708,-0.007808747,-0.06308241,-0.060771428,-0.059779666,0.019036727,-0.057910204,0.018608116,0.01638443,0.02186581,-0.01917547,0.05806376,0.012891246,-0.003892514,-0.010475739,-0.060779463,0.06016678,0.002817092,0.019816773,-0.05175777,-0.001972849,0.059987396,0.046215136,0.062120195,-0.029270142,-0.03259084,0.05101703,-0.040352024,-0.063115686,0.025089134,-0.027065465,0.062794514,0.056512572,0.008502773,-0.039307665,0.05942937,0.02862352,-0.005205813,-0.027305227,-0.04884736,-0.048799403,-0.05529344,-0.056594167,-0.010079827,0.03469746,0.032129236,0.059204258,0.0628665,0.06289686,-0.059547793,-0.05818725,-0.03338511,-0.024842588,0.051151544,0.041842967,0.023570294,0.037541393,0.018757151,-0.00396593,-0.002687005,-0.03185227,0.036161877,0.060301144,-0.004411917,0.051707707,-0.04737416,-0.008399667,0.035916544,0.029188953,0.028334133,-0.008111811,0.044338368,0.04897858,-0.0550254,0.047990274,0.06211113,-0.047372043,0.022066668,-0.02540157,0.013739863,-0.014806631,0.06312338,0.05785677,-0.038263083,0.0338524,-0.05508988,0.040032405,-0.025594553,-0.03288163,-0.049252026,0.048884567,0.06312278,-0.060357608,-0.015924158,-0.01466817,-0.042027358,0.04070934,-0.0628872,0.053893004,0.00673721,0.05727049,-0.05363109,-0.058467276,-0.055511344,0.06305651,0.001898079,0.06138448,0.054834947,-0.043005068,0.048085295,0.003847158,0.021340437,-0.02153738,0.060244296,-0.015221752,-0.06027972,-0.05644167,0.035447694,-0.06268785,-0.054993987,-0.028749468,-0.06246462,-0.056543168,0.030982627,-0.030835938,-0.026956374,0.04976921,-0.01627721,0.056705028,-0.011944388,-0.04760295,0.049923915,-0.019901417,0.03534866,0.06154751,-0.027565993,-0.057221845,0.034446698,0.036969215,-0.020307882,0.062933624,-0.03751909,0.01318931,-0.018985294,0.06284046,-0.058123063,0.012086446,0.026369313,0.007252033,-0.028849836,-0.05192613,0.04897261,0.037285015,0.03997105,0.057785217,-0.054527227,0.033328097,0.022928283,0.014178664,0.06296918,0.039930772,0.045926925,0.047309924,0.062347755,-0.059573878,-0.023379141,0.002977731,0.050939836,-0.036835756,0.012664541,0.026529292,-0.020433111,0.055250984,-0.016320039,-0.048054937,0.04953188,-0.057191566,-0.059235625,-0.00122256,0.06156679,0.06088899,0.062269855,0.002143315,-0.063020796,0.05933682,0.043760326,0.000389086,-0.056477487,-0.044753123,0.047157228,0.03987181,0.055053886,-0.054238368,-0.060577597,0.027785212,0.016906561,0.001046963,0.05954651,0.05483413,-0.060772423,-0.060617395,0.009517867,-0.028567158,0.03267966,0.05682031,0.03465103,-0.061189946,0.063123345,-0.034109987,-0.05124208,0.047238078,0.043985426,-0.030756347,0.060949363,-0.008269416,-0.041853916,-0.018336533,-0.016146619,-0.037067566,0.055170603,0.026213167,0.06280569,-0.029766291,-0.061365,-0.047205012,-0.06014169,0.010866482,-0.019175328,0.06190055,-0.05752808,-0.06207079,0.013955512,-0.048589487,0.042572178,-0.002731185,-0.005783502,-0.023717944,0.062304206,-0.046241835,0.038301107,0.06305631,0.020687161,0.056836333,-0.062743805,0.036603175,-0.05535281,-0.052567985,-0.037977897,-0.033559375,0.059405047,-0.040732037,0.053102642,0.052812822,0.018966999,-0.0526424,0.028218564,0.034799196,-0.034748845,0.062719196,-0.014973902,-0.032749932,-0.026056709,0.044408903,-0.002026861,0.063054055,0.010000581,-0.009116412,0.012306321,0.05543476,0.005013698,-0.042192515,-0.027943237,0.058861583,-0.060473148,-0.028169498,0.062869444,-0.02106197,-0.016860671,-0.062189415,-0.061911,0.057265367,-0.013208779,0.009554257,0.06299399,0.04238494,0.013639911,0.026550401,0.05659855,-0.006502522,-0.019917883,-0.018055588,-0.037077237,0.061524283,0.05527992,-0.06308122,-0.06310258,0.042771216,0.06223013,-0.042814795,-0.062778935,0.033720102,0.038349804,-0.033147685,0.05753321,0.06108611,-0.009994197,-0.06312057,-0.057306916,-0.058060855,-0.061852977,0.036911108,-0.05763504,-0.061003756,-0.05310299,0.034119498,-0.05823761,0.062340003,0.05810065,0.059579875,0.019656772,0.0496118,0.04463297,-0.05560511,-0.06308334,0.06279701,0.062109686,0.060015537,0.03751996,0.043117248,-0.05152613,-0.06274269,-0.011254569,0.0116608,0.019067923,-0.05706831,-0.060442854,-0.055061456,-0.06276308,0.026287409,-0.00403244,-0.017028049,-0.028242536,0.04439315,-0.009274363,-0.04107887,0.032131784,0.03173313,-0.062483884,0.05753836,-0.055743042,0.052217368,0.011614983,0.038394384,0.054568265,0.007685708,-0.051685147,-0.032881778,-0.00457652,0.06060087,0.016699038,0.02382299

One-tube fluorogenic reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for the quantitation of feline coronaviruses,"Abstract A one-tube reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for absolute feline coronavirus (FCoV) quantitation was developed. The assay is based on the 5′ nuclease activity of the Thermus flavus (Tfl) polymerase and a fluorogenic probe which generates fluorescence when it is cleaved. The fluorogenic probe, also called TaqMan™ probe (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, USA), is an oligonucleotide designed to bind between the two PCR primers to the target cDNA and is labeled with a reporter and a quencher dye. In the intact probe, the quencher dye suppresses the fluorescence of the reporter dye by Förster-type energy transfer. During the polymerase extension steps the Tfl exonuclease activity cleaves the hybridised probe resulting in the generation of fluorescent emission of the reporter dye. The threshold cycle (C T value) indicates the increase of reporter fluorescence and is directly related to the initial amount of target cDNA or RNA, respectively. Fluorescence is monitored in real time after each cycle by a Perkin-Elmer ABI Prism® 7700 Sequence Detector. After completion of amplification, the C T values of the samples are calculated back to a standard curve, generated by amplification of diluted standard molecules. The one-tube RT-PCR described below allows precise quantitation, is highly sensitive, rapid (no separate reverse transcription step and no post-amplification steps), easy to handle, allows for a high sample throughput, shows a very good reproducibility, and can be executed with a low risk of contamination.

Quantitative sense-specific determination of murine coronavirus RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction,"Abstract In many applications, it is useful to know the sense and amount of viral RNAs present in a sample. In theory, sense-specific measurement of viral RNAs may be achieved by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays which utilize primers of defined polarity during the RT step. However, in practice, it has been shown that such assays are prone to artifacts, such as non-specific priming, which drastically diminish their reliability. Using murine coronavirus MHV-4 as a model, we describe and validate several modifications of the RT-PCR procedure which eliminate these artifacts. Key RT-PCR parameters which were optimized include the design of tagged primers, DNase treatment of in vitro transcribed RNA standards, specification of temperature differences between RT and PCR annealing steps, and use of competitive RNA templates for quantitative assays. The assays described may be used to determine the sense and abundance of any viral or host RNA of interest in complex biological

Development of a nested PCR assay for the detection of canine coronavirus,"Abstract A diagnostic test for canine coronavirus (CCV) infection based on a nested polymerase chain reaction (n-PCR) assay was developed and tested using the following coronavirus strains: CCV (USDA strain), CCV (45/93, field strain), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV, field strain), trasmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV, Purdue strain), bovine coronavirus (BCV, 9WBL-77 strain), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, M-41 strain) and fecal samples of dogs with CCV enteritis. A 230-bp segment of the gene encoding for transmembrane protein M of CCV is the target sequence of the primer. The test described in the present study was able to amplify both CCV and TGEV strains and also gave positive results on fecal samples from CCV infected dogs. n-PCR has a sensitivity as high as isolation on cell cultures, and can therefore be used for the diagnosis of CCV infection in dogs.",-0.03992897,-0.005490908,0.014491154,-0.029135365,-0.028047882,0.06015013,-0.002730787,-0.037306264,0.04439174,0.026806938,0.063944004,0.061482135,-0.004985773,0.012735383,0.04474452,-0.045514423,-0.06392445,-0.038275696,0.05936852,-0.03570582,-0.06229718,-0.052825905,-0.06141969,0.06329014,0.060588434,0.060835805,-0.035593342,-0.00314505,-0.031319033,0.03286818,0.02333154,0.06394972,-0.02329283,0.014815073,0.06333785,0.061214637,-0.058021944,-0.007727852,-0.04677168,-0.041893337,0.018915089,-0.028182883,-0.062039897,-0.03488127,-0.06353496,-0.015665488,0.0343405,0.05412681,0.05849651,0.01221452,-0.05645542,0.033872075,-0.06371267,-0.00246023,-0.06312225,0.031541068,-0.036568016,-0.042871572,0.054753296,-0.021353852,0.057992324,0.010882336,-0.038774636,-0.037520494,0.06345266,-0.06186706,0.052570477,-0.038466457,-0.011739849,-0.056458946,0.044518914,0.06126133,0.0249854,0.02353314,-0.030415382,-0.035868477,0.048338436,0.01930535,-0.06393629,-0.00318007,-0.005134599,0.056701202,0.047363225,-0.027906645,-0.044393983,0.05218442,-0.017341495,-0.01680314,-0.015875157,-0.05221328,-0.05568036,0.04823172,-0.054059606,0.04320502,0.05776331,0.057270348,0.051021747,0.051106296,0.05840561,-0.024610963,-0.004005738,-0.053892598,0.043885633,0.050803013,0.007368779,0.000531733,0.06373603,-0.05571725,0.013093261,-0.062269434,-0.01985888,0.036048558,0.033609185,0.049296714,0.059088893,-0.058560606,-0.048778772,-0.024572646,0.054075222,-0.040440828,-0.026795246,0.039649963,0.028014021,-0.045798905,0.015203635,0.055973068,0.021242892,0.050178267,-0.02363566,0.062743954,0.02308958,0.06394972,0.0619309,-0.030503616,0.04419345,-0.053459466,0.02007015,0.062083147,-0.05517129,-0.003020575,-0.019332714,0.06393974,-0.06310239,0.009058865,-0.027373552,-0.026041854,0.00598074,-0.06357808,0.05722603,-0.00467182,0.054494426,-0.054874357,-0.059506297,0.000441758,0.063762575,0.000515133,0.054914627,0.057396576,0.017001688,0.000264355,-0.043503277,0.030138792,-0.051827203,0.049788453,0.044524647,-0.026752427,-0.046376463,-0.00772285,-0.043959163,-0.06323341,0.02463198,-0.06289985,-0.022893822,0.039096706,0.032141265,0.04645833,0.054037306,-0.044797942,0.04842241,0.04800696,0.03771199,0.012600531,0.021474833,-0.033670764,0.06061072,0.00923893,-0.042679533,-0.009396965,0.04444605,-0.02263023,0.063790224,-0.052886516,0.006632579,-0.008508248,0.047902096,-0.05675936,0.04173488,0.002603987,-0.058426082,0.05612444,-0.055546355,0.061897006,0.04367828,0.059223026,0.018461622,-0.061995864,0.021369435,0.055371873,0.06305727,0.06390424,0.052491277,-0.062137175,0.039090984,0.057793006,-0.06287319,-0.009494512,0.06333514,0.06030579,-0.022865258,-0.030715846,0.020041266,0.022980345,0.047501616,0.026189707,0.01001261,0.009607553,-0.04923237,-0.04594266,-0.025219228,0.010703674,0.017577471,0.031313453,0.00744061,-0.0637885,0.039990146,-0.03333037,-0.0174023,-0.05205506,-0.029301232,-0.009244588,0.003993314,-0.006474708,0.024434935,-0.04756882,0.053547498,-0.013634957,-0.058323864,-0.046065897,0.047072418,-0.0638125,-0.019432975,0.05840173,0.010819348,0.021752462,0.054857757,-0.049983583,-0.063291736,0.063949205,0.04247758,0.013071142,0.044613294,0.05543801,-0.039283846,0.052437954,0.015610077,0.001107661,-0.012028601,-0.051948536,-0.055933215,-0.030810762,0.027112348,0.06318019,-0.011186861,-0.061473366,0.003043308,-0.05105874,0.049820215,0.021690402,0.060221296,-0.045892473,-0.03344029,-0.019720979,-0.013396578,-0.01695432,-0.026906429,0.007920525,-0.061615136,0.06377151,-0.010172017,0.038655266,0.06344775,0.030723823,0.062411208,-0.039281324,-0.026647585,-0.062339183,-0.01847898,-0.043347146,-0.06304072,0.045457862,-0.03780659,0.058627427,0.062231112,0.01959759,-0.061712526,0.05015154,0.032862805,0.008567028,0.045603342,0.027651088,-0.038011417,0.034542676,0.022000201,0.009368412,0.06220391,-0.002052051,0.049853947,-0.016857224,-0.056737203,-0.050130986,-0.06301808,-0.052891966,0.052275915,-0.045692354,-0.026965104,0.0623915,-0.018680923,-0.059575994,0.002477231,-0.06375793,-0.008086408,0.027244994,0.051066082,0.05070963,-0.015022943,0.05352633,0.04315479,-0.042434037,0.044693142,-0.013212883,0.021874236,-0.056906424,0.05804772,-0.003508788,-0.063460484,-0.06394703,0.013079942,0.022648023,-0.048223928,-0.060748473,-0.039267983,0.011911785,0.04332152,0.042293567,0.04898386,-0.04768257,-0.06387142,-0.05233745,0.032352854,-0.06333182,-0.019133324,-0.061195042,-0.062280294,0.03142032,0.040087085,-0.046507902,0.06356208,-0.051848795,0.06253741,-0.006886606,-0.00347145,0.03834447,0.045721363,-0.06362779,0.055363998,0.049526513,0.036317628,0.041369736,-0.061520126,-0.04947206,-0.038811766,0.03404795,-0.020022979,0.031885978,-0.05227058,-0.060060646,-0.0583288,-0.06381419,-0.03703678,-0.039259262,-0.045216914,-0.051541395,0.05615601,-0.010281464,0.059548285,0.020386403,-0.03353895,-0.060404547,0.034497447,-0.024243522,0.051332574,-0.043582387,-0.000285937,0.026094334,0.038796674,-0.037014816,-0.032972425,0.005499884,0.062268537,0.025824126,0.022120824,-0

Diagnosis of canine coronavirus infection using nested-PCR,"Abstract The results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nested polymerase chain reaction (n-PCR) assays for the diagnosis of canine coronavirus (CCV) infection, and the comparison with other diagnostic techniques, such as electron microscopy (EM) and virus isolation using A-72 cell line are reported. The study was carried out on 71 faecal samples of pups with enteritis. Of 71 samples examined 14 were positive in PCR, whereas 30 samples resulted positive in the n-PCR assay. CCV was detected by EM examination in only four out of 45 samples, and by virus isolation in three out of 30 samples n-PCR

Similarity relations of DNA and RNA polymerases investigated by the principal component analysis of amino acid sequences,"Abstract The principal component analysis based on the physicochemical properties of amino acid residues is applied to DNA and RNA polymerases to assign the sequence motifs for the polymerization activities of these proteins. After the reconfirmation of the sequence motifs of families A and B of DNA polymerases indicated previously, it elucidates the sequence motifs for the polymerization activity of DNA polymerase III (family C) by the similarity to the polymerization center of multimeric DNA dependent RNA polymerases. This identification proceeds to clarify the sequence motifs for polymerization activities of primases; eukaryotic and archaebacterial primases carry motifs similar to those of family C, while the motifs of eubacterial primase fall into the category of the motifs in family B DNA polymerases such as α, δ, ϵ and II. This finding means that DNA dependent RNA polymerases are also divided into groups corresponding to three families, A, B and C, because the monomeric DNA dependent RNA polymerases in phages are reconfirmed to carry sequence motifs similar to those of family A DNA polymerases. Furthermore, the three families of polymerization motifs are found to fall within the variation range of polymerization motifs displayed by many RNA dependent RNA polymerases, suggesting a close evolutionary relation between them. The sequence motifs for polymerization activities of reverse transcriptase and telomerase seem to be the intermediate between family A DNA polymerase and some RNA dependent RNA polymerases, e.g., from Leviviridae.

A recombinant Fab neutralizes dengue virus in vitro,"Abstract A recombinant Fab that recognizes a neutralizing epitope located in the (296–400) region of protein E of dengue virus was obtained from cloned hybridoma cells secreting the mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4E11. The Fd and light chain antibody genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, cloned into the phagemid vector pMad, expressed in bacteria to produce Fab fragments and sequenced. The mAb 4E11, in particular its light chain complementary-determining regions, shared homologies with two other anti-viral mAbs. The affinity of the parental mAb and the cloned Fab to the MalE-E(296–400) fusion protein were shown to be of the same magnitude, i.e. nanomolar. Fab 4E11 neutralization capacity was found between 8 and 4-times or less lower than that of mAb 4E11, depending on serotypes, thus the Fab could have a smaller antiviral activity than the mAb in vitro.",-0.035767637,0.026214963,0.011125203,-0.061785985,0.051826023,0.048174832,-0.020046782,-0.016398024,0.035330318,0.048788898,0.06736273,-0.06548138,-0.052211657,0.014891035,0.031761248,-0.061851848,-0.05831084,-0.057963904,0.037691556,-0.014020902,-0.03309366,-0.0402558,-0.032223873,0.061679393,0.06142839,0.037375882,-0.000443111,0.049958304,0.02556117,0.048864663,0.027852867,0.06730053,-0.01337745,-0.011012237,0.063217334,0.01699484,-0.036516163,0.030281529,-0.048131272,-0.006856224,0.010348432,-0.022514496,0.008441396,-0.021941043,0.035498396,-0.06220657,-0.04534158,-0.034150086,0.06443109,-0.02921641,-0.003296183,-0.001385025,-0.060580276,-0.063653484,-0.001858951,0.010928281,-0.0658205,-0.06577671,-0.004028736,-0.02874259,-0.03036237,0.025229601,-0.018808177,0.025970992,-0.04695452,-0.04798718,0.055806153,0.038992893,0.061404653,-0.06309265,0.031728018,0.04613041,-0.010000061,0.013960728,0.032131463,-0.015892472,0.028280776,0.039194193,-0.0669031,0.021357374,-0.026102256,0.065362945,-0.024795746,-0.03314822,0.039835803,0.067192584,0.006359396,0.06665092,-0.04120497,0.054805502,-0.023881808,-0.053484853,-0.054223232,-0.03273181,0.029770961,0.05112431,0.06319057,-0.002993896,0.06659017,-0.004327711,-0.006244747,-0.011460396,0.03473322,0.03813082,-0.0310934,0.04044949,0.040870782,-0.007871799,-0.016655443,-0.038747855,-0.056861915,0.06517747,0.055249296,0.06392377,0.062337574,-0.012788964,-0.06600299,0.03635062,-0.03169233,-0.06384408,-0.03778913,0.06481243,0.040202133,-0.048171166,0.035758577,0.052561857,-0.042442683,-0.023379145,0.018459613,0.034992784,0.030161142,0.06741217,0.057657517,0.011383366,0.04305966,-0.032823395,-0.004955006,0.060730275,-0.03408837,0.021872273,0.028685285,0.06753881,-0.045554966,-0.02940128,-0.061749104,-0.043721706,0.011541921,-0.0667476,0.049339507,0.029942961,-0.01800274,-0.06288061,-0.05659418,0.000384377,0.06745674,0.048398923,0.06574317,0.055001672,0.061874934,0.044566594,-0.026174711,-0.006026716,-0.05181448,0.060784366,0.00548864,0.039888553,-0.04929668,-0.0388928,-0.040082883,-0.034423884,-0.04552636,0.043114908,-0.052817486,0.053814325,-0.04217667,-0.012198905,0.025736067,-0.033472307,0.065152474,-0.011095828,-0.005339277,0.001208629,-0.042402834,0.05284039,0.03035254,-0.054291364,-0.0432269,0.059588976,0.05193585,-0.03309297,0.06543599,-0.050178673,-0.025267733,-0.015511795,0.06728658,-0.001378789,0.049474344,-0.009691283,0.06369198,-0.01686082,-0.062906235,0.021535885,0.04904474,0.052181087,0.025823608,-0.034631148,-0.038583845,0.054055024,-0.0331747,0.061618652,0.02601753,0.035169918,0.05806546,0.06160165,-0.066667885,-0.033682365,0.018231235,0.023414258,-0.018121902,-0.021683395,0.019638525,-0.051503897,0.057404734,-0.045067392,0.035421893,-0.003163856,-0.05117549,-0.034368396,-0.037825283,-0.007766505,-0.015469106,0.062306542,0.009275098,-0.06693045,0.056652,0.04696397,0.05273355,-0.057551067,-0.0244439,0.060270704,0.051170956,0.05851368,-0.06611082,0.038475987,0.04910359,-0.02216734,-0.034293443,0.055581592,-0.021883996,-0.0530383,-0.06738106,0.06010874,-0.055943612,0.06224447,0.051494334,0.035113234,-0.06011552,0.067544155,-0.044387773,-0.020927487,-0.007767967,0.05642127,-0.020227192,0.038793862,-0.013955442,0.06033635,0.058980547,-0.01155821,0.04351485,-0.025479896,0.061617076,0.066875055,0.026028594,-0.018370468,-0.045858752,-0.058181934,0.066336714,0.05025126,0.055591494,-0.0650814,0.045753602,-0.01586576,-0.053498738,-0.015938569,-0.059231006,-0.027339775,-0.062394265,0.06443098,-0.067401856,0.013493802,0.06680767,-0.017113091,0.029631937,-0.039627105,-0.030468974,-0.04914897,-0.05980528,0.058542334,-0.063868314,0.04104418,-0.030117039,0.050284624,0.055057492,0.014335565,0.004356139,-0.042041015,-0.011073503,-0.002866404,0.03198895,0.046685282,0.05996074,-0.053575344,0.06621423,-0.020016333,0.05463923,0.05687078,-0.011798275,-0.065410785,0.005818585,-0.05804877,-0.022782054,-0.036095314,0.038488492,-0.048488043,-0.011134045,0.057880223,-0.05551487,0.053387426,-0.04885453,-0.051595885,0.057103824,-0.025759835,0.04614077,0.065548435,0.01675779,0.050954297,0.05868575,-0.024552273,0.031045005,-0.049408615,0.03614985,-0.04728037,0.057485357,0.036513485,-0.06746635,-0.06744631,-0.060283832,0.030931804,-0.037844673,-0.02752593,0.03331622,0.04566648,0.002422005,0.026359726,0.04572618,-0.027175616,-0.067127116,0.05796307,-0.030791936,-0.06290408,0.0365127,-0.013565888,-0.033345006,0.015265845,0.061050624,0.001845929,0.06717454,-0.037939794,0.05721027,0.066618145,0.023589581,0.045575686,-0.05518931,-0.06754056,0.06725362,0.0506161,0.06262756,0.011215714,0.011067925,-0.041503105,-0.06673468,-0.06584383,0.016612243,0.013435108,0.030070418,-0.04777649,-0.052374188,-0.06581408,0.029787982,0.019454112,-0.028742567,-0.058420323,0.05993918,0.02710948,0.015061604,0.022098713,0.056289524,-0.014245436,0.043616626,-0.065770864,0.043888554,0.026845688,-0.04950302,0.033502124,-0.031960826,-0.050564166,0.009332743,0.044186454,0.0597772,-0.0313642,-0.029184971,-0.021265084,

Molecular confirmation of an adenovirus in brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula),"Abstract Partial genome characterisation of a non-cultivable marsupial adenovirus is described. Adenovirus-like particles were found by electron microscopy (EM) in the intestinal contents of brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) in New Zealand. Using degenerate PCR primers complementary to the most conserved genome regions of adenoviruses, the complete nucleotide sequence of the penton base gene, and partial nucleotide sequences of the DNA polymerase, hexon, and pVII genes were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis of the penton base gene strongly suggested that the brushtail possum adenovirus (candidate PoAdV-1) belongs to the recently proposed genus Atadenovirus.

Identification of the polymerase polyprotein products p72 and p65 of the murine coronavirus MHV-JHM,"Abstract The RNA polymerase gene of murine coronavirus MHV-JHM encodes a polyprotein of greater than 750 kDa. This polyprotein is proposed to be processed by two papain-like cysteine proteinases, PCP-1 and PCP-2, and a poliovirus 3C-like proteinase domain, 3C-pro, to generate protein products. The amino-terminal product of the MHV polymerase polyprotein, p28, is generated by cleavage of the polyprotein by PCP-1. To identify the viral products downstream of p28, we generated a fusion-protein specific antiserum directed against the region adjacent to p28 and used the antiserum to detect virus-specific proteins from MHV-JHM infected cells. When this antiserum was used to immunoprecipitate radiolabeled proteins from MHV-JHM infected cell lysates, virus-specific proteins of 72 and 65 kDa were detected. Furthermore, pulse and chase experiments demonstrated that p72 is likely a precursor to the mature protein product, p65. To investigate which viral proteinase may be responsible for generating p72 and p65, we expressed the 5′-region of the MHV-JHM RNA polymerase gene including the two papain-like cysteine proteinase domains in an in vitro transcription/translation system and analyzed the translation products for proteolytic processing. We also cloned and expressed the 72 kDa region immediately downstream from p28, and tested the ability of in vitro translated PCP-1 and PCP-2 to cleave p72 to p65 in trans. Our results indicate that neither viral proteinase domain PCP-1 nor PCP-2 is capable of cleavage of p72 to produce p65 in vitro. The role of MHV proteinases in the processing of p72 and p65 is discussed.",-0.010471316,0.055713836,-0.035260152,-0.045189433,-0.016943553,0.04815358,-0.03819127,-0.026303943,0.048065174,0.013476994,0.06566921,-0.030144032,-0.041254357,0.034750976,0.03537135,-0.06552625,-0.063832104,-0.048442226,0.038746636,0.051113587,0.014637165,0.009266361,-0.057773545,0.008797742,0.055495657,0.04793492,0.04325625,0.043214615,-0.050565626,0.04003352,0.015848318,0.064898275,0.040683392,-0.013036414,0.052818943,0.014841408,-0.052714176,0.025853397,-0.061574377,0.006191299,0.009435531,0.01129252,-0.023568906,-0.053223066,0.03762625,-0.05462821,-0.06285661,-0.03890666,0.044626754,-0.057820708,-0.016862718,-0.018861026,-0.06533901,-0.04929439,0.007409443,0.015075718,-0.034764845,0.03245559,0.05340041,0.03362063,0.047232874,-0.032975975,-0.024920005,-0.021870403,0.025687382,-0.06234566,0.059288964,0.041119266,0.043571617,-0.054877665,-0.013810597,0.06195549,0.005875293,0.041897483,-0.050145116,-0.000480636,0.0651668,0.030720923,-0.060622737,0.034771167,-0.043966196,0.065641694,0.04961733,-0.045980304,-0.018352361,0.06340573,-0.033271942,0.0355778,-0.05484083,0.044663988,-0.042300966,-0.0476572,-0.0478241,0.0489686,0.012499581,-0.014279829,0.05765881,0.0523538,0.06565812,-0.02423896,-0.053064436,-0.019621504,-0.025184266,0.04360298,0.04581172,0.03940359,0.024808839,-0.032404736,-0.053618502,-0.053473845,-0.03740709,0.041426014,-0.025689717,0.048137564,0.047461145,-0.025482807,-0.026611002,-0.020692036,0.02029952,0.000855972,-0.042332724,0.065557,0.063081615,0.013492436,0.054815765,0.05628085,0.008592224,0.03295726,-0.034877118,0.052329052,-0.020955939,0.06572236,0.06478821,0.050373472,0.041829202,-0.059271835,-0.05039834,0.026385846,-0.061524197,0.004854186,-0.008697327,0.065724485,-0.062157232,-0.055511452,-0.052929137,-0.059694164,0.025995921,-0.065009765,-0.001820042,0.057154853,0.019509446,-0.06562542,-0.050306913,-0.036524843,0.06572441,0.057106156,0.04678012,0.0502763,0.021412527,0.02659313,0.044759113,-0.05842874,-0.044834122,0.05396995,-0.00396693,-0.011777539,-0.060125325,-0.024524879,-0.06444073,-0.056142434,-0.015670028,0.035188835,-0.05561185,-0.005315403,0.034009263,-0.0401253,0.05983514,-0.051310115,0.06518403,0.000329548,0.009476326,0.045132007,-0.027031414,0.008439573,0.039033297,-0.05504653,-0.061693385,0.0590955,0.053193063,-0.021026757,0.05765521,-0.0615626,-0.026017971,0.013392511,0.06540932,-0.049100358,0.01269949,0.020117674,0.04168547,0.041712444,-0.06128197,0.047431897,0.026609464,0.04115273,0.05434093,-0.05086177,0.02734829,0.063314244,0.05197275,0.06413493,0.035095662,0.0634435,0.032331847,0.06399278,-0.064935334,-0.062755585,0.007562877,0.06266264,-0.019057259,0.024617631,-0.034221616,-0.042893246,-0.039357428,-0.012718258,-0.012366651,-0.052370273,-0.058676936,-0.061689902,1.89E-05,-0.044256315,-0.030924523,0.061376173,0.003990095,-0.06571798,0.0644153,0.060096875,-0.008389418,-0.0644617,-0.01865194,0.057380907,0.037376367,0.029595427,-0.03167756,0.043043464,0.06211,-0.03250869,0.022960752,0.044277094,-0.019913778,-0.03764319,-0.0656771,0.024419257,-0.04835409,-0.04822458,0.060359553,0.015541854,-0.03575088,0.06572458,-0.059755716,-0.01461664,0.020219216,0.045904923,0.020179514,0.059745632,0.009227435,0.04118668,-0.043591384,0.010588515,-0.011286,0.02299702,0.05965699,0.06567125,-0.043457735,0.005415538,-0.01903319,-0.060206782,0.03860351,-0.014458295,0.06363611,-0.06096565,-0.051762495,-0.051779035,-0.057450697,0.059466623,-0.003793486,0.022929624,-0.043138795,0.06422806,-0.06036633,0.03337935,0.06541895,-0.042767595,0.056055363,-0.014941738,-0.03154219,-0.059528217,-0.064716205,-0.030489963,-0.06436628,0.04580606,-0.0406518,0.06437991,0.059380185,0.03535833,0.008028352,0.047895752,-0.054705065,-0.043529376,0.06304383,-0.05191298,0.060086776,0.006975581,0.03389405,-0.06237946,0.05689402,0.00473099,0.040874384,-0.030887205,0.030567624,-0.01823661,0.033263676,0.024756523,-0.002921049,-0.047518507,0.05654701,0.038773064,-0.05085052,-0.061305273,-0.061690558,-0.004338394,0.045856696,-5.67E-05,0.020131757,0.06523821,0.013325666,0.029303288,0.045676235,-0.003625699,0.0490049,0.011587232,0.058076836,-0.018992564,0.06036018,0.050906353,-0.06572187,-0.065723225,-0.03773149,0.04487456,-0.028588533,-0.040410362,-0.008265764,-0.056748185,-0.044113733,0.002526368,-0.044072706,0.014044867,-0.06571429,-0.024450729,-0.06068251,-0.063485324,0.00173238,-0.059136428,-0.061492916,-0.03609866,-0.001188085,-0.04252561,0.065670826,-0.013185534,0.06464183,0.050258916,0.057716157,-0.011253378,-0.04241862,-0.06572241,0.061967727,0.060842894,0.06009415,-0.052664634,-0.011643469,-0.042797793,-0.06557053,0.04717953,-0.010260072,-0.015463302,0.013820343,-0.06200327,-0.0654243,-0.06185652,0.043651093,-0.011221322,-0.029253254,-0.040803306,0.056622885,0.00185747,-0.01029867,0.034234494,0.04931745,-0.0629284,0.043664716,-0.029654713,0.048560735,0.043931868,0.04125794,0.05533193,0.04396295,-0.011694685,-0.060956206,-0.001035425,0.03762405,0.012445341,0.00331172,-0.048885692,0.019617833,-0.05205

Experimental confirmation of recombination upstream of the S1 hypervariable region of infectious bronchitis virus,"Abstract Chimeric infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) genomes with cross-over sites in the S1 gene were generated by co-infection with two distinct IBV strains. Recombinant viruses were collected from chicken embryos, embryonic cultured cells and chickens co-infected with Ark99 and Mass41 strains and purified by differential centrifugation. The recombinant S1 genes were identified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) using heterologous primers and confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The recombinants with Ark99 5′ and Mass41 3′ sequences were identified following the in vitro, in ovo and in vivo co-infections. Mixed RNA extracted from Ark99 and Mass41 did not produce RTPCR products with these primers at the PCR conditions used. Cross-over sites within the amplified 580 (Mass41) or 604 (Ark99) bases of the 5′ S1 gene could only be detected between nucleotides 50 and 155. While this region, lying upstream of the S1 hypervariable region, corresponded with sites commonly identified in naturally occurring isolates, recombination sites identified in these studies could not be detected within the HVR of S1 of the genomes of chimeric

Phylogenetic analysis of a highly conserved region of the polymerase gene from 11 coronaviruses and development of a consensus polymerase chain reaction assay,"Abstract Viruses in the genus Coronavirus are currently placed in three groups based on antigenic cross-reactivity and sequence analysis of structural protein genes. Consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were used to obtain cDNA, then cloned and sequenced a highly conserved 922 nucleotide region in open reading frame (ORF) 1b of the polymerase (pol) gene from eight coronaviruses. These sequences were compared with published sequences for three additional coronaviruses. In this comparison, it was found that nucleotide substitution frequencies (per 100 nucleotides) varied from 46.40 to 50.13 when viruses were compared among the traditional coronavirus groups and, with one exception (the human coronavirus (HCV) 229E), varied from 2.54 to 15.89 when compared within these groups. (The substitution frequency for 229E, as compared to other members of the same group, varied from 35.37 to 35.72.) Phylogenetic analysis of these pol gene sequences resulted in groupings which correspond closely with the previously described groupings, including recent data which places the two avian coronaviruses—infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) of chickens and turkey coronavirus (TCV)—in the same group [Guy, J.S., Barnes, H.J., Smith L.G., Breslin, J., 1997. Avian Dis. 41:583–590]. A single pair of degenerate primers was identified which amplify a 251 bp region from coronaviruses of all three groups using the same reaction conditions. This consensus PCR assay for the genus Coronavirus may be useful in identifying as yet unknown

Astroviruses,"Publisher Summary Human astroviruses are members of the Astroviridae family. They are non-enveloped viruses possessing a single-stranded RNA of positive polarity as their genome. The development of sensitive tests for the presence of astrovirus—for example, using group reactive monoclonal antibodies—has led to the conclusion that astroviruses are the cause of more cases of childhood diarrhea. Astroviruses have also been identified as the cause of major outbreaks of diarrhea and vomiting. Different serotypes of human astrovirus have been defined based on immune electron microscopy, neutralization tests, and type-specific enzyme immune assays (EIAs).

Chapter 9 The Detection of Waterborne Viruses,"Publisher Summary Viruses in water are usually present in concentrations too low for detection by direct analysis. Virological investigation of water samples is always a multi-stage process involving concentration of viruses present followed by an appropriate detection procedure. There are several approaches to detection of viruses. Part or all of the concentrate may be inoculated into cell cultures to detect infectious cytopathogenic virus, and if this is done in a quantitative fashion the virus can be enumerated, the count being reported as plaque-forming units, the tissue culture infectious dose, or most probable number units. The virus may be isolated and identified from the cell cultures. Viruses that multiply without producing an identifiable cytopathic effect in culture may sometimes be detected by immunoperoxidase or immunofluorescence staining. The concentrate may also be analyzed by molecular biological procedures (usually polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time-PCR). The problem then is that such techniques do not usually detect the infectious virus, and novel approaches have been made recently to meet this challenge.",-0.05658932,0.04398087,0.014411545,-0.023918971,0.04443051,0.0540434,0.05151509,0.03111764,0.011640693,0.030521374,0.064081065,-0.05326324,0.022515072,0.042200584,0.021278968,-0.06253479,-0.059666473,-0.038721923,0.05782755,-0.003302869,-0.043678496,0.018105108,-0.06328739,0.051465936,-0.02275184,0.053645257,-0.056428403,-0.044179257,-0.051890787,-0.054556314,0.058432188,0.064076096,0.00911424,-0.019447932,0.02895138,0.060968332,-0.06378764,-0.041609548,-0.05774559,-0.057005726,0.044206902,-0.000239722,-0.005325124,0.023177046,-0.039142027,-0.023936125,0.037985947,-0.026846612,0.027335467,-0.014813303,-0.039868366,-0.001141639,-0.062652245,-0.023791363,-0.06389945,0.04796908,-0.059655145,0.007742633,0.054833278,0.014056911,0.038637593,-0.008107822,0.026743231,-0.047537327,-0.010686305,-0.063264884,0.03127931,0.04556321,0.049168084,0.000796674,-0.028855141,0.029813098,0.006499998,0.050741274,-0.010134709,-0.035267532,0.04389673,0.013642734,-0.06405281,0.01994096,-0.036541034,0.05754984,0.01713054,-0.04340525,-0.05108514,0.028406799,0.046461374,0.04547502,-0.059827156,0.025076594,-0.057499412,0.004893995,-0.062120996,-0.011983577,0.038487304,0.04297701,0.04883017,0.0637675,0.063971534,-0.056757014,0.048115678,-0.04023432,-0.06384399,0.041538388,0.04054123,0.028933333,0.038016252,-0.057223365,0.016658891,0.055024974,-0.021178711,0.043510776,0.056854002,0.040966492,0.05763038,0.028621271,-0.024971029,-0.045480773,0.025840165,0.034475096,-0.000454767,0.053216726,0.012402156,-0.043473333,-0.05802267,0.044959076,0.04087751,-0.013440398,0.010748793,0.04992171,0.035633877,0.064082704,0.039762914,-0.045756325,0.059344843,-0.062456273,-0.026910046,0.04595545,-0.0608289,-0.0593658,0.028503591,0.064054534,-0.05616991,-0.017016876,0.055942908,-0.05022593,0.052197125,-0.047906302,0.04558669,-0.01587118,0.035081934,-0.020665273,0.022706889,-0.044838417,0.063987456,-0.059269663,0.06350686,0.05065084,0.023482671,0.05250334,-0.027033046,-0.050890565,-0.03646972,-0.03417313,0.015606462,-0.05563558,0.008322509,0.052978218,-0.040310245,-0.05918422,-0.043035302,-0.06346331,-0.05173385,-0.024197634,-0.028042378,0.008935408,-0.04328168,0.037201785,0.040238813,0.001150373,0.04278182,0.018561874,0.05882754,0.046195794,0.054880954,-0.03180076,-0.06024518,0.02559709,0.023388807,0.00762296,0.06387167,-0.002746384,0.048453398,0.012593378,0.057456452,-0.019603068,0.012217892,0.054575603,-0.034324456,-0.000564589,-0.05449203,0.06318115,0.05323227,-0.0575344,0.061110348,-0.06353062,-0.012326854,-0.015239386,-0.005273592,0.06396492,0.053979453,0.009997863,0.061814353,0.05338117,-0.00941996,0.04534409,0.053527635,0.0610321,-0.055014424,-0.03216042,0.041328218,-0.05061171,0.044700064,-0.001064227,-0.054348495,0.061297473,-0.06350705,-0.06399421,0.014857477,-0.029438859,0.057892397,0.05466217,-0.013082825,-0.06407183,0.030898608,0.022782536,0.04191268,-0.06258352,0.019613905,0.028925888,-0.049856093,-0.007129069,0.0536512,-0.052934468,0.048667677,-0.061260104,-0.046834223,-0.042789955,0.009176643,-0.043944295,-0.06182357,-0.03179018,0.01233285,-0.02353287,0.053202357,0.054223537,-0.050351147,0.064083464,-0.028024867,-0.027514063,0.04058993,0.034118913,0.056987297,0.055149883,0.028241314,-0.04714596,0.001451584,-0.05354125,-0.007968047,0.042665932,-0.03347205,0.04720264,-0.06209283,-0.0627156,-0.023455989,-0.06023188,0.020397296,-0.05613707,0.0638263,-0.055389263,-0.06298422,-0.045001753,0.002296217,0.05572431,-0.037511416,0.00032584,-0.058588438,0.05187342,-0.040125936,0.029334266,0.06387787,-0.058711752,0.063232854,-0.008287376,0.034870446,-0.037077777,-0.01871117,-0.009028208,-0.062011663,0.039099228,0.013488179,0.06369517,0.05244931,-0.008807992,-0.06385114,0.0511147,0.059374273,-0.04901797,-0.054390315,0.01137609,0.047988992,0.05486114,-0.04342606,-0.014287922,0.063783236,-0.04550395,0.061071575,0.037158918,0.059705835,0.034228697,-0.039677765,0.06079417,0.03548235,0.024508504,-0.06128245,0.06372985,-0.058174487,-0.049392212,-0.061630093,-0.020975018,0.054610714,0.06189672,0.022607548,0.06353094,-0.048255954,0.055919543,0.04065092,-0.053311307,0.018738111,0.011522789,0.02760154,-0.05142699,0.023424834,0.05359263,-0.06407343,-0.06406126,-0.000206697,0.060195994,-0.05751397,-0.05301491,-0.01013913,-0.036394145,0.025184808,0.03726498,0.053405136,-0.008924183,-0.064079456,-0.046233423,0.00712677,0.006651055,-0.051064305,-0.06274612,-0.059846364,0.052004352,0.010681886,-0.010116013,0.06406836,-0.048191298,0.031512793,-0.03665856,0.04498856,0.06147393,-0.04247178,-0.06332514,0.062964514,0.05386301,0.052727647,0.031881295,-0.047528464,-0.010333336,-0.06342917,0.009503127,0.003842767,0.04300858,-0.041610375,-0.05527456,0.02216088,-0.06388359,-0.025714446,0.005721889,0.017038018,-0.03129343,0.06317109,-0.006105335,-0.00958784,0.047894888,-0.037630595,-0.05740447,0.048447102,0.06012607,0.047714524,0.05666593,0.038835377,0.05626195,0.033346947,-0.039971154,-0.005611438,0.0598778,0.048873626,-0.009035499,0.054078244,0.016910566,-0.05692597,

Antiviral activity of Jinchai capsule against influenza virus,"Abstract Objective To evaluate the effect on influenza virus of Jinchai, a capsule made of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Methods Madin-darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were infected with the FM1 strain of influenza virus A (subtype H1N1) in vitro. They were used to explore how Jinchai affected cell adsorption, cell membrane fusion, transcription and replication of the influenza virus. Hemagglutinin (HA) protein, intracellular pH, and influenza virus protein acid (PA) polymerase subunit were detected with confocal microscopy and real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results Jinchai significantly reduced the expression of HA and PA polymerase subunit mRNA in infected MDCK cells. Jinchai also significantly decreased intracellular pH in infected cells. Conclusions Jinchai had strong anti-influenza activity against the influenza virus. It weakened the ability of the influenza virus to adsorb to cell wall and fuse with cell membranes in the early infection stage, and inhibited the transcription and replication of the virus.",0.023750748,0.041157153,-0.038120527,-0.041992947,0.048817262,0.05565381,0.05595034,-0.043198492,0.04942302,-0.000701876,0.059349243,-0.056259576,-0.054958396,-0.039874617,0.058655813,-0.05933959,-0.059349027,-0.058826692,0.057274498,-0.028260991,-0.054047614,-0.046299964,-0.043656353,0.058617808,0.02809079,0.029664263,0.009155794,-0.031541456,-0.028496617,0.002076704,0.058398314,0.059349243,-0.012154194,-0.05867049,0.055429455,-0.045441996,-0.058590766,-0.038134545,-0.03612445,0.045995556,0.055620395,-0.030715939,-0.04422621,0.003446035,0.05640632,-0.032331347,0.02593452,0.01158712,0.057972647,-0.04351115,-0.001054443,0.052887283,-0.0592237,0.025354581,-0.058757026,0.053676657,-0.054663036,-0.057747666,0.03754966,-0.045593645,-0.006413568,0.046782434,0.05552052,0.056605715,0.006982326,-0.053865563,0.05396881,0.042496014,0.055961374,0.03643495,0.053749736,0.053519,0.0312471,0.03680802,-0.011300208,-0.005549635,0.05154238,-0.049326707,-0.059342537,0.04996736,0.044595864,0.058521245,-0.004640972,0.01929869,-0.043099366,0.046921782,-0.040197853,0.007704639,-0.058068875,0.04291264,-0.05078001,0.03648806,-0.0509768,0.0150326,0.044384852,0.054917544,0.05743115,0.052919254,0.059343524,-0.05356766,-0.039019864,0.002280176,0.025790773,0.037418026,-0.008532448,0.035663705,0.057511926,-0.04712371,-0.017370222,-0.05423559,-0.044966236,0.028298836,0.05904605,0.04138506,0.05760836,-0.04590425,-0.058938302,-0.009876415,-0.054187104,-0.04780044,-0.03621438,0.016521538,0.05342003,-0.057545666,-0.003168149,0.056262154,-0.017861892,0.028339129,0.02739088,-0.032535043,0.017068207,0.059349243,0.048610833,0.027634282,0.048848543,-0.058313016,0.039002582,0.043084405,-0.054336037,0.028597722,0.015398493,0.059317008,-0.053343534,-0.05217588,0.009519588,0.044021573,0.04651379,-0.0593115,-0.020633157,0.01972612,0.05350407,-0.058050003,-0.049398676,0.047473986,0.059349164,-0.020994032,0.059195116,0.027042607,0.046837434,0.041698843,0.0393654,-0.001820409,0.028858213,0.04017444,0.057179507,-0.057233974,-0.05603891,-0.051279534,-0.046486992,-0.059107177,-0.04739749,-0.056824718,-0.05062334,0.00363158,0.033151183,-0.051861074,0.025656352,0.000962262,0.018393213,-0.013456048,-0.022161951,-0.021904668,0.024781387,0.054554794,0.058021843,-0.002641212,-0.059111785,0.05213539,0.04623373,0.018997671,0.05605073,-0.056003492,-0.0485739,-0.001216741,0.058888596,-0.03955726,0.050159067,0.04087542,0.019499313,0.020405928,-0.05390535,0.059273727,-0.033479962,-0.05072326,-0.013351221,-0.028342558,0.033391938,0.05084479,0.05181306,0.059315946,0.046933107,0.033423085,0.023803197,-0.011597875,-0.05597804,0.005654519,0.052782424,0.05323022,-0.012509755,0.011228667,-0.021658823,-0.03822485,0.053292815,-0.04157015,-0.030235123,0.030438224,-0.05677131,-0.05867661,0.05017038,-0.002031526,-0.006438991,0.056290753,0.047479194,-0.059132434,0.015694894,0.046819676,0.03353205,-0.059232563,-0.027791565,0.056034703,0.039556783,0.0508739,0.029236754,-0.045261826,0.05305258,-0.04649171,-0.04795379,0.042062085,0.049516346,-0.05508553,-0.059342045,0.041484617,-0.042407133,-0.025406027,0.058067914,0.018041177,-0.05928599,0.05934838,-0.008670446,-0.05102176,0.051897187,0.04922612,-0.0568667,-0.007861992,0.030229548,-0.005890782,0.055562627,0.032360367,0.017054588,0.054519497,-0.023295907,0.058648825,-0.049144052,0.014383394,0.054607626,-0.05823452,0.05728497,0.05748777,0.05932407,-0.05851195,-0.021168094,-0.029475773,-0.041095857,-0.009191968,-0.044826906,-0.04497498,-0.059240773,-0.001082637,-0.059293706,0.047021408,0.05934471,-0.024931962,0.05909795,-0.039019745,-0.043306686,-0.0581072,0.014163357,-0.032833967,-0.05931088,0.04363144,-0.032919787,0.054907896,0.044015635,0.052040376,-0.054127302,0.000631734,-0.017111195,-0.054530248,0.038934328,-0.004915443,0.043181233,-0.057272382,-0.029115941,0.057359114,0.059301697,0.013522009,0.05289339,0.0487506,0.03466794,-0.051068075,-0.037604917,-0.04709068,0.05652396,-0.055199385,-0.055755068,0.059322055,-0.05385668,0.023142593,-0.046518523,-0.05777604,0.046065066,0.02998014,0.022625908,0.057815067,0.05135525,0.024791455,0.05566,-0.006685038,0.032128952,-0.049806796,0.053641517,-0.056281645,0.059258476,0.04890909,-0.05934826,-0.059349243,-0.0322285,0.059194814,-0.05068073,-0.05471897,-0.044069815,0.057107594,-0.036580663,0.039069355,0.05880977,-0.038063575,-0.059332985,-0.030698039,-0.008251889,-0.007886332,0.045697846,-0.057850182,-0.059126563,0.05454008,0.04914028,-0.030249435,0.059192725,-0.017696468,-0.002241101,0.052091103,0.012622223,0.038968757,-0.028019639,-0.059349235,0.057135716,0.05652994,0.05925237,0.014861897,0.04578784,-0.005180466,-0.059331212,0.039225314,0.053622846,0.047704365,-0.044666752,-0.04568305,-0.027045645,-0.059348494,-0.013653933,-0.021251507,0.01338599,-0.052980527,0.011472882,-0.05093625,-0.04114168,0.04514254,-0.055638965,-0.03211638,0.04649426,-0.058182374,0.030300183,0.030450711,-0.018172132,0.05626679,-0.00394599,-0.027450971,-0.05696535,0.057975955,0.056162287,0.051684275,0.034668602,-0.

Gripe A (H1N1)v pandémica en UCI: ¿qué hemos aprendido?,"Resumen Las características de la gripe pandémica 2009 son diferentes de las de la gripe estacional. En Australia- Nueva Zelanda (ANZIC) se multiplicaron por 15 los ingresos en la unidad de cuidados intensivos (UCI) en el invierno austral. Se comparan las características de la serie española de los primeros ingresos en UCI en julio con las series publicadas en Canadá y ANZIC hasta octubre de 2009. A diferencia de lo observado en España, sólo la mitad de los ingresos en Canadá y ANZIC se debió a neumonía viral primaria, mientras que la neumonía bacteriana fue más frecuente en los primeros. En todas las series, los jóvenes, muchos de los cuales no tenían comorbilidad, fueron la población más afectada. La obesidad, la patología pulmonar crónica, el embarazo y la cardiopatía fueron las comorbilidades más frecuentes. El diagnóstico mediante rt-PCR puede presentar un 10% de falsos negativos. El shock y la insuficiencia renal aguda fueron más frecuentes en la serie española. El 10-30% de los afectados requieren ingreso a UCI y 6 de cada 10 ventilación mecánica (VM), con una alta frecuencia de fracaso de la ventilación no invasiva (75%). La mortalidad fue similar entre las series (14-25%), aunque mayor en los pacientes que requieren VM (30%). La administración precoz (< 48 h de inicio de los síntomas) de oseltamvir se ha asociado a una mejor evolución. Por ello, su administración precoz en pacientes con factores de riesgo, o en quienes aun sin ellos presentan signos de progresión clínica, podría reducir el ingreso en la UCI y la mortalidad. Abstract The characteristics of pandemic influenza 2009 differ from those of seasonal influenza. In Australia-New Zealand the number of admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) increased by 15-fold in the southern winter. We compared the characteristics of the Spanish series of the first ICU admissions in July with those of series published in Canada and Australia-New Zealand up to October 2009. Unlike the situation in Spain, only half the admissions in Canada and Australia-New Zealand were due to primary viral pneumonia but bacterial pneumonia was much more frequent. In all series, young people, many of whom had no comborbidities, were the most frequently affected population. The most common comorbidities were obesity, chronic pulmonary disease, pregnancy and heart disease. Diagnosis through reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction can have a false-negative rate of 10%. Shock and acute renal insufficiency were more frequent in the Spanish series. A total of 10-30% of patients required ICU admission and 6 of 10 patients required mechanical ventilation with a high frequency of failure of non-invasive ventilation (75%). Mortality was similar among the series (14-25%) but was higher in patients requiring mechanical ventilation (30%). Early oseltamivir administration (< 48h after symptom onset) has been associated with better outcome. Therefore, early administration of this drug in patients with risk factors or those who, although free from risk factors, show clinical progression, could reduce ICU admissions and

A follow-up of Beagle dogs intradermally infected with Leishmania chagasi in the presence or absence of sand fly saliva,"Abstract In this study, we compare the development of infection and/or disease in Beagle dogs intradermally infected with Leishmania chagasi, in the presence or absence of Lutzomyia longipalpis saliva, with those of intravenously infected animals. Spleen samples of all the animals inoculated with parasites had positive polymerase chain reaction tests for Leishmania DNA. Positive spleen cultures for Leishmania were detected earlier (P≤0.018) and were more frequent (five out of the five animals) in intravenously infected animals than in the intradermally infected animals, in presence (two out of the six animals) or absence (three out of the five animals) of salivary gland lysate of L. longipalpis. Significant increase in serum antibodies against Leishmania was observed only in the intravenously infected group (P=0.004). In addition, dogs with infection confirmed by isolation of amastigotes or detection of parasite DNA were, nevertheless, negative for anti-Leishmania antibodies up to 5 months or more after infection. Only animals of the intravenously infected group developed progressive decreases in hematocrit (Pearson r=−0.8076, P=0.0026) and hemoglobin (Pearson r=−0.8403, P=0.0012) during the infection period. No significant difference in the course of infection was observed between groups of intradermally infected animals. The data presented herein confirms that the intradermal inoculation of dogs with Leishmania produces an asymptomatic form of infection. It also fails to show an advantage in using L. longipalpis saliva as an infection-enhancing agent in experimental canine

Exacerbations de l’asthme et identification virale associée à celle du Chlamydiae pneumoniae et du Mycoplasma pneumoniae : épidémiologie comparative entre nourrissons et enfants âgés de plus de deux ans,"Résumé Objectifs. – L’utilisation des nouvelles techniques d’identification par les méthodes moléculaires apporte de nouvelles données épidémiologiques. Patients et méthodes. – Cent dix-huit aspirations nasales pratiquées chez des enfants hospitalisés pour une exacerbation aiguë d’asthme ont été colligées. Les techniques conventionnelles ont associé la culture virale et l’immunofluorescence et les techniques moléculaires une polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Résultats. – L’utilisation des techniques conventionnelles a mis en évidence un virus dans 34 % des prélèvements respiratoires (40 cas sur 118), tandis que l’étude par PCR permet une identification positive sur 68 % des prélèvements (80 cas sur 118) et l’association des deux méthodes amène la positivité à 77 % (91 cas sur 118). Les co-infections ont concerné 23 % des prélèvements positifs. L’identification virale par les outils traditionnels est significativement plus fréquente chez les jeunes asthmatiques, ainsi que lors de l’utilisation des outils de biologie moléculaire de façon non significative. L’épidémiologie comparative retrouve la prépondérance dans les deux groupes d’âge du rhinovirus (45 %), puis du virus respiratoire syncytial (28 %) et de l’entérovirus (8,5 %). Chez les enfants âgés de moins de deux ans, rhinovirus et virus respiratoire syncytial ont une prévalence proche (42 et 36 % respectivement) sensiblement différente de celle des enfants âgés de plus de deux ans (66 et 27 % respectivement). L’identification par PCR de Chlamydia pneumoniae et de Mycoplasma pneumoniae reste rare (six cas sur 118 prélèvements). Conclusion. – La prééminence du rhinovirus et du virus respiratoire syncytial est retrouvée lors des exacerbations d’asthme chez le nourrisson tandis que C. pneumoniae et M. pneumoniae ne semblent pas particulièrement impliqués. L’identification est plus forte chez les jeunes asthmatiques avec probablement une charge virale plus importante, car la positivité de la culture virale est plus fréquente chez les enfants âgés de moins de deux ans. Abstract Purpose.– Molecular processes can have a different impact on epidemiological data. Patients and methods. – The study covers 118 nasal aspirate samples taken on children hospitalized for acute asthma exacerbation for 2 years. Conventional techniques associated viral culture and immunofluorescence while molecular techniques used polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results. – Virus presence was revealed with conventional techniques in 34% of the respiratory samples (40/118), while PCR study of viruses and genomes of Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae allowed positive identification in 68% of the samples (80/118). The combination of both techniques allowed identification of an infectious agent in 77% of cases (91/118). More than one pathogenic agent was isolated in 23% of positive samples. Epidemiological study shows prevalence of rhinovirus (45%), then respiratory syncytial virus (28%) and enterovirus (8.5%). In children under 2 years of age, rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus have a close prevalence (respectively 42 and 36%), which is not the same result as in older children (respectively 66 and 27%). Moreover, PCR techniques allowed the identification of just a few Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (6/118). Conclusion. – In this study, molecular techniques of identification demonstrate a clear advantage in sensitivity compared to performances of viral cultures or immunofluorescence. The importance of rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus is remarkable while Chlamydia pneumoniae an Mycoplasma pneumoniae do not seem to be particularly involved.",-0.057165768,0.056600846,-0.030001042,-0.041907128,-0.045177013,0.05720082,0.056566592,-0.052972272,0.01991716,0.008334531,0.0578146,-0.014389552,0.010658428,0.011501832,0.056731526,-0.057518404,-0.057814755,-0.052375536,0.038632743,-0.056442257,0.050321028,-0.020624418,-0.055575132,-0.002675896,-0.050559867,0.030184912,0.02150515,-0.003642035,0.031239035,-0.040133793,0.05636565,0.05781466,-0.03905542,0.000546214,0.040842723,-0.044694547,-0.057755735,-0.054822423,-0.056619313,0.035766333,0.044416673,0.008022924,4.01E-05,-0.021163514,-0.000515609,-0.045690797,0.017852848,-0.005289584,0.056388065,-0.028089052,-0.0548782,-0.044380162,-0.057812784,-0.055909578,-0.057544515,0.011839988,-0.05746033,-0.03611696,0.051930327,0.05154216,0.038097166,0.051702637,-0.051673602,0.050105322,0.002057749,-0.057173498,0.051689606,-0.040932015,0.03537743,-0.054534037,0.032558594,0.016016841,-0.015419927,0.057470392,-0.054342963,-0.030719165,-0.012575061,-0.023946434,-0.057784762,0.008675492,0.04657047,0.05763372,0.057749506,0.025646716,-0.041683182,0.044183064,-0.034923885,0.004255339,-0.008450471,-0.05718264,-0.05612572,-0.046079382,-0.056678865,-0.033842765,-0.04713152,0.054381963,0.054552067,0.057781383,0.05778864,-0.05670755,-0.055418722,-0.056638606,-0.024060119,0.057490163,-0.015042244,-0.0215389,0.013839426,0.017212348,0.054880388,0.021883063,0.042484757,0.054457765,0.051527705,0.047690615,0.057650104,-0.01916076,-0.030741693,0.02314881,0.025432723,0.003272559,-0.026869211,0.057472877,0.055548605,-0.0570322,0.052594494,0.05162695,0.015795656,0.040424727,0.03146572,0.024890276,-0.050627373,0.057814773,0.05596032,-0.038503673,0.052746445,-0.04532964,0.050615367,0.03650113,-0.051232062,-0.036729872,0.020809308,0.057814773,-0.057337426,-0.049592715,-0.02133194,-0.037726015,0.055489246,-0.057741474,0.05593883,-0.050735544,0.039624143,-0.056435194,-0.05744627,-0.05577307,0.057740692,-0.004279062,0.057243466,0.056820188,-0.054229386,0.038555283,-0.03981522,-0.009017563,-0.04199084,0.05743931,0.033962537,-0.049198966,-0.050316494,0.013999881,-0.057123363,-0.057289686,-0.008221536,-0.057589956,-0.056204382,0.057376564,0.012848126,0.01095449,0.04980713,0.025749387,0.056947757,-0.04465111,0.006609445,0.045458354,-0.03479308,0.04387731,0.057396844,-0.045282934,-0.05440249,0.03317158,0.033955414,0.056103487,0.057338968,-0.027268782,0.013955588,-0.00741563,0.057677347,-0.053636495,-0.042112418,0.033514287,-0.00657604,0.006862609,-0.057688687,0.057132542,0.03947472,0.005676372,-0.016340544,-0.05578371,-0.05458044,0.054297462,-0.013396534,0.057660528,0.036531247,0.0523216,0.045943983,0.056333754,-0.057789117,-0.038694657,0.029473104,0.03432604,-0.050575618,0.008226574,0.03141221,-0.041422267,0.05430184,-0.052224305,0.008656455,0.039537676,-0.047561202,-0.057342466,0.0181319,0.021586375,0.04428057,0.05770705,0.052534267,-0.057814755,0.0396879,0.030395223,-0.017319623,-0.0575698,-0.033460204,0.033640094,0.01331904,0.050433777,-0.057558835,-0.05322672,0.057799697,-0.038173236,-0.05201053,0.039177608,0.05162429,-0.046744253,-0.022003526,-0.04213758,-0.05473204,-0.049105976,0.05008379,0.04996866,0.013282138,0.057814773,0.01849625,0.02848675,0.054402478,0.053309962,-0.05491137,0.050366633,-0.009950301,-0.003812295,-0.027391402,0.038536973,-0.0210143,0.03795328,0.001258718,0.057798076,-0.057128888,-0.057666283,0.014496775,-0.05620467,0.044018127,-0.03363693,0.05692261,-0.052420653,-0.055577233,-0.000547117,0.007744372,0.053122867,-0.020550739,-0.03258608,-0.04800772,0.04505829,-0.05656024,-0.021191685,0.044403117,0.045246433,0.05345128,-0.057540957,-0.041631848,-0.055148732,-0.016499583,-8.01E-06,-0.057032626,0.056641396,-0.023758309,0.05494135,0.026395544,-0.003233337,-0.057087757,0.05618095,-0.005607129,-0.029289227,0.0564301,-0.00094214,0.022232603,-0.016158648,-0.00250942,-0.007761525,0.05779094,0.001302982,-0.037145298,0.024540788,0.057696007,0.054217327,-0.03493683,0.05554518,0.004413829,-0.04983099,-0.055798143,0.057763334,0.025415327,-0.030108728,-0.057813838,-0.04529211,0.049878005,0.04776631,0.019092472,0.057814684,-0.031651046,0.001864627,0.030867418,0.052347187,0.045384236,-0.044459138,0.020480381,-0.026346453,0.057444867,0.055356044,-0.05776881,-0.057811104,0.05558455,0.05705471,-0.05504103,-0.057777517,0.05214282,0.04330624,0.00827871,0.052669685,0.05490365,-0.05517406,-0.05781432,-0.009580315,-0.022600573,-0.057184808,0.026454886,-0.05225754,-0.055280868,0.007869889,-0.036441647,-0.057307158,0.05766797,0.003611815,0.053263713,-0.05523894,0.050013777,0.057580486,-0.040711056,-0.054268904,0.05739822,0.056937743,0.052533746,0.051086634,0.05211399,-0.056218475,-0.054869372,0.021026846,0.007263845,-0.005017802,-0.04115152,-0.04244787,-0.053358257,-0.05612686,-0.017689085,0.04479925,0.055419415,0.034732018,0.049356233,0.00348015,0.014158427,0.05073003,-0.032646507,-0.05755256,0.05653499,-0.054097783,-0.018600116,0.050914757,0.01721368,0.057745554,0.017046338,-0.030136727,-0.030979477,-0.033346746,0.05668301,-0.004088396,0.

Diagnostic moléculaire en pathologie infectieuse: intérêt d'un diagnostic multiplex dans les pneumopathies atypiques,"Résumé Parmi les pathogènes responsables de pneumopathies atypiques, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, et Legionella pneumophila sont trois bactéries fréquentes pour lesquelles un diagnostic étiologique rapide est difficile à obtenir. L'amplification génique in vitro offre une possibilité de rendu de résultats dans la journée, mais souvent au détriment d'un temps de réalisation important du fait du manque d'automatisation. Cet inconvénient est réduit en cas d'utilisation de techniques d'amplification génique multiplex, dont un exemple de réalisation est présenté dans cet article. Abstract Among frequent potential respiratory pathogens, Mycoplasma pneumoniæ, Chlamydia pneumoniæ, and Legionella pneumophila are difficult to isolate with usual laboratory techniques (culture, serologic tests). Adapted molecular biology tools are able to amplify a specific genomic target and allow the diagnosis the same day, but with a very time consuming process. The proposed technique allows the diagnosis of the three bacteriaes in a few hours time using a multiplex single-tube polymerase chain

"Sequence analysis of gene 3, gene 4 and gene 5 of avian infectious bronchitis virus strain CU-T2","Abstract We have previously reported the nucleotide sequences of gene 2 (spike (S) protein gene), gene 6 (nucleocapsid (N) protein gene), and the 3′ end untranslated region of a novel avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain, CU-T2 [Jia et al. (1995) Arch. Virol. 140, 259–271]. In the present report we describe the sequences of the remaining genes of this strain (gene 3, 4 and 5) with the exception of gene 1 (RNA polymerase gene). Gene 3 contained three open reading frames (ORFs), 3a, 3b and 3c of 174, 195 and 282 nucleotides (nt), respectively. Gene 4 (membrane (M) protein gene) consisted of 749 nt with a single ORF of 687 nt. Gene 5 contained two ORFs, 5a and 5b, with 198 and 249 nt, respectively. Thus, in total, there were 7349 nt from the 5′ end of S protein gene to the 3′ end of the CU-T2 genome. The overall nt sequence homologies between gene 3, 4, and 5 of CU-T2 and those of other strains were between 84.1–90.8%, 85.8–88.8% and 90.4–96.4%, respectively. The predicted amino acid (aa) sequence homologies revealed that gene 3b and 5b were more conserved than 3a, 3c and 5a. Each individual gene of CU-T2 strain (with the exception of the RNA polymerase gene) had a different level of homology with the homologous gene of other strains, suggesting that the evolution of IBV strains in general has been a complex, and as yet, poorly understood process. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Reproduction of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in immunostimulated and non-immunostimulated 3-week-old piglets experimentally infected with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2),"Abstract Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in swine is causally associated with the newly recognised pathogen, porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). In this study, 3-week-old SPF PCV2-seronegative piglets were inoculated intranasally with PCV2. The effect of immunostimulation on the induction of PMWS was investigated by immunisation with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) emulsified in incomplete Freunds adjuvant. The study was terminated 5 weeks after inoculation. While disease was not observed in the age-matched controls, two out of five non-immunised PCV2-infected piglets died on postinoculation day (PID) 21, and one was euthanized on PID 25 in moribund condition. These animals had appeared lethargic with persistent fever from PID 12 onwards. The euthanized pig appeared smaller than littermates and suffered from jaundice. At postmortem examination, gastric ulceration, icterus, and liver and thymus atrophy were observed. Furthermore, histological lesions of degenerating hepatocytes and hepatitis in combination with lymphoid depletion and syncytial cells in lymph nodes were consistent with the diagnosis of PMWS. One out of five immunostimulated PCV2-infected piglets was euthanized on PID 22 with convulsions after a period with wasting. This pig was lethargic from PID 14 onwards with persistent fever from PID 8 and transient dyspnoea. No differences in clinical signs, gross pathologic or histological findings were observed for the remaining non-immunostimulated and immunostimulated PCV2-infected piglets. All 10 PCV2-inoculated piglets seroconverted to PCV2 within 14 days after inoculation. By virus isolation, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), and immunostaining of cryostat sections, it was demonstrated that lymphoid tissue contained abundant PCV2 antigen. Viral DNA load in serum samples was assessed by Q-PCR. All four PMWS-affected piglets had high levels of PCV2 DNA in serum, suggesting that there was a correlation between high levels of viral DNA in serum and the development of PMWS. In conclusion, infection with PCV2 caused PMWS in SPF piglets, however, the immunostimulation did not seem to play a critical

Partial sequence of the spike glycoprotein gene of transmissible gastroenteritis viruses isolated in Korea,"Abstract The spike (S) glycoprotein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is the predominant inducer of neutralizing antibodies and has been implicated in virulence and host cell tropism. In this study, the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the amino terminal half of the S glycoprotein gene of one Korean field TGEV strain (133) isolated in 1997 and three Korean field TGEV strains (KT2, KT3 and KT4) isolated in 2000 and HKT2 strain, KT2 passaged 104 times in ST cells, were determined. The amino terminal half of the S glycoprotein gene including antigenic sites A, B, C and D, were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Amplified PCR products were cloned, sequenced, and compared with published sequences for non-Korean TGEV strains. Korea TGEV field strains had 98.5–99.5% nucleotide sequence and 97.2–99.0% amino acid sequence similarity with each other. They had 96.5–99.0% nucleotide sequence similarity and 94.9–97.6% amino acid sequence similarity compared to non-Korean TGEV strains. Korean TGEV strains had several specific nucleotide and amino acid sequences which were not found in foreign TGEV or PRCV strains. HKT2 strain differed by 0.89% in nucleotide and 2.03% amino acid sequences compared to original KT2 strain although the regions forming four antigenic sites were not changed. By phylogenetic tree analysis, Korean field TGEV strains were branched into different groups from non-Korean TGEV or PRCV strains.

Detection of feline coronaviruses by culture and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of blood samples from healthy cats and cats with clinical feline infectious peritonitis,"Abstract A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for the detection of the feline coronavirus (FCoV) genome and a co-cultivation method for the isolation of field strains of FCoV are described. Using the RT-PCR assay to assess blood samples from cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) (n=47) and healthy cats from households with endemic FCoV (n=69) it was shown that approximately 80% of the cats were viraemic, irrespective of their health status. It was also shown that, over a 12-month period, a similar percentage of healthy cats remained viraemic, and that the presence of viraemia did not appear to predispose the cats to the development of FIP. The co-cultivation system proved to be a suitable method for the culture of field strains of FCoV from blood samples, so long as the cultures were maintained for at least 4 weeks. Using this system, followed by the RT-PCR, viraemia was detected as frequently as by RT-PCR on RNA extracted directly from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.",-0.052996717,0.04281807,0.010950455,-0.04081407,0.007811336,0.036265887,0.002252769,0.017886579,0.013032111,0.056810014,0.06823862,0.068194166,0.04890463,0.04348098,-0.011047755,-0.018673815,-0.066763245,0.00074569,-0.013772686,0.041765217,-0.06156753,-0.029788319,-0.040238585,0.060557406,0.03512383,0.051800963,-0.058030672,-0.001318912,0.02783967,-0.035969835,0.048504416,0.066039555,-0.039904412,0.028151218,-0.010947569,0.043495294,-0.06430613,-0.038547516,-0.034089733,0.036475863,0.050298207,0.009424172,-0.022333285,-0.044473574,-0.068258524,-0.026646933,0.021064574,0.012602015,0.050374515,0.0451233,-0.045245692,-0.057290465,-0.06023641,0.003582477,-0.06542055,0.025407726,-0.06052563,0.03597371,0.06639827,-0.06767314,0.05562192,0.05060265,-0.0574035,-0.022049474,0.068191975,-0.061011437,0.04734247,0.002027513,0.06326938,-0.033191707,-0.026199538,0.05030463,0.051231958,0.055023924,-0.016511824,0.05219391,-0.003541067,0.011024621,-0.06789412,0.030924408,-0.046882577,0.05622101,0.02198362,0.045584913,-0.009228875,0.05876646,-0.025647257,0.06443963,-0.012975768,-0.040810127,-0.030957226,-0.03568534,-0.047191802,0.051242188,-0.0003526,0.0502251,0.029992878,0.06410188,0.0676297,-0.013884216,-0.031111449,0.051827807,-0.038587872,0.06517704,0.041292336,-0.027250439,0.067377865,-0.014369273,-0.057000153,0.022194754,0.018793166,0.057992317,0.05494239,-0.034600463,0.032099374,0.01541164,-0.003770377,0.013549711,0.054304343,-0.044100974,-0.032898396,0.048672322,-0.059226148,-0.06290767,-0.040227134,0.0437903,0.002624328,0.002452122,0.039006744,0.068142295,0.04585879,0.06826396,0.054253362,-0.015251805,0.05087046,-0.0525554,-0.025404233,0.04051985,-0.022493944,0.008299711,0.004287504,0.06826165,-0.06741584,-0.010860782,0.003334969,-0.02427339,-0.017765699,-0.06720459,0.05940556,-0.022029167,0.062169883,-0.05227036,-0.06289112,-0.036263324,0.06475431,0.049521513,0.050985105,0.055505708,0.037777394,-0.03143737,0.005747967,-0.055946723,-0.0324714,-0.03186481,-0.016272523,-0.068249874,-0.030170888,-0.01612409,-0.037813593,-0.04620049,0.028419856,-0.042457964,-0.007513186,0.025046933,-0.007902253,-0.012165047,0.02266933,-0.04654279,0.040284537,-0.046190944,0.031452015,-0.021612031,-0.024164654,-0.022786176,0.0487583,0.023056991,-0.006022483,0.03815466,-0.011002125,0.03764755,0.057876762,-0.028648729,0.03843414,0.024331566,0.0651627,-0.029959893,-0.014296599,-0.02543038,-0.03325967,-0.063627906,-0.057576865,0.05208583,-0.022588767,0.036083285,0.053203475,-0.06061001,0.0434981,0.06825565,0.0488431,-0.06703251,-0.01957411,0.06826413,0.059024952,0.060259875,-0.067357495,0.043558784,0.050413243,0.0535068,0.006193769,-0.027396733,-0.006751051,0.014340033,0.019779064,-0.058415826,0.04477676,0.008457977,-0.034416214,-0.04163457,-0.005636516,0.011986725,0.048257574,0.036960274,0.006357241,-0.06826118,0.054343663,-0.007016942,0.028322887,-0.0275159,-0.03411809,0.04615064,0.006496454,0.065013066,0.015078013,-0.05927726,0.06766814,-0.06068273,-0.059724048,-0.06176908,0.054244604,-0.06420111,-0.003831602,-0.031336993,-0.04513845,0.04112607,0.06213553,0.006902322,-0.06480246,0.06826405,-0.039184667,-0.005209161,0.020350166,0.05010658,-0.005349967,0.043101214,-0.017731924,-0.06826039,-0.03252729,-0.007601532,-0.040464442,-0.010748134,0.053820465,0.056396566,-0.026479417,-0.054888263,-0.03257829,-0.06572306,0.03626614,-0.057317145,0.06073037,-0.011911181,-0.061404716,-0.052116036,0.006941554,0.033074964,0.05979752,-0.0338413,-0.06494226,0.06823598,-0.03272098,0.002465026,0.06785883,-0.01710976,0.06825987,-0.06800975,-0.05395624,-0.06288155,-0.04745646,0.04274371,-0.067961186,0.04866202,0.058027383,0.060899876,0.02469291,-0.061887436,-0.05582546,0.040966477,0.008396376,-0.059701256,-0.00981911,0.023521919,-0.024611756,0.051248547,0.01572956,-0.021615699,0.064346835,-0.03785962,-0.004066689,-0.05827298,0.062425595,-0.05724321,-0.06469537,0.004501147,0.030125804,0.01773462,-0.059588354,0.04714719,-0.040491268,-0.05104336,-0.06242973,-0.043554325,0.005531281,-0.02291719,-0.066601835,0.06529538,0.043444827,0.054155055,0.04206087,-0.010185034,-0.033846278,-0.022716088,-0.033435665,0.003263512,-0.039412748,0.06060831,-0.06728057,-0.06801464,0.05595176,0.060530785,-0.0578066,-0.058846794,0.009919638,-0.048995458,-0.025594804,-0.010731709,0.046617262,0.022573324,-0.06819837,-0.04128126,0.013557851,-0.067347966,0.035531808,-0.019451847,-0.04211238,0.0537331,-0.006337759,-0.007725157,0.0673541,0.050842997,0.04480028,-0.03264299,-0.0519533,0.005677757,-0.039625604,-0.06712434,0.053787436,0.04975827,0.026550183,-0.06825083,0.067815624,-0.020938471,-0.052893538,-0.025180684,-0.02953538,0.067938305,0.02894899,-0.000425475,-0.04252117,-0.032873414,-0.013219534,0.033424325,0.032532237,0.02109429,0.05821993,-0.031173965,-0.024221715,-0.011502251,-0.054841746,-0.06738362,0.050669078,-0.06778872,0.03446578,0.036516026,0.015265895,-0.036672488,0.03379169,-0.04777036,-0.06048592,0.000316042,0.05296579,0.049501516,-0.028051227,-0.030984076,-0.04719865,-

Detection and genotyping of bovine diarrhea virus by reverse transcription-polymerase chain amplification of the 5′ untranslated region,"Abstract A reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was developed to differentiate the bovine diarrhea virus (BVDV) from other pestiviruses, and to determine the genotype of the BVDV isolates. For this purpose, primer pairs were selected in the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR). The primers BE and B2 were located in highly conserved regions and were pestivirus-specific. Two primer pairs named B3B4 and B5B6 were specific of BVDV genotypes I and II, respectively. With this technique, an amplification product of the expected size was obtained with either the B3B4 or the B5B6 primer pairs for the 107 BVDV isolates tested but not for BDV or CSFV. For some isolates that were grouped in the genotype II, sequence analysis of the PCR fragments confirmed their classification into this

Sequence and analysis of bovine enteritic coronavirus (F15) genome I.—Sequence of the gene coding for the nucleocapsid protein; analysis of the predicted protein,"Summary Sequences encoding the N protein of the bovine enteritic coronavirus-F15 strain (BECV-F15) have been cloned in PBR322 plasmid using cDNA produced by priming with oligo-dT on purified viral genomic RNA. Some 265 insert-containing clones were studied. Hybridization of these inserts with poly(A)+ RNA extracted from infected cells led to the conclusion that they were located at the 3′-end of the genome. After subcloning in M13 phage DNA, clones were sequenced by the Sanger technique. A 1,710-nucleotide sequence corresponding to the gene coding for the viral N-protein was established. It shows 2 overlapping open reading frames (ORF). The 3′-non-coding end of the gene has an 8-nucleotide sequence in common with the homologous genome areas of MHV, TGE and IBV viruses. This sequence may represent the polymerase RNA binding site. An upstream sequence surrounding the first AUG of the smaller ORF corresponds to a potentially functional initiation codon. The sequence of the primary translation product deduced from the DNA sequence predicts a polypeptide of 207 amino acids (22.9 Kd) with a high leucine (19.8%) content, possessing a hydrophobic N-terminal end. The larger ORF has a coding capacity of 448 amino acids (49.4 Kd), corresponding to the N-protein molecular weight. The deduced protein possesses 43 serine residues (9.6% of the total amino acid content) which may be phosporylated and involved in N-protein/RNA binding. N-protein also has 5 regions with a high basic amino acid content. One of them is also serine-rich and has a strong homology site with MHV, TGE and IBV viruses. In the first part of the N-terminal, a 12-amino-acid sequence (PRWYFYYLGTGP) is highly conserved for BECV-F15, JHM, TGE and IBV viruses. BCV Mebus strain and BECV-F15 have only minor differences in their N-protein

VIRUS-INDUCED WHEEZING IN CHILDREN Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Rhinovirus,"The strong association between infantile wheezing and respiratory tract infections caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been well established. In studies of older children, rhinovirus becomes the major virus associated with asthma. These relationships are outlined in the box on page 36. In the past, this relationship was more difficult to appreciate, because rhinovirus does not always grow well in culture. In addition, the linkage between asthma and atopy during childhood has raised the question whether viral infections alone can precipitate exacerbations of asthma. Use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to measure viral nucleic acid material has provided the opportunity to study virus-induced wheezing among children in greater detail, and investigations of experimental rhinovirus infections in adults have demonstrated how this virus can augment both the early and late phase manifestations of airway hyperreactivity. This article reviews recent advances that have enhanced our understanding of virus-induced wheezing, along with new information indicating that interactions between viral infections and allergic inflammation may be critical to the pathogenesis of acute

"A prospective, community-based study on virologic assessment among elderly people with and without symptoms of acute respiratory infection","Abstract Background and objective Community-based elderly studies concerning microbiology of acute respiratory infections are scarce. Data on subclinical infections are even totally absent, although asymptomatic persons might act as a source of respiratory infections. Methods In a 1-year community-based study, we prospectively investigated the possible virologic cause of acute respiratory infections in 107 symptomatic case episodes and 91 symptom-free control periods. Participants, persons ⩾60 years, reported daily the presence of respiratory symptoms in a diary. Virologic assessment was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology. Results In 58% of the case episodes a pathogen was demonstrated, the most common being rhinoviruses (32%), coronaviruses (17%), and influenzaviruses (7%). The odds ratio for demonstrating a virus in cases with symptoms vs. controls without symptoms was 30.0 (95% confidence interval 10.2–87.6). In 4% of the symptom-free control periods a virus was detected. Conclusion This study supports the importance of rhinovirus infections in community-dwelling elderly persons, whereas asymptomatic elderly persons can also harbor pathogens as detected by PCR, and thus might be a source of infection for their environment.",-0.010059753,0.055442706,-0.015792275,-0.036758956,0.05352208,0.047518846,0.038962,-0.016450882,0.044324122,0.038986128,0.065594524,-0.025414519,0.054762386,0.027559318,0.06358893,-0.06359802,-0.06559356,0.03143071,0.006055865,-0.056225687,-0.057035852,0.003583403,-0.042159937,0.002179152,0.011532526,0.0572511,-0.032986484,-0.048650872,-0.000273769,-0.013726761,0.05106007,0.06559461,-0.010416374,-0.013640382,-0.017184295,-0.04007079,-0.0655155,-0.06379465,-0.04869362,-0.032830726,0.039617423,0.024733892,0.05090393,-0.009448879,-0.024271816,0.051699102,-0.008620894,-0.034643985,0.007460165,-0.05209148,-0.0485519,-0.032341897,-0.065160185,-0.046914175,-0.051039964,0.022173965,-0.059939183,0.032696757,0.06525204,0.052725226,-0.032536417,0.042788494,-0.016257789,-0.053620834,-0.013164663,-0.06496398,0.050099943,-0.057287686,0.058756627,-0.062838666,0.03679045,0.000374264,0.03908403,0.064875446,-0.004216659,-0.03248563,-0.06318278,-0.045795288,-0.06554167,0.027047602,0.025091887,0.051353157,0.061726034,0.011172158,-0.028721536,0.05959361,0.014198655,0.053278062,-0.019879188,-0.06356733,0.008595747,-0.035691958,-0.037418418,-0.02529344,-0.011132922,0.06428615,0.05308885,0.06271555,0.06486595,-0.033692483,-0.06273479,-0.027832069,-0.05236458,0.053510215,-0.009209141,0.0333627,0.054470874,-0.025102146,0.018876597,-0.013678162,-0.06368627,0.04878666,0.057426304,0.03858441,0.06314482,0.011837011,-0.04441783,0.029438898,0.015592463,0.03735615,0.014355233,0.06042265,0.007820161,-0.05039674,0.06022854,0.03559691,-0.047983162,0.013776007,0.037274517,0.05244597,-0.049396593,0.06559478,0.046015378,-0.023945391,0.010471529,-0.06515822,0.04405963,0.018248443,-0.019452276,-0.052816607,-0.04765628,0.06557685,-0.06365808,-0.04700913,0.018383745,0.019035844,0.013929977,-0.06458919,0.062143236,-0.021175012,0.041941263,-0.03000511,-0.05787309,-0.05369179,0.03500077,-0.028316505,0.05844684,0.050770253,0.04429839,-0.005751472,-0.02717123,-0.038735382,-0.044341337,0.00812822,-0.029829452,-0.061415333,-0.044820055,0.06320366,-0.05903414,-0.06052257,0.027986879,-0.065583974,-0.05985491,-0.050609782,-0.043715946,-4.68E-05,0.003827221,-0.04912058,0.03907179,-0.016421761,0.04281697,0.048634708,-0.047707267,0.035645287,0.063846655,0.017132182,-0.06470713,-0.039325077,0.001653054,0.049966134,0.06538492,-0.058505762,0.01909203,0.047516227,0.051556434,-0.03579489,0.006564982,0.059391566,0.026090462,0.000885055,0.007490608,0.061930858,-0.015940573,0.02499206,0.056644462,-0.023455946,-0.007227965,-0.058612615,0.00344234,0.0646773,0.05425726,-0.000149548,0.037725274,0.0642503,-0.05189831,-0.000358284,0.007873196,0.040674534,-0.03365219,-0.008214253,0.0441481,-0.048983388,0.026560673,0.00274378,-0.010772706,0.0089781,-0.062581636,-0.06544507,0.057295706,0.05865222,0.049801238,0.06292246,0.05396545,-0.06559,0.022235684,0.005826386,0.05521067,-0.05671563,-0.027123837,-0.04277991,-0.018401949,0.051836446,0.005873561,-0.061056755,0.06348211,-0.058298957,-0.032033976,0.04772381,0.06260583,-0.06020382,0.046389002,-0.044895817,-0.057705656,-0.022832636,0.063363455,0.056065332,-0.003193448,0.06559477,0.041065723,0.050882895,0.035741266,-0.012610557,-0.04555672,0.014224057,-0.054296896,0.034270998,-0.003837869,-0.034079432,0.059550323,-0.002349711,-0.01232133,0.05244447,-0.061364375,-0.060438022,-0.0244411,-0.06094213,0.052654922,-0.029239176,0.063499205,-0.025510773,-0.061890464,-0.03707658,-0.038418353,-0.000641183,-0.05434303,-0.0424363,-0.01746974,0.03819184,-0.037696432,0.049534194,0.056686945,0.002995021,0.05035208,-0.029187387,-0.04105112,-0.04347241,-0.051341083,-0.041269936,-0.04160332,0.058165967,-0.048433825,0.05880269,0.029209584,-0.005122717,-0.06306186,0.058432054,0.050637145,-0.057865884,0.050108828,-0.04462957,0.018589964,-0.05414155,-0.011143052,0.046177547,0.06548622,-0.019938873,0.047566142,0.03244009,0.0645009,0.048166607,-0.048873406,0.035819743,0.04686471,-0.037504435,-0.0601366,0.06557141,0.005678081,-0.047007505,-0.065444,-0.050420996,0.007707268,0.04684708,-0.042940572,0.06347714,0.049869962,0.022990052,-0.006752029,0.056882996,-0.009422887,-0.043951675,0.001963499,-0.020783946,0.064951375,0.06411953,-0.06461826,-0.065578915,0.06302528,0.062442806,-0.058402784,-0.06550734,-0.001653132,0.027193265,-0.019285213,0.039612517,0.060251046,-0.051841777,-0.0655883,-0.0457177,0.04973783,-0.036711078,0.017580803,-0.05404441,-0.061641913,0.058214493,-0.057272606,0.020346748,0.064747155,0.06436237,0.030363144,-0.014265591,-0.033504423,0.02686007,-0.06303223,0.006864956,0.060159147,0.05528927,-0.003690723,-0.01217035,0.01132434,0.026406476,-0.027571013,-0.009995204,0.002865461,0.008200453,-0.033183426,-0.044332985,0.017765885,-0.06419804,-0.02939222,0.058436867,0.043538805,0.05471254,-0.05682196,-0.041947596,-0.030803071,0.000924982,-0.014298129,-0.0653122,0.05760443,-0.054699127,-0.051565338,0.025176955,0.04165782,0.056272943,-0.004233983,-0.05054614,-0.035145994,0.018744169,0.03094684,0.032013725,0.056020744,0.005409905,-0.0387

Progress towards a higher taxonomy of viruses,"Summary The current consensus view is that a higher hierarchical taxonomy of viruses cannot be established for two reasons. Firstly, viruses appear to be polyphyletic in origin, with several sets of viruses arising by different, independent routes at different times. Secondly, subsequent virus adaptation for survival in different host/vector combinations has involved the selective acquisition of additional genes by a process of cassette or modular evolution, with these additional gene modules coming from other viruses or host genetic material. Thus, depending on the gene product used for comparison, different phylogenetic relationships can be deduced. Further virus adaptation can arise by reassortment of segmented genomes, gene duplication, deletions, frameshift mutations, point mutations or de novo development of new gene products from existing, unused reading frames. The solution to the first objection is to place all viruses in a separate kingdom and assign the current viruses to several phyla that reflect these diverse origins. The solution to the second objection is to consider the core module of replication machinery as the major criterion on which to make the initial assignments to classes and orders. For RNA viruses, the major criterion is the sequence identity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Using this criterion, the positive strand RNA viruses can be assigned to five classes that correspond to the recently recognized supergroups of RNA viruses. These five classes contain four, three, three, three and one order(s) respectively. These fourteen orders contain 31 virus families (including 17 families of plant viruses) and 48 genera (including 30 genera of plant viruses). This approach confirms the separation of the alphaviruses and flaviviruses into two families, the Togaviridae and Flaviridae, but suggests that several other current taxonomic assignments, such as the pestiviruses, hepatitis C virus, rubiviruses, hepatitis E virus and arteriviruses, may be wrong. The coronaviruses and toroviruses appear to be distinct families in distinct orders, not distinct genera of the same family as currently classified. In addition, the luteoviruses are split into two families and apple chlorotic leaf spot virus appears not to be a closterovirus but a new genus of the Potexviridae. From an analysis of the polymerase dendrograms of the dsRNA viruses, it appears that they are not closely related to each other, but belong to four additional classes (Partitiviridae, Reoviridae, Birnaviridae and Cystoviridae) and one additional order (Totiviridae) of one of the classes of positive ssRNA viruses in the same subphylum as the positive strand RNA viruses. The negative strand virus polymerase relationships confirm the assignment of the negative strand viruses to two orders in a single class in a separate subphylum of the RNA viruses. This review includes preliminary data suggesting that the DNA viruses can also be assigned to higher taxa on the basis of the sequence identities of their highly conserved DNA polymerases. The suggested use of viral polymerases to establish higher order relationships is similar in principle to the use of highly conserved ribosomal RNA gene sequences in prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxonomy. This review also discusses the assignment of 33 of the 35 groups of plant viruses into genera of 25 families based on the nature of the genome and its arrangement, the level of sequence identity and, to a lesser extent, particle

Evaluation of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) for the detection of rota viruses: applications of the assay,"Summary Our aim was to evaluate the reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) technique for the detection of rotavirus shedding by infected children as a routine diagnostic procedure, in comparison to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), electron microscopy (EM) and polyacrylamide gel etectrophoresis (PAGE) of rotavirus double stranded RNA. Two-hundred and twenty stool specimens were collected from infants and young children with diarrhoea, and 10–20% faecal suspensions were made. Several methods of rotavirus dsRNA extraction were assayed. Electrophoretic analysis of viral RNA was carried out on 10% polyacrylamide gols followed by silver staining. RT/PCR was performed using oligonucleotide primers specific for both 3′ and 5′ ends of the rotavirus gene encoding VP7 which ere highly conserved among group A rotaviruses. Following RNA extraction with phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitation, RT/PCR could detect rotaviral RNA in only 11 of 25 samples known to contain rotaviruses by conventional methods. The purification of RNA extracts by CF11 cellulose and the application of the RNAID method were equally effective in extracting RNA and/or removing inhibitory substances from the faecal samples. RT/PCR led to the detection of 66 positive samples from 220 specimens tested (30%). whilst 64 specimens were positive by EUSA (29%), 59 (26.3%) by PAGE and 56 (25.4%) by EM. In our study, RT/PCR was 100 times more sensitive than the ELISA test in detecting rotaviruses serially diluted in a faecal suspension. Although RT/PCR is theoretically much more sensitive than ELISA, PAGE and EM for detection of rotaviruses, great care must be taken to remove inhibitory substances from the enzymatic reactions. We do not consider that RT/PCR should replace immunoassays with high sensitivity and specificity for rotavirus testing in faecal samples, although this technique has other applications, like the

Infectious exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease associated with respiratory viruses and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae,"Abstract Infectious exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been reported to occur with both viral and bacterial pathogens. In this study, 35 exacerbations associated with the isolation of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae from sputum were identified as part of a prospective longitudinal study. Samples from these patients were subjected to immunoassays to identify a new immune response to the homologous isolate of non-typeable H. influenzae to more accurately assess a bacterial etiology. These patients also were studied carefully for evidence of viral infection using viral culture, serology and polymerase chain reaction-based assays. Sixteen of 35 exacerbations (45.7%) were associated with evidence of acute viral infection and 11 of the 35 exacerbations (31.4%) were associated with the development of new serum IgG to homologous non-typeable H. influenzae. Overall, evidence of infection with a respiratory virus or non-typeable H. influenzae was seen in 24 of 35 exacerbations (68.6%). No association between viral infection and immune response to non-typeable H. influenzae was observed, although a trend toward an immune response to non-typeable H. influenzae and absence of viral infection was seen. The results show that exacerbations in adults with COPD were associated with infection caused by virus alone, non-typeable H. influenzae alone, or virus and non-typeable H. influenzae

Detection of Human Metapneumovirus in Hospitalized Children with Acute Respiratory Tract Infection Using Real-time RT-PCR in a Hospital in Northern Taiwan,"Background/purpose Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a newly discovered respiratory pathogen. This prospective hospital-based study investigated the clinical role and features of hMPV in Taiwan. Methods Respiratory specimens collected from hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection between September 1, 2003 and April 10, 2005 were screened for metapneumovirus using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results During the study period, 930 specimens were obtained from 926 hospitalized children. After exclusion of 200 cases due to lack of clinical evidence of airway infection or diseases with known etiology, 726 were included in the analysis. Among these, 33 children had a positive result for hMPV infection. The majority of these patients were admitted during spring and early summer. Twenty-one (63.6%) were younger than 2 years of age. hMPV accounted for 13.3% of respiratory infections occurring between the ages of 18 and 24 months and was as common a respiratory pathogen as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in that age group. The 11 patients (33.3%) with underlying diseases had a similar disease course to those without underlying diseases. A co-pathogen was found in 11 patients (33.3%). Infected children between 2 and 5 years of age had significantly higher titers of hMPV in their respiratory specimens (103.88 copies/mL) than children younger than 2 years (102.26 copies/mL) (p = 0.013) and children older than 5 years (102.25 copies/mL) (p = 0.005). hMPV positive cases were significantly older than those with RSV infection (p = 0.002) and had a shorter duration of hospitalization (p = 0.001), fewer days of oxygen use (p = 0.001) and higher levels of C-reactive protein (p = 0.004). Conclusion Metapneumovirus circulates in children in northern Taiwan during spring and early summer. hMPV was the most common respiratory pathogen in children aged between 18 and 24 months hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection.

Décès brutal et infection à virus Influenza A chez un enfant de deux ans : étude d’un cas autopsique,"Résumé La grippe de l’enfant est fréquente mais passe souvent inaperçue. Les formes gravissimes ou létales sont en revanche exceptionnelles. Observation. – Nous rapportons une observation de décès brutal d’un enfant de 23 mois chez lequel le virus Influenza A a été isolé postmortem par polymerase chain reaction (PCR) dans le poumon et dont les lésions anatomopathologiques étaient celles décrites dans la grippe maligne. Conclusion. – Devant un tableau de décès non expliqué voire une mort subite du nourrisson ou du jeune enfant, les causes infectieuses en particulier virales doivent être cherchées soigneusement avec recherche virale par PCR recommandée, les autres techniques pouvant rester négatives. Abstract Influenza A virus infections are common in childhood and infancy and are often underdiagnosed while serious or letal forms are rare. Case-report. – We describe a case of sudden death in a two-year-old boy. Pathologic findings at autopsy were consistent with Myxovirus influenzae A virus infection and the virus was isolated by post mortem PCR. Conclusion. – In the case of sudden death in infants, especially if pathologic findings are compatible with a viral infection, PCR may allow identification of the causative

"Infections nosocomiales à coronavirus humains chez le nouveau-né 1 Travail financé en partie par la Société française de pédiatrie (bourse de DEA), le ministère de la santé (PHRC 97) et le CCLIN–Ouest. A. Gagneur est boursier de la Société française de pédiatrie.","Résumé Les coronavirus humains sont des virus enveloppés à ARN de la famille des Coronaviridae avec deux sérogroupes identifiés : 229-E et OC-43. Ces virus possèdent le plus grand ARN viral connu. Ce génome est un ARN simple brin positif associé à une protéine phosphorylée de la nucléocapside, la protéine N. L’enveloppe des coronavirus humains contient deux ou trois glycoprotéines membranaires : S ou spike protein, M ou protéine de membrane et HE ou hémagglutine-estérase. Le rôle pathogène de ces virus est mal connu en raison des difficultés diagnostiques. Cependant la mise au point de l’immunofluorescence avec anticorps monoclonaux et des techniques d’amplification génique permet de nouvelles recherches épidémiologiques. Les coronavirus peuvent survivre jusqu’à six jours en suspension et trois heures après séchage, ce qui suggère un rôle nosocomial potentiel. Deux études prospectives réalisées dans une unité de réanimation néonatale et pédiatrique ont révélé une relation significative entre l’existence de prélèvement nasopharyngés positifs et la survenue de symptômes respiratoires. Des prélèvements positifs chez le personnel suggèrent une contamination patient-personnel ou personnel–patient. En raison de leur survie possible sur les surfaces et de l’efficacité démontrée des agents désinfectants, des mesures universelles de prévention associant lavage des mains et désinfection des surfaces peuvent être proposées. Abstract Human coronaviruses, with two known serogroups named 229-E and OC-43, are enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses. The large RNA is surrounded by a nucleoprotein (protein N). The envelop contains 2 or 3 glycoproteins: spike protein (or protein S), matrix protein (or protein M) and a hemagglutinin (or protein HE). Their pathogen role remains unclear because their isolation is difficult. Reliable and rapid methods as immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction allow new researches on epidemiology. Human coronaviruses can survive for as long as 6 days in suspension and 3 hours after drying on surfaces, suggesting that they could be a source of hospital-acquired infections. Two prospective studies conducted in a neonatal and paediatric intensive care unit demonstrated a significant association of coronavirus-positive naso-pharyngal samples with respiratory illness in hospitalised preterm neonates. Positive samples from staff suggested either a patient-to-staff or a staff-to-patient transmission.

Virologie : l’apport de la biologie moléculaire dans le diagnostic microbiologique en pneumopédiatrie,"Résumé Les outils traditionnels du diagnostic virologique comprennent la recherche antigénique directe par immunofluorescence (IF) ou test immunoenzymatique (EIA), et l’isolement en culture. Les techniques d’IF ou EIA ont une sensibilité en général légèrement inférieure à celle de la culture, mais elles permettent de détecter également une fraction d’échantillons faussement négatifs en culture. Les résultats de plusieurs équipes, utilisant des techniques de reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), montrent que les méthodes moléculaires détectent plus d’échantillons positifs que les méthodes traditionnelles. Le travail est en cours pour élargir le nombre de virus identifiés par des RT-PCR multiplex et découvrir de nouveaux virus, tels le métapneumovirus humain, en cause dans les atteintes respiratoires de l’enfant. En conclusion, afin de concilier rapidité, contrôle des coûts et un fort taux de détection des virus respiratoires, l’utilisation combinée de l’IF et de la RT-PCR multiplex semble ce jour la meilleure façon de progresser dans le diagnostic des maladies respiratoires de l’enfant. Summary The conventionnal tools used for virological diagnosis include direct antigen detection by immunofluorescence (IFA) or an immunoenzymatic test (EIA), and viral isolation technique (VIT). In most cases, IFA and EIA have a slightly lower sensitivity than VIT but are also able to detect some VIT-negative samples. Results of several teams using RT-PCR technologies show that the molecular methods detect more positive cases than the conventional tools. Work is under way to expand the number of viruses detected by multiplex RT-PCR and to determine wether newly discovered viruses, such as human metapneumovirus, contribute to burden of paediatric lower respiratory infections. In conclusion, according to requirements of speed, low cost of the methods, and to achieve the highest rate of detection of respiratory viruses, the combined use of IFA and multiplex RT-PCR is today likely to be the best way to improve diagnosis of respiratory illnesses in

Molecular Screening by Polymerase Chain Reaction Detects Panleukopenia Virus DNA in Formalin-Fixed Hearts from Cats with Idiopathic Cardiomyopathy and Myocarditis,"Abstract Viral myocarditis has been suggested as an etiology for cardiomyopathy in several mammalian species. Myocarditis and idiopathic cardiomyopathy have been reported in the domestic cat, although a viral etiology has not been demonstrated. Because of the continuing interest in the potential relationship between viral myocarditis and cardiomyopathy, we evaluated hearts from cats with spontaneous, idiopathic cardiomyopathy for viral genomic material within myocytes by polymerase chain reaction, and for the presence of myocarditis by light microscopy. Thirty-one (31) formalin-fixed hearts from domestic cats who died of idiopathic cardiomyopathy were randomly selected from pathology archives. Seventeen (17) formalin-fixed hearts from healthy cats were similarly selected as normal controls. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to evaluate myocardial tissue for the presence of viral genome from feline panleukopenia virus, herpes virus, calici virus, and corona virus. Hearts were examined using light microscopy for histologic evidence of myocarditis according to the Dallas criteria. Panleukopenia virus was identified by PCR in 10 of 31 cats with cardiomyopathy but in none of the controls. Neither cardiomyopathic or control cats tested positive by PCR for herpes virus, calici virus, and corona virus. Myocarditis was detected by histologic examination in 18 of 31 cardiomyopathic cats and in none of 17 control cats.

Chlamydia pneumoniae and Exacerbations of Asthma in Adults,"Background Chlamydia pneumoniae is a frequent causative agent of acute respiratory disease and has been recently reported as a possible case of asthma. Objective We assessed the prevalence of C. pneumoniae infections in adult patients with acute exacerbations of asthma. Methods One hundred sixty-eight adult patients with acute exacerbations of asthma and 108 control subjects matched for age, sex, and smoking status were studied. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained from all subjects and analyzed by isolation in cell culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for C. pneumoniae. Serum samples were also obtained and tested for C. pneumoniae-specific antibodies by the microimmunofluorescence test. Results C. pneumoniae was isolated from two (1.2%) asthma patients and none from controls and detected by PCR from nine (5.4%) cases and one (0.9%) control. Both culture positive specimens were also positive in PCR. Further, serologic evidence of acute C. pneumoniae infection was present in 15 (8.9%) of asthma patients and in three (2.8%) of controls (P = .048). The prevalence of C. pneumoniae-specific IgG and IgA was significantly higher in asthma cases than in controls (IgG >/= 1:16; 85.1% versus 67.6%, P = .001; IgA ≥ 1:16: 47.6% versus 16.7%, P < .001). Mean titer of IgG and IgA was also significantly greater in asthma cases than in controls (IgG: 38.8 versus 18.1, P = .0001; IgA: 17.2 versus 6.1, P = .0001). Conclusion Our data suggest that C. pneumoniae infection may trigger acute exacerbations of adult

Detection of animal pathogens by using the polymerasechain reaction (PCR),"Summary The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a nucleic acid-based technique that enables the rapid and sensitive detection of specific micro-organisms. Although this technique is widely used in veterinary research, it has not yet found applications in routine microbiological analysis of veterinary clinical samples. However, advances in sample preparation together with the increasing availability of specific gene sequences will probably lead to the more widespread diagnostic use of PCR in the future. PCR is likely to have a strong impact in the epidemiology, treatment and prevention of animal infectious

The role of polymerase chain reaction and its newer developments in feline medicine,"Abstract We give a brief overview on the principles of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), quantitative competitive PCR and real-time PCR (TagMan technology). The literature dealing with PCR and its role in the diagnosis, pathogenesis and research of infectious diseases of the domestic cat is reviewed. Cross-contaminations which occasionally occur during handling of amplified DNA may be an important problem in the PCR laboratory. In many infectious diseases, PCR results are difficult to interpret as their predictive positive and negative values are not always known. Newer assays, such as TagMan procedures, are becoming increasingly reliable and cost-effective. It can be expected that additional knowledge on how to interpret PCR results will soon be

Ordinary and opportunistic enteropathogens associated with diarrhea in senegalese adults in relation to human immunodeficiency virus serostatus,"Abstract Objectives: A survey was conducted in Dakar, Senegal, to identify major types and prevalences of bacteria, parasites, fungi, and Rotaviruses associated with diarrhea in relation to human immunodeficieny virus (HIV) serostatus with the goal to provide guidance to physicians for case management. Methods: Etiologic agents were identified in a case-control study: cases were HIV-infected patients with diarrhea (HIV+ D+) and HIV seronegative patients with diarrhea (HIV− D+); controls were HIV-infected patients without diarrhea (HIV+ D−) and seronegative controls without diarrhea (HID− D−). Ordinary enteric pathogens were identified by conventional methods. Different Escherichia coli pathotypes were characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), identification of HEp-2 cell adherence pattern, Sereny test, GIvl1-ELISA, and the suckling mouse assay. Opportunistic parasites, such as Cryptosporidium and Microsporidium, were identified by the Kinyoun method and trichromic stain of Weber, respectively. Rotaviruses were identified with a commercial latex agglutination kit. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by the disk diffusion method. Results: Among the 594 patients examined, 158 were HIV+ D+, 121 were HIV− D+, 160 were HIV+ D−, and 155 were HIV− D−. The main etiologies of diarrhea were different according to HIV serostatus of patients. In immunocompetent adults the main causes of diarrhea were Shigella sp (12.4%), Entamoeba histolytica (10.7%), Salmonella enterica (6.6%), and Giardia (4.9%). In the immunocompromised host the more frequent pathogens were enteroaggregative E. coli (19.6%), Microsporidium (9.4%), Cryptosporidium sp (8.2%), Rotavirus (8.2%), Shigella sp (7.6%), Candida albicans (7.6%), E. histolytica (5.1%), S. enterica (4.4%), and Isospora belli (4.4%). Also, Blastocystis hominis has to be considered as an opportunistic parasite, because it was identified only in HIV-infected patients, with higher prevalence in adults with diarrhea (2.5% in HIV+ D+ patients; 0.6% in HIV+ D− patients). High level of asymptomatic carriage of Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura and some cases of multiple infections were observed. Fungi, Cryptosporidium sp and Microsporidium sp, were often identified in patients with low CD4 counts (range, 79–250 cells/mL). Independently from HIV-serostatus, CD4 count was lower in diarrheic persons, suggesting that diarrhea is a debilitating illness and that effective management of diarrhea can prevent immunosuppression. Isolated enteropathogenic strains displayed high resistance to most antibiotics used in Senegal for treating diarrhea (ampicillin, tetracycline, cotrimoxazole); they were susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. Conclusion: These epidemiologic data suggest that guidelines for the management of diarrhea during HIV infection in Dakar should be updated.",-0.05257766,0.05368605,0.014269115,0.025237774,0.053295977,0.050774056,0.04612862,-0.011749518,-0.014369248,-0.026154008,0.05454991,-0.039669458,0.03742478,0.023522707,0.05439936,-0.054227725,-0.05454991,-0.037024714,-0.0209007,0.04493672,-0.053886656,-0.054498095,-0.047732983,-0.050205108,0.05438064,0.041494656,-0.054205645,0.042211667,-0.032336045,0.047802962,0.036620423,0.05454991,0.04979762,-0.054478783,0.054462302,0.004903102,-0.054549266,-0.050849285,-0.049537774,-0.006624777,0.039996594,0.004260217,-0.02098412,0.050811566,-0.035903092,0.05443533,-0.051401313,-0.051065344,0.054379806,-0.053487167,-0.052898057,0.011060466,-0.05454885,0.04423456,-0.048187852,0.053001914,-0.043740142,-0.05368133,0.05453432,0.050121993,-0.023077864,0.047121957,0.03201938,-0.022667697,-0.010350572,-0.054500826,0.051743664,0.03138427,0.04014341,-0.05448906,0.020008886,0.053483885,0.019547515,0.05417747,0.009664814,-0.036702674,-0.03796246,-0.008541487,-0.05454918,-0.03733104,-0.054162078,0.054329578,0.05362456,0.05272341,0.03796552,0.05451685,-0.036368437,0.04892908,-0.046601593,-0.05442804,-0.05039398,0.014150186,-0.031049434,-0.008261452,0.04071517,0.047040854,0.04960677,0.054153554,0.054388758,-0.009061385,0.039118003,0.027371295,-0.033100177,0.051796705,0.049737595,0.008140476,0.050632864,0.004746132,0.016234748,-0.022278814,-0.047800504,-0.015624193,0.05380907,0.046532832,0.054546487,0.002433794,-0.05303124,0.010766371,0.0532764,0.035668496,0.054539304,0.022713462,0.023467481,-0.003478257,0.05167659,0.05175436,0.037992157,0.0529868,-0.004019026,-0.021195121,-0.050075896,0.05454991,0.05429703,-0.026271582,0.051239535,-0.053547166,0.04876404,0.006078664,-0.054058295,-0.051264536,-0.04453814,0.054549903,-0.054025456,-0.043732844,0.050801564,0.046524126,-0.02294374,-0.051975932,0.054049276,-0.050984155,0.053810738,-0.022983406,-0.047491923,0.053546365,0.05427055,0.032255135,0.05454965,0.04126029,0.05400553,-0.049475852,-0.028392933,-0.031018171,0.01948234,0.045295455,0.03940358,-0.051456854,0.013044964,0.053103436,-0.045953672,-0.05402703,0.037161097,-0.05454982,-0.047876388,-0.054509137,-0.05228835,0.049745798,-0.036784004,-0.005244165,0.053784057,-0.015128579,0.051368736,0.042804394,-0.042208068,0.04870367,0.054325957,0.05132512,-0.054398574,-0.04639743,0.048814073,0.053180832,0.0545234,-0.041539658,0.045098197,0.039703343,0.054312427,-0.05163046,-0.05084318,0.048583664,-0.0510961,-0.027473526,-0.05051897,0.053919766,0.054018673,0.016751153,0.050607376,0.028740803,0.040147666,0.010655233,0.054403596,0.053900488,0.04254071,0.03730972,-0.022533238,0.054434564,-0.054478213,0.053536206,0.04487725,0.05227166,0.03973276,0.05017652,0.048321307,-0.027503671,-0.011170798,-0.05288688,0.05076985,-0.048779074,-0.054500647,-0.05378503,0.029804554,0.036795318,0.054442797,0.05324064,0.05421427,-0.054549884,0.03962651,0.045124423,0.043795507,-0.05345577,-0.04710141,0.015374681,0.028885985,0.054364454,0.051918138,0.051377643,0.054515343,-0.007014127,0.02965027,0.05297817,0.052128967,-0.054323737,0.048206095,0.049960498,-0.044812925,-0.044885296,0.05452789,0.04257347,-0.04962321,0.05454991,-0.024602666,0.009879475,0.050605863,0.0527694,-0.017891593,0.045533814,-0.052228797,0.052412454,0.036558628,-0.027157549,0.046582058,0.041699264,-0.018337347,0.054541185,-0.054466553,-0.054541104,-0.03940014,0.013899274,0.05164959,0.021870196,0.054539893,-0.046466984,0.009421716,0.019370163,-0.043308645,-0.021374043,0.003108541,-0.027024856,-0.048445083,0.051730424,-0.031770952,0.054471705,0.05444261,-0.006283251,0.054439854,-0.04166525,-0.048643984,-0.047809117,0.024132697,-0.05226837,-0.044276223,0.054469988,-0.022229029,0.04939825,-0.00280231,0.05005938,-0.037536148,0.050680775,0.001168407,-0.052002747,0.005387798,-0.031993985,-0.02289722,-0.0543957,-0.002189551,0.052840877,0.05454138,-0.000347206,0.05099057,0.03860979,0.05399838,0.053415045,-0.0534513,0.054398965,0.053795762,-0.05430458,-0.053570542,0.05454795,-0.015939057,-0.053941708,-0.054546703,-0.048304833,0.004613258,0.043795217,-0.053082008,0.054350954,-0.035000954,-0.028964845,-0.04976393,-0.023323879,0.02651381,-0.027479796,0.053201683,-0.05349665,0.054520894,0.05337418,-0.054373927,-0.05454991,0.05313333,0.028936988,-0.027187722,-0.054447986,-0.03932934,0.016235875,-0.04231048,0.054476675,0.051856883,0.031889915,-0.054549877,0.03960035,0.052348495,-0.012354199,0.049810942,-0.0543275,-0.054471534,0.05171896,0.030310329,0.006693161,0.05454707,-0.03866089,0.051631782,0.029513067,0.048399072,0.043774143,-0.0541125,-0.0410475,0.054549776,0.05424251,0.053427838,-0.022787275,-0.053369533,-0.009668806,0.0471398,0.027071236,0.04261406,-0.037536677,-0.031265028,-0.01643826,-0.054361764,-0.054549254,-0.04564019,-0.051788203,0.051316157,0.051359694,0.04726909,0.03559889,0.017990286,0.038496178,-0.053088725,-0.054376602,0.05444539,-0.054536812,0.035626978,0.014055098,-0.053429145,0.05448567,-0.046770126,-0.05441759,-0.014176787,0.05183482,0.045250595,-0.051590748,0.05310682,0.053683642,-0.04

Molecular analysis of cerebrospinal fluid in viral diseases of the central nervous system,"Abstract The use of nucleic acid (NA) amplification techniques has transformed the diagnosis of viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS). Because of their enhanced sensitivity, these methods enable detection of even low amounts of viral genomes in cerebrospinal fluid. Following more than 10 years of experience, the polymerase chain reaction or other NA-based amplification techniques are nowadays performed in most diagnostic laboratories and have become the test of choice for the diagnosis of several viral CNS infections, such as herpes encephalitis, enterovirus meningitis and other viral infections occurring in human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons. Furthermore, they have been useful to establish a viral etiology in neurological syndromes of dubious origin and to recognise unusual or poorly characterised CNS diseases. Quantitative methods have provided a valuable additional tool for clinical management of these diseases, whereas post-amplification techniques have enabled precise genome characterisation. Current efforts are aiming at further improvement of the diagnostic efficiency of molecular techniques, their speed and standardisation, and to reduce the costs. The most relevant NA amplification strategies and clinical applications of to date will be the object of this

Clinical virology in real time,"Abstract The ability to detect nucleic acids has had and still has a major impact on diagnostics in clinical virology. Both quantitative and qualitative techniques, whether signal or target amplification based systems, are currently used routinely in most if not all virology laboratories. Technological improvements, from automated sample isolation to real time amplification technology, have given the ability to develop and introduce systems for most viruses of clinical interest, and to obtain clinical relevant information needed for optimal antiviral treatment options. Both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) can currently be used together with real time detection to generate results in a short turn-around time and to determine whether variants relevant for antiviral resistance are present. These new technologies enable the introduction of an individual patient disease management concept. Within our clinical setting, we have introduced this e.g. for quantitative detection of Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV) in T-dell depleted allogeneic stem cell transplant patients. This enabled us to develop models for pre-emptive anti B-cell immunotherapy for EBV reactivation, thereby effectively reducing not the incidence of EBV-lymphoproliferative disease but the virus related mortality. Furthermore, additional clinically relevant viruses can now easily be detected simultaneously. It also becomes more feasible to introduce molecular testing for those viruses that can easily be detected using classical virological methods, like culture techniques or antigen detection. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the clinical importance of the additional positive samples detected. It should however be made clear that a complete exchange of technologies is unlikely to occur, and that some complementary technologies should stay operational enabling the discovery of new viruses. The implementation of these molecular diagnostic technologies furthermore warrants the use and introduction of standardized materials as well as participation in international quality control programs. Finally, the use of an internal control throughout the whole procedure not only ensures the accuracy of the results generated, but also is necessary to enable precise quantification of these results and to determine detection thresholds more accurately. Since so many targets do have clinical implications, laboratories might prefer to use universal internal controls before the in-house developed assays should be introduced in clinical virology.",-0.057573125,-0.041154098,-0.04953976,-0.027347524,-0.014130215,0.008314913,0.041875005,0.05073565,-0.019486254,-0.018884014,0.05827426,-0.04968278,0.057534233,-0.000367136,0.042671304,0.023643387,-0.058273666,-0.048858322,-0.0315332,-0.051396236,0.011288029,0.008085113,-0.055416856,0.05356236,-0.04768848,0.051666684,0.009291722,0.027655177,0.014309202,0.017031996,-0.034612417,0.05827441,0.04492657,0.027259493,0.030476768,0.055459905,-0.058003515,-0.03538522,-0.05819957,-0.052042786,-0.036090348,-0.043645717,0.013487289,-0.052848164,-0.008234606,-0.01124915,-0.001509831,0.03094521,-0.010194472,-0.040507775,-0.056744345,0.024146436,-0.057823405,0.03589282,-0.058227926,-0.03633785,-0.04843703,0.05667502,0.056765668,0.012945693,0.023964468,-0.039762758,0.007950823,-0.055170666,-0.010429856,-0.05330265,0.056747273,0.008260238,-0.04632355,-0.05345731,-0.04389329,-0.03037029,0.04980956,0.04752476,-0.010853954,-0.050501995,0.027596807,-0.056794196,-0.058160033,0.05498504,-0.054186698,0.05779574,0.043250345,0.002479355,-0.047490604,-0.01531505,0.00100361,0.029624684,0.05503929,-0.054505374,-0.004110039,0.013892309,-0.042956702,-0.024077516,-0.04817646,0.0522602,0.021383911,0.05823358,0.0581458,-0.056535427,-2.24E-05,-0.019630844,-0.051680073,0.030137692,0.053899195,-0.001137394,0.05459959,-0.000996082,-0.01854767,0.05790661,-0.0525699,0.057933103,0.031079806,-0.030359577,0.057019435,0.052048393,-0.05462648,0.04648095,0.04593082,0.04828909,-0.027355194,0.05725711,0.043452956,-0.025217576,-0.053284887,0.02878501,-0.04461898,-0.003920631,0.04960387,0.054362595,0.047740076,0.058274418,0.04524202,-0.055772856,0.015304906,0.051510066,0.052375518,0.053140484,-0.000544119,-0.05431114,0.024287118,0.05793637,-0.02241215,-0.025683748,0.045838606,-0.058196574,0.056692682,-0.057982016,0.056406803,-0.053565264,0.057502717,-0.05123326,-0.057017557,-0.05794395,0.0581985,-0.011646881,0.05802571,0.03925958,0.0289209,0.036210503,0.04193656,0.009962878,-0.053415395,0.048393928,-0.048651606,-0.021873757,0.048173983,0.02807341,-0.057371367,-0.04007609,-0.0556796,-0.058250066,-0.03203551,0.057722915,-0.0376689,-0.028345848,-0.043373365,-0.00592569,0.05585269,-0.046084143,-0.051844582,0.04854726,0.048927184,-0.01649894,0.057806995,0.022212699,-0.051308718,-0.04095702,0.03747812,0.019540299,0.058006532,-0.056913145,0.007282736,-0.040773794,0.058106065,0.006476216,0.054380722,0.016633283,-0.048752055,-0.050287187,-0.05736452,0.051563915,-0.041143984,0.008636099,0.057686232,-0.05826231,-0.040264037,-0.008340775,0.051257584,0.05787449,0.047416873,-0.05098701,0.058017828,0.05796303,-0.025420628,-0.019456418,0.047662828,0.052922353,-0.049201988,-0.022995425,0.03181025,-0.028656637,0.025386777,0.001424059,-0.051077846,0.05360732,-0.058273073,-0.057819903,-0.018177846,0.05597133,0.04558647,0.05704286,-0.054048996,-0.058130514,0.020623112,0.039026234,-0.03509703,-0.05238407,0.042593777,-0.03278335,-0.029751325,0.003755064,-0.03638539,-0.057138257,0.05189411,-0.008384994,-0.05537849,-0.053027958,0.025680564,-0.058113113,-0.058050655,-0.05282129,0.04554431,0.02447617,0.058024816,0.04469094,-0.05803991,0.058274418,-0.05629791,-0.053637236,0.050539892,-0.027002376,0.03889924,0.047825854,0.004470053,-0.053452235,-0.02411995,0.02570722,-0.0446532,0.038234264,0.028278252,0.026571803,-0.055088237,-0.058166455,0.012217545,-0.0573761,0.057250544,-0.009468096,0.05825077,-0.04537862,-0.058195826,-0.048887983,-0.050062448,0.043410067,-0.058031246,0.007799434,-0.054553796,0.043577645,0.025004677,-0.04027431,0.058066677,-0.00695249,0.05827299,-0.056566898,0.058249176,-0.05292833,-0.019414281,-0.04106326,-0.02832194,0.036071774,0.044597123,0.056794643,0.045754418,0.011478971,-0.058167133,-0.045261756,-0.043420658,-0.051638603,0.05436685,-0.053705424,-0.007400722,0.052492987,0.015115768,-0.050830368,0.058228385,-0.018739622,0.029644402,-0.04424998,0.05590416,-0.057292897,-0.057354357,0.056811627,0.01785993,0.025357014,-0.036910575,0.05784923,-0.013547631,-0.04697151,-0.044432834,-0.027170498,0.055741016,0.052728754,0.042726316,0.058240674,-0.031322148,0.05068338,0.046546448,-0.032655854,0.045180347,-0.045105524,-0.056668974,-0.037258934,0.0497064,0.056929346,-0.058271155,-0.05770863,-0.04613519,0.056740485,-0.057266597,-0.057222307,0.054070257,-0.053793006,0.033846654,0.05246711,0.05802306,0.023624431,-0.058273092,-0.008749125,-0.033295136,-0.04513235,0.016099684,-0.05541412,-0.054376427,0.057892412,-0.020236744,-0.057031073,0.058273885,-0.029426344,-0.039004304,-0.003178757,0.055597395,0.058189817,-0.017191581,-0.058268685,0.057426438,0.038014572,0.002025362,0.030825086,-0.046135392,-0.054885596,-0.05804783,0.000660173,0.058202393,0.04377438,0.03275969,-0.049572818,0.05030947,-0.048349306,0.048370626,0.042322885,-0.04919862,-0.038213804,0.054177497,0.020581998,-0.005941653,0.052200805,0.054291386,-0.058242586,0.047722775,0.04406509,-0.04018435,0.056256704,0.054611087,-0.004022344,0.05677501,-0.045560915,0.02929936,-0.033692338,0.057191767,0.004859619,0

SARS-coronavirus replicates in mononuclear cells of peripheral blood (PBMCs) from SARS patients,"Abstract Background: The etiologic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently identified, positive single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Little is known about the dynamic changes of the viral replicative form in SARS cases. Objectives: Evaluate whether SARS-CoV can infect and replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of infected persons and reveal any dynamic changes to the virus during the course of the disease. Study design: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from SARS cases infected by the same infectious source were tested for both negative-stranded RNA (minus-RNA, “replicative intermediates”) and positive-stranded RNA (genomic RNA) of SARS-CoV during the course of hospitalization by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: SARS-CoV minus-RNA was detected in PBMCs from SARS patients. The viral replicative forms in PBMCs were detectable during a period of 6 days post-onset of the disease, while the plus-RNA were detectable for a longer period (8–12 days post-onset). Conclusions: SARS-coronavirus can infect and replicate within PBMCs of SARS patients, but viral replication in PBMCs seems subject to self-limitation.",-0.04113916,0.055827066,-0.018480098,-0.007951788,0.04273893,0.036285605,0.06476614,0.008344273,0.04575063,0.033976004,0.06544944,-0.052659627,0.041377895,0.054479364,0.06424706,-0.06409175,-0.06544917,-0.056740176,-0.011913124,0.020608768,-0.05740462,0.010082801,-0.0521277,0.057828095,0.037161358,0.018608691,0.003852785,-0.017402662,-0.049149487,-0.04842076,0.04786175,0.06544946,-0.04463215,0.002918377,0.054111995,0.03144124,-0.064626,-0.04622476,-0.051371343,0.022362858,0.049398206,-0.034658507,0.001706567,-0.06240367,0.028253358,0.049558513,0.004792515,-0.005811312,0.04434969,0.02149163,-0.051714756,-0.030808056,-0.06495609,-0.03773264,-0.045140784,0.010528024,-0.05942331,0.038089544,0.065053165,0.053927608,0.00031959,0.030347962,0.030255698,0.03700704,-0.003638934,-0.06505937,0.058185894,-0.037435364,0.058990307,-0.018995697,-0.023412988,-0.03279936,0.027015187,0.042834,-0.05348935,-0.04091742,0.032788996,0.011062924,-0.06523513,0.032215364,-0.033976085,0.06483356,0.02162929,0.04714562,-0.046904594,0.059322324,-0.04074271,0.057876073,-0.058885206,-0.0640027,-0.011028164,0.015112097,-0.06129886,0.021376202,0.001047229,0.051167767,0.042877078,0.06144661,0.06518448,-0.007680391,-0.037956573,0.035380814,-0.021100378,0.02261854,0.022269418,0.0556498,0.046752367,-0.023116391,-0.009142158,-0.02004092,-0.051930264,0.04935403,0.057265185,-0.004868503,0.06508628,-0.009035486,-0.05429158,-0.031524085,-0.019714227,0.016709372,-0.024034277,0.059934493,-0.001091378,-0.062478565,-0.035173684,0.051168412,0.012972606,-0.022238446,0.019208727,7.92E-06,-0.035025306,0.065449476,0.062449634,0.021900075,0.021958612,-0.06405737,0.001187768,0.0033498,-0.03545654,0.001108522,-0.00235271,0.06544704,-0.06406822,-0.02604722,0.031410493,-0.041956034,0.017382873,-0.064433396,0.060348585,0.010258606,0.06450876,-0.058520336,-0.03130076,-0.005713674,0.065409064,-0.029377066,0.03411615,0.055600632,0.04991666,0.012775419,-0.027885575,0.018586712,-0.047995184,0.011926615,-0.040574957,-0.05008013,-0.051305637,-0.007473775,-0.04048449,-0.061904013,0.013815591,-0.06514629,-0.055161987,-0.042513564,-0.01769304,-0.028834244,0.03293193,-0.003512731,0.062957756,0.005301263,-0.01765059,0.012098867,0.004863972,0.04739623,0.058009684,0.027963677,-0.060171124,0.023400307,0.041502845,0.008972244,0.062421974,-0.057414737,0.005710887,0.003986956,0.06533621,-0.059502363,-0.021246921,0.05015333,-0.03390329,-0.04048051,-0.060488407,0.060242873,-0.02548445,-0.008074494,0.062446468,-0.030440101,0.044052098,0.022621302,0.04223796,0.06485701,0.048846573,0.03907606,0.049793154,0.05863472,-0.06375437,0.038983524,0.032921433,0.032875698,-0.056786325,0.06165544,0.01725306,-0.019920873,0.037032396,-0.021665584,0.037798703,-0.016004695,-0.060483854,-0.06536172,0.05444633,0.01169253,0.047215246,0.051473062,-0.010967512,-0.06539754,0.063849285,0.040890373,0.045917887,-0.058124702,-0.040791627,0.0162006,-0.037940636,0.033251125,-0.010418724,-0.05021578,0.040800717,-0.056868583,-0.060895275,0.047865354,0.021244349,-0.06380149,-0.0538646,-0.060493957,0.005104298,-0.036403116,0.064999744,0.04746393,-0.06463542,0.06544942,-0.044386055,-0.01466934,0.055777214,0.031690948,-0.051190555,0.06067845,0.022656918,0.008712299,-0.00038345,-0.027405202,-0.030337572,0.03523613,0.034345794,0.061653428,-0.05674103,-0.059794527,-0.023610255,-0.049833465,0.00079445,0.046999935,0.06518956,-0.044208024,-0.007303451,-0.05516326,-0.031250376,0.035562657,0.01575504,-0.037535775,-0.059392367,0.031122709,-0.043279197,0.04502121,0.06253001,-0.06304307,0.060000993,-0.031393208,-0.060260788,-0.05614119,-0.010527063,-0.05765267,-0.061811924,-0.01750986,-0.03669687,0.06280317,0.05488538,0.04547072,-0.043536384,0.030966504,-0.009300195,-0.019414697,0.058999676,-0.058600605,0.008811669,-0.003947346,-0.04993745,-0.05430783,0.06474538,-0.024121845,-0.011158599,0.06280993,0.05718763,0.044021945,-0.042476144,0.054173928,0.054974213,-0.0631718,-0.02542599,0.06495379,-0.06214899,-0.04276009,-0.019221896,-0.0634082,0.053466447,0.04845602,-0.03772179,0.06477115,-0.014932176,0.009990661,-0.007293217,0.056514177,-0.012599541,0.001400329,0.051859666,-0.03497143,0.0642546,0.055854592,-0.06532237,-0.065408945,0.034901712,0.06092162,0.001509465,-0.06486219,0.005148055,0.04429262,-0.022946494,0.047673147,0.059579983,-0.031780727,-0.06542982,-0.059038263,0.017883388,-0.059320267,0.05800144,-0.042037185,-0.0606052,0.029554198,0.033918396,-0.042400703,0.065326184,0.026621018,0.04654955,-0.03153126,-0.000162125,0.008058528,-0.043855313,-0.06444793,0.064980276,0.05997497,0.065065645,-0.010150908,0.026609007,-0.012779655,-0.042353347,0.049007807,0.049138594,0.050670497,-0.02343527,-0.055960048,-0.062296588,-0.06500765,0.001392527,0.056283474,0.015807128,0.059938435,0.038928036,0.013224379,-0.05592733,-0.028161319,-0.02629527,-0.060350623,0.016381912,-0.059844676,0.038587946,-0.00331569,-0.047948174,0.028304812,0.013442579,-0.052508507,-0.03998675,-0.019640587,0.059133943,0.02851774,0.013390788,-0.0325085

"Detection of viral, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in exacerbations of asthma in children","Abstract Background: A high frequency of virus infections has been recently pointed out in the exacerbations of asthma in children. Objectives: To confirm this, using conventional and molecular detection methods, and expanding the study to younger children. Study design: One hundred and thirty-two nasal aspirates from 75 children hospitalized for a severe attack of asthma were studied (32 infants, mean age 9.1 months; and 43 children, mean age 5.6 years). According to the virus, a viral isolation technique, immunofluorescence assays (IFA) or both were used for the detection of rhinovirus, enterovirus, respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, adenovirus, coronavirus 229E, influenza and parainfluenza virus. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were used for the detection of rhinovirus, enterovirus, RS virus, adenovirus, coronavirus 229E and OC43, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Results: Using IFA and viral isolation techniques, viruses were detected in 33.3% of cases, and by PCR techniques, nucleic acid sequences of virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were obtained in 71.9% of cases. The combination of conventional and molecular techniques detects 81.8% of positive samples. Two organisms were identified in the same nasal sample in 20.4% of the cases. The percentage of detections was higher (85.9%) in the younger group than in the other (77%). The most frequently detected agents were rhinovirus (46.9%) and RS virus (21.2%). Using PCR rather than conventional techniques, the detection rates were increased 5.8- and 1.6-fold in rhinovirus and RS virus infections, respectively. The detection levels of the other organisms are as follows: 9.8, 5.1, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.7, and 2.2% for enterovirus, influenza virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, respectively. Conclusion: These results confirm the previously reported high frequency of rhinovirus detection in asthmatic exacerbations in children. They also point out the frequency of RS virus detection, and emphasize the fact that PCR assays may be necessary to diagnose respiratory infections in asthma.",-0.051288754,0.05598732,-0.050697815,-0.03750516,-0.052713536,0.054732572,0.054265752,-0.037713878,-0.043673288,0.005590505,0.056539286,-0.037461907,0.013292813,-0.047913127,0.056395877,-0.055376697,-0.056539282,-0.049357183,0.05086748,-0.048554134,-0.040141925,-0.05424497,-0.056485593,0.053318113,-0.051843088,0.003565425,0.053029574,-0.023269637,0.047884703,-0.037194706,0.055434603,0.056539286,-0.04834661,0.052214485,0.052038934,-0.038346082,-0.05652132,-0.054724682,-0.055444013,-0.026150834,0.0359388,-0.036662612,0.003604111,-0.012060311,0.034614466,-0.052885562,-0.03277802,-0.026505116,0.022915378,-0.041368365,-0.047551777,0.035246402,-0.056532126,-0.05516149,-0.056523826,0.055435665,-0.05637782,-0.049158923,0.04293839,0.050339423,0.05333176,-0.010604329,-0.031855673,0.0467403,-0.01902582,-0.05638223,0.056330618,-0.0389459,0.046768907,-0.03555362,0.028841162,0.0473083,0.0558702,0.05629144,-0.03701986,0.030247737,0.007447617,-0.051618934,-0.056537908,-0.035441983,0.05130181,0.056415725,0.055374015,0.037747998,-0.0460042,0.049054008,-0.024496112,0.03117164,-0.020146763,-0.056209765,-0.05580002,-0.042940833,-0.049238853,0.025016287,0.039583832,-0.012130852,0.038925897,0.05642262,0.05626718,-0.046297126,-0.044212606,-0.016659068,-0.021222306,0.055706196,0.041491996,0.015959078,0.006762228,-0.030761022,0.02588338,-0.007535048,0.025059901,0.05484136,0.054859713,-0.004260377,0.05578473,-0.008984727,-0.045347996,0.034206443,0.016000176,0.019584242,0.012967556,0.054164894,0.04306127,-0.054622974,0.04715189,0.055758506,-0.02327425,0.02864853,-0.026567908,0.051541056,-0.023481702,0.056539286,0.049444918,0.01760354,0.033809308,-0.051850766,0.010296121,0.051287983,-0.029270196,-0.043657262,0.05377957,0.056538913,-0.055378422,-0.055116452,-0.002083084,-0.041478116,0.04523013,-0.056004405,0.051865935,0.035991844,0.033149187,-0.031120706,-0.055667754,-0.053181473,0.05647474,0.032839455,0.056353834,0.033013698,-0.029405806,0.03282946,-0.040952384,0.021539226,-0.029058777,0.055804048,0.048386317,-0.05500994,-0.052523434,0.055263866,-0.056330536,-0.056466613,-0.023494128,-0.05647145,-0.055534005,0.052562196,0.03877572,-0.034317184,-0.011129262,0.000810612,0.055932816,0.021543149,-0.014686173,0.055051632,0.052414607,0.05425549,0.054844644,-0.047400713,-0.056330517,0.001846831,-0.023755465,0.013594869,0.056449197,-0.05277146,0.019639218,0.008633147,0.056444682,-0.035637826,-0.04919706,0.055921763,-0.04897432,-0.020270092,-0.05357932,0.05650365,0.013720107,-0.038213506,0.042301387,-0.05613809,0.03396595,0.055934127,0.037407897,0.056360368,0.051690724,0.044485096,0.011347781,0.05462944,-0.043978095,-0.03074241,0.022474615,0.055959933,-0.03286054,-0.05101662,0.020236256,0.000647444,0.0487967,-0.048289012,0.002841443,0.023729185,-0.05584828,-0.056460645,0.05253014,0.05103722,0.05227708,0.055994112,0.052483864,-0.056537773,0.012384363,0.048772085,0.031317256,-0.056472234,0.009476835,-0.016915081,0.014168669,0.029804435,-0.021471137,-0.051727887,0.056446422,-0.05150028,-0.04433086,0.05051642,0.04303431,-0.05519085,-0.049606305,-0.05116764,-0.048199326,-0.039308053,0.044125672,0.023187317,-0.055985987,0.05653928,0.050652903,-0.032469843,0.05516793,0.05077331,-0.053009495,0.049283322,-0.04628563,0.026640194,0.005536567,-0.00207836,0.004426991,0.05624255,-0.021246899,0.0565112,-0.055061616,-0.05649672,-0.048798118,-0.05614955,0.05356757,0.014812845,0.05648984,-0.04799318,-0.05532647,-0.009279012,-0.043334924,0.046024702,-0.022351747,0.02818126,-0.007173135,0.030085044,-0.05396508,-0.008880409,0.04301664,-0.031996693,0.05568796,-0.056214847,-0.053736404,-0.023337139,-0.033704568,-0.04140056,-0.055443827,0.04304651,-0.035725333,0.056315776,0.043478217,0.04906776,-0.056511983,0.056182694,0.014158063,-0.040989924,0.05579027,-0.050305437,-0.003976177,-0.041444723,-0.036100306,0.02226239,0.05633045,-0.053534444,0.052322827,0.051989835,0.056346226,0.021917023,-0.02923666,0.054995798,0.051987078,-0.05526926,-0.022686172,0.056536887,0.03164256,-0.02922229,-0.05653898,-0.054537512,0.02263759,0.051008936,0.029782627,0.056426656,-0.036218047,0.04134588,0.04808638,0.055199455,0.04352593,0.012786076,-0.03297584,-0.04756624,0.056379467,0.05264393,-0.056508623,-0.05653862,0.05381564,0.056524385,-0.053778924,-0.05649752,0.0239004,-0.05284381,-0.027262824,0.048307944,0.05598604,0.011234706,-0.056538455,-0.03293648,0.03944372,-0.045379747,0.031380482,-0.05639384,-0.05640162,0.013788235,-0.04400925,-0.031204559,0.05653175,0.04254651,0.052256715,-0.05274827,0.051624067,0.055419594,-0.05550611,-0.05545246,0.05628459,0.056214456,0.049728982,0.04193993,-0.025895303,-0.05485651,-0.05119629,0.055975243,0.02298654,-0.043354213,-0.056195,-0.002982083,-0.05329784,-0.056533918,-0.055246692,0.052099623,0.051277924,-0.046586484,-0.030597692,0.015692342,-0.023464331,0.04292222,-0.055692747,-0.056499735,0.05572924,-0.05642278,-0.010096626,0.05324449,0.00039541,0.056417264,-0.021137644,0.000159839,-0.051924124,0.033686467,0.054223012,0.029924918,0.050051637,-

The emergence of influenza A H7N9 in human beings 16 years after influenza A H5N1: a tale of two cities,"Summary Infection with either influenza A H5N1 virus in 1997 or avian influenza A H7N9 virus in 2013 caused severe pneumonia that did not respond to typical or atypical antimicrobial treatment, and resulted in high mortality. Both viruses are reassortants with internal genes derived from avian influenza A H9N2 viruses that circulate in Asian poultry. Both viruses have genetic markers of mammalian adaptation in their haemagglutinin and polymerase PB2 subunits, which enhanced binding to human-type receptors and improved replication in mammals, respectively. Hong Kong (affected by H5N1 in 1997) and Shanghai (affected by H7N9 in 2013) are two rapidly flourishing cosmopolitan megacities that were increasing in human population and poultry consumption before the outbreaks. Both cities are located along the avian migratory route at the Pearl River delta and Yangtze River delta. Whether the widespread use of the H5N1 vaccine in east Asia—with suboptimum biosecurity measures in live poultry markets and farms—predisposed to the emergence of H7N9 or other virus subtypes needs further investigation. Why H7N9 seems to be more readily transmitted from poultry to people than H5N1 is still

Scalable Transcriptional Analysis Routine—Multiplexed Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Platform for Gene Expression Analysis and Molecular Diagnostics,"We report the development of a new technology for simultaneous quantitative detection of multiple targets in a single sample. Scalable transcriptional analysis routine (STAR) represents a novel integration of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and capillary electrophoresis that allows detection of dozens of gene transcripts in a multiplexed format using amplicon size as an identifier for each target. STAR demonstrated similar or better sensitivity and precision compared to two commonly used methods, SYBR Green-based and TaqMan probe-based real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. STAR can be used as a flexible platform for building a variety of applications to monitor gene expression, from single gene assays to assays analyzing the expression level of multiple genes. Using severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus as a model system, STAR technology detected single copies of the viral genome in a two-gene multiplex. Blinded studies using RNA extracted from various tissues of a SARS-infected individual showed that STAR correctly identified all samples containing SARS virus and yielded negative results for non-SARS control samples. Using alternate priming strategies, STAR technology can be adapted to transcriptional profiling studies without requiring a priori sequence information. Thus, STAR technology offers a flexible platform for development of highly multiplexed assays in gene expression analysis and molecular

Molecular Diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome The State of the Art,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first appeared in Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002. Although virus isolation and serology were useful early in the SARS outbreak for diagnosing new cases, these tests are not generally useful because virus culture requires a BSL-3 laboratory and seroconversion is often delayed until 2 to 3 weeks after infection. The first qualitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-coronavirus (CoV) were sensitive and capable of detecting 1 to 10 genome equivalents. These assays were quickly supplemented with quantitative real-time assays that helped elucidate the natural history of SARS, particularly the initial presence of low viral loads in the upper respiratory tract and high viral loads in the lower respiratory tract. The unique natural history of SARS-CoV infection dictates the testing of both respiratory and nonrespiratory specimens, the testing of multiple specimens from the same patient, and sending out positives to be confirmed by a reference laboratory. Commercially available reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS have recently appeared; however, meaningful evaluations of these assays have not yet been performed and their true performance has not been determined. These and other issues related to diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection are discussed in this

"Use of a Multiplex RT-PCR Assay for Simultaneous Detection of the North American Genotype Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus, Swine Influenza Virus and Japanese Encephalitis Virus","Abstract A multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (multiplex RT-PCR) assay was developed and subsequently evaluated for its efficacy in the detection of multiple viral infections simultaneously, in swine. Specific primers for each of the 3 RNA viruses, North American genotype porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and swine influenza virus, were used in the testing procedure. The assay was shown to be highly sensitive because it could detect as little as 10−5 ng of each of the respective amplicons in a single sample containing a composite of all 3 viruses. The assay was also effective in detecting one or more of the same viruses in various combinations in specimens, including lymph nodes, lungs, spleens, and tonsils, collected from clinically ill pigs and in spleen specimens collected from aborted pig fetuses. The results from the multiplex RT-PCR were confirmed by virus isolation. The relative efficiency (compared to the efficiency of separate assays for each virus) and apparent sensitivity of the multiplex RT-PCR method show that this method has potential for application in routine molecular diagnostic

Ribovirus emergentes implicados en las gastroenteritis,"Los virus se sitúan en un lugar preferente entre los agentes causales de diarrea aguda, en particular en la infancia. En este contexto el papel de los astrovirus, coronavirus, torovirus y picobirnavirus es emergente. Los astrovirus se han detectado en las heces entre el 1,2 y el 20 % de niños con diarrea que requieren atención médica en una gran variedad de localizaciones geográficas. Se han descrito brotes epidémicos en escuelas, guarderías y salas pediátricas, y son más frecuentes entre niños de menos de 3 años. En climas templados se ha demostrado una mayor incidencia invernal, y en climas tropicales ésta es similar en todo el año, siendo su transmisión preferente por vía orofecal. Se han reconocido siete serotipos de astrovirus humanos, de los cuales el más común es el uno. Los viriones pueden eliminarse durante amplios períodos y detectarse mediante microscopia electrónica. En estudios epidemiológicos se emplean técnicas de enzimoinmunoanálisis para detectar el antígeno común de grupo y se han desarrollado también técnicas basadas en la detección de ácidos nucleicos mediante hibridación y amplificación (reacción en cadena de la polimerasa). Los coronavirus entéricos se han asociado con frecuencia con enfermedad gastrointestinal en recién nacidos y niños menores de 12 años. El papel de los torovirus y picobirnavirus como causa de gastroenteritis es también emergente. Se necesitan estudios epidemiológicos para determinar su verdadera frecuencia en la comunidad, identificar sus mecanismos de transmisión y explicar la fisiopatología de los cuadros provocados por estos agentes. Viral agents are one of the main causes of acute diarrhea, particularly in infants and young children. Astrovirus, coronavirus, torovirus, and picobirnavirus are increasingly being identified as causative agents of gastroenteritis. Astroviruses have been detected in the stools of between 1.2 % and 20 % of children with diarrhea requiring medical care in a variety of geographical areas. Outbreaks have been described in schools, day care settings and pediatric wards. Children younger than 3 years old are the most frequently affected. In temperate climates incidence is greater in winter whereas in tropical areas infection occurs throughout the year. Transmission is mainly through the fecal-oral route. At least seven serotypes of human astroviruses have been recognized and serotype 1 is more common than the other serotypes. Astroviruses are often shed in stools during long periods and can be detected by electron microscopy. An enzyme-immunoassay technique that detects the astrovirus group antigen has been widely used in epidemiological studies. Nucleic acid hybridization and polymerase chain reaction-based techniques have also been used. Enteric coronaviruses have most frequently been associated with gastrointestinal disease in neonates and children younger than 12 years old. The role of toroviruses and picobirnaviruses as causative agents of gastroenteritis is still emerging. Further epidemiological studies to determine the frequency of these viruses in the community and to identify their mechanisms of transmission are needed, as are further studies to elucidate the pathophysiology of diseases due to these

Infecciones respiratorias por metapneumovirus en lactantes hospitalizados,"Antecedentes El metapneumovirus humano es un virus de reciente descripción al que se atribuyen infecciones respiratorias que afectan fundamentalmente a la población infantil. Objetivos Conocer la incidencia de infecciones por metapneumovirus en lactantes hospitalizados, así como sus características clínicas y la posible presencia de coinfecciones con otros agentes virales. Pacientes y métodos Estudio prospectivo realizado de septiembre a junio de 2003 en todos los niños menores de 2 años ingresados en la Unidad de Lactantes del Hospital Severo Ochoa de Leganés (Madrid), por infección respiratoria. La detección de agentes virales se realizó mediante recogida de aspirado nasofaríngeo y realización de inmunofluorescencia directa y/o reacción en cadena de la polimerasa-transcripción inversa (RT-PCR). Descripción de las características clínicas y epidemiológicas de los procesos respiratorios de los pacientes con detección positiva para metapneumovirus humano. Resultados Ingresaron 200 lactantes con patología respiratoria durante el período mencionado, de los cuales en 18 se detectó infección por metapneumovirus humano (9% de los pacientes). El metapneumovirus humano supuso un 13,8% de los aislamientos virales positivos. El 100 % de estos niños ingresaron en marzo-abril. La edad media fue de 6,7 ± 6,1 meses. El 38,8 % desarrolló una bronquiolitis y en el 55,5 % se objetivó un episodio recurrente de sibilancias. El 55,5 % de los niños precisó oxigenoterapia durante el ingreso. Se encontraron coinfecciones con otros agentes virales en el 33,3 % de estos pacientes. Conclusiones El metapneumovirus humano es un agente viral muy frecuente en los lactantes afectados de enfermedad respiratoria, causando fundamentalmente bronquiolitis y episodios recurrentes de sibilancias. Es más frecuente en primavera y tiene una alta tendencia a la coinfección con otros virus. Background Human metapneumovirus (hPMV) is a recently identified virus that is recognized as a cause of respiratory tract illness in the pediatric population. Objectives To determine the incidence of respiratory tract infections caused by hPMV in hospitalized infants and to describe the clinical characteristics and possible presence of coinfection with other viral agents. Patients and methods We performed a prospective study from September to June 2003 in all children aged less than 24 months who were admitted to the Severo Ochoa Hospital (Leganés, Madrid) with a respiratory tract infection. Virological diagnosis was made with a direct immunofluorescent assay and/or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on specimens obtained from nasopharyngeal washing. Demographic and clinical data from patients with an hPMV respiratory tract infection were analyzed. Results During the study period, 200 infants were admitted with a respiratory tract infection, of which 18 (9 %) had an hPMV infection. HPMV was the viral agent isolated in 13.8% of positive nasopharyngeal washings. All patients were admitted between March and April. The mean age was 6.7 ± 6.1 months. The most common diagnoses were recurrent wheezing (55.5 %) and bronchiolitis (38.8%). Oxygen therapy was required by 55.5 % of infants during hospitalization. Coinfection with other respiratory viruses was confirmed in 33.3% of the patients. Conclusions Human metapneumovirus is a major cause of respiratory tract illness in hospitalized infants.

Rapid Recovery of Classical Swine Fever Virus Directly from Cloned cDNA,"Abstract The reverse genetics for classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is currently based on the transfection of in vitro transcribed RNA from a viral genomic cDNA clone, which is inefficient and time-consuming. This study was aimed to develop an improved method for rapid recovery of CSFV directly from cloned cDNA. Full-length genomic cDNA from the CSFV Shimen strain, which was flanked by a T7 promoter, the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme and T7 terminator sequences, was cloned into the low-copy vector pOK12, producing pOKShimen-RzTΦ. Direct transfection of pOKShimen-RzTΦ into PK/T7 cells, a PK-15-derived cell line stably expressing bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase, allowed CSFV to be rescued rapidly and efficiently, i.e., at least 12 h faster and 31.6-fold greater viral titer when compared with the in vitro transcription-based rescue system. Furthermore, the progeny virus rescued from PK/T7 cells was indistinguishable, both in vitro and in vivo, from its parent virus and the virus rescued from classical reverse genetics. The reverse genetics based on intracellular transcription is efficient, convenient and cost-effective.

A duplex RT-PCR assay for detection of H9 subtype avian influenza viruses and infectious bronchitis viruses,"Abstract H9 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) are major pathogens circulating in poultry and have resulted in great economic losses due to respiratory disease and reduced egg production. As similar symptoms are elicited by the two pathogens, it is difficult for their differential diagnosis. So far, no reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay has been found to differentiate between H9 AIV and IBV in one reaction. Therefore, developing a sensitive and specific method is of importance to simultaneously detect and differentiate H9 AIV and IBV. In this study, a duplex RT-PCR (dRT-PCR) was established. Two primer sets target the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of H9 AIV and the nucleocapsid (N) gene of IBV, respectively. Specific PCR products were obtained from all tested H9 AIVs and IBVs belonging to the major clades circulating in China, but not from AIVs of other subtypes or other infectious avian viruses. The sensitivity of the dRT-PCR assay corresponding to H9 AIV, IBV and mixture of H9 AIV and IBV were at a concentration of 1×101, 1.5×101 and 1.5×101 50% egg infective doses (EID50) mL−1, respectively. The concordance rates between the dRT-PCR and virus isolation were 99.1 and 98.2%, respectively, for detection of samples from H9N2 AIV or IBV infected chickens, while the concordance rate was 99.1% for detection of samples from H9N2 AIV and IBV co-infected chickens. Thus, the dRT-PCR assay reported herein is specific and sensitive, and suitable for the differential diagnosis of clinical infections and surveillance of H9 AIVs and IBVs.",-0.056570318,0.034764245,-0.023343174,0.038499486,0.061875287,0.056761943,0.050337996,-0.05208232,0.054545816,-0.025919959,0.06309682,-0.044394195,-0.025989385,0.020393433,0.053019658,-0.05874802,-0.063089006,-0.05340903,0.062355332,0.019705152,-0.02928944,-0.023493456,-0.056386936,0.027606228,0.040587172,0.040174834,-0.048845574,0.051887885,0.042180717,0.023211822,0.061325453,0.063097045,-0.023671374,0.041493922,0.057507925,0.014302081,-0.05848295,-0.046716537,-0.061490476,-0.0313679,-0.023694925,-0.021524021,0.021002539,-0.006182155,-0.06006064,0.000427133,-0.037732244,-0.015183099,0.030317264,-0.029508028,-0.01640817,-0.011429904,-0.063008964,-0.060646005,-0.05467216,0.022529693,-0.062747456,-0.05755633,0.054656908,-0.0398454,0.052980434,-0.010871995,0.020015335,-0.048563138,0.029298337,-0.062336843,0.062273774,-0.05060174,0.04453195,-0.060888957,0.020268844,0.051742174,-0.006661324,0.059932623,-0.054613512,0.000741059,-0.038545962,0.046229713,-0.06306158,0.004721194,0.051225554,0.06172741,0.05621699,0.014578559,-0.04653522,0.061298333,-0.000549827,0.03941633,-0.041994907,-0.057972822,-0.059882373,-0.024038263,-0.046475068,-0.042587228,0.0408399,0.059918214,0.057506494,0.060748387,0.062475074,-0.004062106,-0.049264755,-0.027018648,0.04977521,0.06166716,0.05482987,0.030662328,-0.006032469,0.036210284,-0.021903982,-0.005341401,-0.045024734,0.031594235,0.06187576,0.056476492,0.062114768,-0.040454905,-0.043681666,0.001258014,0.050113358,0.005385957,-0.013580169,0.052783363,0.0408527,-0.058971465,0.043214608,0.053426154,0.03744582,-0.002849996,-0.036125377,0.006127789,0.04008931,0.06309709,0.05867005,-0.016411157,0.061010834,-0.05771098,-0.028177312,0.062180653,-0.055564784,-0.03828628,-0.002538706,0.06309712,-0.05591735,-0.023995683,-0.039280996,-0.057517365,0.007749806,-0.06248571,0.05689469,-0.02670487,0.011065417,-0.029920803,-0.061910175,-0.058418423,0.06294881,0.034592543,0.06189788,0.021867024,0.055896524,0.042229645,-0.054275632,0.006120506,-0.057307832,0.06258876,0.05699398,-0.00495825,-0.04348673,0.05539179,-0.05719642,-0.058631096,-0.01175376,-0.06190126,-0.029387493,0.032641385,-0.04326081,-0.02661239,0.059725247,-0.03051956,0.060460437,0.025654385,-0.013551867,-0.041514248,0.047341753,0.029848598,0.0491364,-0.019003497,-0.041069362,0.015310846,-0.019403677,0.003372822,0.06293128,-0.05704815,-0.036324266,-0.006024308,0.05972532,-0.053985186,0.03669866,0.036326088,-0.03685596,-0.04212823,-0.061462864,0.061869305,0.022067966,0.035526987,0.05864791,-0.04263576,0.023583537,0.054535657,-0.01838487,0.06295912,0.0306441,0.049099877,-0.05398835,0.06282724,-0.06248912,-0.03523013,0.0434101,0.060917616,-0.01438988,-0.03472291,-0.034434214,-0.026327018,0.010167579,0.003443191,-0.014333314,0.001486879,-0.059275497,-0.059506234,-0.017244916,-0.032763373,0.05880879,0.06168561,0.015826466,-0.06309631,0.04002954,-0.003541687,0.03787155,-0.055515215,0.017536275,0.03596514,0.03686053,-0.00992637,-0.058970466,-0.058637194,0.061050497,-0.049362376,-0.059083194,0.030764116,0.043250617,-0.056926128,-0.02393072,0.017635057,-0.05755923,0.017563077,0.027024116,0.013631836,-0.05518143,0.06309713,0.023819953,-0.017599272,0.051560335,0.009522362,-0.04717906,0.0575594,0.003747208,-0.036634803,-0.027547168,0.049340032,0.024821334,0.0296431,0.05580869,0.06301302,-0.030660124,-0.057690114,-0.050607804,-0.055484753,-0.003933626,0.04508612,0.06267496,-0.033628285,-0.04529109,0.054052602,-0.045380376,0.025185091,0.04751107,-0.019473083,-0.0504171,0.056561824,-0.0630235,0.061623488,0.06302007,-0.020225985,0.058866937,-0.010222244,-0.05389089,-0.047985822,-0.04103575,-0.02474646,-0.062385906,0.056048565,0.015154399,0.052445292,0.059120595,0.010975575,-0.06271682,0.0478429,0.058824684,0.001728345,0.054441717,0.023142854,0.053452674,0.005797564,0.054817893,-0.050137583,0.06299368,0.045490347,0.029637862,0.06090279,0.04596075,-0.010668584,-0.059130065,0.03626291,0.061453417,-0.036317524,-0.03631975,0.062385745,-0.060370315,-0.041416973,-0.05957204,-0.059674423,0.057619665,0.04564887,0.03757111,0.062896475,-0.02683482,-0.04651047,0.019005142,0.047537666,0.03678881,-0.031912226,0.03988246,-0.033331607,0.054942045,-0.013969255,-0.06304965,-0.06307343,0.05880148,0.055430584,0.002082956,-0.06273899,-0.026440011,0.023433216,-0.015119838,0.061310045,-0.021991184,-0.011223768,-0.063095056,-0.051028434,-0.052137945,-0.06279984,0.04000508,-0.05173405,-0.05942296,-0.022974582,0.035710912,-0.03315025,0.063079745,0.04787256,0.048988048,0.01878429,0.008365043,0.022406995,-0.000309853,-0.06170799,0.062244046,0.051075693,0.06120351,0.02647722,0.032086994,-0.040807374,-0.016325274,-0.027094314,0.007002978,0.050145406,0.004515127,-0.04689588,-0.062479585,-0.062409926,-0.004493229,-0.012302388,0.019143367,-0.05368715,-0.04558175,0.0314599,-0.01106934,0.03557752,-0.031458218,-0.044493098,0.05926926,-0.048485883,0.045136847,0.020248555,0.035724625,0.06275032,-0.026817668,-0.020545397,-0.040238928,0.03671433,0.06006003,0.007011682,-0.014722743,-0.0431

"Nucleocapsid gene analysis from an imported case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Malaysia","Abstract Objective To describe the complete nucleocapsid (N) gene region of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) from imported case in Malaysia and the relations with human- and camel-derived MERS-CoV. Methods Combination of throat and nasal swab specimens was subjected to viral RNA extraction. For screening, the extracted RNA was subjected to real-time RT-PCR targeting upstream of E gene, open reading frame 1b and open reading frame 1a. For confirmation, the RNA was subjected to RT-PCR targeting partial part of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nucleocapsid, followed by amplification of complete N gene region. Nucleotide sequencing of the first Malaysian case of MERS-CoV was performed following the confirmation with real-time RT-PCR detection. Results Initial analysis of partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and N gene revealed that the nucleotides had high similarity to Jeddah_1_2013 strain. Analysis of complete N gene region (1 242 nucleotides) from the case showed high similarity and yet distinct to the nucleotide sequences of camel-derived MERS-CoV. Conclusions From the finding, there are possibilities that the patient acquired the infection from zoonotic transmission from dromedary

2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pneumonia: Serial Computer Tomography Findings,"From December 2019, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia (formerly known as the 2019 novel Coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) broke out in Wuhan, China. In this study, we present serial CT findings in a 40-year-old female patient with COVID-19 pneumonia who presented with the symptoms of fever, chest tightness, and fatigue. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.

The antiviral compound remdesivir potently inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,"Antiviral drugs for managing infections with human coronaviruses are not yet approved, posing a serious challenge to current global efforts aimed at containing the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Remdesivir (RDV) is an investigational compound with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). RDV is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). Here, we co-expressed the MERS-CoV nonstructural proteins nsp5, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 (RdRp) in insect cells as a part a polyprotein to study the mechanism of inhibition of MERS-CoV RdRp by RDV. We initially demonstrated that nsp8 and nsp12 form an active complex. The triphosphate form of the inhibitor (RDV-TP) competes with its natural counterpart ATP. Of note, the selectivity value for RDV-TP obtained here with a steady-state approach suggests that it is more efficiently incorporated than ATP and two other nucleotide analogues. Once incorporated at position i, the inhibitor caused RNA synthesis arrest at position i+3. Hence, the likely mechanism of action is delayed RNA chain termination. The additional three nucleotides may protect the inhibitor from excision by the viral 3'-5' exonuclease activity. Together, these results help to explain the high potency of RDV against RNA viruses in cell-based

Repurposing of clinically approved drugs for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 in a 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) related coronavirus model,"BACKGROUND: Medicines for the treatment of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections are urgently needed. However, drug screening using live 2019-nCoV requires high-level biosafety facilities, which imposes an obstacle for those without such facilities or 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This study aims to repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV related coronavirus model. METHODS: A 2019-nCoV related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/ Guangxi was described. Whether GX_P2X uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor was investigated by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated silencing of ACE2. The pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were screened for their ability to inhibit cytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells by GX_P2X infection. The antiviral activities and antiviral mechanisms of potential drugs were further investigated. Viral yields of RNAs and infectious particles were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and plaque assay, respectively. RESULTS: The spike protein of coronavirus GX_P2V shares 92.2% amino acid identity with that of 2019-nCoV isolate Wuhan-hu-1, and uses ACE2 as the receptor for infection just like 2019-nCoV. Three drugs-cepharanthine (CEP), selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride exhibited complete inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell culture at 10 μmol/L. CEP demonstrated the most potent inhibition of GX_P2V infection, with a concentration for 50% of maximal effect [EC50] of 0.98 μmol/L. The viral RNA yield in cells treated with 10 μmol/L CEP was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without CEP treatment ([6.48 ± 0.02] × 10vs. 1.00 ± 0.12, t = 150.38, P < 0.001) at 72 h post-infection (p.i.). Plaque assays found no production of live viruses in media containing 10 μmol/L CEP at 48 h p.i. Furthermore, we found CEP has potent antiviral activities against both viral entry (1.00 ± 0.37 vs. 0.46 ± 0.12, t = 2.42, P < 0.05) and viral replication (1.00 ± 0.43 vs. [6.18 ± 0.95] × 10, t = 3.98, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V is a workable model for 2019-nCoV research. CEP, selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride are potential drugs for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Our results strongly suggest that CEP is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of pan-betacoronavirus, and clinical trial of CEP for treatment of 2019-nCoV infection is warranted.",-0.055015583,0.01175669,0.004838448,-0.013563595,0.001677353,0.05296095,0.056432046,-0.030153342,0.044997364,0.025861446,0.05939466,0.055806424,0.053772956,-0.02993726,0.0478745,-0.057868868,-0.0593945,0.0435903,0.034310047,0.04488779,-0.055925775,-0.05186761,-0.059165772,-0.056255322,0.0517905,0.05324157,-0.024726735,-0.051506802,-0.04909898,0.052263167,0.0581724,0.059394673,0.01408213,0.032824196,0.0455768,-0.05247797,-0.052710637,-0.038845092,-0.055301044,0.005570628,0.020880431,0.036010247,-0.009661867,-0.006516894,0.03435699,-0.02074124,-0.033823162,0.046645023,0.058079053,-0.031099616,-0.048190147,0.031446554,-0.059387453,0.016886592,-0.059233464,-0.008057865,-0.0515261,-0.01579824,0.059112415,0.004749472,0.03451621,-0.035615057,0.029665321,-0.025501136,-0.007345123,-0.05867545,0.05860325,0.056451328,0.01774391,-0.05305946,0.03452698,0.058493897,0.04482845,0.05919457,-0.04005655,-0.050486047,0.050110403,-0.027216982,-0.05920311,0.018792188,-0.0581799,0.0591714,0.054644175,-0.055626854,-0.037773915,0.04506773,-0.034922145,0.045935646,-0.042177826,-0.051611867,-0.03895101,-0.043593228,-0.012000393,0.027023992,0.052057043,0.05688714,0.047391098,0.059095416,0.059387214,-0.05818517,-0.05874431,0.025897676,0.044269662,0.04505078,0.05815893,0.054421306,0.03074236,0.017870292,-0.04595057,-0.023343392,-0.05799498,-0.033227045,0.016057914,0.025109712,0.054178715,-0.034207627,-0.051956523,-0.045648083,0.0505864,0.05183605,0.018406838,0.05896702,-0.009077719,-0.037077658,0.05237973,0.047219038,-0.05515263,-0.014081501,-0.013188854,-0.025394425,0.003871724,0.059394673,0.058849875,-0.042206973,0.05024512,-0.05257404,0.011455539,-0.02305506,-0.056108933,-0.014944444,0.050879333,0.059394673,-0.059365302,-0.05667197,-0.005691015,-0.056422736,0.024044115,-0.059099022,0.026264371,0.008777947,-0.04664255,-0.059164584,-0.057743248,-0.03474706,0.05939461,0.057460155,-0.002314655,0.05743746,-0.04749799,0.020174602,-0.008327531,0.052077208,0.017479718,0.057457246,-0.030797128,-0.0519943,-0.04349463,0.015539588,-0.059206877,-0.05790108,0.0400798,-0.05927249,-0.042846587,0.04138364,0.023604453,-0.0436163,0.05742196,-0.033440936,0.05452793,-0.026722156,-0.005943542,0.055672493,-0.04591494,0.04435478,0.058849875,0.045204517,0.028683102,0.037237052,0.058699407,0.04273526,0.05804961,0.037831314,-0.05739269,-0.012373754,0.05922742,-0.05657794,0.008255163,0.013149224,0.04230899,-0.035222936,-0.05738424,0.058614,-0.014098392,0.004491224,-0.004735297,-0.045511495,0.032288697,0.054900642,0.038826037,0.05880888,0.022905778,0.05723241,-0.03771137,0.059144646,-0.05930077,-0.056759983,0.054324523,0.058860958,-0.037716284,-0.023943624,-0.005504232,-0.014152002,0.04390781,-0.051343292,0.02703742,0.013238534,-0.059062764,-0.053263206,-0.011608139,0.03861163,0.059001192,0.04356817,0.049477283,-0.05939466,0.059207506,-0.004104616,0.045889467,-0.05439371,-0.03737035,0.05887895,0.0439805,0.004838251,-0.035882346,0.033296656,0.05104148,-0.00527903,-0.057436462,0.004465251,0.056869935,-0.049136717,-0.057943955,0.00423184,-0.031413123,0.009160259,0.059104048,0.030280754,-0.050646916,0.059394673,-0.058881994,-0.038641922,0.054299656,0.051348682,-0.028831016,0.058538403,0.00339665,-0.033508573,-0.05218457,-0.055731367,-0.03989997,0.05664819,0.040539123,0.05938323,-0.02294239,-0.059352208,0.03270258,-0.059135057,0.05565676,-0.015387649,0.058665484,-0.05395365,-0.051523305,-0.035431843,-0.053357463,0.029521387,-0.045869287,-0.050345723,-0.023200937,0.030131202,0.000112757,-0.029909544,0.059266124,0.026464393,0.059266113,-0.04379952,0.035717152,-0.05903601,-0.052758753,-0.05358458,-0.055596285,0.015143066,-0.006326134,0.059168994,0.050792392,0.046364732,-0.058339216,0.051150713,-0.021257067,-0.024853637,0.058617145,-0.057567336,-0.007004329,-0.054198235,0.035444815,-0.046900224,0.059339482,0.034944862,-0.010683283,-0.019999072,0.048325293,0.017913684,-0.05907241,0.041981805,0.047808502,0.038362175,0.01066207,0.055567093,0.01833862,-0.054450456,-0.05931876,-0.04043652,-0.040953416,0.05019652,0.03552071,0.05853019,-0.025836667,-0.038258273,0.002635815,0.01161989,-0.008541327,-0.046605237,0.05640185,-0.030596996,0.057730272,0.042106424,-0.05939238,-0.05939462,0.027119098,0.057246134,-0.008587957,-0.0585554,-0.027433364,-0.038149416,-0.057724677,-0.007396292,0.014266871,-0.051030163,-0.059394635,-0.054342173,-0.04940908,-0.043450035,0.015782684,-0.059291292,-0.05930021,0.05238058,0.020985015,-0.05565746,0.059189893,0.051844258,0.054272223,-0.029221557,0.054579526,0.019443013,0.040038057,-0.059319627,0.05932841,0.036543813,0.05791541,-0.05808243,-0.014478164,-0.04247775,-0.058915704,0.056407526,-0.017091261,0.037857905,0.04471774,-0.0592467,-0.050253876,-0.05417794,0.055296678,0.013009092,0.033995185,0.032775294,0.055582546,-0.05764951,-0.050766885,0.030597176,0.002144435,-0.05902678,0.057056442,-0.055291228,0.047306273,0.025688266,0.0490087,0.00779516,0.05788449,-0.045881182,-0.05681418,-0.04461989,0.056336526,0.03253783,0.059060268,-0.027166408,

"Clinical Features and Chest CT Manifestations of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Single-Center Study in Shanghai, China","OBJECTIVE. Confronting the new coronavirus infection known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is challenging and requires excluding patients with suspected COVID-19 who actually have other diseases. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical features and CT manifestations of COVID-19 by comparing patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia who presented at a fever observation department in Shanghai, China. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients were retrospectively enrolled in the study from January 19 through February 6, 2020. All patients underwent real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. RESULTS. Eleven patients had RT-PCR test results that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, whereas 22 patients had negative results. No statistical difference in clinical features was observed (p > 0.05), with the exception of leukocyte and platelet counts (p < 0.05). The mean (± SD) interval between onset of symptoms and admission to the fever observation department was 4.40 ± 2.00 and 5.52 ± 4.00 days for patients with positive and negative RT-PCR test results, respectively. The frequency of opacifications in patients with positive results and patients with negative results, respectively, was as follows: ground-glass opacities (GGOs), 100.0% versus 90.9%; mixed GGO, 63.6% versus 72.7%; and consolidation, 54.5% versus 77.3%. In patients with positive RT-PCR results, GGOs were the most commonly observed opacification (seen in 100.0% of patients) and were predominantly located in the peripheral zone (100.0% of patients), compared with patients with negative results (31.8%) (p = 0.05). The median number of affected lung lobes and segments was higher in patients with positive RT-PCR results than in those with negative RT-PCR results (five vs 3.5 affected lobes and 15 vs nine affected segments; p < 0.05). Although the air bronchogram reticular pattern was more frequently seen in patients with positive results, centrilobular nodules were less frequently seen in patients with positive results. CONCLUSION. At the point during the COVID-19 outbreak when this study was performed, imaging patterns of multifocal, peripheral, pure GGO, mixed GGO, or consolidation with slight predominance in the lower lung and findings of more extensive GGO than consolidation on chest CT scans obtained during the first week of illness were considered findings highly suspicious of

"Replicative homeostasis II: Influence of polymerase fidelity on RNA virus quasispecies biology: Implications for immune recognition, viral autoimmunity and other ""virus receptor"" diseases","Much of the worlds' population is in active or imminent danger from established infectious pathogens, while sporadic and pandemic infections by these and emerging agents threaten everyone. RNA polymerases (RNA(pol)) generate enormous genetic and consequent antigenic heterogeneity permitting both viruses and cellular pathogens to evade host defences. Thus, RNA(pol )causes more morbidity and premature mortality than any other molecule. The extraordinary genetic heterogeneity defining viral quasispecies results from RNA(pol )infidelity causing rapid cumulative genomic RNA mutation a process that, if uncontrolled, would cause catastrophic loss of sequence integrity and inexorable quasispecies extinction. Selective replication and replicative homeostasis, an epicyclical regulatory mechanism dynamically linking RNApol fidelity and processivity with quasispecies phenotypic diversity, modulating polymerase fidelity and, hence, controlling quasispecies behaviour, prevents this happening and also mediates immune escape. Perhaps more importantly, ineluctable generation of broad phenotypic diversity after viral RNA is translated to protein quasispecies suggests a mechanism of disease that specifically targets, and functionally disrupts, the host cell surface molecules – including hormone, lipid, cell signalling or neurotransmitter receptors – that viruses co-opt for cell entry. This mechanism – ""Viral Receptor Disease (VRD)"" – may explain so-called ""viral autoimmunity"", some classical autoimmune disorders and other diseases, including type II diabetes mellitus, and some forms of obesity. Viral receptor disease is a unifying hypothesis that may also explain some diseases with well-established, but multi-factorial and apparently unrelated aetiologies – like coronary artery and other vascular diseases – in addition to diseases like schizophrenia that are poorly understood and lack plausible, coherent, pathogenic

Different rates of (non-)synonymous mutations in astrovirus genes; correlation with gene function,"BACKGROUND: Complete genome sequences of the Astroviridae include human, non-human mammalian and avian species. A consensus topology of astroviruses has been derived from nucleotide substitutions in the full-length genomes and from non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions in each of the three ORFs. Analyses of synonymous substitutions displayed a loss of tree structure, suggesting either saturation of the substitution model or a deviant pattern of synonymous substitutions in certain virus species. RESULTS: We analyzed the complete Astroviridae family for the inference of adaptive molecular evolution at sites and in branches. High rates of synonymous mutations are observed among the non-human virus species. Deviant patterns of synonymous substitutions are found in the capsid structural genes. Purifying selection is a dominant force among all astrovirus genes and only few codon sites showed values for the dN/dS ratio that may indicate site-specific molecular adaptation during virus evolution. One of these sites is the glycine residue of a RGD motif in ORF2 of human astrovirus serotype 1. RGD or similar integrin recognition motifs are present in nearly all astrovirus species. CONCLUSION: Phylogenetic analysis directed by maximum likelihood approximation allows the inclusion of significantly more evolutionary history and thereby, improves the estimation of dN and dS. Sites with enhanced values for dN/dS are prominent at domains in charge of environmental communication (f.i.

Conserved aspartic acid 233 and alanine 231 are not required for poliovirus polymerase function in replicons,"Nucleic acid polymerases have similar structures and motifs. The function of an aspartic acid (conserved in all classes of nucleic acid polymerases) in motif A remains poorly understood in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. We mutated this residue to alanine in a poliovirus replicon. The resulting mutant could still replicate, although at a reduced level. In addition, mutation A231C (also in motif A) yielded high levels of replication. Taken together these results show that poliovirus polymerase conserved residues D233 and A231 are not essential to poliovirus replicon

Using patient-collected clinical samples and sera to detect and quantify the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV),"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused a large outbreak of pneumonia in Beijing, China, in 2003. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect and quantify SARS-CoV in 934 sera and self-collected throat washes and fecal samples from 271 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS managed at a single institution. RESULTS: SARS-CoV detection rates in sera were highest in the first 9 days of illness, whereas detection was highest in throat washes 5–14 days after onset of symptoms. The highest SARS-CoV RT-PCR rates (70.4–86.3%) and viral loads (log(10 )4.5–6.1) were seen in fecal samples collected 2–4 weeks after the onset of clinical illness. Fecal samples were frequently SARS-CoV RT-PCR positive beyond 40 days, and occasional sera still had SARS-CoV detected after 3 weeks of illness.

Universal primers that amplify RNA from all three flavivirus subgroups,"BACKGROUND: Species within the Flavivirus genus pose public health problems around the world. Increasing cases of Dengue and Japanese encephalitis virus in Asia, frequent outbreaks of Yellow fever virus in Africa and South America, and the ongoing spread of West Nile virus throughout the Americas, show the geographical burden of flavivirus diseases. Flavivirus infections are often indistinct from and confused with other febrile illnesses. Here we review the specificity of published primers, and describe a new universal primer pair that can detect a wide range of flaviviruses, including viruses from each of the recognised subgroups. RESULTS: Bioinformatic analysis of 257 published full-length Flavivirus genomes revealed conserved regions not previously targeted by primers. Two degenerate primers, Flav100F and Flav200R were designed from these regions and used to generate an 800 base pair cDNA product. The region amplified encoded part of the methyltransferase and most of the RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (NS5) coding sequence. One-step RT-PCR testing was successful using standard conditions with RNA from over 60 different flavivirus strains representing about 50 species. The cDNA from each virus isolate was sequenced then used in phylogenetic analyses and database searches to confirm the identity of the template RNA.

Deletion of human metapneumovirus M2-2 increases mutation frequency and attenuates growth in hamsters,"BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection can cause acute lower respiratory tract illness in infants, the immunocompromised, and the elderly. Currently there are no licensed preventative measures for hMPV infections. Using a variant of hMPV/NL/1/00 that does not require trypsin supplementation for growth in tissue culture, we deleted the M2-2 gene and evaluated the replication of rhMPV/ΔM2-2 virus in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: In vitro studies showed that the ablation of M2-2 increased the propensity for insertion of U nucleotides in poly-U tracts of the genomic RNA. In addition, viral transcription was up-regulated although the level of genomic RNA remained comparable to rhMPV. Thus, deletion of M2-2 alters the ratio between hMPV genome copies and transcripts. In vivo, rhMPV/ΔM2-2 was attenuated compared to rhMPV in the lungs and nasal turbinates of hamsters. Hamsters immunized with one dose of rhMPV/ΔM2-2 were protected from challenge with 10(6 )PFU of wild type (wt) hMPV/NL/1/00. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that hMPV M2-2 alters regulation of transcription and influences the fidelity of the polymerase complex during viral genome replication. In the hamster model, rhMPVΔM2-2 is attenuated and protective suggesting that deletion of M2-2 may result in a potential live vaccine candidate. A more thorough knowledge of the hMPV polymerase complex and the role of M2-2 during hMPV replication are being studied as we develop a potential live hMPV vaccine candidate that lacks M2-2

Widespread distribution and a new recombinant species of Brazilian virus associated with cotton blue disease,"BACKGROUND: Cotton blue disease (CBD), an important global cotton crop pathology responsible for major economic losses, is prevalent in the major cotton-producing states of Brazil. Typical CBD symptoms include stunting due to internodal shortening, leaf rolling, intense green foliage, and yellowing veins. Atypical CBD symptoms, including reddish and withered leaves, were also observed in Brazilian cotton fields in 2007. Recently, a Polerovirus named Cotton leafroll dwarf virus (CLRDV) was shown to be associated with CBD. RESULTS: To understand the distribution and genetic diversity of CLRDV in Brazil, we analyzed 23 CBD-symptomatic plants from susceptible cotton varieties originating from five of the six most important cotton-growing states, from 2004–2007. Here, we report on CLRDV diversity in plants with typical or atypical CBD symptoms by comparing viral coat protein, RNA polymerase (RdRp), and intergenic region genomic sequences. CONCLUSION: The virus had a widespread distribution with a low genetic diversity; however, three divergent isolates were associated with atypical CBD symptoms. These divergent isolates had a CLRDV-related coat protein but a distinct RdRp sequence, and probably arose from recombination events. Based on the taxonomic rules for the family Luteoviridae, we propose that these three isolates represent isolates of a new species in the genus

Complete genomic sequence analysis of infectious bronchitis virus Ark DPI strain and its evolution by recombination,"An infectious bronchitis virus Arkansas DPI (Ark DPI) virulent strain was sequenced, analyzed and compared with many different IBV strains and coronaviruses. The genome of Ark DPI consists of 27,620 nucleotides, excluding poly (A) tail, and comprises ten open reading frames. Comparative sequence analysis of Ark DPI with other IBV strains shows striking similarity to the Conn, Gray, JMK, and Ark 99, which were circulating during that time period. Furthermore, comparison of the Ark genome with other coronaviruses demonstrates a close relationship to turkey coronavirus. Among non-structural genes, the 5'untranslated region (UTR), 3C-like proteinase (3CL(pro)) and the polymerase (RdRp) sequences are 100% identical to the Gray strain. Among structural genes, S1 has 97% identity with Ark 99; S2 has 100% identity with JMK and 96% to Conn; 3b 99%, and 3C to N is 100% identical to Conn strain. Possible recombination sites were found at the intergenic region of spike gene, 3'end of S1 and 3a gene. Independent recombination events may have occurred in the entire genome of Ark DPI, involving four different IBV strains, suggesting that genomic RNA recombination may occur in any part of the genome at number of sites. Hence, we speculate that the Ark DPI strain originated from the Conn strain, but diverged and evolved independently by point mutations and recombination between field strains.",-0.05430513,-0.037045974,0.015783215,0.05287275,0.05672658,0.02946625,0.058707014,-0.03673219,0.05584411,0.05230156,0.058706965,0.04793055,0.005546752,0.038257126,0.05888561,-0.03729553,-0.019921966,-0.056701455,0.0582481,0.0091505,-0.055673294,-0.00768776,-0.055664163,0.053291906,0.058786493,0.053397708,0.058709208,0.05318193,-0.000919295,-0.02203285,0.05865369,0.05889416,-0.03746135,-0.057710994,0.058409084,0.028382843,-0.05886347,0.054769382,-0.05692221,-0.038936675,0.026063938,-0.057003144,0.048502132,-0.030443119,-0.05243222,-0.049472515,-0.020813582,0.04601303,0.042865902,-0.025269756,0.056596823,0.05076026,-0.058862098,-0.05109929,-0.044251807,0.019105626,-0.050666198,0.007168693,0.05135179,0.0423998,0.051624067,0.019222628,0.048074666,-0.001691273,0.029838894,-0.0579866,0.05827077,-0.044882566,0.006745628,-0.054964438,-0.05271067,0.05889143,0.058671482,0.051700205,-0.05040653,0.057846244,0.05820144,0.018776486,-0.042245373,0.03706545,-0.017100243,0.05869091,-0.011999075,-0.042671163,-0.0480067,0.058602694,-0.009540838,-0.028729849,-0.023031047,-0.051040336,-0.057111304,-0.020518614,-0.026312571,0.058192033,-0.032308713,0.031242348,0.043377183,0.058891505,0.05819866,0.053254154,0.04003924,0.04017889,0.0512419,-0.020168645,0.03230387,-0.019291176,0.05783324,-0.054538876,-0.034621578,-0.04778639,0.04881636,0.011681947,-0.04531937,0.042612284,0.058529906,0.03244228,-0.05884205,0.011819548,-0.055087607,-0.051260885,0.041011006,0.056700077,0.057938345,-0.05237396,-0.029870534,0.020110784,0.042593,-0.006388724,-0.04993615,0.054575775,0.050374795,0.05898857,0.057198156,-0.009200499,-0.05793694,0.010087047,0.004811193,0.05585856,-0.009339508,0.010735722,-0.040719762,0.058993526,-0.05800538,-0.02360678,0.052247856,-0.055999827,0.021609439,-0.056075014,0.042709813,0.053214032,-0.03789163,-0.019507837,-0.057694,0.01402356,0.058860227,0.057492357,0.05826501,0.05138418,0.057008278,0.044170473,-0.05892599,-0.03788203,-0.011955108,0.058650367,-0.045121837,-0.026891282,-0.058842655,0.05842382,0.027442878,-0.03258416,-0.044440895,0.035810325,-0.016961208,0.058522936,-0.04044124,-0.011228009,-0.026509257,0.05066956,0.054106794,-0.040173464,-0.03880338,-0.05620928,0.022226414,-0.04843444,-0.04310273,-0.021406312,-0.058945067,-0.006489642,-0.023515549,0.003941935,0.05889872,-0.047144357,-0.017562214,0.043128014,0.05882721,0.016253585,0.010105895,-0.006576219,0.04345303,-0.0545999,0.03090369,0.0566816,0.028818326,-0.0463939,0.002851744,-0.040083904,0.00384959,0.058915175,0.014291269,0.058958557,0.045870744,0.058939423,0.038793318,0.04995365,-0.056718662,0.01690021,0.05650306,0.046942275,-0.049025696,0.009631519,-0.018947562,-0.05769286,-0.018326903,-0.051575184,0.048585705,-0.048442703,-0.05536254,-0.057945076,0.046442147,-0.023727955,-0.043595716,0.05535282,0.018621301,-0.05899345,0.058418866,0.05722155,0.05661553,0.040595382,-0.049601085,0.032882303,0.030502805,-0.001799438,-0.058953527,0.01617843,0.05897729,-0.021082858,-0.058303807,-0.030833835,0.042231794,-0.023630379,-0.051978856,0.002031745,-0.012681485,-0.035229925,0.053012032,0.03164168,-0.056536086,0.058993574,0.05790645,0.006946788,0.050039522,-0.010133037,-0.051752158,0.058561616,0.028375484,0.02940726,0.034319416,0.01073377,-0.04312415,0.016068691,0.020124253,0.058565654,-0.011908614,0.047771964,-0.05445783,-0.050183512,-0.026456172,0.012249886,0.05857398,0.056439564,-0.012208492,-0.008443663,-0.017583784,0.013571199,-0.05812316,-0.029784758,-0.0503197,0.058851685,-0.05492453,-0.020849291,0.058992058,-0.046526134,0.058735184,-0.047154624,-0.056359682,-0.051292263,-0.015106772,0.017991867,-0.058991466,0.045324348,-0.004894203,0.007301965,0.055227745,0.053563442,-0.05872673,0.037831504,-0.042935975,-0.045565065,0.045910466,0.056848746,0.05010093,-0.035721395,0.05063316,-0.05819733,0.01674816,-0.051236037,0.045357358,-0.03329533,0.035229445,0.03762628,-0.0586634,0.057822727,0.05733795,-0.058847528,-0.04604983,-0.032582045,-0.05422022,-0.058426775,-0.058603957,-0.0408117,0.051947523,-0.05810526,0.053868175,0.058860525,-0.055985466,0.03097217,0.03681426,-0.044883367,0.004997059,-0.057806578,-0.006104644,-0.05008718,0.05865512,-0.009374557,-0.058981948,-0.027907494,0.055667467,-0.03671763,0.023418868,-0.058444723,-0.02854595,-0.014452435,-0.051955104,-0.027202176,0.010265885,0.038115595,-0.058990974,-0.05235665,-0.002915231,-0.058756303,0.036800075,-0.054562945,-0.052137934,0.057345856,0.0447081,0.043822296,0.05883255,0.05615345,0.049373254,-0.041641057,0.01902756,-0.049528316,0.048099518,-0.058748394,0.044037737,0.008648471,0.053609192,-0.009591355,0.022746991,-0.058903836,0.048065014,0.05729337,0.03900635,-0.037927315,-0.040212665,0.029602269,-0.058625937,-0.043905452,0.001484404,0.04217827,-0.01778458,-0.054106805,0.05803398,-0.033809066,-0.004364106,0.054478,0.02596012,-0.057476297,-0.014629484,-0.05871341,0.032811787,-0.027809475,-0.057454444,0.055538695,0.015188618,0.049160838,-0.032413468,-0.018928774,0.05120533,0.053694047,-0.005498502,0.02158683

Reverse genetic characterization of the natural genomic deletion in SARS-Coronavirus strain Frankfurt-1 open reading frame 7b reveals an attenuating function of the 7b protein in-vitro and in-vivo,"During the outbreak of SARS in 2002/3, a prototype virus was isolated from a patient in Frankfurt/Germany (strain Frankfurt-1). As opposed to all other SARS-Coronavirus strains, Frankfurt-1 has a 45-nucleotide deletion in the transmembrane domain of its ORF 7b protein. When over-expressed in HEK 293 cells, the full-length protein but not the variant with the deletion caused interferon beta induction and cleavage of procaspase 3. To study the role of ORF 7b in the context of virus replication, we cloned a full genome cDNA copy of Frankfurt-1 in a bacterial artificial chromosome downstream of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Transfection of capped RNA transcribed from this construct yielded infectious virus that was indistinguishable from the original virus isolate. The presumed Frankfurt-1 ancestor with an intact ORF 7b was reconstructed. In CaCo-2 and HUH7 cells, but not in Vero cells, the variant carrying the ORF 7b deletion had a replicative advantage against the parental virus (4- and 6-fold increase of virus RNA in supernatant, respectively). This effect was neither associated with changes in the induction or secretion of type I interferon, nor with altered induction of apoptosis in cell culture. However, pretreatment of cells with interferon beta caused the deleted virus to replicate to higher titers than the parental strain (3.4-fold in Vero cells, 7.9-fold in CaCo-2 cells). In Syrian Golden Hamsters inoculated intranasally with 10e4 plaque forming units of either virus, mean titers of infectious virus and viral RNA in the lungs after 24 h were increased 23- and 94.8-fold, respectively, with the deleted virus. This difference could explain earlier observations of enhanced virulence of Frankfurt-1 in Hamsters as compared to other SARS-Coronavirus reference strains and identifies the SARS-CoV 7b protein as an attenuating factor with the SARS-Coronavirus genome.

Development of a fluorescent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection of Goose parvovirus in vivo,"BACKGROUND: Goose parvovirus (GPV) is a Dependovirus associated with latent infection and mortality in geese. Currently, it severely affects geese production worldwide. The objective of this study was to develop a fluorescent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (FQ-PCR) assay for fast and accurate quantification of GPV DNA in infected goslings, which can aid in the understanding of the regular distribution pattern and the nosogenesis of GPV in vivo. RESULTS: The detection limit of the assay was 2.8 × 10(1 )standard DNA copies, with a sensitivity of 3 logs higher than that of the conventional gel-based PCR assay targeting the same gene. The real-time PCR was reproducible, as shown by satisfactory low intraassay and interassay coefficients of variation.

Collection by trained pediatricians or parents of mid-turbinate nasal flocked swabs for the detection of influenza viruses in childhood,"This study evaluated the efficiency of pediatric mid-turbinate nasal flocked swabs used by parents in 203 children aged 6 months to 5 years with signs and symptoms of respiratory disease. Two nasal samples were collected from each child in a randomised sequence: one by a trained pediatrician and one by a parent. The real-time polymerase chain reaction influenza virus detection rates were similar in the samples collected using the two methods (Cohen's kappa = 0.86), as were the cycle threshold values. In comparison with the pediatrician-collected samples, the sensitivity and specificity of the parental collections were respectively 89.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 77.8-100%) and 97.7% (95% CI: 95.5-100%), and the positive and negative predictive values were respectively 86.2% (95% CI: 73.7-95.1%) and 98.2% (95% CI: 96.4-100%). The children were significantly more satisfied with the parental collections (median values ± standard deviation, 1.59 ± 0.55 vs 3.51 ± 0.36; p < 0.0001). These findings show that mid-turbinate nasal flocked swabs specifically designed for infants and children can be used by parents without reducing the influenza virus detection rate. Moreover, the direct involvement of parents significantly increases patient acceptance, thus simplifying collection and suggesting that this novel swab design should be considered for epidemiological surveys and vaccine efficacy

A multiplex reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction for detection and differentiation of wild-type and vaccine strains of canine distemper virus,"A multiplex reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) method was developed for the detection and differentiation of wild-type and vaccine strains of canine distemper virus (CDV). A pair of primers (P1 and P4) specific for CDV corresponding to the highly conserved region of the CDV genome were used as a common primer pair in the first-round PCR of the nested PCR. Primers P2 specific for CDV wild-type strains, were used as the forward primer together with the common reverse primer P4 in the second round of nested PCR. Primers P3, P5 specific for CDV wild-type strain or vaccine strain, were used as the forward primer together with the common reverse primer P4+P6 in the second round of nested PCR. A fragment of 177 bp was amplified from vaccine strain genomic RNA, and a fragment of 247 bp from wild-type strain genomic RNA in the RT-nPCR, and two fragments of 247 bp and 177 bp were amplified from the mixed samples of vaccine and wild-type strains. No amplification was achieved for uninfected cells, or cells infected with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), canine parvovirus (CPV), canine coronavirus (CCV), rabies virus (RV), or canine adenovirus (CAV). The RT-nPCR method was used to detect 30 field samples suspected of canine distemper from Heilongjiang and Jilin Provinces, and 51 samples in Shandong province. As a result of 30 samples, were found to be wild-type-like, and 5 to be vaccine-strain-like. The RT-nPCR method can be used to effectively detect and differentiate wild-type CDV-infected dogs from dogs vaccinated with CDV vaccine, and thus can be used in clinical detection and epidemiological

An emerging recombinant human enterovirus 71 responsible for the 2008 outbreak of Hand Foot and Mouth Disease in Fuyang city of China,"Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), a common contagious disease that usually affects children, is normally mild but can have life-threatening manifestations. It can be caused by enteroviruses, particularly Coxsackieviruses and human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) with highly variable clinical manifestations. In the spring of 2008, a large, unprecedented HFMD outbreak in Fuyang city of Anhui province in the central part of southeastern China resulted in a high aggregation of fatal cases. In this study, epidemiologic and clinical investigations, laboratory testing, and genetic analyses were performed to identify the causal pathogen of the outbreak. Of the 6,049 cases reported between 1 March and 9 May of 2008, 3023 (50%) were hospitalized, 353 (5.8%) were severe and 22 (0.36%) were fatal. HEV71 was confirmed as the etiological pathogen of the outbreak. Phylogenetic analyses of entire VP1 capsid protein sequence of 45 Fuyang HEV71 isolates showed that they belong to C4a cluster of the C4 subgenotype. In addition, genetic recombinations were found in the 3D region (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a major component of the viral replication complex of the genome) between the Fuyang HEV71 strain and Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), resulting in a recombination virus. In conclusion, an emerging recombinant HEV71 was responsible for the HFMD outbreak in Fuyang City of China,

A duplex real-time RT-PCR assay for detecting H5N1 avian influenza virus and pandemic H1N1 influenza virus,"A duplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was improved for simultaneous detection of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus and pandemic H1N1 (2009) influenza virus, which is suitable for early diagnosis of influenza-like patients and for epidemiological surveillance. The sensitivity of this duplex real-time RT-PCR assay was 0.02 TCID(50 )(50% tissue culture infective dose) for H5N1 and 0.2 TCID(50 )for the pandemic H1N1, which was the same as that of each single-target RT-PCR for pandemic H1N1 and even more sensitive for H5N1 with the same primers and probes. No cross reactivity of detecting other subtype influenza viruses or respiratory tract viruses was observed.

Real-world comparison of two molecular methods for detection of respiratory viruses,"BACKGROUND: Molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assays are increasingly used to diagnose viral respiratory infections and conduct epidemiology studies. Molecular assays have generally been evaluated by comparing them to conventional direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) or viral culture techniques, with few published direct comparisons between molecular methods or between institutions. We sought to perform a real-world comparison of two molecular respiratory viral diagnostic methods between two experienced respiratory virus research laboratories. METHODS: We tested nasal and throat swab specimens obtained from 225 infants with respiratory illness for 11 common respiratory viruses using both a multiplex assay (Respiratory MultiCode-PLx Assay [RMA]) and individual real-time RT-PCR (RT-rtPCR). RESULTS: Both assays detected viruses in more than 70% of specimens, but there was discordance. The RMA assay detected significantly more human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), while RT-rtPCR detected significantly more influenza A. We speculated that primer differences accounted for these discrepancies and redesigned the primers and probes for influenza A in the RMA assay, and for HMPV and RSV in the RT-rtPCR assay. The tests were then repeated and again compared. The new primers led to improved detection of HMPV and RSV by RT-rtPCR assay, but the RMA assay remained similar in terms of influenza detection. CONCLUSIONS: Given the absence of a gold standard, clinical and research laboratories should regularly correlate the results of molecular assays with other PCR based assays, other laboratories, and with standard virologic methods to ensure consistency and accuracy.",-0.057560444,0.025316052,-0.0493617,-0.005426969,0.049038693,-6.41E-05,0.055372536,-0.05705244,-0.0452825,0.02197907,0.057745136,-0.012141187,0.0575931,-0.019642267,0.05607638,-0.0547734,-0.05774279,0.030262813,0.05734337,-0.04289812,0.038088005,-0.040955998,-0.05755003,0.051888738,-0.017077683,-0.012462048,0.012592339,0.05719097,-0.041124575,-0.040355887,0.057394683,0.057744656,-0.01812358,-0.001112292,0.022337038,-0.013697551,-0.057723455,-0.057561807,-0.05753671,0.028043525,-0.036726486,-0.043877006,-0.05700501,-0.014077011,0.02591238,0.049565405,-0.022038182,0.050513495,0.057458244,0.027679227,-0.053393833,-0.044584602,-0.05756591,-0.014836352,-0.057731245,0.0496821,-0.055758376,-0.015771968,0.03060171,0.05443196,0.03224007,0.04768099,-0.015234287,0.001771,0.04441283,-0.057382032,0.056062166,0.020328766,0.053999953,-0.057138458,0.04149754,0.05186874,0.03975427,0.03728615,-0.05362992,-0.034441713,-0.041503973,-0.04727642,-0.057744537,0.04862439,0.04084647,0.053287085,0.05376676,0.04853667,-0.047848284,0.04268592,-0.050392374,-0.038910683,0.052355878,-0.054909173,-0.045587134,-0.036799535,-0.051418394,-0.027527152,0.041915353,0.04934443,0.050955195,0.057366505,0.057486136,-0.041255087,-0.045980405,-0.051349428,-0.022618052,0.053446114,0.053302757,0.006420139,0.000716652,0.05704806,0.034571663,0.007778679,-0.02549439,0.05588703,0.041050367,-0.013825442,0.05760795,0.016819995,-0.048494786,-0.012162885,-0.033917993,0.014759157,-0.050023846,0.019738838,0.037192184,-0.05143076,-0.00968657,0.054725826,-0.03911407,0.031349268,-0.000498234,0.043062244,-0.002097589,0.057745144,0.038033683,-0.044432197,-0.000650013,-0.027272109,0.055598766,0.050306205,0.052917592,-0.025452103,-0.027873179,0.057733748,-0.05417918,-0.023305701,-0.019524572,0.0477552,0.03855219,-0.057725575,0.05739802,0.04810791,0.05696824,-0.04163742,-0.05734146,-0.057606857,0.057725586,0.030827064,0.03759287,0.01727978,0.051258944,-0.038351454,-0.016138082,0.03456433,-0.04469857,0.057309967,-0.020450935,-0.053420242,-0.05713869,0.052888714,-0.054629058,-0.056101717,-0.008888775,-0.057171095,-0.050643355,0.036287386,-0.02063293,-0.03845926,0.03879079,-0.03215536,0.054873813,0.029845439,-0.02846415,0.045337748,-0.01626076,0.057095323,0.0574924,0.048973158,-0.04290943,-0.053960577,-0.042659845,0.034721445,0.057744738,-0.05629715,-0.026633885,-0.00597893,0.046586815,-0.055872824,-0.054198083,-0.011307688,-0.05025693,-0.04921141,-0.041879825,0.054847267,0.010756399,0.054311503,0.05748821,-0.057711914,0.037916683,-0.008724153,0.026387183,0.052623957,0.040746078,0.043641277,0.033982538,0.05736821,-0.04610394,-0.054590937,0.049101353,0.051126953,-0.047687497,-0.0409584,-0.009579264,-0.048138734,0.038478594,-0.006660898,-0.037439484,0.05703051,-0.05522193,-0.056108736,-0.028154809,0.03450663,0.050311532,0.05767853,0.046908434,-0.05768474,0.014223929,0.05224777,-0.022497753,-0.05704843,0.012012706,0.03653381,-0.009224951,-0.053364508,-0.057733875,-0.057667855,0.05742102,-0.053999096,-0.056603577,-0.051807698,0.019188117,-0.05749605,-0.012889872,0.034566067,-0.0358053,0.054667637,0.050292216,-0.036548935,-0.057743967,0.05774512,0.014950219,0.005681879,0.05534897,-0.024292223,0.031929538,0.054543275,-0.054850653,-0.017559743,-0.025284307,-0.00716801,0.019907169,0.017732585,0.013597391,0.05308874,-0.045755684,-0.047796335,-0.051563457,-0.05275945,-0.048543226,-0.04784917,0.057469238,-0.045059018,-0.057728652,0.025090648,-0.052099634,0.049123425,-0.05361487,0.006655216,-0.006889297,0.05733721,-0.052208822,-0.0333595,0.057469714,0.025093658,0.054666057,-0.05751977,-0.010454225,-0.051677067,-0.022936342,-0.001731572,-0.038325995,0.051981594,-0.036122616,0.036586408,0.048755996,0.008651231,-0.057737824,0.04751277,0.054255214,-0.05512038,0.05753321,-0.033086754,0.030137654,-0.035702363,0.056975324,-0.024014067,0.057722952,0.04110715,0.044341482,0.053084005,0.057614993,-0.00622821,-0.056185294,0.026796486,0.053733747,-0.047307555,-0.046369486,0.056707107,-0.014131584,-0.04167645,-0.05728085,-0.056615267,0.007545782,0.05552393,0.055145804,0.05772556,0.012113952,0.032495286,0.056538202,0.05683228,0.047531743,-0.04299399,-0.04665284,0.038320772,0.057584256,0.050309382,-0.057731353,-0.057744145,0.056889776,0.05428727,-0.056843538,-0.05773183,0.05327616,-0.008482325,-0.025220357,0.05445032,0.05752614,-0.045058217,-0.057742026,-0.05231414,-0.02571741,-0.057599492,0.026846591,-0.055560656,-0.0552812,-0.003065183,-0.051324826,-0.05772393,0.05767085,-0.012492901,0.050655227,-0.035356317,0.028054073,0.05505927,-0.051018614,-0.057733208,0.05760299,0.057025876,0.050976064,0.010076218,0.03549544,-0.056228828,-0.0573146,0.00232384,-0.00478662,0.042097494,0.000916437,0.013075879,0.004716628,-0.055139877,-0.025074957,0.050366245,0.045426767,0.010852188,0.02219083,0.03280838,0.003066937,-6.95E-05,0.020645259,-0.057743486,0.046715707,-0.052549202,0.03376428,0.03900068,0.05506266,0.057095293,0.045832634,0.013995587,0.002502472,0.0531858,0.05598613,-0.052820936,0.051143553,0.0

Rapid detection of wheat yellow mosaic virus by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification,"For the detection of wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV), we established a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method. Using Primer Explorer software, four sets of primers were designed and RT-LAMP assay reaction conditions were optimized. The RT-LAMP was performed at different times by four primer sets. Agarose gel analysis showed that WYMV could be detected after 30 min with the primer set III and after 45 min with the other three primer sets, both under the 80-min reaction time. RT-LAMP had the same results with the four primer sets, thus primer set III and 65°C for 80 min reaction were selected for virus detection. There was no significant different when avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) and moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) RT-LAMP with the four primer sets and M-MLV was chosen due to its relatively cheap price. The result on specificity showed that the assay could amplify WYMV specifically, and the sensitivity comparison showed that the RT-LAMP was 100 times more sensitive than conventional reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Overall, RT-LAMP was found to be a simple, specific, sensitive, convenient and time-saving method for WYMV detection.",-0.056984015,-0.038133465,-0.011431829,-0.059842512,0.05632467,0.043426245,0.043644056,-0.04920862,0.04103456,0.060805798,0.061764292,0.020697182,0.04440631,0.04574132,0.05373821,0.023999192,-0.057805754,-0.035663284,0.04557678,-0.015178259,-0.06316452,-0.043041293,-0.054705877,0.062154964,0.045966364,0.015183487,-0.047405608,0.045335248,0.057576925,-0.034044232,0.06278332,0.062133074,-0.004301929,0.031133024,-0.028286917,0.05818493,-0.04283235,-0.059544854,-0.056366365,0.007687282,-0.037938606,-0.045548975,-0.037174124,-0.05920299,-0.042498834,-0.013214055,0.014274723,-0.030351192,-0.036457364,-0.025481625,0.007130162,-0.04946358,-0.063333735,-0.060977954,-0.060148805,0.003683656,-0.06224162,0.007583922,0.061938725,0.051520877,0.04526263,-0.02710761,0.00973144,-0.03694183,0.018867794,-0.054598827,0.0598763,-0.06115356,0.062222376,-0.056943174,0.035634138,-0.007108548,0.04637226,0.060881518,-0.050742928,0.009322755,0.010457564,-0.050687958,-0.06351082,0.0349499,0.010937232,0.054616623,0.044579487,0.02182018,-0.061005414,0.063446365,0.04711284,-0.005339644,-0.033617605,-0.0253703,-0.001596228,-0.030434525,-0.061471142,-0.021653919,0.048076436,0.027748683,0.056392632,0.0622501,0.05859277,-0.060546715,-0.05535128,-0.030680507,-0.01402742,0.0248213,0.060966387,0.045830917,-0.020412153,0.016588645,-0.062387627,0.013433762,0.003009707,0.059293628,0.044835992,0.00470386,0.062298287,0.008107717,-0.023430264,-0.020273887,-0.014724213,0.061408944,-0.053448245,0.06164229,0.027755288,-0.028881406,-0.022865418,0.06153344,-0.018787026,-0.056691006,-0.05696086,0.024995117,-0.060174216,0.06293351,0.062480133,-0.062052693,-0.001445793,-0.06236824,-0.024779681,0.058715798,-0.04152049,0.013930545,0.032940645,0.06366784,-0.061843637,-0.003193347,-0.04352856,-0.05845531,0.022111528,-0.019861622,0.04225309,0.021776047,0.026766688,-0.005632115,-0.057795797,-0.060550287,0.058728416,-0.038479917,0.05183824,0.019606564,0.009592533,0.026295727,0.006275302,0.029779673,-0.060385797,0.06195879,0.036252085,0.038013794,-0.052685957,0.036623564,-0.051065072,-0.061171867,-0.023637699,-0.05457958,-0.028769176,0.062464412,-0.0578046,-0.008321479,0.038646698,-0.026166052,0.05770719,0.05103161,-0.058394283,-0.017683422,-0.011277291,0.052631862,0.06256997,-0.006113541,-0.0333334,0.008471426,0.004131258,0.038450576,0.06364682,-0.054067064,0.02307652,0.02272928,0.007284738,-0.013408551,0.03072626,-0.027237138,-0.031996693,-0.04622452,0.024219481,0.06294521,0.04574409,0.036887992,0.061386283,-0.041187536,-0.04870283,-0.016867455,0.019374808,0.05709692,-0.043107633,-0.052782573,0.054344777,0.05169491,-0.06321863,-0.05859224,0.059682738,0.04322101,-0.02736749,-0.025261994,0.037378117,-0.045162443,0.010785452,0.019232195,0.03495263,0.042428058,-0.06341761,-0.043745477,-0.03300861,-0.053263236,0.03994276,0.032399453,0.0532183,-0.0636714,-0.037168827,0.051470615,0.04591707,-0.05128924,-0.033983707,0.045946453,0.03873327,-0.059017595,-0.059938435,-0.042934556,-0.009018745,-0.056584775,-0.054877922,0.05634895,0.01799505,-0.034747932,-0.057660505,0.045470126,0.010229178,0.03469822,0.06303666,0.011830876,-0.042546112,0.06367355,0.059765354,0.02145107,0.045766663,0.048842352,-0.026161503,0.045757685,0.038465764,-0.061870553,-0.060009718,0.055524144,-0.00521925,-0.00958158,-0.0364035,0.055965565,-0.037322007,-0.05919444,-0.036139462,-0.045939054,0.033061143,-0.057648294,0.059801668,0.05029925,-0.063248515,-0.03317473,-0.056496836,-0.028138906,-0.038993407,-0.03986202,-0.039077178,0.05971357,-0.029139325,0.057904243,0.036667448,0.057095256,-0.010917474,0.002095711,-0.009587752,-0.03568084,-0.060309496,-0.04527359,-0.007094673,-0.01907557,0.011635314,0.058364395,0.021949036,0.016169615,-0.06282839,0.048927095,0.063024886,-0.058503278,0.0626091,-0.030398404,0.009254942,-0.019840952,0.05367399,-0.05166013,0.06197983,0.060269766,-0.003010215,0.04294635,0.033841867,-0.035923544,-0.045804802,0.058825053,0.060796805,-0.01462154,-0.054762546,0.051340457,-0.042289585,0.008292745,-0.055758804,-0.05518744,0.06059712,0.057339575,-0.011514683,0.060693067,-0.049989533,0.058496926,0.05257609,-0.052793335,-0.027083475,-0.04697965,-0.03486673,0.019950863,0.015346137,0.053338073,-0.063552804,-0.052734584,0.050821766,-0.012371601,0.010136079,-0.063233756,0.03629002,0.049389075,0.04252537,0.06112745,0.045485083,0.026582362,-0.063652635,-0.016359475,0.050461777,-0.06362552,0.030704916,-0.03003273,-0.044199813,-0.04440776,0.026659206,-0.028858228,0.0635277,0.046433136,0.061594643,-0.04829297,0.04843785,0.034218077,0.025164114,-0.06349573,0.05713147,0.05463542,-0.0465145,0.04854364,-0.05046958,-0.05363578,-0.058097072,0.005116229,0.02870188,0.033457574,0.03475421,-0.057342693,0.01033756,-0.050069004,-0.02973101,0.043292083,0.047865935,-0.01849323,0.0175609,-0.002986566,0.011186017,0.013992451,0.049160127,-0.06136662,0.008252415,-0.0636296,0.04612496,0.056132622,0.044141997,0.015657255,0.024636691,-0.060361657,0.058707263,0.02526268,0.0538043,0.05811682,0.055252824,0.0444

Respiratory viruses in children hospitalized for acute lower respiratory tract infection in Ghana,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory tract infections are one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality among young children in developing countries. Information on the viral aetiology of acute respiratory infections in developing countries is very limited. The study was done to identify viruses associated with acute lower respiratory tract infection among children less than 5 years. METHOD: Nasopharyngeal samples and blood cultures were collected from children less than 5 years who have been hospitalized for acute lower respiratory tract infection. Viruses and bacteria were identified using Reverse Transcriptase Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction and conventional biochemical techniques. RESULTS: Out of 128 patients recruited, 33(25.88%%, 95%CI: 18.5% to 34.2%) were positive for one or more viruses. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) was detected in 18(14.1%, 95%CI: 8.5% to 21.3%) patients followed by Adenoviruses (AdV) in 13(10.2%, 95%CI: 5.5% to 16.7%), Parainfluenza (PIV type: 1, 2, 3) in 4(3.1%, 95%CI: 0.9% to 7.8%) and influenza B viruses in 1(0.8%, 95%CI: 0.0 to 4.3). Concomitant viral and bacterial co-infection occurred in two patients. There were no detectable significant differences in the clinical signs, symptoms and severity for the various pathogens isolated. A total of 61.1% (22/36) of positive viruses were detected during the rainy season and Respiratory Syncytial Virus was the most predominant. CONCLUSION: The study has demonstrated an important burden of respiratory viruses as major causes of childhood acute respiratory infection in a tertiary health institution in Ghana. The data addresses a need for more studies on viral associated respiratory tract

Visual detection of the human metapneumovirus using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification with hydroxynaphthol blue dye,"BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a major cause of acute respiratory infections ranging from wheezing to bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children worldwide. The objective of this study is to develop a visual reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the detection of hMPV and applied to the clinical samples. RESULTS: In this study, visual RT-LAMP assay for hMPV was performed in one step with the addition of hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB), and were used to detect respiratory samples. Six primers, including two outer primers (F3 and B3), two inner primers (FIP, BIP) and two loop primers (LF and LB), were designed for hMPV N gene by the online software. Moreover, the RT-LAMP assay showed good specificity and no cross-reactivity was observed with human rhinovirus (HRV), human respiratory syncytial Virus (RSV), or influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). The detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was approximately ten viral RNA copies, lower than that of traditional reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 100 RNA copies. In the 176 nasopharyngeal samples, 23 (13.1%) were conformed as hMPV positive by RT-LAMP, but 18 (10.2%) positive by RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional RT-PCR, the visual hMPV RT-LAMP assay performed well in the aspect of detect time, sensitivity, specificity and visibility. It is anticipated that the RT-LAMP will be used for clinical tests in hospital or field testing during outbreaks and in

Bovine herpes virus type 1 induces apoptosis through Fas-dependent and mitochondria-controlled manner in Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells,"BACKGROUND: Bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) is an important pathogen in cattle that is responsible for substantial economic losses. Previous studies suggest that BHV-1 may induce apoptosis in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells via a mechanism only involving caspases and p53. However, the mechanism for BHV-1-induced MDBK cell apoptosis still requires more research. METHODS: MDBK was used as a model to study the precise signaling pathways of apoptosis induced by BHV-1 infection. RESULTS: BHV-1 infection activated a Fas/FasL-mediated apoptotic pathway, resulting in activation of caspase-8 and cleavage of Bid. In addition, BHV-1 infection down-regulated Bcl-2 and up-regulated Bax expression, thereby initiating the release of cytochrome c followed by caspase-9 activation. The combined activation of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways resulted in activation of downstream effecter caspase-3 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), leading to apoptosis. Furthermore, blocking apoptosis using caspase inhibitors improved BHV-1-infected MDBK cell viability to different extent. BHV-1 infection did not induce significant DNA fragmentation in MDBK cells pretreated with ammonium chloride (NH(4)Cl) or cells infected with UV-inactivated BHV-1. Blocking caspases activation increased BHV-1 replication. CONCLUSIONS: BHV-1 induces apoptosis in MDBK cells through extrinsic and intrinsic pathways and there might be cross-talk between the two pathways. In addition, BHV-1 replication may be necessary for the induction of apoptosis in BHV-1-infected cells, and prolonged cell viability benefits BHV-1

Diagnostic value of respiratory virus detection in symptomatic children using real-time PCR,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory tract infections are an important public health problem. Sensitive and rapid diagnostic techniques have been developed and are used in daily clinical practice. Here we evaluate the clinical relevance of detecting 20 common respiratory pathogens by molecular methods in a general pediatric clinic. METHODS: Nasopharynx samples of children < 18 years of age with respiratory symptoms referred to a general pediatric clinic were tested for the presence of 19 viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, using real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Of 177 patients included in this retrospective study, 73% were positive for at least one virus. Respiratory syncytial virus (36.6%) and human rhinovirus (24%) were most frequently detected. Patients in whom a respiratory virus or Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected, were younger (6 versus 24 months; p < 0.001) and more often hospitalized (116 versus 34; p = 0.001) than patients in whom no respiratory pathogen was detected. Also they were more likely to present with feeding problems, dyspnea, rhinorrhea and wheezing (all p < 0.05) than patients without a respiratory pathogen. In the majority of cases, clinicians did not change their antibiotic management after detecting a viral respiratory pathogen. No difference in mean Ct value was found between patients with one respiratory pathogen and those with >1 respiratory pathogen (30.5 versus 31.2; p = 0.573). CONCLUSION: Routine testing of common respiratory pathogens could lead to a better understanding of their role in disease in children with respiratory

First introduction of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 and detection of respiratory viruses in pediatric patients in Central African Republic,"BACKGROUND: Acute viral respiratory illnesses in children in sub-Saharan Africa have received relatively little attention, although they are much more frequent causes of morbidity and mortality than in developed countries. Active surveillance is essential to identify the causative agents and to improve clinical management, especially in the context of possible circulation of pandemic viruses. FINDINGS: A prospective study was conducted in the Central African Republic (CAR) between January and December 2010 among infants and children aged 0–15 years attending sentinel sites for influenza-like illness or acute respiratory illness. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected, and one-step real-time and multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to detect respiratory viruses. Respiratory viruses were detected in 49 of the 329 (14.9%) nasopharyngeal samples: 29 (8.8%) contained influenza viruses (5 (1.5%) had pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus and 24 (7.3%) had influenza B viruses), 11 (3.3%) contained parainfluenza viruses types 1 and 3 and 9 (2.7%) contained human respiratory syncytial virus. Most cases were detected during the rainy season in the CAR. Analysis of the amplicon sequences confirmed the identity of each detected virus. CONCLUSIONS: The influenza surveillance system in the CAR has provided valuable data on the seasonality of influenza and the circulation of other respiratory viruses. Our network could therefore play a valuable role in the prevention and control of influenza epidemics in the

Evaluation and molecular characterization of human adenovirus in drinking water supplies: viral integrity and viability assays,"BACKGROUND: Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are the second-leading cause of childhood gastroenteritis worldwide. This virus is commonly found in environmental waters and is very resistant to water disinfection and environmental stressors, especially UV light inactivation. Molecular techniques, such as PCR-based methods (Polymerase Chain Reaction), are commonly used to detect and identify viral contamination in water, although PCR alone does not allow the discrimination between infectious and non-infectious viral particles. A combination of cell culture and PCR has allowed detection of infectious viruses that grow slowly or fail to produce cytopathic effects (CPE) in cell culture. This study aimed to assess the integrity and viability of human adenovirus (HAdV) in environmental water and evaluate circulating strains by molecular characterization in three sites of the water supply in Florianópolis, Santa Catarina Island, Brazil: Peri Lagoon water, spring source water, and water from the public water supply system. METHODS: Water samples were collected, concentrated and HAdV quantified by real-time PCR. Viral integrity was evaluated by enzymatic assay (DNase I) and infectivity by plaque assay (PA) and integrated cell culture using transcribed mRNA (ICC-RT-qPCR). Samples containing particles of infectious HAdV were selected for sequencing and molecular characterization. RESULTS: The analyzed sites contained 83, 66 and 58% undamaged HAdV particles (defined as those in which the genetic material is protected by the viral capsid) at Peri Lagoon, spring source water and public supply system water, respectively. Of these, 66% of the particles (by PA) and 75% (by ICC-RT-qPCR) HAdV were shown to be infectious, due to being undamaged in Peri Lagoon, 33% (by PA) and 58% (by ICC-RT-qPCR) in spring source water and 8% (by PA) and 25% (by ICC-RT-qPCR) in the public water supply system. ICC-RT-qPCR, a very sensitive and rapid technique, was able to detect as low as 1 × 10(2) HAdV genome copies per milliliter of infectious viral particles in the environmental water samples. The molecular characterization studies indicated that HAdV-2 was the prevalent serotype. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate a lack of proper public health measures.

Transmission of Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) Virus in a Train in China,"BACKGROUND: Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged in North America in April 2009 and spread globally. We describe the epidemiology and public health response to the first known outbreak of 2009 H1N1 in a train, which occurred in June 2009 in China. METHODS: After 2 provinces provided initial reports of 2009 H1N1 infection in 2 persons who had travelled on the same train, we conducted a retrospective epidemiologic investigation to collect information from the passengers, crew members, contacts, and health care providers. We explored the source of infection and possible routes of transmission in the train. All cases were confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. RESULTS: Train #1223 traveled 40 hours, made 28 stops in 4 Chinese provinces, and boarded 2555 passengers, who logged a total of 59 144 person-hours of travel time. Nineteen confirmed 2009 H1N1 cases were identified. Of these, 13 were infected and developed symptoms on the train and 6 occurred among contacts who developed illness during medical monitoring. In addition, 3 asymptomatic cases were identified based on RT-PCR testing of respiratory swabs from contacts. The attack rate among contacts of confirmed cases in the same car was higher than that among contacts in other cars (3.15% vs. 0%, P < 0.001). Attack rates increased with exposure time. CONCLUSIONS: Close contact and long exposure may have contributed to the transmission of 2009 H1N1 virus in the train. Trains may have played an important role in the 2009 influenza

"Prevalence of adenovirus in children with acute respiratory tract infection in Lanzhou, China","BACKGROUND: Human adenovirus (HAdV) is an important agent causing respiratory tract infection in children. Information on the epidemiological and clinical features of HAdV is limited in children with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in China, especially those of a novel genotype, Ad55. METHODS: In total, 1169 nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children younger than 14 years with ARTIs between November 2006 and November 2009. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to screen HAdVs. All PCR-positive products were sequenced. RESULTS: 74 of 1169 (6.33%) specimens were positive for HAdVs. Among positive cases, AdV3 (58/74) was detected most frequently, followed by AdV11 (10/74), AdV2 (2/74), AdV7 (2/69), AdV6 (1/74), and AdV1 (1/74). AdV55 was found in one case. The incidence of HAdV infection peaked in children aged 3–7 years. The most common clinical diagnosis was upper respiratory infection, and the most common syndrome was fever and cough.The comparison of HAdV and RSV group revealed that Children infected with group AdV were significant older than children infected with group RSV, had more fever but less frequently wheezing, and cough, crackles, and cyanosis, The duration of hospitalization between the AdV group and RSV group was not significant, but a greater frequency of LRTIs was observed in RSV group. CONCLUSIONS: HAdV is an important viral agent in children with ARTIs in Lanzhou City, China. Multiple HAdV serotypes co-circulated with Ad3, which was predominant in this 3-year study.

Antibody-dependent infection of human macrophages by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,"BACKGROUND: Public health risks associated to infection by human coronaviruses remain considerable and vaccination is a key option for preventing the resurgence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We have previously reported that antibodies elicited by a SARS-CoV vaccine candidate based on recombinant, full-length SARS-CoV Spike-protein trimers, trigger infection of immune cell lines. These observations prompted us to investigate the molecular mechanisms and responses to antibody-mediated infection in human macrophages. METHODS: We have used primary human immune cells to evaluate their susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV in the presence of anti-Spike antibodies. Fluorescence microscopy and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were utilized to assess occurrence and consequences of infection. To gain insight into the underlying molecular mechanism, we performed mutational analysis with a series of truncated and chimeric constructs of fragment crystallizable γ receptors (FcγR), which bind antibody-coated pathogens. RESULTS: We show here that anti-Spike immune serum increased infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages by replication-competent SARS-CoV as well as Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles (SARS-CoVpp). Macrophages infected with SARS-CoV, however, did not support productive replication of the virus. Purified anti-viral IgGs, but not other soluble factor(s) from heat-inactivated mouse immune serum, were sufficient to enhance infection. Antibody-mediated infection was dependent on signaling-competent members of the human FcγRII family, which were shown to confer susceptibility to otherwise naïve ST486 cells, as binding of immune complexes to cell surface FcγRII was necessary but not sufficient to trigger antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. Furthermore, only FcγRII with intact cytoplasmic signaling domains were competent to sustain ADE of SARS-CoVpp infection, thus providing additional information on the role of downstream signaling by FcγRII. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that human macrophages can be infected by SARS-CoV as a result of IgG-mediated ADE and indicate that this infection route requires signaling pathways activated downstream of binding to FcγRII

Low-Fidelity Polymerases of Alphaviruses Recombine at Higher Rates To Overproduce Defective Interfering Particles,"Low-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerases for many RNA virus mutators have been shown to confer attenuated phenotypes, presumably due to increased mutation rates. Additionally, for many RNA viruses, replication to high titers results in the production of defective interfering particles (DIs) that also attenuate infection. We hypothesized that fidelity, recombination, and DI production are tightly linked. We show that a Sindbis virus mutator replicating at a high multiplicity of infection manifests an earlier and greater accumulation of DIs than its wild-type counterpart. The isolated DIs interfere with the replication of full-length virus in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, the ability of the mutator virus to overproduce DIs could be linked to an increased recombination frequency. These data confirm that RNA-dependent RNA polymerase fidelity and recombination are inversely correlated for this mutator. Our findings suggest that defective interference resulting from higher recombination rates may be more detrimental to RNA virus mutators than the increase in mutational burden. IMPORTANCE Replication, adaptation, and evolution of RNA viruses rely in large part on their low-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Viruses artificially modified in their polymerases to decrease fidelity (mutator viruses) are attenuated in vivo, demonstrating the important role of fidelity in viral fitness. However, attenuation was attributed solely to the modification of the viral mutation rate and the accumulation of detrimental point mutations. In this work, we described an additional phenotype of mutator viruses: an increased recombination rate leading to defective interfering particle (DI) overproduction. Because DIs are known for their inhibitory effect on viral replication, our work suggests that fidelity variants may be attenuated in vivo via several mechanisms. This has important implications in the development of fidelity variants as live attenuated vaccine

Isolation and Characterization of a Novel Gammaherpesvirus from a Microbat Cell Line,"While employing deep sequencing and de novo assembly to characterize the mRNA transcript profile of a cell line derived from the microbat Myotis velifer incautus, we serendipitously identified mRNAs encoding proteins with a high level of identity to herpesviruses. A majority were closely related to proteins of equine herpesvirus 2 (EHV-2), a horse gammaherpesvirus. We demonstrated by electron microscopy the presence of herpesvirus-like particles in the microbat cells. Passage of supernatants from microbat cells to Vero cells resulted in syncytium formation, and expression of viral genes and amplification of viral DNA were demonstrated by quantitative PCR. Susceptibility of human cell lines to productive infection was also demonstrated. Next-generation sequencing and de novo assembly of the viral genome from supernatants from Vero cells yielded a single contig of approximately 130 kb with at least 77 open reading frames (ORFs), predicted microRNAs (miRNAs), and a gammaherpesvirus genomic organization. Phylogenic analysis of the envelope glycoprotein (gB) and DNA polymerase (POLD1) revealed similarity to multiple gammaherpesviruses, including those from as-yet-uncultured viruses of the Rhadinovirus genus that were obtained by deep sequencing of bat tissues. Moreover, the assembled genome revealed ORFs that share little or no homology to known ORFs in EHV-2 but are similar to accessory proteins of other gammaherpesviruses. Some also have striking homology to predicted Myotis bat proteins. Cumulatively, this study provides the first isolation and characterization of a replication-competent bat gammaherpesvirus. IMPORTANCE Bats are of significant interest as reservoirs for zoonotic viral pathogens; however, tools to dissect bat-virus interactions are limited in availability. This study serendipitously identified, in an established bat cell line, a fully replication-competent gammaherpesvirus; determined the complete genome sequence of the virus; and generated a viral transcript map. This virus can replicate in select human and nonhuman primate cell lines. However, analyses of viral sequences support a bat origin for this virus; we therefore refer to the virus as bat gammaherpesvirus 8 (BGHV8). The viral genome contains unique open reading frames that likely encode modulators of bat innate and adaptive immune signaling pathways and expresses viral miRNAs. The virus and its gene products should provide a unique tool to dissect both bat and gammaherpesvirus

"Human Respiratory Coronaviruses Detected In Patients with Influenza-Like Illness in Arkansas, USA","Acute respiratory viruses often result in significant morbidity and mortality. The potential impact of human respiratory coronavirus (CoV) infections was underestimated until the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2003, which showed that new, highly pathogenic coronaviruses could be introduced to humans, highlighting the importance of monitoring the circulating coronaviruses. The use of sensitive molecular methods has contributed to the differential diagnosis of viruses circulating in humans. Our study aim was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of human CoV strains circulating in Arkansas, their genetic variability and their association with reported influenza-like symptoms. We analyzed 200 nasal swab samples, collected by the Arkansas Department of Health in 2010, for influenza diagnosis. All samples were from patients showing acute respiratory symptoms while testing negative for influenza. Samples were pre-screened, using a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) multiprobe for coronavirus, and subjected to confirmatory pancoronavirus and/or strain-specific reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR followed by sequence analysis. Seventy-nine samples (39.5%) were positive by qRT-PCR and 35 samples (17.5%) were confirmed by conventional RT-PCR. Twenty-three of the confirmed samples (59%) were sequenced. The most frequent strain detected was HCoV-OC43-like followed by NL63-like; only one sample was positive for HCoV-229E and one for HCoV-HKU1. Feline-like CoV strains were detected in three samples, representing possible evidence of interspecies transmission or a new human strain. Seventeen percent of the coronavirus positive samples were also positive for other respiratory viruses, such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Parainfluenza 2 and 3, and Rhinovirus. Thus, HCoV-OC43, NL63, HKU1 and new feline-like strains were circulating in Arkansas in 2010. HCoV was the sole respiratory virus detected in 16% of the patients who showed acute respiratory symptoms with negative diagnoses for influenza

Rescue of the 1947 Zika Virus Prototype Strain with a Cytomegalovirus Promoter-Driven cDNA Clone,"The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak has been linked to severe pathogenesis. Here, we report the construction of a plasmid carrying a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-expressed prototype 1947 Uganda MR766 ZIKV cDNA that can initiate infection following direct plasmid DNA transfection of mammalian cells. Incorporation of a synthetic intron in the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) region of the ZIKV polyprotein reduced viral cDNA-associated toxicity in bacteria. High levels of infectious virus were produced following transfection of the plasmid bearing the wild-type MR766 ZIKV genome, but not one with a disruption to the viral nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) polymerase active site. Multicycle growth curve and plaque assay experiments indicated that the MR766 virus resulting from plasmid transfection exhibited growth characteristics that were more similar to its parental isolate than previously published 2010 Cambodia and 2015 Brazil cDNA-rescued ZIKV. This ZIKV infectious clone will be useful for investigating the genetic determinants of ZIKV infection and pathogenesis and should be amenable to construction of diverse infectious clones expressing reporter proteins and representing a range of ZIKV isolates. IMPORTANCE The study of ZIKV, which has become increasingly important with the recent association of this virus with microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome, would benefit from an efficient strategy to genetically manipulate the virus. This work describes a model system to produce infectious virus in cell culture. We created a plasmid carrying the prototype 1947 Uganda MR766 ZIKV genome that both was stable in bacteria and could produce high levels of infectious virus in mammalian cells through direct delivery of this DNA. Furthermore, growth properties of this rescued virus closely resembled those of the viral isolate from which it was derived. This model system will provide a simple and effective means to study how ZIKV genetics impact viral replication and

Human IFIT1 Inhibits mRNA Translation of Rubulaviruses but Not Other Members of the Paramyxoviridae Family,"We have previously shown that IFIT1 is primarily responsible for the antiviral action of interferon (IFN) alpha/beta against parainfluenza virus type 5 (PIV5), selectively inhibiting the translation of PIV5 mRNAs. Here we report that while PIV2, PIV5, and mumps virus (MuV) are sensitive to IFIT1, nonrubulavirus members of the paramyxoviridae such as PIV3, Sendai virus (SeV), and canine distemper virus (CDV) are resistant. The IFIT1 sensitivity of PIV5 was not rescued by coinfection with an IFIT1-resistant virus (PIV3), demonstrating that PIV3 does not specifically inhibit the antiviral activity of IFIT1 and that the inhibition of PIV5 mRNAs is regulated by cis-acting elements. We developed an in vitro translation system using purified human IFIT1 to further investigate the mechanism of action of IFIT1. While the translations of PIV2, PIV5, and MuV mRNAs were directly inhibited by IFIT1, the translations of PIV3, SeV, and CDV mRNAs were not. Using purified human mRNA-capping enzymes, we show biochemically that efficient inhibition by IFIT1 is dependent upon a 5′ guanosine nucleoside cap (which need not be N7 methylated) and that this sensitivity is partly abrogated by 2′O methylation of the cap 1 ribose. Intriguingly, PIV5 M mRNA, in contrast to NP mRNA, remained sensitive to inhibition by IFIT1 following in vitro 2′O methylation, suggesting that other structural features of mRNAs may influence their sensitivity to IFIT1. Thus, surprisingly, the viral polymerases (which have 2′-O-methyltransferase activity) of rubulaviruses do not protect these viruses from inhibition by IFIT1. Possible biological consequences of this are discussed. IMPORTANCE Paramyxoviruses cause a wide variety of diseases, and yet most of their genes encode structural proteins and proteins involved in their replication cycle. Thus, the amount of genetic information that determines the type of disease that paramyxoviruses cause is relatively small. One factor that will influence disease outcomes is how they interact with innate host cell defenses, including the interferon (IFN) system. Here we show that different paramyxoviruses interact in distinct ways with cells in a preexisting IFN-induced antiviral state. Strikingly, all the rubulaviruses tested were sensitive to the antiviral action of ISG56/IFIT1, while all the other paramyxoviruses tested were resistant. We developed novel in vitro biochemical assays to investigate the mechanism of action of IFIT1, demonstrating that the mRNAs of rubulaviruses can be directly inhibited by IFIT1 and that this is at least partially because their mRNAs are not correctly methylated.",-0.05095794,0.058014646,-0.040988132,-0.031953257,0.050585993,0.06066742,-0.050436236,-0.058550213,-0.007478421,0.058262393,0.060864467,-0.027583772,-0.021076744,0.051456828,-0.024326889,-0.06061713,-0.060822867,-0.045456715,0.059723206,0.038513795,-0.05260438,-0.005643755,-0.049543705,0.002355757,0.04710647,0.05459781,0.013857512,0.027980447,-0.005118696,0.052065838,0.044898532,0.060864907,0.003020892,-0.05854168,-0.017612549,-0.029939603,-0.057202842,-0.041001514,-0.029739441,-0.024108592,0.002025552,-0.006374393,-0.024976103,-0.020947637,-0.027650496,0.007038589,-0.035102054,-0.037433237,0.05418157,-0.036689214,0.025694648,-0.03812363,-0.060676754,-0.04272596,-0.05856442,0.008220892,-0.030065196,-0.009770692,0.06081429,-0.046372402,-0.008714197,0.044957597,-0.003121959,-0.028494552,-0.031030225,-0.060762376,0.057173513,0.056008674,0.05483035,0.037965897,0.046496104,0.05976668,0.020733768,0.03741625,-0.05418365,0.04340656,0.05538672,0.032347713,-0.060415372,0.052707937,-0.018476205,0.060737424,0.05439636,-0.055358905,0.008990367,0.052732326,0.024599623,0.056918666,-0.05305016,0.01515457,-0.035390098,-0.014241523,-0.057494752,0.009716589,-0.013258147,0.05913212,0.049437877,0.06073649,0.060860503,-0.05105487,-0.05637714,0.03889296,-0.056497134,0.04897003,0.06011328,0.023912452,0.039856583,-0.043032758,0.013152456,0.005790289,0.006928141,-0.04265503,0.01772558,0.025891297,0.058605984,0.050058726,-0.060655463,-0.005714135,0.044313163,-0.042095833,0.033313163,0.058038075,0.058984056,-0.057317544,0.054957837,0.03817388,0.04338845,-0.015128718,0.031084787,0.013406282,-0.04455896,0.060865786,0.0598679,-0.028219841,0.026832907,-0.051778156,0.004549218,0.058318373,-0.059164986,0.028562963,0.04588393,0.060865782,-0.06023092,-0.05866781,-0.03615001,-0.05848675,0.043694947,-0.060765665,0.058529988,0.037019335,0.014551985,-0.06037178,-0.056396693,0.032329716,0.060864024,0.048577514,0.05463975,0.04360084,0.006179075,0.0043408,-0.018321594,0.056092553,0.027956357,0.043397006,-0.058077898,-0.03750519,-0.059046667,-0.03400088,-0.05965848,-0.055946838,-0.055857237,-0.060849886,-0.04679468,0.0358168,-0.057054996,-0.014612404,0.048637047,-0.044244442,0.060580637,-0.053553324,0.008964029,-0.007300355,-0.051746488,-0.0551587,0.058120307,-0.032318927,-0.03105649,0.02244543,0.060448512,0.03153122,0.05844944,0.038508873,-0.040622212,0.030075874,0.057807002,-0.05585343,-0.005231787,0.00150111,0.051405396,-0.03874574,-0.06043634,0.059012435,0.002102834,0.008910757,0.041061003,-0.05566241,-0.05142178,0.06063622,0.0531096,0.06070868,0.03776076,0.05117584,0.059472233,0.06063604,-0.060684122,-0.044753168,0.019385176,-0.016098743,-0.060494453,-0.013803389,-0.049906563,-0.05928342,0.040607546,-0.052836686,-0.02973788,0.017479505,-0.060840964,-0.05856978,-0.017613301,0.019107712,0.015653914,0.06057373,0.03351967,-0.060865775,0.04210478,-0.026570577,0.015256423,-0.05826214,-0.04277754,0.051969677,0.028736312,0.05237369,-0.010295935,-0.028055403,-0.010854604,-0.053188473,-0.05726039,0.052169453,0.03565715,-0.020066697,-0.06043352,0.036315285,-0.057233583,0.04357277,0.060673304,0.001709567,-0.031551357,0.060865786,-0.05872047,-0.017520906,0.03622306,-0.04407894,0.017643198,0.04767275,-0.019572012,-0.02753996,-0.051142313,0.019860955,0.02976402,0.051802956,0.045239534,0.06077456,-0.04388471,-0.028730951,-0.041543186,-0.053332206,0.059720222,0.058509525,0.060401715,-0.04374454,-0.040211115,-0.051798273,-0.037244182,0.049421534,-0.058847018,-0.02485067,-0.050080188,0.053545333,-0.048282582,0.059810918,0.060803875,0.048615582,0.060585964,0.000839359,0.02706961,-0.049930796,0.017318219,-0.033009946,-0.060186096,0.037295334,0.010928846,0.06030426,0.022701977,0.024826523,-0.020708552,0.04529273,-0.02173714,-0.053417083,0.059311464,-0.060336445,0.05974608,0.016650848,0.046979126,-0.051146153,0.058413867,0.036703784,0.02359841,-0.05161686,0.06077361,-0.019216143,-0.060130164,0.056209862,0.053267743,-0.04333294,0.0066107,0.060664788,-0.0558644,-0.060574837,-0.05036064,-0.04433215,0.03638583,0.047289155,0.047676153,0.060856596,0.014240047,-0.004351004,0.026366837,0.007615908,0.044054005,-0.047582883,0.02657972,-0.002741231,0.045075845,0.051893223,-0.060860574,-0.060864277,-0.006101894,0.056282245,-0.033000376,-0.057772204,0.03704223,-0.028430967,-0.051101476,-0.017077092,0.03803386,-0.031228792,-0.060865555,-0.007572434,-0.056078624,-0.05525724,0.016277758,-0.059429005,-0.057837363,0.0561314,0.029113082,-0.04886207,0.06085578,0.032466516,0.056771923,0.042094745,-0.04889755,0.0413727,-0.049627088,-0.06083727,0.060041953,0.05536037,0.055551074,0.004127029,0.030351078,-0.020895068,-0.060560048,0.047159564,-0.018030815,0.004645104,0.05039208,-0.0599576,-0.024522584,-0.060129326,0.053260483,0.025412746,0.057538804,0.052113943,0.056964077,-0.05934369,0.054365247,-0.006534086,0.02763404,-0.040966343,0.023214981,-0.004079169,0.012475772,0.045159288,-0.010230715,-0.04857075,0.02772701,-0.055404954,-0.05415666,0.035168786,-0.012707313,0.0388097,0.021

"Epidemiology, Co-Infections, and Outcomes of Viral Pneumonia in Adults: An Observational Cohort Study","Advanced technologies using polymerase-chain reaction have allowed for increased recognition of viral respiratory infections including pneumonia. Co-infections have been described for several respiratory viruses, especially with influenza. Outcomes of viral pneumonia, including cases with co-infections, have not been well described. This was observational cohort study conducted to describe hospitalized patients with viral pneumonia including co-infections, clinical outcomes, and predictors of mortality. Patients admitted from March 2013 to November 2014 with a positive respiratory virus panel (RVP) and radiographic findings of pneumonia within 48 h of the index RVP were included. Co-respiratory infection (CRI) was defined as any organism identification from a respiratory specimen within 3 days of the index RVP. Predictors of in-hospital mortality on univariate analysis were evaluated in a multivariate model. Of 284 patients with viral pneumonia, a majority (51.8%) were immunocompromised. A total of 84 patients (29.6%) were found to have a CRI with 48 (57.6%) having a bacterial CRI. Viral CRI with HSV, CMV, or both occurred in 28 patients (33.3%). Fungal (16.7%) and other CRIs (7.1%) were less common. Many patients required mechanical ventilation (54%) and vasopressor support (36%). Overall in-hospital mortality was high (23.2%) and readmissions were common with several patients re-hospitalized within 30 (21.1%) and 90 days (36.7%) of discharge. Predictors of in-hospital mortality on multivariate regression included severity of illness factors, stem-cell transplant, and identification of multiple respiratory viruses. In conclusion, hospital mortality is high among adult patients with viral pneumonia and patients with multiple respiratory viruses identified may be at a higher

Assay optimization for molecular detection of Zika virus,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the diagnostic performance of real-time reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for Zika virus detection. METHODS: We compared seven published real-time RT–PCR assays and two new assays that we have developed. To determine the analytical sensitivity of each assay, we constructed a synthetic universal control ribonucleic acid (uncRNA) containing all of the assays’ target regions on one RNA strand and spiked human blood or urine with known quantities of African or Asian Zika virus strains. Viral loads in 33 samples from Zika virus-infected patients were determined by using one of the new assays. FINDINGS: Oligonucleotides of the published real-time RT–PCR assays, showed up to 10 potential mismatches with the Asian lineage causing the current outbreak, compared with 0 to 4 mismatches for the new assays. The 95% lower detection limit of the seven most sensitive assays ranged from 2.1 to 12.1 uncRNA copies/reaction. Two assays had lower sensitivities of 17.0 and 1373.3 uncRNA copies/reaction and showed a similar sensitivity when using spiked samples. The mean viral loads in samples from Zika virus-infected patients were 5 × 10(4) RNA copies/mL of blood and 2 × 10(4) RNA copies/mL of urine. CONCLUSION: We provide reagents and updated protocols for Zika virus detection suitable for the current outbreak strains. Some published assays might be unsuitable for Zika virus detection, due to the limited sensitivity and potential incompatibility with some strains. Viral concentrations in the clinical samples were close to the technical detection limit, suggesting that the use of insensitive assays will cause false-negative

Viral factors in influenza pandemic risk assessment,"The threat of an influenza A virus pandemic stems from continual virus spillovers from reservoir species, a tiny fraction of which spark sustained transmission in humans. To date, no pandemic emergence of a new influenza strain has been preceded by detection of a closely related precursor in an animal or human. Nonetheless, influenza surveillance efforts are expanding, prompting a need for tools to assess the pandemic risk posed by a detected virus. The goal would be to use genetic sequence and/or biological assays of viral traits to identify those non-human influenza viruses with the greatest risk of evolving into pandemic threats, and/or to understand drivers of such evolution, to prioritize pandemic prevention or response measures. We describe such efforts, identify progress and ongoing challenges, and discuss three specific traits of influenza viruses (hemagglutinin receptor binding specificity, hemagglutinin pH of activation, and polymerase complex efficiency) that contribute to pandemic risk.

Coronavirus Susceptibility to the Antiviral Remdesivir (GS-5734) Is Mediated by the Viral Polymerase and the Proofreading Exoribonuclease,"Emerging coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe disease in humans, but no approved therapeutics are available. The CoV nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity. We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs in vitro and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model. However, studies with GS-5734 have not reported resistance associated with GS-5734, nor do we understand the action of GS-5734 in wild-type (WT) proofreading CoVs. Here, we show that GS-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with similar 50% effective concentration values (EC(50)) as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Passage of WT MHV in the presence of the GS-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all CoVs that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734, as determined by EC(50). The resistant viruses were unable to compete with WT in direct coinfection passage in the absence of GS-5734. Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same in vitro resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model. Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging

Risk factors and patterns of household clusters of respiratory viruses in rural Nepal,"Viral pneumonia is an important cause of death and morbidity among infants worldwide. Transmission of non-influenza respiratory viruses in households can inform preventative interventions and has not been well-characterised in South Asia. From April 2011 to April 2012, household members of pregnant women enrolled in a randomised trial of influenza vaccine in rural Nepal were surveyed weekly for respiratory illness until 180 days after birth. Nasal swabs were tested by polymerase chain reaction for respiratory viruses in symptomatic individuals. A transmission event was defined as a secondary case of the same virus within 14 days of initial infection within a household. From 555 households, 825 initial viral illness episodes occurred, resulting in 79 transmission events. The overall incidence of transmission was 1.14 events per 100 person-weeks. Risk of transmission incidence was associated with an index case age 1–4 years (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 2.35; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40–3.96), coinfection as initial infection (IRR 1.94; 95% CI 1.05–3.61) and no electricity in household (IRR 2.70; 95% CI 1.41–5.00). Preventive interventions targeting preschool-age children in households in resource-limited settings may decrease the risk of transmission to vulnerable household members, such as young infants.",-0.048840486,0.054872524,-0.058910817,-0.051246233,-0.03894765,0.04607612,0.058452617,-0.0462181,0.053757045,0.028207466,0.060277816,-0.023015978,-0.003989502,-0.056034327,0.05977936,-0.037782174,-0.060278725,-0.044036545,-0.057318278,-0.001997855,-0.055303883,-0.006563828,0.005002395,0.006535927,0.005234473,-0.021364663,-0.054687746,-0.030130664,-0.037481427,-0.04414361,0.035459585,0.060278505,-0.055353034,-0.025592297,0.039439205,-0.013742943,-0.059681658,-0.05969666,-0.05645112,0.041112687,0.053930275,0.05932742,0.05261802,-0.02053902,-0.03824851,0.036920473,0.05059081,-0.049833138,0.025645625,-0.03847708,-0.058869544,-0.004497719,-0.060064953,-0.012710196,-0.04213062,-0.022984343,-0.058765523,-0.025408465,0.06004665,0.028173685,-0.048794147,0.05446045,-0.03192253,-0.010710619,0.055775948,-0.05950838,0.057427164,0.008744406,0.057742614,0.023609288,-0.05338305,-0.054045934,-0.03336573,0.056567587,0.037615936,0.0529197,-0.05864632,-0.000817739,-0.0598983,-0.0542327,0.05930985,0.05053148,0.047322057,-0.011551889,-0.033981085,0.059246156,0.041485943,0.026227573,0.013277762,-0.055167872,-0.051016826,0.046940662,-0.027355999,0.04483196,0.008122441,0.03482284,0.04310882,0.05863502,0.057498794,-0.05369964,-0.05716318,0.004599272,-0.037323367,0.037098996,0.037082035,-0.004589554,0.051578827,-0.05579949,-0.030585518,-0.03780183,-0.0548959,0.022737125,0.05094487,0.024330111,0.0601299,0.04224212,-0.001185481,-0.04385251,-0.02402621,-0.027421841,-0.017346412,0.041742817,-0.0393268,-0.04991334,-0.007842272,0.032098424,0.034968834,-0.030562509,0.037392583,0.005365092,-0.05577244,0.060276676,0.056597732,-0.05174821,-0.033979222,-0.060196646,0.052278936,0.04887423,-0.038087934,-0.035911158,0.009636617,0.060271636,-0.059772525,-0.055377014,0.056646127,0.02711767,0.047240194,-0.05761668,0.0589124,-0.007708338,0.052198615,0.02812446,-0.051858272,-0.047218036,-0.029361652,-0.034356184,0.05949974,0.059483312,0.035995353,0.045933016,-0.032573402,-0.02682949,-0.05474706,-0.019296201,0.001205947,-0.058590487,-0.019329334,0.051640555,-0.04641166,-0.042063173,0.057204016,-0.060264837,-0.05063908,-0.040780727,0.00613224,-0.010783783,0.04848608,-0.056399073,0.039031416,-0.037118535,-0.036684114,0.041313473,-0.015816823,0.059202127,0.05973957,-0.02910117,-0.0570192,-0.032352865,0.005279819,0.006651891,-0.017981952,-0.047472235,-0.023423363,0.054533135,0.025905564,-0.01765339,-0.051413603,0.052288804,0.053099766,-0.04084187,0.021419432,0.058940552,-0.053637974,-0.04702598,0.040892664,0.048347794,0.03728936,-0.016080393,0.02603337,0.060128253,0.014387723,-0.0569399,0.001002435,0.057197448,-0.056165166,0.053596847,0.01673267,0.055262633,0.05327628,-0.050973006,0.0391783,0.013845074,0.007408051,0.038646646,0.04848191,-0.013382027,-0.045063376,-0.059622474,0.044372384,0.057041865,0.035394464,0.05740206,0.059206635,-0.060271703,0.049466856,0.041158166,0.052384663,-0.04259752,-0.042822827,-0.018580386,-0.002327405,0.029176647,-0.03636677,0.03482521,0.05989817,-0.057076335,-0.05047933,0.055123877,0.047991015,-0.06008743,0.05552766,-0.057691038,-0.045684967,-0.03484102,0.05650113,0.05233098,-0.052830897,0.06027872,-0.050928403,-0.04927429,-0.036560915,0.043244272,-0.053047583,0.03880464,-0.057533715,-0.049432322,0.017976217,-0.057630055,0.053200416,0.058217995,-0.008620003,0.05120863,-0.01927586,0.019994773,-0.037324555,-0.026772456,0.05864989,0.043070685,0.059269197,0.024431637,-0.015888123,-0.042885855,-0.047837496,0.057008952,-0.007330846,-0.026038555,-0.03816226,-0.05549861,-0.023901787,0.025679873,0.05882669,-0.055652097,0.05813699,-0.020612054,-0.054462187,-0.045263365,-0.027353276,-0.05991701,-0.056720532,0.02762157,-0.035392944,0.016853074,0.033055484,0.000942713,-0.05753433,0.021027766,0.03384626,-0.05608251,0.045703366,-0.051941257,0.04382734,-0.022006277,-0.055508815,-0.001679755,0.059655625,-0.059437633,0.053719662,0.059734207,0.053962123,-0.012102113,0.007074493,0.05878038,0.052493118,-0.040251657,-0.059962403,0.060276687,-0.051791333,-0.023073183,-0.060267054,-0.053350795,-0.002587194,0.029514806,-0.023880007,0.056222986,0.038751025,0.033589233,0.035228558,0.059837524,-0.04749919,0.026608035,0.05746601,-0.058764573,0.0585775,0.056803897,-0.045824766,-0.059072163,0.058851067,0.04997057,-0.05912152,-0.05974892,0.045510713,-0.053339962,0.011068172,0.022376275,0.008741723,0.007715935,-0.060274582,-0.041229866,-0.03282217,0.01488694,0.02839596,-0.059505742,-0.05717738,0.05725272,-0.037347168,0.023731,0.059571758,0.05683195,-0.030621728,-0.004996947,-0.04442831,0.043487728,-0.041924898,-0.032983035,0.058051825,0.038457595,0.035597637,-0.042391483,0.05061334,-0.04668877,-0.024947757,0.0338391,-0.031687863,0.038536817,0.036936864,6.53E-05,-0.012693743,-0.05653264,-0.04903374,0.03774158,0.030404732,0.056985985,-0.043963857,0.054940455,-0.05771335,0.06009383,-0.03868989,-0.043997604,0.045552514,-0.059036274,-0.026988104,0.05682006,0.007234783,0.05989223,0.004927462,-0.040887527,-0.038430538,0.05637138,0.053388976,-0.05125738,0.0

Post-pandemic influenza A/H1N1pdm09 is associated with more severe outcomes than A/H3N2 and other respiratory viruses in adult hospitalisations,"This study compares the frequency and severity of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 (A/H1), influenza A/H3N2 (A/H3) and other respiratory virus infections in hospitalised patients. Data from 17 332 adult hospitalised patients admitted to Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Western Australia, with a respiratory illness between 2012 and 2015 were linked with data containing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results for respiratory viruses including A/H1, A/H3, influenza B, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza. Of these, 1753 (10.1%) had test results. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted to compare the viruses for clinical outcomes including ICU admission, ventilation, pneumonia, length of stay and death. Patients with A/H1 were more likely to experience severe outcomes such as ICU admission (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2–5.5, P = 0.016), pneumonia (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.6–5.7, P < 0.001) and lower risk of discharge from hospital (indicating longer lengths of hospitalisation; HR 0.64 95% CI 0.47–0.88, P = 0.005), than patients with A/H3. Patients with a non-influenza respiratory virus were less likely to experience severe clinical outcomes than patients with A/H1, however, had similar likelihood when compared to patients with A/H3.

Genomic Characterization of a Newly Discovered Coronavirus Associated with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Humans,"A novel human coronavirus (HCoV-EMC/2012) was isolated from a man with acute pneumonia and renal failure in June 2012. This report describes the complete genome sequence, genome organization, and expression strategy of HCoV-EMC/2012 and its relation with known coronaviruses. The genome contains 30,119 nucleotides and contains at least 10 predicted open reading frames, 9 of which are predicted to be expressed from a nested set of seven subgenomic mRNAs. Phylogenetic analysis of the replicase gene of coronaviruses with completely sequenced genomes showed that HCoV-EMC/2012 is most closely related to Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 (BtCoV-HKU4) and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5 (BtCoV-HKU5), which prototype two species in lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus. In accordance with the guidelines of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, and in view of the 75% and 77% amino acid sequence identity in 7 conserved replicase domains with BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5, respectively, we propose that HCoV-EMC/2012 prototypes a novel species in the genus Betacoronavirus. HCoV-EMC/2012 may be most closely related to a coronavirus detected in Pipistrellus pipistrellus in The Netherlands, but because only a short sequence from the most conserved part of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-encoding region of the genome was reported for this bat virus, its genetic distance from HCoV-EMC remains uncertain. HCoV-EMC/2012 is the sixth coronavirus known to infect humans and the first human virus within betacoronavirus lineage

Relationship between the GOLD combined COPD assessment staging system and bacterial isolation,"BACKGROUND: Acute exacerbations, which are a significant cause of mortality and morbidity, adversely affect chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) prognosis by accelerating loss of lung function. It is important to know the microorganisms that commonly cause exacerbations in the patient groups classified according to clinical and functional characteristics for fast and accurate treatment of acute exacerbations. OBJECTIVES: The last Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) publication recommended a new staging system containing obstruction degree, frequency of exacerbations, and quality of life questionnaires. This study is designed to analyze the relationship between the bacteria isolated in acute exacerbations and new GOLD stages. METHODS: Potentially pathogenic bacteria (PPB) isolation with culture and polymerase chain reaction methods were obtained from 114 acute exacerbation COPD patients, classified into A, B, C, and D groups by analyzing the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) value, COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score, and exacerbation frequency according to the new GOLD staging system. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between exacerbation frequency and PPB isolation (P=0.002). There was no relationship between GOLD stage, FEV(1), and CAT score with PPB isolation. The isolated bacteria diversity and mixed infection frequency were higher in the GOLD stage D group. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated only from D group patients. CONCLUSION: Bacterial infection may cause an acute exacerbation equally in each stage for COPD. The difference in bacterial etiology is more related to exacerbation frequency than FEV(1) and CAT scores for an acute exacerbation. Determining exacerbation frequency is significant for treatment success in empirical antibiotic

Identification of highly conserved regions in L-segment of Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and immunoinformatic prediction about potential novel vaccine,"Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne zoonotic viral disease with a disease fatality rate between 15% and 70%. Despite the wide range of distribution, the virus (CCHFV) is basically endemic in Africa, Asia, eastern Europe, and the Middle East. Acute febrile illness associated with petechiae, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiple-organ failure are the main symptoms of the disease. With all these fatal effects, CCHFV is considered a huge threat as no successful therapeutic approach is currently available for the treatment of this disease. In the present study, we have used the immunoinformatics approach to design a potential epitope-based vaccine against the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-L of CCHFV. Both the T-cell and B-cell epitopes were assessed, and the epitope “DCSSTPPDR” was found to be the most potential one, with 100% conservancy among all the strains of CCHFV. The epitope was also found to interact with both type I and II major histocompatibility complex molecules and is considered nonallergenic as well. In vivo study of our proposed peptide is advised for novel universal vaccine production, which might be an effective path to prevent CCHF

Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein cannot differentiate bacterial or viral infection in COPD exacerbation requiring emergency department visits,"BACKGROUND: Viral and bacterial infections are the most common causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. Whether serum inflammatory markers can differentiate bacterial from virus infection in patients with COPD exacerbation requiring emergency department (ED) visits remains controversial. METHODS: Viral culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to identify the viruses in the oropharynx of patients with COPD exacerbations. The bacteria were identified by the semiquantitative culture of the expectorated sputum. The peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC) counts, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and clinical symptoms were compared among patients with different types of infections. RESULTS: Viruses were isolated from 16 (22.2%) of the 72 patients enrolled. The most commonly identified viruses were parainfluenza type 3, influenza A, and rhinovirus. A total of 30 (41.7%) patients had positive bacterial cultures, with the most commonly found bacteria being Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Five patients (6.9%) had both positive sputum cultures and virus identification. The WBC, CRP, and PCT levels of the bacteria-positive and bacteria-negative groups were not statistically different. Multivariate analysis showed that patients with increased sputum volumes during the COPD exacerbations had higher risks of recurrent exacerbations in the 1-year period following the first exacerbation. CONCLUSION: WBC, CRP, or PCT could not differentiate between bacterial and viral infections in patients with COPD exacerbation requiring ED visits. Those with increased sputum during a COPD exacerbation had higher risks for recurrent exacerbations.",-0.056501266,0.050696988,-0.014271738,-0.045152146,0.022436121,0.028763426,0.04797576,-0.0488448,-0.05369615,0.029112194,0.058064036,0.03410846,-0.0522946,0.00309618,0.05724041,-0.049578305,-0.058064036,-0.046605628,-0.051400244,0.050082453,-0.044631094,0.027881049,-0.044728227,0.05131357,-0.01987482,0.052322693,-0.0507357,-0.03865225,-0.008932997,-0.05481378,0.054167513,0.058064036,0.028280666,-0.027339067,0.002381587,-0.015540625,-0.056372844,-0.052979182,-0.051587395,-0.011321913,0.030038267,-0.009810095,0.05036896,-0.03302141,0.030255884,0.05759649,-0.04384501,-0.03920072,-0.006221442,0.029832942,-0.05641689,-0.002591585,-0.058048554,-0.04534074,-0.057509746,0.056138765,-0.057558622,-0.04325833,0.057175536,0.0578676,-0.019215899,0.05720075,0.04453576,-0.01774563,-0.056011412,-0.057338655,0.0536981,-0.052008387,0.04297864,-0.053804517,-0.016835336,0.04174288,0.047868222,0.057949957,-0.034759402,-0.004743238,-0.011007847,-0.027780779,-0.058063846,-0.004273293,-0.014743299,0.057983074,0.053599436,0.055604074,-0.05548235,0.057849023,0.01717201,-0.026530687,-0.042936023,-0.057996392,-0.035654556,0.018821638,-0.05464354,-0.031230366,-0.039873015,0.044555437,0.039108742,0.057505313,0.05789957,-0.022260437,0.039296295,-0.00331896,-5.89E-05,0.05147136,0.05220799,0.013241153,0.056243062,0.04871408,-0.009971574,0.01202469,-0.05069253,0.01583823,0.043687742,0.05645871,0.057573512,0.028765094,-0.01888527,0.010701126,0.040865958,0.038518365,-0.024783444,0.050941214,-0.008955938,-0.053864688,0.05307629,0.050167233,-0.01707725,0.049976345,-0.045950554,-0.028269613,-0.037667945,0.058064036,0.05488926,0.027220285,0.038315203,-0.056143552,0.035684977,-0.038978584,-0.0457123,-0.003172353,-0.051377527,0.0580638,-0.05791996,-0.004699507,-0.034776323,0.004561906,0.000205839,-0.05802019,0.05715037,-0.05152399,0.04672243,-0.055121873,-0.056511536,-0.049459122,0.0579654,0.008796192,0.050882027,-0.005235292,0.051776275,-0.047070965,0.009477123,-0.046660203,0.029164322,0.057309747,0.013069348,-0.057633676,-0.0413496,-0.023658765,-0.048998173,-0.05648236,-0.002826678,-0.05806358,-0.05774067,-0.02579952,-0.022904249,0.032603107,0.008286664,-0.04124805,0.053016894,0.018195244,-0.048279006,0.04613624,-0.036260538,0.057517685,0.057891514,0.033294518,-0.056206677,-0.037587628,0.054034557,0.03142794,0.0562176,-0.04715619,-0.035715606,0.04099734,0.05750881,-0.056584537,-0.038046766,0.04252127,-0.020162242,0.03593317,-0.054975882,0.056418963,0.002555887,-0.043728795,-0.049101632,-0.014032794,0.044698775,-0.038898762,0.05009873,0.057984333,0.040119838,-0.008120283,-0.007086203,0.052647434,-0.05250984,0.049896292,0.038976036,0.046017192,-0.0397962,0.039623484,0.01521461,-0.004815109,0.05769695,-0.054602884,0.040609177,-0.05349292,-0.057013575,-0.058055148,0.052166376,0.055605493,0.05631919,0.057324365,0.056750596,-0.058061704,0.046122428,0.056503285,0.03387371,-0.053970076,-0.004200347,-0.015262953,-0.008418737,0.051828086,-0.011054696,-0.055625185,0.053557094,-0.046748035,-0.053564016,0.046878923,0.055945497,-0.057597,0.049636267,0.016703647,-0.043493677,-0.045903,0.05804037,0.043799356,-0.04126309,0.05806402,0.04837204,0.03078829,0.052342907,0.046879724,0.013599095,0.03499057,-0.038154125,-0.000401664,-0.023786169,0.023899125,0.007802197,0.05467972,-0.023299059,0.05789815,-0.05588101,-0.058054455,0.019006902,-0.056133173,-0.027419783,0.019682886,0.058046162,-0.05559355,-0.022921752,-0.015757143,-0.05222459,-0.02492969,0.005624316,-0.024337003,-0.05156787,0.0542145,-0.0531249,0.05680055,0.05603911,0.018181762,0.056315392,-0.057004515,-0.055187292,-0.050286092,-0.027210461,0.033669993,-0.05679857,0.05432671,-0.022471271,0.04856395,0.025737328,-0.002878608,-0.0574042,-0.024312884,-0.011369215,-0.054415256,0.054225244,-0.039926134,-0.045886006,-0.038253002,-0.05163268,-0.048472136,0.05800556,-0.05708921,0.052330665,0.013041761,0.058056008,0.05718877,-0.049197085,0.027224958,0.054157596,-0.031725973,-0.04934076,0.05803651,-0.030945556,-0.027371095,-0.058041576,-0.046007,0.031471398,0.040169626,-0.051991455,0.05640907,0.053753953,0.050520092,-0.056854315,0.028796673,-0.008241397,-0.037761815,0.013239028,-0.04285403,0.058062598,0.056324508,-0.058018126,-0.05806402,0.04978144,0.055529565,-0.049949434,-0.05780476,0.02505589,0.034090478,0.043622956,0.05643205,0.057817627,0.013175498,-0.05806323,0.011247846,-0.022220246,-0.05166792,0.045785055,-0.04998358,-0.057879053,0.020835305,-0.02541113,0.039103054,0.058048464,0.034214493,0.056669205,-0.056494713,-0.018704114,0.04285787,-0.054201923,-0.045518033,0.058011513,0.05758407,0.05759635,-0.003864712,-0.05135492,-0.036031827,-0.01921889,-0.03652056,0.00074069,0.00387429,-0.03718125,0.01481505,-0.04380944,-0.058054566,0.010412265,0.040317297,0.028637825,0.041564733,0.026187446,0.05336411,0.038282037,0.020387927,-0.028500162,-0.058037978,0.05735069,-0.05757154,0.018605491,0.032356102,0.05668474,0.05733501,0.04787654,-0.033328112,-0.045085523,-0.047725998,0.056823745,0.0105429,0.05246572,0.0

"Detection of Viral and Bacterial Pathogens in Hospitalized Children With Acute Respiratory Illnesses, Chongqing, 2009–2013","Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) cause large disease burden each year. The codetection of viral and bacterial pathogens is quite common; however, the significance for clinical severity remains controversial. We aimed to identify viruses and bacteria in hospitalized children with ARI and the impact of mixed detections. Hospitalized children with ARI aged ≤16 were recruited from 2009 to 2013 at the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected for detection of common respiratory viruses by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or PCR. Bacteria were isolated from NPAs by routine culture methods. Detection and codetection frequencies and clinical features and severity were compared. Of the 3181 hospitalized children, 2375 (74.7%) were detected with ≥1 virus and 707 (22.2%) with ≥1 bacteria, 901 (28.3%) with ≥2 viruses, 57 (1.8%) with ≥2 bacteria, and 542 (17.0%) with both virus and bacteria. The most frequently detected were Streptococcus pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and influenza virus. Clinical characteristics were similar among different pathogen infections for older group (≥6 years old), with some significant difference for the younger. Cases with any codetection were more likely to present with fever; those with ≥2 virus detections had higher prevalence of cough; cases with virus and bacteria codetection were more likely to have cough and sputum. No significant difference in the risk of pneumonia, severe pneumonia, and intensive care unit admission were found for any codetection than monodetection. There was a high codetection rate of common respiratory pathogens among hospitalized pediatric ARI cases, with fever as a significant predictor. Cases with codetection showed no significant difference in severity than those with single

Viral Polymerase-Helicase Complexes Regulate Replication Fidelity To Overcome Intracellular Nucleotide Depletion,"To date, the majority of work on RNA virus replication fidelity has focused on the viral RNA polymerase, while the potential role of other viral replicase proteins in this process is poorly understood. Previous studies used resistance to broad-spectrum RNA mutagens, such as ribavirin, to identify polymerases with increased fidelity that avoid misincorporation of such base analogues. We identified a novel variant in the alphavirus viral helicase/protease, nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) that operates in concert with the viral polymerase nsP4 to further alter replication complex fidelity, a functional linkage that was conserved among the alphavirus genus. Purified chikungunya virus nsP2 presented delayed helicase activity of the high-fidelity enzyme, and yet purified replication complexes manifested stronger RNA polymerization kinetics. Because mutagenic nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin also affect intracellular nucleotide pools, we addressed the link between nucleotide depletion and replication fidelity by using purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors. High-fidelity viruses were more resistant to these conditions, and viral growth could be rescued by the addition of exogenous nucleosides, suggesting that mutagenesis by base analogues requires nucleotide pool depletion. This study describes a novel function for nsP2, highlighting the role of other components of the replication complex in regulating viral replication fidelity, and suggests that viruses can alter their replication complex fidelity to overcome intracellular nucleotide-depleting conditions. IMPORTANCE Previous studies using the RNA mutagen ribavirin to select for drug-resistant variants have highlighted the essential role of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in regulating replication fidelity. However, the role of other viral replicase components in replication fidelity has not been studied in detail. We identified here an RNA mutagen-resistant variant of the nsP2 helicase/protease that conferred increased fidelity and yet could not operate in the same manner as high-fidelity polymerases. We show that the alphavirus helicase is a key component of the fidelity-regulating machinery. Our data show that the RNA mutagenic activity of compounds such as ribavirin is coupled to and potentiated by nucleotide depletion and that RNA viruses can fine-tune their replication fidelity when faced with an intracellular environment depleted of

Identification of potential drug targets by subtractive genome analysis of Escherichia coli O157:H7: an in silico approach,"Bacterial enteric infections resulting in diarrhea, dysentery, or enteric fever constitute a huge public health problem, with more than a billion episodes of disease annually in developing and developed countries. In this study, the deadly agent of hemorrhagic diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome, Escherichia coli O157:H7 was investigated with extensive computational approaches aimed at identifying novel and broad-spectrum antibiotic targets. A systematic in silico workflow consisting of comparative genomics, metabolic pathways analysis, and additional drug prioritizing parameters was used to identify novel drug targets that were essential for the pathogen’s survival but absent in its human host. Comparative genomic analysis of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotated metabolic pathways identified 350 putative target proteins in E. coli O157:H7 which showed no similarity to human proteins. Further bio-informatic approaches including prediction of subcellular localization, calculation of molecular weight, and web-based investigation of 3D structural characteristics greatly aided in filtering the potential drug targets from 350 to 120. Ultimately, 44 non-homologous essential proteins of E. coli O157:H7 were prioritized and proved to have the eligibility to become novel broad-spectrum antibiotic targets and DNA polymerase III alpha (dnaE) was the top-ranked among these targets. Moreover, druggability of each of the identified drug targets was evaluated by the DrugBank database. In addition, 3D structure of the dnaE was modeled and explored further for in silico docking with ligands having potential druggability. Finally, we confirmed that the compounds N-coeleneterazine and N-(1,4-dihydro-5H-tetrazol-5-ylidene)-9-oxo-9H-xanthene-2-sulfon-amide were the most suitable ligands of dnaE and hence proposed as the potential inhibitors of this target protein. The results of this study could facilitate the discovery and release of new and effective drugs against E. coli O157:H7 and other deadly human bacterial pathogens.",-0.010751762,0.027319666,-0.033568915,-0.055828575,0.031304087,0.052366175,0.030470224,-0.037578736,-0.012548147,-0.05605805,0.061453417,-0.022596944,0.03111536,-0.05770964,-0.022969311,-0.05980781,-0.061447486,0.04410774,-0.029691355,0.00730381,-0.04760654,-0.046375643,-0.060807507,0.055154007,0.061151832,0.04941546,0.055626053,-0.036949217,-0.044204928,-0.03326243,-0.00942808,0.06145258,0.05786145,-0.005573768,-0.024067452,0.003264432,-0.061401494,-0.039922908,-0.046888277,-0.05714406,0.050399378,0.038257714,-0.040153995,0.00916624,-0.047406964,0.044465315,-0.049705006,-0.036610246,0.058494892,-0.0450565,-0.056892455,0.005028904,-0.061251123,0.011182872,-0.061315916,0.049425356,-0.060367186,0.059678633,0.055471867,-0.04600786,0.055809364,0.016851,-0.015642814,-0.06068994,-0.047189195,-0.060685698,0.05939496,-0.018509498,-0.037958294,-0.056209024,-0.018017778,0.04733032,0.04604623,0.054796427,0.0031907,-0.015604804,0.058151715,-0.05461932,-0.061373323,0.056917787,-0.060511805,0.05881382,0.061175793,-0.048837647,0.001021303,0.059922677,0.044407137,-0.040064365,-0.058160536,-0.00300202,9.18E-05,-0.004014165,-0.028305212,0.058997244,-0.007544598,0.06139168,0.05987336,0.061408583,0.061446853,0.001510295,-0.057563066,0.0556802,0.027608307,0.057388734,0.057869863,0.039156668,0.032599494,0.021533078,-0.041902706,0.018452637,-0.049349662,0.006130409,0.029072382,0.051351767,0.049471177,0.03522222,-0.060946785,0.026396768,-0.010255827,0.051638275,0.008936105,0.04631012,0.03454133,0.0447366,0.05341325,-0.029845,0.018938022,0.05517874,-0.013874978,0.03619657,-0.012178232,0.061453525,0.056248862,-0.023856485,0.051111635,0.007219363,0.03781901,-0.011757913,-0.03269843,-0.05770667,0.042004455,0.061453238,-0.058761835,0.02827996,-0.009751208,-0.061200865,0.03681856,-0.036914315,0.06016638,0.059310067,-0.061115168,-0.0588475,-0.05922472,-0.04869845,0.061453026,0.051171865,0.061209,-0.007787861,0.058785666,0.055209327,0.059837297,0.055166293,0.032562375,0.058690827,-0.036542065,0.0037497,0.010187113,-0.021617657,-0.06120497,-0.06052948,0.04561252,-0.05797742,0.001264807,-0.04022792,0.029521877,-0.010967676,0.0421935,0.04302586,0.05895299,0.056876767,0.049185462,-0.017024972,-0.052301876,-0.010765595,0.058241043,0.006552923,-0.05630033,-0.047239736,0.05398439,-0.040952947,0.06140362,-0.040832885,0.018537223,0.0459735,0.060232855,-0.05692434,0.023137577,0.019623913,0.025007045,-0.055346977,-0.05477595,0.026200997,0.027890434,0.052471876,0.0473008,-0.055124946,0.027282245,0.053237204,0.042884503,0.060500428,0.001328662,0.024451025,0.027776005,0.0612069,-0.042962477,0.047783878,0.034914047,0.052073006,0.04172581,-0.05908684,-0.01486114,-0.043369815,-0.028368533,-0.04363442,0.006170372,-0.045314115,-0.061256398,-0.053475093,-0.030494578,0.05570588,0.05389055,0.058638748,0.058627855,-0.06144806,0.023331447,0.013322599,0.023810346,-0.061066635,0.009433137,0.049800515,0.05355581,0.060496412,-0.010864803,-0.054369204,0.057224087,0.02513276,-0.014241274,-0.004673411,0.059436463,-0.06084681,-0.027606875,0.021493685,0.01599345,0.051267907,0.060744155,0.016465481,-0.056923926,0.061453495,0.001779064,0.016478084,0.042170543,0.0569111,-0.010229823,0.05294146,0.053135734,-0.025964996,0.023357587,0.009585634,0.014315006,0.023784235,0.051007025,0.060825236,-0.024796402,-0.045388732,-0.021034934,-0.05540893,0.027999638,-0.03326755,0.059662852,-0.05066371,-0.06089656,0.030588556,-0.058214433,0.045672756,-0.027595608,-0.025534932,-0.005898268,0.034363944,-0.050953534,0.027742425,0.061222278,0.050722275,0.06118085,-0.05678963,0.05845869,-0.061271574,-0.00469769,0.05745036,-0.06009862,0.0502583,-0.013645297,0.061040558,0.052618667,0.033227324,-0.061248858,-0.02753122,0.006836285,-0.06053606,0.055426218,-0.06017059,-0.019299366,0.02706036,0.049168274,-0.058193292,0.061262988,-0.020534571,0.059161816,-0.016322661,0.056782093,0.05555443,-0.027846124,0.043926537,0.046272557,-0.025368033,-0.007607748,0.05023025,0.053983904,-0.057377025,-0.054807026,-0.056228224,0.012958363,-0.004573389,0.008025834,0.05506473,0.033614103,0.01659218,0.05686711,-0.00066661,0.03369885,-0.013594943,-0.009662606,-0.001081254,0.06138441,-0.03225387,-0.061432287,-0.061453298,0.034218792,0.050119586,-0.025046144,-0.059610374,-0.050889805,-0.04325479,-0.05863003,0.001162764,0.038172677,0.015293193,-0.061453316,-0.04572224,-0.00373049,-0.06073259,0.027371606,-0.047195897,-0.058275785,0.049030162,-0.011758094,-0.060505778,0.06135322,-0.025120381,0.05669837,0.000895021,0.024785094,-0.047282174,-0.055768438,-0.061347906,0.051942438,-0.022194503,0.03226282,0.04728728,-0.051782392,-0.036703233,-0.04173321,-0.011471023,0.060638517,0.040671982,-0.013461812,-0.050351936,-0.03602405,-0.059408475,0.030355485,0.023394134,-0.014554291,-0.035324056,0.05956829,-0.03693034,0.04594443,0.025869846,-0.015739072,-0.0606123,0.04966522,-0.05962628,-0.056782708,0.054260805,0.004763781,0.040527716,0.010745578,-0.021573398,0.007165517,0.00420587,0.04270262,0.042158376,0.050832264,0.02646769

"Pilot study of participant-collected nasal swabs for acute respiratory infections in a low-income, urban population","OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and validity of unsupervised participant-collected nasal swabs to detect respiratory pathogens in a low-income, urban minority population. METHODS: This project was conducted as part of an ongoing community-based surveillance study in New York City to identify viral etiologies of acute respiratory infection. In January 2014, following sample collection by trained research assistants, participants with acute respiratory infection from 30 households subsequently collected and returned a self-collected/parent-collected nasal swab via mail. Self/parental swabs corresponding with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction primary research samples were analyzed. RESULTS: Nearly all (96.8%, n=30/31) households agreed to participate; 100% reported returning the sample and 29 were received (median time: 8 days). Most (18; 62.1%) of the primary research samples were positive. For eight influenza-positive research samples, seven (87.5%) self-swabs were also positive. For ten other respiratory pathogen-positive research samples, eight (80.0%) self-swabs were positive. Sensitivity of self-swabs for any respiratory pathogen was 83.3% and 87.5% for influenza, and specificity for both was 100%. There was no relationship between level of education and concordance of results between positive research samples and their matching participant swab. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, self-swabbing was feasible and valid in a low-income, urban minority

"Relative frequency, Possible Risk Factors, Viral Codetection Rates, and Seasonality of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Among Children With Lower Respiratory Tract Infection in Northeastern Brazil","Few studies, each limited to a single major city, have investigated the prevalence and seasonal patterns of different viruses among children with low respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in Northeastern Brazil. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and of 7 other viruses in children for LRTI in 4 capitals from this region, and investigate their association with several risk factors, including meteorological data. From April 2012 to March 2013, 507 children, aged up to 24 months and hospitalized with LRTI in one of the participating centers at Aracajú, Salvador, Recife, and Maceió, had a sample of nasopharyngeal aspirate collected and analyzed for the following viruses by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction followed by hybridization on low-density microarrays: RSV, influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, and coronavirus. The result was positive in 66.5% of cases, RSV was the most common virus (40.2%). Except for rhinovirus (17%), all other virus had frequency rates lower than 6%. Viral coinfections were detected in 13.8% of samples. Possible related risk factors for RSV infection were low age upon entry, attendance of daycare, low gestational age, and low educational level of the father. The relative frequency of viral infections was associated with increasing temperature and decreasing humidity separately, but the results also suggested both associated with increased frequency of RSV. Some of these findings differ from those reported for other regions in Brazil and may be used to guide policies that address

"Population-based Surveillance for Medically Attended Human Parainfluenza Viruses From the Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project, 2010–2014","BACKGROUND: Parainfluenza viruses (PIV) have been shown to contribute substantially to pediatric hospitalizations in the United States. However, to date, there has been no systematic surveillance to estimate the burden among pediatric outpatients. METHODS: From August 2010 through July 2014, outpatient health care providers with enumerated patient populations in 13 states and jurisdictions participating in the Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project conducted surveillance of patients with influenza-like illness (ILI). Respiratory specimens were collected from the first 10 ILI patients each week with demographic and clinical data. Specimens were tested for multiple respiratory viruses, including PIV1–4, using reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction assays. Cumulative incidence was calculated using provider patient population size as the denominator. RESULTS: PIVs 1–3 were detected in 8.0% of 7716 ILI-related outpatient specimens: 30% were PIV1, 26% PIV2 and 44% PIV3. PIV circulation varied noticeably by year and type, with PIV3 predominating in 2010–2011 (incidence 110 per 100,000 children), PIV1 in 2011–2012 (89 per 100,000), dual predominance of PIV2 and PIV3 (88 and 131 per 100,000) in 2012–2013 and PIV3 (100 per 100,000) in 2013–2014. The highest incidence of PIV detections was among patients aged <5 years (259–1307 per 100,000). The median age at detection for PIV3 (3.4 years) was significantly lower than the median ages for PIV1 (4.5 years) and PIV2 (7.0 years; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PIVs 1–3 comprise a substantial amount of medically attended pediatric ILI, particularly among children aged <5 years. Distinct seasonal circulation patterns as well as significant differences in rates by age were observed between PIV

Detection of Common Respiratory Viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in Patient-Occupied Rooms in Pediatric Wards,"Few studies have assessed viral contamination in the rooms of hospital wards. This cross-sectional study evaluated the air and objects in patient-occupied rooms in pediatric wards for the presence of common respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Air samplers were placed at a short (60–80 cm) and long (320 cm) distance from the head of the beds of 58 pediatric patients, who were subsequently confirmed to be infected with enterovirus (n = 17), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n = 13), influenza A virus (n = 13), adenovirus (n = 9), or M pneumoniae (n = 6). Swab samples were collected from the surfaces of 5 different types of objects in the patients’ rooms. All air and swab samples were analyzed via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for the presence of the above pathogens. All pathogens except enterovirus were detected in the air, on the objects, or in both locations in the patients’ rooms. The detection rates of influenza A virus, adenovirus, and M pneumoniae for the long distance air sampling were 15%, 67%, and 17%, respectively. Both adenovirus and M pneumoniae were detected at very high rates, with high concentrations, on all sampled objects. The respiratory pathogens RSV, influenza A virus, adenovirus, and M pneumoniae were detected in the air and/or on the objects in the pediatric ward rooms. Appropriate infection control measures should be strictly implemented when caring for such

"Etiology, Seasonality, and Clinical Features of Viral Respiratory Tract Infections in Children Hospitalized With Acute Bronchiolitis: A Single-Center Study","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the viral frequency, seasonality, and clinical and demographic features of patients hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis. A cross-sectional, descriptive study was performed in 316 infants younger than 2 years of age who were hospitalized for acute viral bronchiolitis. Respiratory tract infection agents were investigated with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 316 infants were included in this study. Of the 316 infants, at least one respiratory tract pathogen was detected in 75% (237/316). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common virus identified in 127 infants (40.1%) followed by rhinovirus (n = 78, 24.6%). In this study, where viral agents were determined via PCR in patients who were followed-up due to the diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis, RSV was detected as the most common agent, as in other studies. In almost half of the RSV-positive patients, RSV was accompanied by a second or third

Identifying agents triggering bronchiolitis in the State of Qatar,"BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis is considered as the most frequent lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children. This disorder is marked by acute inflammation, edema, damage of epithelial cells lining small airways, and augmentation of mucus production. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to identify agents triggering bronchiolitis in the State of Qatar. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective study was performed at Hamad Medical Corporation, the only tertiary and academic medical center in the State of Qatar. The study included infants and young children aged 0–24 months who were admitted to our pediatric ward with diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis (2010–2012) RESULTS: Eight hundred thirty-five infants and young children met the study inclusion criteria with mean age at diagnosis of 3.61±3.56 months. Respiratory virus real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on 769 (92.0%) of the participants. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was positive in 352 (45.7%) children admitted with clinical bronchiolitis. In addition, no viruses were identified in 142 (18.4%) of those admitted, and respiratory viruses other RSV were found in 275 (35.7%) of the children. Our investigations and observations show that there has been a steady and periodic seasonal variation in the RSV rate over the study period. A seasonal trend for the RSV (detected by respiratory virus real-time polymerase chain reaction) rate was evident, showing annual peaks in the months of October, November, December, and January, with a significant test for seasonality (test statistics [T]=3.15, P=0.009). CONCLUSION: In countries with desert hot weather, bronchiolitis might affect children throughout the year.

Elevated serum LAMC2 is associated with lymph node metastasis and predicts poor prognosis in penile squamous cell carcinoma,"PURPOSE: Molecular biomarkers, especially serologic factors, have been widely applied in cancer diagnosis and patient follow-up. However, there are few valuable prognostic factors in penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC). Here, the authors investigated whether laminin gamma 2 (LAMC2) expression, especially serum LAMC2 (sLAMC2) level, was a suitable prognostic factor that could aid in the prediction of survival in PSCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 114 PSCC patients. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were performed to detect LAMC2 expression; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to test sLAMC2 concentration; and a Transwell assay and an in vivo experiment in nude mice were used to test PSCC cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. The chi-squared test was used to analyze the association between LAMC2 level and clinical parameters, the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate the hazard ratio for death, and Kaplan–Meier analysis with a log-rank test was used for the survival analysis. RESULTS: LAMC2 was overexpressed in PSCC tissues, and the LAMC2 expression level was higher in metastatic lymph node (LN) tissues than in primary cancer tissues; moreover, the LAMC2 levels in primary cancer tissues and sLAMC2 were higher in patients with LN metastasis than in those without LN metastasis. Upregulated LAMC2 facilitated the migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of PSCC cells in vitro and promoted LN metastasis of PSCC cells in nude mice. Elevated LAMC2 levels were strongly correlated with advanced clinicopathologic parameters, especially LN metastasis, in PSCC patients and predicted shorter disease-specific survival. The predictive value of sLAMC2 is superior to that of C-reactive protein and squamous cell carcinoma antigen previously reported in PSCC patients, and a stratification analysis revealed that the level of sLAMC2 had a higher predictive value for disease-specific survival in early penile cancer (especially at the N(0/X) stage) than in later-stage penile cancer. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that sLAMC2 is a potential serologic prognostic marker in PSCC and could aid in risk stratification in early-stage PSCC

Restriction of H1N1 influenza virus infection by selenium nanoparticles loaded with ribavirin via resisting caspase-3 apoptotic pathway,"INTRODUCTION: Ribavirin (RBV) is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug. Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) attract much attention in the biomedical field and are used as carriers of drugs in current research studies. In this study, SeNPs were decorated by RBV, and the novel nanoparticle system was well characterized. Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells were infected with H1N1 influenza virus before treatment with RBV, SeNPs, and SeNPs loaded with RBV (Se@RBV). METHODS AND RESULTS: MTT assay showed that Se@RBV nanoparticles protect cells during H1N1 infection in vitro. Se@RBV depressed virus titer in the culture supernatant. Intracellular localization detection revealed that Se@RBV accumulated in lysosome and escaped to cytoplasm as time elapsed. Furthermore, activation of caspase-3 was resisted by Se@RBV. Expressions of proteins related to caspase-3, including cleaved poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, caspase-8, and Bax, were downregulated evidently after treatment with Se@RBV compared with the untreated infection group. In addition, phosphorylations of phosphorylated 38 (p38), JNK, and phosphorylated 53 (p53) were inhibited as well. In vivo experiments indicated that Se@RBV was found to prevent lung injury in H1N1-infected mice through hematoxylin and eosin staining. Tunel test of lung tissues present that DNA damage reached a high level but reduced substantially when treated with Se@RBV. Immunohistochemical test revealed an identical result with the in vitro experiment that activations of caspase-3 and proteins on the apoptosis pathway were restrained by Se@RBV treatment. CONCLUSION: Taken together, this study elaborates that Se@RBV is a novel promising agent against H1N1 influenza virus

Respiratory Viral Infections in Children and Adolescents with Hematological Malignancies,"BACKGROUND: Despite the introduction of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for the diagnosis of respiratory viral infection (RVI), guidance on the application of this test and the management of RVI in immunocompromised children is lacking. This study evaluated the clinical characteristics of RVI and established strategies for the PCR test in children and adolescents with hematological malignancies. METHODS: This study included children and adolescents with underlying hematological malignancies and respiratory symptoms, in whom a multiplex PCR test was performed. Patients in whom RVI was identified and not identified were categorized into Groups I and II, respectively. Group I was sub-divided into patients with upper and lower respiratory infections. The medical records of the enrolled patients were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 93 respiratory illnesses were included. Group I included 46 (49.5%) cases of RVI, including 31 (67.4%) upper and 15 (32.6%) lower respiratory infections. Rhinovirus (37.0%) was the most common viral pathogen. Significantly more patients in Group I had community-acquired respiratory illnesses (p=0.003) and complained of rhinorrhea (p<0.001) and sputum (p=0.008) than those in Group II. In Group I, significantly more patients with lower respiratory infections had uncontrolled underlying malignancies (p=0.038) and received re-induction or palliative chemotherapy (p=0.006) than those with upper respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS: A multiplex PCR test should be considered for RVI diagnosis in immunocompromised children and adolescents with respiratory symptoms, especially in those with rhinorrhea or sputum prominent over a cough. The early application of the PCR test in patients with uncontrolled underlying malignancies may improve

Nested–polymerase chain reaction detection of Pneumocystis carinii f. sp. canis in a suspected immunocompromised Cavalier King Charles spaniel with multiple infections,"A 7-month-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel female was referred due to a chronic cough refractory to antibiotic treatments. Laboratory findings showed leukocytosis, increased serum C-reactive protein, hypogammaglobulinemia, and decreased total serum immunoglobulin G concentration. Thoracic radiographs showed a mild bronchial pattern. Cytology of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid revealed a septic inflammation. Bordetella bronchiseptica, Mycoplasma spp., and Pneumocystis carinii were identified by polymerase chain reaction testing, and Klebsiella pneumonia was cultured from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Moreover, Escherichia coli was also cultured from urine. Pneumocystis spp. identification was done by sequencing of genetic amplicons. The dog died due to cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to a spontaneous pneumothorax on the day following the procedure. This report documents the detection of Pneumocystis carinii f. sp. canis in a suspected immunocompromised Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with concurrent pulmonary and urinary tract infections involving four different pathogens, and highlights the importance of the use of polymerase chain reaction testing to detect canine Pneumocystis spp. in cases with negative bronchoalveolar lavage

The prevalence of respiratory pathogens in adults with community-acquired pneumonia in an outpatient cohort,"PURPOSE: Community-acquired pneumonia is a common illness worldwide. In adults, community-acquired bacterial pneumonia has been well studied, but viral pneumonia is less well understood. We designed this study to identify respiratory pathogens, including common pneumonia-causing bacteria, viruses and atypical pneumonia pathogens, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia at the Fever Clinic of Peking University Third Hospital. We collected sputum or throat swabs from patients diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. Multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed for 20 pathogens, including 9 viruses, 3 atypical pathogens and 8 bacteria. RESULTS: There were 232 outpatients enrolled in our study, and 153 patients (65.9%) had positive test results, of which 26.7% were viruses, 19.4% were atypical pathogens and 19.8% were bacteria. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was detected at the highest frequency (19.0%), exceeding Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. The most commonly identified viral pathogens were IFVs (15.1%), PIVs (3.4%) and RhV (2.6%). The most commonly identified bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.1%), Haemophilus influenza (6.5%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.6%). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that viruses were commonly detected in outpatients with CAP, and IFVs were the most common viruses, especially during flu season. Patients with viral infection were prone to viral-bacterial coinfection. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the leading pathogen in the outpatients with CAP. Viral infection occurs in a large number of outpatients with CAP, and it should receive greater attention in clinical

Examining Landscape Factors Influencing Relative Distribution of Mosquito Genera and Frequency of Virus Infection,"Mosquito-borne infections cause some of the most debilitating human diseases, including yellow fever and malaria, yet we lack an understanding of how disease risk scales with human-driven habitat changes. We present an approach to study variation in mosquito distribution and concomitant viral infections on the landscape level. In a pilot study we analyzed mosquito distribution along a 10-km transect of a West African rainforest area, which included primary forest, secondary forest, plantations, and human settlements. Variation was observed in the abundance of Anopheles, Aedes,Culex, and Uranotaenia mosquitoes between the different habitat types. Screening of trapped mosquitoes from the different habitats led to the isolation of five uncharacterized viruses of the families Bunyaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Rhabdoviridae, as well as an unclassified virus. Polymerase chain reaction screening for these five viruses in individual mosquitoes indicated a trend toward infection with specific viruses in specific mosquito genera that differed by habitat. Based on these initial analyses, we believe that further work is indicated to investigate the impact of anthropogenic landscape changes on mosquito distribution and accompanying arbovirus infection.",-0.032070603,0.027503991,0.034590155,-0.056970704,0.051218063,0.009684926,0.045444928,-0.03159615,0.002471579,-0.02984086,0.06033026,0.049656,0.028919745,-0.043855984,0.054601036,-0.05781697,-0.059805635,-0.057516217,0.05448178,-0.05592628,-0.050942346,-0.050365962,-0.010257227,0.049933907,0.053008772,0.058114477,0.03695311,-0.026942799,0.05734894,-0.05613255,-0.036610033,0.060326256,0.044991825,-0.017422874,-0.057942424,0.033131883,0.04422403,-0.018739048,-0.04030291,0.03857242,0.002420693,0.051575508,-0.016202599,-0.05198563,-0.06033032,0.008858828,0.03286364,-0.006974123,0.004483516,0.02065655,0.059689026,-0.04281312,-0.05950443,0.042955834,-0.057872184,-0.049118523,-0.060107328,-0.044529885,0.058375824,0.001243346,0.053615656,-0.020935213,0.000175238,-0.021853808,0.05235928,-0.048395902,0.052473534,-0.05834953,0.042416926,-0.049647182,-0.014341308,0.056576557,0.049507014,0.056861557,-0.04649945,0.056287676,0.040663626,-0.03936487,-0.06032179,0.035291422,0.060207874,0.0586254,0.04562052,0.016901873,-0.053148434,0.039465655,0.022782985,0.010665668,-0.05337322,0.002977473,-0.033865325,0.047827665,0.038084798,0.059780505,-0.035520736,0.0589984,0.04542398,0.060268942,0.060314186,0.015234769,-0.03648967,-0.024623424,-0.023375642,0.05534204,0.029576357,0.05929204,0.05638006,0.029481858,-0.038911685,-0.027578274,0.044452578,0.003427257,0.051110324,0.05161614,0.05888106,0.034076877,-0.058372594,0.009811408,0.03496219,0.024574718,0.058242775,-0.008425942,-0.008405735,-0.048071075,0.037477907,0.041422363,0.06019371,-0.01596598,-0.032063168,0.031147486,-0.031034447,0.06033026,0.05166305,-0.039968446,0.033966523,-0.057597667,0.044862617,0.057502635,-0.03858608,-0.024966272,0.000989691,0.060322057,-0.051037017,-0.016668525,0.056151897,-0.05198041,-0.017030304,-0.05880716,0.05337129,-0.020682061,0.03435076,-0.035103016,-0.04490571,-0.012892442,0.059654444,-0.054943807,0.055661704,0.04273343,-0.027322184,0.023370534,-0.0538372,-0.05795556,0.04564594,0.059360117,0.036794163,0.044576123,0.057747718,0.027724603,-0.053912915,-0.05142925,-0.029480435,-0.05887974,-0.053573716,0.0531054,-0.007363319,0.02842051,0.049663883,-0.058570966,0.049342215,0.041193668,0.029866604,0.018831339,0.021220576,-0.009084627,0.059321385,0.0501675,-0.05889789,-0.058686003,0.054285742,-0.01874801,0.027273301,-0.051623836,-0.05802365,0.030812835,0.044872046,-0.03457071,0.059672378,0.043100897,-0.050295554,-0.05513004,-0.05205041,0.06027067,0.036436364,0.046768073,0.03668641,-0.055379964,-0.05019497,0.060129587,0.043240074,0.059702978,0.0553289,0.060330037,0.040634207,0.057969958,-0.059089553,0.05293852,0.020823112,0.036356434,-0.05930567,-0.05973218,-0.001166373,-0.041735455,-0.057517044,-0.05421074,0.016516468,0.050136656,-0.05697348,-0.0579579,0.020087875,0.059567597,0.06026197,0.051436838,0.05847412,-0.060301233,-0.042605285,0.033758316,-0.031902142,-0.0391333,-0.023527911,0.028167244,0.050247673,0.011563674,-0.040998567,-0.040482946,-0.047715306,-0.009296963,0.005274996,0.03597576,0.059065368,-0.035700057,0.042721953,-0.02278939,-0.00697284,-0.015040485,0.059821535,0.047599897,-0.060099006,0.06032944,-0.034062132,-0.027885247,-0.018574802,0.024069099,-0.05634576,0.037679356,0.002863404,-0.032088254,0.013392636,-0.013867302,-0.04785175,0.03593113,0.013454783,0.05819123,-0.041653205,-0.008429675,-0.054721083,-0.056802955,0.043145265,-0.004485195,0.060138166,-0.01232762,-0.014984081,0.030785864,-0.030956943,0.049303096,0.000764115,-0.03806999,-0.038722284,0.060310792,-0.03410465,0.051830906,0.05989114,0.044715226,0.060302805,0.002837815,0.014722242,-0.039000127,-0.035726715,-0.044531208,-0.06032828,0.0596135,0.016619053,0.02703071,0.055307683,0.03286926,-0.06002578,-0.049425814,0.012147174,-0.03688578,0.052456606,-0.02541016,0.026650833,-0.039685566,-0.048842918,-0.020489698,0.060166698,-0.059481554,0.06000442,0.003183206,0.060173806,-0.008690141,-0.056404114,0.054586813,0.05825004,-0.05954657,-0.05865973,0.060299527,0.040924396,-0.041741647,-0.052392077,-0.045956276,-0.01627587,0.047911078,-0.0120769,0.058481667,0.002998089,0.042740863,0.0391105,0.021563647,-0.000722781,-0.001266315,-0.013779745,0.010367507,0.04081133,0.02138487,-0.059490245,-0.06032908,0.046582624,0.058497377,0.013717002,-0.06008682,0.05645685,0.05720743,0.05511592,0.030168077,0.014471552,0.040927257,-0.060324732,-0.002404591,-0.024389273,-0.05506976,0.054550372,-0.006027912,-0.057427805,0.039939996,-0.055561006,0.02794729,0.06002027,0.05792471,0.053153306,0.05590597,0.012768057,0.0548229,0.046186447,-0.05847496,0.020448554,0.023832064,0.05973549,0.056881335,-0.03240321,0.009660023,0.058684915,0.059904583,0.053988274,0.05826115,0.027618797,-0.048979253,-0.012061933,-0.05953457,-0.053222608,0.05009172,0.030387798,-0.038641937,0.056161266,-0.023661263,-0.060012765,0.041300956,-0.053063437,0.051663276,0.040916402,-0.036605645,-0.051979452,0.05484176,-0.059401263,0.04362125,0.002279772,-0.03892351,-0.05440974,0.04416251,0.055592112,0.028095573,0.056246053,0.05449986,-0.

Microbiological study of patients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD) and the usefulness of analytical and clinical parameters in its identification (VIRAE study),"PURPOSE: Respiratory infection is the most common cause for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD). The aim of this work was to study the etiology of the respiratory infection in order to assess the usefulness of the clinical and analytical parameters used for COPD identification. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 132 patients over a period of 2 years. The etiology of the respiratory infection was studied by conventional sputum, paired serology tests for atypical bacteria, and viral diagnostic techniques (immunochromatography, immunofluorescence, cell culture, and molecular biology techniques). We grouped the patients into four groups based on the pathogens isolated (bacterial versus. viral, known etiology versus unknown etiology) and compared the groups. RESULTS: A pathogen was identified in 48 patients. The pathogen was identified through sputum culture in 34 patients, seroconversion in three patients, and a positive result from viral techniques in 14 patients. No significant differences in identifying etiology were observed in the clinical and analytical parameters within the different groups. The most cost-effective tests were the sputum test and the polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION: Based on our experience, clinical and analytical parameters are not useful for the etiological identification of COPD exacerbations. Diagnosing COPD exacerbation is difficult, with the conventional sputum test for bacterial etiology and molecular biology techniques for viral etiology providing the most profitability. Further studies are necessary to identify respiratory syndromes or analytical parameters that can be used to identify the etiology of new AE-COPD cases without the laborious diagnostic techniques.",-0.056260295,0.040107105,-0.04108206,0.007189179,0.052273363,-0.04176267,0.052844036,-0.048814885,-0.04962353,-0.032409195,0.058489777,0.013840487,0.04055367,0.01188794,0.049271803,-0.056226354,-0.058489777,-0.028749788,-0.007948351,-0.04643135,-0.031288583,-0.022027502,-0.05757976,-0.027298983,-0.047044385,0.008587999,-0.00255723,0.047769193,0.048597403,-0.047304947,0.050199546,0.058489777,0.027354453,0.043002892,0.016456382,-0.006166633,-0.057685915,-0.05119761,-0.058133278,-0.031667117,0.030908192,-0.05600664,0.02732551,0.01684442,-0.025259752,0.041580983,-0.015654493,0.03763696,0.046433527,-0.04656236,-0.05571235,-0.00268997,-0.058455832,-0.014873645,-0.058240857,-0.03720258,-0.027063955,0.0428232,0.05736474,0.05843527,-0.052477382,0.054777265,0.019458493,-0.01110059,-0.034952443,-0.058008358,0.046993293,-0.054369096,0.04187803,-0.05678975,0.018200472,0.018003494,0.05527472,0.05269739,-0.05421343,-0.05262769,0.045108423,-0.016439242,-0.05845296,0.04188175,0.056498908,0.05839374,0.058013722,0.05019887,-0.056982197,0.045986325,0.000714572,-0.003549584,-0.00046885,-0.058443017,-0.05606789,-0.05535104,0.00292974,-0.046541546,-0.03265435,0.057249215,-0.012476489,0.05824461,0.05843592,-0.054037094,-0.032381527,0.004570365,-0.053409744,0.05493047,0.027296688,0.001390993,0.05806194,0.040674098,0.050638482,0.01741336,-0.035111573,0.040897302,0.031599008,0.050254792,0.05666535,0.04581423,-0.02161926,0.05397413,0.057144836,0.0498971,0.009216349,0.031009696,0.04881476,-0.050687384,0.0418103,0.053065237,-0.050705217,0.04641638,-0.02835756,-0.005988218,-0.0409438,0.058489777,0.04987115,0.009094211,0.055764664,-0.05045109,0.04795889,0.027651025,-0.05780925,-0.051134434,-0.057232343,0.05847681,-0.058406956,0.031236708,-0.018646944,0.015029546,0.023156675,-0.050526667,0.058407847,-0.057569742,0.029623834,-0.057570085,-0.056521256,-0.057740223,0.058469184,-0.03945199,0.051967114,0.0393185,0.024685783,-0.054857392,0.01376049,-0.023715453,-0.047212787,0.05720995,-0.02141714,-0.05654009,-0.033804864,0.037538115,-0.055585824,-0.042370535,-0.039764665,-0.058486957,-0.012675213,0.042731613,-0.003511109,0.015195698,-0.043290906,-0.041281655,0.057963513,0.026269248,-0.040478528,0.05795652,-0.027992435,-0.001676719,0.05681338,-0.00690623,-0.045434523,-0.045594983,0.03591266,0.016546035,0.058159083,-0.057520084,0.054588046,0.007960434,0.055585407,-0.050628066,-0.030867113,-0.006396643,-0.03371504,-0.02677539,-0.05653031,0.046653915,0.0056634,0.049496084,0.052471347,-0.05841253,0.004440853,-0.050262626,0.04637675,0.05845194,0.021053704,0.05138046,-0.001594736,0.05774778,-0.019236663,0.003216194,0.029029965,0.032606404,-0.019458953,0.035144664,-0.009680082,0.021849347,0.057664823,-0.05425477,-0.024907464,-0.021937735,-0.05835799,-0.05311868,0.026126709,0.057393424,0.044393167,0.058247346,0.025558988,-0.05846421,0.054085027,0.037203252,-0.035243433,-0.050222807,0.018132903,0.02762228,0.012136729,0.055526026,-0.05372518,-0.058448568,0.057566468,-0.026804335,-0.057552576,-0.030806689,0.05816477,-0.058131672,0.025777416,0.038040686,0.006596774,-0.04962067,0.058332864,0.036213003,-0.040320054,0.058489628,-0.029339666,-0.023073252,0.056880835,0.042661402,0.009887967,0.021758797,-0.044402994,-0.02958881,0.040114496,-0.028699297,-0.052072,0.03480778,-0.00812287,0.05784284,-0.051236864,-0.058480185,-0.02162738,-0.054107863,-0.014166388,-0.04577997,0.05840642,-0.05682284,-0.058282085,-0.037946418,-0.05131852,0.056442954,0.011229952,0.000662439,0.027145527,0.055676244,0.007263381,0.048996575,0.035804074,0.04182594,0.058399264,-0.058387764,0.050417293,-0.043906894,-0.038348593,0.03548518,-0.017886374,0.057139717,0.04825115,0.036564473,0.025050923,-0.04647814,-0.05732226,0.009571041,0.054745205,-0.056548383,0.056731936,0.03104246,-0.05101046,-0.047081567,0.05099377,0.00141108,0.058389455,-0.056038853,0.009428488,-0.027903141,0.05797053,0.03746613,-0.051378388,-0.008403878,0.053053398,-0.055784214,-0.04269882,0.05729093,-0.025830494,-0.047665417,-0.044619177,-0.046742085,0.02356161,0.058030102,-0.017070258,0.05834237,0.04728163,0.054920275,-0.022123333,0.055381108,0.016642023,-0.029288203,-0.054011606,0.041441027,0.058482688,0.05634268,-0.058488034,-0.058488496,0.058106553,0.038174365,-0.057510126,-0.057739597,0.051050734,0.015109254,0.013387508,0.058019683,0.058383495,-0.05340098,-0.058489535,-0.024616504,0.04434227,-0.05351746,0.022742847,0.001297555,-0.058458436,0.007770896,-0.030803172,-0.057906758,0.058452252,0.03186028,0.056501284,-0.05786848,-0.002734091,0.052856673,-0.028531415,-0.056266755,0.05609981,0.057418086,0.055813234,0.055796668,-0.013645146,-0.046078905,-0.05140989,-0.03333246,0.055516336,0.052091707,0.035887744,-0.027002206,0.037127048,-0.043623522,0.020901356,0.035171926,0.035327293,0.0314884,0.030913087,0.006518911,0.007771483,0.024762519,-0.024028495,-0.05837285,0.057788175,-0.035990234,-0.026630197,0.03187196,0.055021662,0.057289973,0.053189564,0.012847158,0.009258798,0.016302813,0.05771219,-0.001570889,0.053283

Epidemiology and Virology of Acute Respiratory Infections During the First Year of Life: A Birth Cohort Study in Vietnam,"BACKGROUND: Understanding viral etiology and age-specific incidence of acute respiratory infections in infants can help identify risk groups and inform vaccine delivery, but community-based data is lacking from tropical settings. METHODS: One thousand four hundred and seventy-eight infants in urban Ho Chi Minh City and 981 infants in a semi-rural district in southern Vietnam were enrolled at birth and followed to 1 year of age. Acute respiratory infection (ARI) episodes were identified through clinic-based illness surveillance, hospital admissions and self-reports. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from infants with respiratory symptoms and tested for 14 respiratory pathogens using multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Estimated incidence of ARI was 542 and 2691 per 1000 infant-years, and hospitalization rates for ARI were 81 and 138 per 1000 infant-years, in urban and semi-rural cohorts, respectively, from clinic- and hospital-based surveillance. However self-reported ARI episodes were just 1.5-fold higher in the semi-rural versus urban cohort, indicating that part of the urban–rural difference was explained by under-ascertainment in the urban cohort. Incidence was higher in infants ≥6 months of age than <6 months, but this was pathogen-specific. One or more viruses were detected in 53% (urban) and 64% (semi-rural) of samples from outpatients with ARI and in 78% and 66% of samples from hospitalized ARI patients, respectively. The most frequently detected viruses were rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus A and bocavirus. ARI-associated hospitalizations were associated with longer stays and more frequent ICU admission than other infections. CONCLUSIONS: ARI is a significant cause of morbidity in Vietnamese infants and influenza virus A is an under-appreciated cause of vaccine-preventable disease and hospitalizations in this tropical setting. Public health strategies to reduce infant ARI incidence and hospitalization rates are needed.",-0.058090493,0.059396368,-0.047614846,-0.05355721,-0.05534361,0.055561077,0.031092763,-0.058004044,-0.031771563,-0.030087605,0.059787005,0.051886518,-0.05696622,-0.05866872,0.057577044,-0.046037666,-0.059787016,-0.019314993,-0.027572816,-0.047755603,0.03515279,-0.040372673,-0.049347036,0.01871381,-0.049682662,0.05830851,-0.02208077,-0.018004835,-0.024588987,-0.038211897,0.050526448,0.05978702,-0.03735329,0.035402432,-0.012889464,-0.036770727,-0.059596714,-0.02623623,-0.05962243,-0.043914866,0.049040344,0.057668008,-0.00684687,0.006064312,-0.047135834,0.042178374,0.003668443,-0.019620763,-0.008102507,-0.041607182,-0.047629535,0.010263748,-0.0597687,-0.056157473,-0.05951569,0.04607538,-0.059706807,0.050102018,0.058680985,0.006895665,-0.042250987,0.052027132,-0.021274889,-0.01724855,-0.000697371,-0.059628777,0.0565547,-0.040514752,0.027897928,0.012368202,-0.012799281,0.013835679,0.03007184,0.05943771,0.002177139,0.05009373,-0.05385157,0.001929933,-0.059688106,0.033077557,0.059350237,0.05756952,0.059455838,-0.039096672,-0.020978132,0.05905628,0.04432676,-0.049658347,-0.030261472,-0.056616534,-0.05864909,0.040897828,-0.032238133,0.011668066,0.014750858,0.05608181,0.02153222,0.059127845,0.058336765,-0.03729951,-0.05934215,-0.05063344,0.012925148,0.059590977,0.041973505,0.022998065,0.044711992,-0.05001885,0.010342062,0.000188595,-0.018535363,0.05592596,0.006670755,0.0456944,0.05948624,0.000161687,-0.05877568,-0.054167286,0.004750553,0.028835688,0.032714672,-0.008375526,0.058887318,-0.04044571,0.04614727,0.033574313,0.055091716,-0.017739274,-0.026819875,0.038648296,-0.004591018,0.059787016,0.055855695,-0.032954335,0.03551878,-0.05583868,0.057370823,0.040400844,-0.050024416,-0.04728277,0.04088946,0.059787013,-0.058718197,-0.0434545,0.004757632,-0.021819567,0.04195847,-0.058572393,0.05887046,-0.04012283,0.030726174,-0.04402629,-0.05882489,-0.04170766,0.0531498,-0.042929478,-0.014660495,0.055802397,-0.003391251,0.054528557,0.046302427,0.030974116,-0.045539465,0.05653571,0.055077452,-0.059057876,0.056786153,-0.022808313,-0.05734255,-0.05735859,0.04634216,-0.059756275,-0.05408248,0.024911208,0.04621616,-0.018194797,0.043508906,-0.024118051,0.055626504,-0.012761555,-0.046946913,0.050644428,0.05010563,0.05472824,0.059514698,-0.05273586,-0.05589297,-0.044439577,0.026739338,-0.000806062,0.05351184,-0.047262233,-0.047653366,0.025684776,0.050145686,-0.041315317,-0.029179392,0.057615735,0.021357462,0.021801768,-0.012193369,0.058566663,0.003377856,0.001670334,-0.032560717,-0.016690236,0.05239799,0.053000454,-0.02679787,0.059665013,0.043913282,-0.043039106,0.001213095,0.057922326,-0.057709366,-0.040287536,0.059338573,0.0508323,0.047453664,-0.04414417,-0.024549393,-0.056402236,0.032422602,-0.04938927,0.045407694,-0.045134675,-0.028918246,-0.059695195,0.053871606,0.05949482,0.031444162,0.051156707,0.052748017,-0.059786238,-0.000361887,0.006978595,0.011642967,-0.056370255,-0.013786261,-0.029489653,-0.016588537,0.05346189,0.04272798,-0.058491778,0.058687843,-0.04715478,-0.03734011,0.056602202,0.05822366,-0.059444416,0.058905143,-0.04657767,-0.053849705,0.009505893,0.057878327,-0.025013704,-0.025856726,0.059787013,0.04702225,0.016134242,-0.033545118,0.040533744,-0.053874973,0.009437542,-0.059372347,-0.00249435,0.04017631,0.03493314,-0.02450251,0.037021834,-0.003759035,0.059407614,-0.034466855,-0.058835268,-0.047104497,-0.05900189,0.03892205,-0.04846437,0.057811905,-0.016576998,-0.054921854,0.05522721,-0.05393435,0.057187423,-0.034438465,-0.02187018,-0.024628643,-0.028397642,-0.04226016,0.05616703,0.059281774,-0.03169751,0.053441923,-0.054804288,-0.058684014,-0.054416303,-0.003132259,0.018807257,-0.055087764,0.059505314,-0.05252123,-0.026911652,-0.007785451,-0.056667358,-0.059633933,0.05649665,0.049719192,-0.028951034,0.05819985,-0.042180307,-0.030989872,-0.005186627,-0.059129916,-0.002624736,0.058887586,-0.00171556,0.051647145,0.046313033,0.059668683,-0.03153441,0.0220154,0.056863133,0.03546277,-0.049371473,-0.05878556,0.05978342,-0.020858712,-0.036518794,-0.05978464,-0.05922296,0.041851394,0.033631716,-0.022619696,0.059201155,0.05704968,0.03845779,-0.022050869,0.052160002,-0.009974378,0.019177582,-0.013394307,-0.030263064,0.059769295,0.058339152,-0.04087634,-0.059741084,0.057654344,0.052776605,-0.058845084,-0.0594691,0.052109893,-0.055887822,0.029051531,0.055345472,0.048481878,-0.022205267,-0.059786547,0.012646468,0.015400507,-0.04503778,0.04598706,-0.057551313,-0.05777464,-0.007262559,-0.034831468,0.009814021,0.059752975,0.024398165,0.047493093,0.021254227,-0.044208534,0.05531006,-0.04090192,0.047898263,0.057621982,0.05724107,0.021677863,-0.013513914,-0.04425512,-0.04427684,-0.01577907,0.01917281,-0.03280662,-6.84E-06,0.002297804,-0.010163819,-0.053399198,-0.059485145,-0.02261617,0.058553293,0.048352093,0.055566963,-0.054297976,-0.054140985,-0.05631186,0.044777032,-0.019975934,-0.058863778,0.024847265,-0.05947003,-0.02351006,0.033386834,0.054947175,0.05957364,-0.003337101,0.05821113,0.014410309,0.05411741,0.05874522,-0.055

Severe Measles Infection: The Spectrum of Disease in 36 Critically Ill Adult Patients,"France has recently witnessed a nationwide outbreak of measles. Data on severe forms of measles in adults are lacking. We sought to describe the epidemiologic, clinical, treatment, and prognostic aspects of the disease in adult patients who required admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). We performed a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 36 adults admitted to a total of 64 ICUs throughout France for complications of measles from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2011. All cases of measles were confirmed by serologic testing and/or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The cohort consisted of 21 male and 15 female patients, with a median age of 29.2 years (25th–75th interquartile range [IQR], 27.2–34.2 yr) and a median Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) of 13 (IQR, 9–18). Among the 26 patients whose measles vaccination status was documented, none had received 2 injections. One patient had developed measles during childhood. Underlying comorbid conditions included chronic respiratory disease in 9 patients, immunosuppression in 7 patients, and obesity in 3 patients, while measles affected 5 pregnant women. Respiratory complications induced by measles infection led to ICU admission in 32 cases, and measles-related neurologic complications led to ICU admission in 2 cases. Two patients were admitted due to concurrent respiratory and neurologic complications. Bacterial superinfection of measles-related airway infection was suspected in 28 patients and was documented in 8. Four cases of community-acquired pneumonia, 6 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia, 1 case of tracheobronchitis, and 2 cases of sinusitis were microbiologically substantiated. Of 11 patients who required mechanical ventilation, 9 developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among the patients with ARDS, extraalveolar air leak complications occurred in 4 cases. Five patients died, all of whom were severely immunocompromised. On follow-up, 1 patient had severe chronic respiratory failure related to lung fibrosis, and 2 patients had mild lower limb paraparesis along with bladder dysfunction, both of which were ascribable to measles-induced encephalitis and myelitis. Among the 5 pregnant patients, the course of measles infection was uneventful, albeit 1 patient underwent emergent cesarean delivery because of fetal growth restriction. Measles is a disease with protean and potentially deceptive clinical manifestations, especially in the immunocompromised patient. Measles-associated pneumonitis and its complications, and less commonly postinfectious encephalomyelitis, are the main source of morbidity and mortality. In contrast with the usually benign course of the disease in immunocompetent patients, measles occurring in immunocompromised patients gives rise to lethal complications including ARDS, with or without bacterial superinfection. Other patients potentially at high risk for severe measles are young adults and pregnant women. Measles pneumonitis may predispose to air leak disease in patients using mechanical ventilation. To date, vaccination remains the most potent tool to control measles

Development of a Rapid Detection Method for Potato virus X by Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification,"The primary step for efficient control of viral diseases is the development of simple, rapid, and sensitive virus detection. Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) has been used to detect viral RNA molecules because of its simplicity and high sensitivity for a number of viruses. RT-LAMP for the detection of Potato virus X (PVX) was developed and compared with conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to demonstrate its advantages over RT-PCR. RT-LAMP reactions were conducted with or without a set of loop primers since one out of six primers showed PVX specificity. Based on real-time monitoring, RT-LAMP detected PVX around 30 min, compared to 120 min for RT-PCR. By adding a fluorescent reagent during the reaction, the extra step of visualization by gel electrophoresis was not necessary. RT-LAMP was conducted using simple inexpensive instruments and a regular incubator to evaluate whether RNA could be amplified at a constant temperature instead of using an expensive thermal cycler. This study shows the potential of RT-LAMP for the diagnosis of viral diseases and PVX epidemiology because of its simplicity and rapidness compared to RT-PCR.",-0.060318343,-0.022231648,-0.018485975,-0.0364043,0.024691109,0.05557803,0.035363518,-0.033621393,0.06368451,0.027444186,0.06572733,-0.045703426,0.05097301,0.023722192,0.016598236,-0.054099135,-0.06533023,-0.037995115,0.058892176,-0.000737483,-0.03294173,-0.000793725,-0.060735505,0.047950305,-0.019647181,0.05057874,0.002461342,0.04494321,-0.052208513,-0.033744782,0.054616436,0.06576456,-0.001165602,0.020998476,0.03114649,0.04553546,-0.064017475,-0.016360724,-0.064720504,-0.008901303,0.013832024,-0.020700937,-0.047360778,-0.056145404,0.021363463,-0.034130793,-0.03847545,0.02450291,-0.037083074,-0.02327748,-0.02465436,-0.028390503,-0.06512167,-0.04406983,-0.059816357,-0.004776257,-0.050273497,0.037951242,0.063470215,-0.04079728,-0.02680833,-0.00813867,0.04113914,-0.051666413,0.03940577,-0.048800163,0.06249108,0.048421584,0.025554173,-0.04846637,0.010665459,0.03551647,0.03021462,0.061741482,0.020283954,-0.018045256,0.049218394,-0.036223274,-0.06480795,0.06029996,-0.03913077,0.065134905,0.033074416,-0.030786378,-0.05950074,0.06484325,0.01447572,0.023453306,0.01488427,0.017901441,-0.002134093,-0.002443414,-0.06487718,0.001309601,0.05247696,0.02123181,0.04808322,0.061836876,0.06554798,-0.063216455,-0.043319374,-0.022657618,0.033418406,0.03010195,0.05074525,0.047971055,0.048832938,-0.012011871,-0.001079908,0.005163152,-0.028161021,0.058269378,0.016418424,-0.01724788,0.059919026,-0.034957375,-0.04683168,-0.03151468,0.00559214,0.00910199,-0.057760667,0.056496754,0.05132613,-0.030942544,-0.014239895,0.035332464,0.00539983,-0.059257656,-0.000697535,0.03471426,-0.0526154,0.06585129,0.055073738,-0.062945746,-0.054532044,-0.052671857,0.006291072,0.05107067,-0.0441606,0.002806822,0.011888838,0.06581321,-0.062327683,-0.02235692,-0.011540171,-0.057624426,-0.027082905,-0.06555925,0.036764167,-0.015467918,0.05964405,-0.05639711,-0.06290107,-0.06514811,0.06552352,0.043267496,0.054389887,0.04302216,-0.045051754,-0.028163904,0.0487177,-0.010425537,-0.056999587,0.007990501,0.04479125,0.02495823,-0.06001004,0.040100213,-0.062199607,-0.007074592,-0.039244767,-0.03249881,-0.05707595,0.02662176,-0.03301811,0.003009575,0.054489188,0.030235868,0.060887583,-0.027262425,-0.058449246,-0.008561085,-0.023266112,0.044526342,0.06555896,-0.062121853,-0.06366427,0.026436694,0.053126696,0.041214366,0.06533309,-0.033741146,-0.007016557,0.021081178,0.048329834,-0.019434437,0.05747143,-0.025970371,-0.003908283,-0.05589649,-0.036041,0.06475359,0.001129884,-0.004622764,0.055767544,-0.06432265,-0.007228452,0.033578895,-2.67E-06,0.06454065,-0.018849753,0.004562967,0.033284776,0.05606472,-0.054762747,-0.06268653,0.05091314,0.030356003,-0.05748755,0.00594062,0.038089186,-0.036579367,-0.054624815,0.039646976,-0.038116906,0.049079128,-0.06480715,-0.043963894,0.012769518,0.035039745,0.03955785,0.042511925,0.018790007,-0.06585205,0.04187734,0.02526719,-0.006032371,-0.056039225,0.027660089,0.05516655,0.015586366,-0.024133481,-0.04466538,-0.05925508,-0.021821247,-0.050985605,-0.010160637,0.010030826,0.060382724,-0.04534532,-0.065593004,0.007182824,-0.036917552,-0.036156572,0.063418105,-0.04347539,-0.05973468,0.065856606,-0.022016095,-0.012050036,0.04857644,0.05479213,0.014698199,0.060852442,0.028512446,-0.062702455,-0.063942246,0.010522036,-0.031562418,0.041813336,-0.014112345,0.058740634,-0.02180171,-0.06447794,0.037220784,-0.054430265,0.002089249,-0.050278787,0.063924626,-0.05148308,-0.06574798,-0.04731502,-0.0393136,0.062156938,-0.054683294,-0.031496964,-0.047673333,0.060974382,-0.044905785,0.022610147,0.06418842,0.06294791,0.06090783,-0.04762444,0.04205601,-0.048392747,-0.06020525,-0.04787804,-0.05615001,0.057673022,-0.050039392,0.0641545,-0.019734712,0.03715558,-0.06253103,0.034385256,0.020556457,-0.06250678,0.06561517,-0.05583543,0.061870262,-0.034350727,0.03178826,-0.051948838,0.06492835,0.055180922,0.018169433,-0.006966695,-0.021308944,-0.050223727,-0.024430195,0.059097048,0.022455508,-0.05095555,-0.018445598,0.049642317,-0.027875138,-0.04887019,-0.06285782,-0.05911699,0.03602482,0.01369381,0.060206514,0.064680345,0.002357298,0.014846935,0.057758052,-0.034571275,-0.003652332,0.017896455,-0.033965845,0.02527646,0.04240607,0.056693487,-0.065840885,-0.06519143,0.04379844,0.062838756,0.0353342,-0.06534655,0.022998026,0.022597337,0.00141774,0.024974903,0.032788105,-0.030013535,-0.06584359,-0.04047455,-0.05044006,-0.06346947,0.001110172,-0.062583104,-0.055512853,-0.033916906,-0.007290707,-0.054394696,0.06564684,0.06480589,0.055109233,0.050942305,-0.000581491,0.051509432,-0.0524854,-0.0658505,0.062358793,0.0289434,0.025829364,0.009751559,-0.05032757,-0.05853352,-0.06344801,0.037435755,0.022588488,0.029445007,0.050570775,-0.06500313,0.001886281,-0.05616005,-0.003185971,0.04447463,0.03712084,-0.05360073,0.033012882,-0.028548902,-0.057389386,0.043501187,0.039203797,-0.06574555,0.04940361,-0.06448046,0.056222398,0.033615515,0.007203428,0.05542398,0.060004067,-0.061366063,-0.036770333,-0.037620876,0.041652467,0.025480404,0.062022742,0.022047644,3.00E-06,-

Stable Occupancy of the Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus-Encoded Deubiquitinase Blocks Viral Infection,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) infection can result in a severe hemorrhagic syndrome for which there are no antiviral interventions available to date. Certain RNA viruses, such as CCHFV, encode cysteine proteases of the ovarian tumor (OTU) family that antagonize interferon (IFN) production by deconjugating ubiquitin (Ub). The OTU of CCHFV, a negative-strand RNA virus, is dispensable for replication of the viral genome, despite being part of the large viral RNA polymerase. Here, we show that mutations that prevent binding of the OTU to cellular ubiquitin are required for the generation of recombinant CCHFV containing a mutated catalytic cysteine. Similarly, the high-affinity binding of a synthetic ubiquitin variant (UbV-CC4) to CCHFV OTU strongly inhibits viral growth. UbV-CC4 inhibits CCHFV infection even in the absence of intact IFN signaling, suggesting that its antiviral activity is not due to blocking the OTU’s immunosuppressive function. Instead, the prolonged occupancy of the OTU with UbV-CC4 directly targets viral replication by interfering with CCHFV RNA synthesis.

Spectrum of respiratory viral infections in liver disease patients with cirrhosis admitted in critical care unit,"BACKGROUND: Clinical significance of respiratory viruses (RVs) as an etiology of pneumonia in liver disease patients with cirrhosis is usually underestimated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the spectrum of RVs in cirrhotic patients with pneumonia admitted in critical care units (CCUs) and its impact on the clinical outcome of cirrhotic patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective study was conducted in a tertiary care CCU, and consecutive cirrhotic patients with pneumonia were included. Bronchoalveolar lavage or throat swab/nasal swab was collected in viral transport medium for analysis of RVs by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. A total of 135 cirrhotic patients were included, viral and bacterial etiology of pneumonia was identified, and analysis was done with the clinical outcome. RESULTS: Overall, RVs were detected in 30 (22.2%) cirrhotic patients and viral–bacterial coinfection in 16 (11.8%) cirrhotic patients. The most common virus detected was rhinovirus in 9 (30%) patients. Mortality in cirrhotic patients with RV infection was significantly higher in comparison to cirrhotic patients with no RV infection (25 [83.3%] and 11 [12.3%], respectively, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses in cirrhotic patients with pneumonia are associated with poor clinical

Identification and Characterization of a Human Coronavirus 229E Nonstructural Protein 8-Associated RNA 3′-Terminal Adenylyltransferase Activity,"Coronavirus nonstructural protein 8 (nsp8) has been suggested to have diverse activities, including noncanonical template-dependent polymerase activities. Here, we characterized a recombinant form of the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) nsp8 and found that the protein has metal ion-dependent RNA 3′-terminal adenylyltransferase (TATase) activity, while other nucleotides were not (or very inefficiently) transferred to the 3′ ends of single-stranded and (fully) double-stranded acceptor RNAs. Using partially double-stranded RNAs, very efficient TATase activity was observed if the opposite (template) strand contained a short 5′ oligo(U) sequence, while very little (if any) activity was detected for substrates with other homopolymeric or heteropolymeric sequences in the 5′ overhang. The oligo(U)-assisted/templated TATase activity on partial-duplex RNAs was confirmed for two other coronavirus nsp8 proteins, suggesting that the activity is conserved among coronaviruses. Replacement of a conserved Lys residue with Ala abolished the in vitro RNA-binding and TATase activities of nsp8 and caused a nonviable phenotype when the corresponding mutation was introduced into the HCoV-229E genome, confirming that these activities are mediated by nsp8 and critical for viral replication. In additional experiments, we obtained evidence that nsp8 has a pronounced specificity for adenylate and is unable to incorporate guanylate into RNA products, which strongly argues against the previously proposed template-dependent RNA polymerase activity of this protein. Given the presence of an oligo(U) stretch at the 5′ end of coronavirus minus-strand RNAs, it is tempting to speculate (but remains to be confirmed) that the nsp8-mediated TATase activity is involved in the 3′ polyadenylation of viral plus-strand RNAs. IMPORTANCE Previously, coronavirus nsp8 proteins were suggested to have template-dependent RNA polymerase activities resembling those of RNA primases or even canonical RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, while more recent studies have suggested an essential cofactor function of nsp8 (plus nsp7) for nsp12-mediated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. In an effort to reconcile conflicting data from earlier studies, the study revisits coronavirus nsp8-associated activities using additional controls and proteins. The data obtained for three coronavirus nsp8 proteins provide evidence that the proteins share metal ion-dependent RNA 3′ polyadenylation activities that are greatly stimulated by a short oligo(U) stretch in the template strand. In contrast, nsp8 was found to be unable to select and incorporate appropriate (matching) nucleotides to produce cRNA products from heteropolymeric and other homooligomeric templates. While confirming the critical role of nsp8 in coronavirus replication, the study amends the list of activities mediated by coronavirus nsp8 proteins in the absence of other proteins.",-0.047637265,0.037324823,-0.056780115,-0.048552837,0.023834672,0.04987276,0.016339328,-0.042113334,-0.002703898,0.053519607,0.058535334,0.037684463,-0.04446433,0.054475114,0.04140973,-0.058555827,-0.052333955,-0.000779128,0.036446314,-0.01853165,0.036498725,0.05201685,-0.057628118,0.05013487,0.0139167,0.05426647,0.05685498,0.047442533,-0.05844288,-0.02285816,-0.011563295,0.05727761,-0.035099786,0.020395305,-0.018421138,0.014803842,-0.05775916,0.003333862,-0.05677057,0.04780498,0.041280635,-0.039497487,-0.025497511,-0.05429047,0.053173758,-0.05586859,-0.04380464,-0.055195425,0.053805128,-0.05744482,0.030113116,0.024033511,-0.058361523,-0.053079907,0.022232397,0.054927163,-0.057125002,-0.004284347,0.058336135,-0.058278497,0.017438764,-0.055724975,0.051804785,-0.04417068,-0.007215073,-0.057939842,0.05616913,-0.04176924,0.054792892,-0.03723319,0.048550636,0.032926768,-0.029114809,0.0500677,-0.049549147,0.021072738,0.05835211,0.027855003,-0.019787325,0.03110553,-0.05498142,0.058560956,-0.046341408,-0.054031435,-0.045508504,0.057285085,0.03047891,0.019382682,-0.045893982,0.043214448,0.014056278,-0.050538953,-0.058186594,0.053554922,-0.02705353,0.05598039,0.056570325,0.05598611,0.058552712,-0.053258814,0.032904025,0.027155653,-0.023947885,-0.000644608,-0.013044717,0.027486585,0.030774293,0.023149528,-0.05215683,-0.044415865,-0.049553405,0.05553324,-0.055642854,0.03377203,0.05582877,0.032521147,-0.058221474,0.045104794,-0.034381427,-0.00778224,-0.042775974,0.058457255,0.058128335,-0.016453357,0.05779332,0.034306295,-0.011659812,0.028786218,-0.04044967,0.02761726,-0.045780882,0.05856795,0.058315396,-0.035856888,0.001039527,0.008737636,0.014920555,0.03370114,-0.056646325,0.031076716,-0.024108998,0.058567896,-0.057970818,-0.05799558,-0.01694677,-0.05453618,0.05377481,-0.05845415,-0.016313182,0.05821145,-0.056294523,-0.05842678,-0.02661737,-0.032258008,0.05856797,0.016255358,-0.004884009,0.057611182,0.04888277,-0.014175139,-0.043629937,-0.018384755,-0.035071127,0.056006882,-0.05008437,0.010426426,-0.05723089,-0.037654188,-0.055189915,-0.051016282,0.000860011,-0.003298981,-0.05582273,-0.008965292,0.046811003,-0.03155081,-0.005804387,-0.03485013,0.05833578,-0.055059064,-0.040949993,0.05260943,-0.05685426,-0.033125915,0.056656558,-0.028658697,-0.05780864,0.057997562,0.05839423,0.01565121,0.05735407,-0.057610348,-0.011508655,0.040508803,0.05850924,-0.011471137,-0.046485804,-0.04901059,-0.027941205,-0.046634324,-0.019344516,0.003565941,-0.041318968,-0.021753078,0.05795147,-0.05078077,-0.03888868,0.058560424,0.04336984,0.056034815,0.021359617,0.05844292,0.058378015,0.057354517,-0.05655323,-0.019831635,0.055866655,0.03307229,-0.05423725,0.016424732,-0.008111041,-0.05759989,0.013117219,-0.05470745,-0.05058158,-0.04990199,-0.058375314,-0.053867344,-0.034880005,0.053718306,-0.002051805,0.05854655,0.02675683,-0.05856793,0.058507286,0.055658624,0.049769405,-0.00967954,-0.05066919,0.05362361,0.021247268,-0.026627371,-0.05741539,-0.03459864,0.025333807,-0.05372121,0.015600553,0.003447417,0.055011146,-0.042933043,-0.058198158,0.040244885,-0.03932957,-0.024126554,0.05830581,0.01530314,-0.04824365,0.058567975,-0.030423166,-0.03655997,0.019159619,0.03301311,0.052338462,0.057206463,0.04773046,0.026332768,-0.03892564,-0.013374751,0.049003482,0.017770061,0.053940754,0.05841246,0.046923026,0.05712693,0.03232515,-0.051666837,0.029591834,0.057297338,0.05840471,-0.046084367,-0.057789914,-0.027492905,-0.056638125,0.05776271,-0.054645456,-0.000377353,-0.043456458,0.057164684,-0.04745252,-0.050479658,0.05833072,-0.016732195,0.058123816,-0.04547311,0.053733803,-0.042592045,0.003106065,-0.05347041,-0.058559656,-0.053236157,-0.04211753,0.05805902,0.013005972,0.057064,-0.032768942,-0.021172097,-0.007274256,-0.036361024,0.048088573,-0.05590981,0.058552347,-0.005618688,0.030988898,-0.05699107,0.052329935,0.05663035,-0.055668037,-0.050655626,0.056232788,0.038628772,-0.05628834,0.006814248,0.03864812,-0.044157933,0.04947038,-0.002926258,-0.04255407,-0.05623758,0.0137544,0.01492465,0.04355311,0.03800297,0.050984528,0.057888076,0.027818633,-0.055689342,0.0546613,0.01708735,0.055398382,0.016895877,-0.03937363,-0.014292832,0.058482777,0.04830366,-0.058567874,-0.058565706,-0.046446566,0.022318019,-0.04730698,-0.058371536,0.047832955,-0.008327859,-0.058388434,0.045126203,0.030108614,-0.047341418,-0.058567878,-0.000450181,-0.054650728,-0.047836192,0.051394388,-0.05854904,-0.058118317,0.039733615,-0.045756858,-0.052197725,0.05855968,0.0430516,0.05528985,0.043549366,0.014590934,0.000522417,-0.057003267,-0.05856784,0.05119245,0.05116928,0.05270891,-0.011540547,0.056543637,-0.05759285,-0.05761621,0.056745343,0.048974387,-0.036853105,0.05674289,-0.041810054,-0.028877977,-0.023043903,0.055757992,0.051290736,0.044415295,0.044927847,0.056412663,-0.05753473,0.024484957,0.045649447,0.038669158,-0.057654846,0.001292936,-0.05848021,0.038122777,0.033673864,0.052664258,-0.032760724,0.051809188,-0.04043667,-0.04725207,0.03625299,0.028390238,0.057666473,0.04310447,-

"Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerases in Host-Pathogen Interactions, Inflammation, and Immunity","The literature review presented here details recent research involving members of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of proteins. Among the 17 recognized members of the family, the human enzyme PARP1 is the most extensively studied, resulting in a number of known biological and metabolic roles. This review is focused on the roles played by PARP enzymes in host-pathogen interactions and in diseases with an associated inflammatory response. In mammalian cells, several PARPs have specific roles in the antiviral response; this is perhaps best illustrated by PARP13, also termed the zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP). Plant stress responses and immunity are also regulated by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. PARPs promote inflammatory responses by stimulating proinflammatory signal transduction pathways that lead to the expression of cytokines and cell adhesion molecules. Hence, PARP inhibitors show promise in the treatment of inflammatory disorders and conditions with an inflammatory component, such as diabetes, arthritis, and stroke. These functions are correlated with the biophysical characteristics of PARP family enzymes. This work is important in providing a comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis of pathogenesis and host responses, as well as in the identification of inhibitors. This is important because the identification of inhibitors has been shown to be effective in arresting the progression of

Clinical characteristics and outcomes of human rhinovirus positivity in hospitalized children,"BACKGROUND: The clinical relevance of positive human rhinovirus (HRV) in hospitalized patients is unclear. Our objective was to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of HRV positivity in a heterogeneous population of hospitalized children, compared to those positive for another respiratory virus and those where no respiratory virus was detected. METHODS: A retrospective case–control study of children hospitalized between January 2014 to April 2015 who had a respiratory viral specimen collected. Clinical and laboratory data were collected, and baseline characteristics and clinical variables were compared. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 671 specimens obtained from 577 patients that were processed for the respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction assay, of which 198 were positive for HRV, 167 positive for another respiratory virus, and 306 where no respiratory virus was detected. A history of asthma was significantly associated with HRV-positive patients (odds ratio [OR] 3.71; P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, HRV-positive patients had a higher requirement for mechanical ventilation (OR 1.44), lower rates of readmission (OR 0.53), and lower mortality (OR 0.35) compared to patients with no respiratory virus isolated; however, none were statistically significant. HRV-positive patients did have a significantly shorter length of stay (LOS) compared with patients with no respiratory virus isolated (difference–0.35; P = 0.001). Similar outcomes were seen in patients positive for other respiratory viruses. CONCLUSIONS: HRV-positive hospitalized pediatric patients with a heterogeneous set of clinical diagnoses had higher association with asthma compared to patients who had another, or no, respiratory virus isolated. HRV-positive patients had shorter LOS compared to patients who had no respiratory viruses isolated. These findings suggest that HRV positivity in hospitalized pediatric patients may not lead to adverse clinical outcomes, although asthma is a risk factor regardless of clinical comorbidities and diagnoses. Further research is warranted to understand the predisposition of asthma to HRV positivity.",-0.056039024,0.054429173,-0.055838257,0.047359142,0.042528074,0.03432446,0.054985918,-0.049714275,-0.016779426,-0.032240152,0.056216944,0.053668804,0.023834366,-0.010776642,0.055362806,-0.05310808,-0.056216944,-0.052044306,-0.04936031,-0.037864737,0.0554433,-0.041023042,-0.000817988,0.041799054,-0.05078815,-0.016547788,-0.031887673,0.04915842,0.03639744,-0.045901902,0.037915234,0.056216944,-0.035390258,0.031368673,0.028006885,-0.055706702,-0.056089576,-0.050141644,-0.05602091,-0.006307717,-0.003708823,0.055102043,-0.049771648,0.020860413,-0.009102112,0.038662933,-0.003855097,0.055331573,0.05209224,-0.020774627,-0.052243635,-0.038116977,-0.05621202,-0.034104425,-0.05576634,0.05214755,-0.054609917,0.02508722,0.05557634,0.052401606,-0.0377046,-0.023421893,-0.021383142,-0.03581249,0.045451444,-0.049128078,0.04093994,-0.052696552,0.05407918,0.001557826,0.012498253,0.052555844,-0.036876146,0.055776715,-0.001008009,-0.03269857,-0.038877863,0.023324993,-0.05616293,-0.016327435,0.05617394,0.051596735,0.054681603,0.056100402,-0.05518498,0.05603791,-0.023706945,0.018714024,0.033246852,-0.05621568,-0.036112793,-0.007568831,-0.0493894,0.025429802,-0.004117038,0.0438747,-0.024162685,0.05515823,0.055694528,-0.027907118,-0.05569946,-0.036353897,-0.048327267,0.04289064,0.041984692,0.004492799,0.048522882,0.05501038,-0.034752667,0.005605314,-0.031526078,0.022900952,0.05132095,0.045560446,0.05607807,0.03444708,-0.011215883,-0.015381873,0.0555278,0.03467121,-0.048951548,0.05206141,-0.008037983,-0.02869594,0.03656672,0.032667506,-0.055683617,-0.04685435,0.025836248,0.028759832,-0.0554198,0.056216944,0.04182245,0.007046832,0.017198678,-0.05467693,0.055597384,0.052052047,-0.028331086,-0.037318755,-0.04598982,0.05621691,-0.05495475,-0.041931685,-0.023145033,-0.020938074,0.02451869,-0.04954198,0.055890024,-0.05550674,0.047640093,-0.010286761,-0.055013,-0.055591963,0.05040086,0.046232518,-0.015583836,0.03746604,-0.002804708,-0.052869678,-0.020579576,-0.03675451,-0.049042832,0.048678555,-0.009916377,-0.056117844,-0.015034026,-0.020078463,-0.047184028,-0.054891128,-0.045498777,-0.056216944,-0.05614972,0.055824686,-0.04925308,-0.001684782,0.054483857,-0.040295813,0.05562599,-0.054979537,-0.042549293,0.01947148,-0.048835427,0.05049362,0.056014583,0.030170342,-0.046848334,-0.05040114,0.056123238,0.05396305,0.053813215,-0.05607801,-0.03737253,0.021493828,0.055045485,-0.03650349,-0.041220225,0.055088565,0.017413396,-0.030513989,-0.038160175,0.052152436,-0.054862775,-0.024367869,0.04091803,-0.05601717,-0.021019468,-0.042066004,0.036706492,0.0553506,0.054275785,-0.002753365,0.01655491,0.050831262,-0.054302912,0.05397778,0.04746138,0.0497395,0.035015278,0.046306305,-0.030740863,0.03035884,0.054638054,-0.044081908,-0.005377331,0.04065087,-0.054737803,-0.05620676,0.040500887,0.055986013,0.052829567,0.056206103,0.050697606,-0.056212995,0.05317982,0.027395109,0.016850261,0.019241435,-0.0421254,0.03159857,0.03151455,0.047794595,-0.054170117,-0.056189284,0.05576479,-0.04348464,-0.055918947,0.050195705,0.052920595,-0.056135643,0.054865967,0.01966032,-0.052377515,-0.039984062,0.055956542,-0.032763533,-0.055950146,0.056216944,0.031046486,0.046401087,0.0495973,0.047933426,0.047590993,-0.019667227,-0.05501929,-0.013085805,-0.000851411,0.014527415,-0.04673454,0.05410818,-0.026330313,0.056208283,0.024846828,-0.056205247,0.031480264,-0.05243185,-0.026797244,0.01706621,0.05571847,-0.05559866,-0.050114278,-0.009987687,-0.01498619,0.045105033,0.022528296,0.027047634,-0.044945672,0.010955275,-0.035336502,0.041827064,0.004951667,0.05032421,0.056139417,-0.056197245,-0.05559154,-0.04448733,0.03958785,-0.055729676,0.031374026,0.046754453,0.02181142,0.0480864,-0.04540102,-0.040972877,-0.056080054,0.020898947,0.052571047,-0.04999638,0.055613223,0.014885093,-0.055914506,-0.05499442,-0.055149663,-0.033217765,0.05503189,-0.055490173,-0.04382944,-0.04897164,0.056197003,0.0549632,-0.038225275,-0.02939527,0.055806547,-0.048206247,-0.053113364,0.0562143,-0.052201252,-0.05370623,-0.056216847,-0.046994716,0.048575852,0.056150798,0.025407469,0.05621506,0.05008232,0.029687975,-0.048512958,0.054734055,-0.024669476,0.04939577,-0.04120356,-0.007756738,0.056213845,0.056156024,-0.055791263,-0.05619288,-0.012092233,0.05513796,-0.056024864,-0.05621368,0.055956148,0.021387527,-0.013105059,0.04966562,0.05604263,-0.038874142,-0.05621671,-0.051993776,0.036895152,-0.03782358,0.05434942,-0.026837578,-0.055076137,0.05334861,-0.03780168,-0.049542803,0.05618342,0.013165565,0.003357299,-0.055057738,0.054504912,0.055014674,-0.050345086,-0.033671875,0.056176264,0.055765133,0.05613023,-0.0155177,0.04168762,-0.054749023,-0.03919486,0.014980254,-0.010267164,0.05015709,0.05359562,0.00239749,-0.014846991,-0.055926833,-0.03327434,0.016373971,0.032569744,0.05619051,-0.043450616,-0.046272915,-0.047020383,0.01960271,-0.04942863,-0.055965528,0.054832224,-0.056208797,-0.0545245,0.051755186,0.056103997,0.05122831,0.036070246,-0.020777995,0.014882667,0.044084,0.055001743,-0.033619136,0.05113402,

The HIV Integrase Inhibitor Raltegravir Inhibits Felid Alphaherpesvirus 1 Replication by Targeting both DNA Replication and Late Gene Expression,"Alphaherpesvirus-associated ocular infections in humans caused by human alphaherpesvirus 1 (HHV-1) remain challenging to treat due to the frequency of drug application required and the potential for the selection of drug-resistant viruses. Repurposing on-the-market drugs is a viable strategy to accelerate the pace of drug development. It has been reported that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) integrase inhibitor raltegravir inhibits HHV-1 replication by targeting the DNA polymerase accessory factor and limits terminase-mediated genome cleavage of human betaherpesvirus 5 (HHV-5). We have previously shown, both in vitro and in vivo, that raltegravir can also inhibit the replication of felid alphaherpesvirus 1 (FeHV-1), a common ocular pathogen of cats with a pathogenesis similar to that of HHV-1 ocular disease. In contrast to what was reported for HHV-1, we were unable to select for a raltegravir-resistant FeHV-1 strain in order to define any basis for drug action. A candidate-based approach to explore the mode of action of raltegravir against FeHV-1 showed that raltegravir did not impact FeHV-1 terminase function, as described for HHV-5. Instead, raltegravir inhibited DNA replication, similarly to HHV-1, but by targeting the initiation of viral DNA replication rather than elongation. In addition, we found that raltegravir specifically repressed late gene expression independently of DNA replication, and both activities are consistent with inhibition of ICP8. Taken together, these results suggest that raltegravir could be a valuable therapeutic agent against herpesviruses. IMPORTANCE The rise of drug-resistant herpesviruses is a longstanding concern, particularly among immunocompromised patients. Therefore, therapies targeting viral proteins other than the DNA polymerase that may be less likely to lead to drug-resistant viruses are urgently needed. Using FeHV-1, an alphaherpesvirus closely related to HHV-1 that similarly causes ocular herpes in its natural host, we found that the HIV integrase inhibitor raltegravir targets different stages of the virus life cycle beyond DNA replication and that it does so without developing drug resistance under the conditions tested. This shows that the drug could provide a viable strategy for the treatment of herpesvirus infections.",-0.020932896,0.026864693,-0.008913475,-0.018300721,-0.004738724,0.06001848,0.053139713,-0.046180815,0.05752342,0.014912094,0.06091672,0.046684984,-0.006932989,0.023006022,0.058499444,-0.060759906,-0.060916398,-0.055017997,0.05996661,0.053439204,-0.060381796,-0.048787907,-0.055645127,0.048201513,0.052009717,0.054839395,-0.00811432,-0.03199665,-0.05549094,-0.001546389,0.05598824,0.060916938,-0.021167219,0.023365036,0.048514124,-0.031067047,-0.06023403,-0.025053691,-0.030226499,0.014237369,-0.000463618,0.013716373,0.029716758,-0.010144434,-0.012835703,-0.03932373,-0.013341262,0.021144677,0.04844634,-0.01618246,-0.030654661,0.054162856,-0.058125764,0.05203356,-0.060503885,-0.025045315,-0.054281253,-0.05103219,0.060779583,0.032478347,-0.014736333,-0.04586912,0.01867947,-0.052532353,-0.043558106,-0.06039695,0.06007635,0.035647415,0.002234781,0.009520494,-0.026078587,0.011578659,0.036592424,0.05032153,-0.025415521,0.005411028,0.059883382,0.013529521,-0.060802,0.056067046,-0.057892475,0.060847305,0.026392028,-0.007868491,-0.038770825,0.0532663,0.002610695,0.052657504,-0.049942404,0.01590134,-0.02109642,-0.057477556,-0.05912847,0.015824791,0.05375306,0.054028645,0.051113103,0.05932443,0.060909983,-0.059214115,-0.015671177,0.054363046,-0.05200941,0.031414255,0.017963905,0.04292361,0.025915299,-0.018877232,0.020481238,0.011204163,-0.042533983,0.013459203,0.050098233,0.054497883,0.060512632,0.002864841,-0.055763047,-0.03799602,0.057385426,0.0218532,-0.033039477,0.060228508,0.030192662,-0.0530521,0.045803845,0.02058429,-0.035221104,-0.037962746,0.035910748,0.053562008,-0.041043043,0.060916957,0.0591269,-0.055569377,0.03718948,-0.05259629,-0.005502156,0.048165545,-0.05901376,-0.034743723,0.06078083,0.0609157,-0.060704246,-0.04433595,0.004811907,-0.052813433,-0.005372921,-0.060527742,0.049838223,0.01728923,-0.000871052,-0.05574654,-0.012630333,0.021627013,0.0609168,0.006638747,0.059164833,0.047511555,0.05783091,0.0474541,-0.04071804,0.020200297,0.019404877,0.05534381,-0.052818753,-0.034173064,-0.054957014,0.055592913,-0.05662248,-0.054652147,-0.056599483,-0.060887914,0.01622033,0.049149938,0.03987995,0.020298487,0.013481932,-0.05671204,0.06006266,-0.04824496,0.011776294,0.05699086,-0.04768484,-0.010658188,0.056848407,-0.052745502,0.020130223,0.02012293,0.059044845,0.011082104,0.028142055,0.015234515,-0.027226252,0.006540014,0.060780704,-0.016553998,-0.045760438,0.031629384,0.023284521,-0.057874084,-0.055440012,0.05799015,0.008187241,-0.031215463,0.047336847,-0.043247446,-0.01687705,0.049976893,0.037031464,0.060818687,0.040874492,0.048060853,0.057765134,0.060152244,-0.055981033,0.040250797,-0.040142905,0.048126824,-0.048461977,-0.037428457,0.047233827,0.011064814,-0.04084916,-0.030753832,0.02024605,0.011429573,-0.060913198,-0.058519814,-0.019760698,0.05295082,0.05915704,0.060190175,0.059558436,-0.06091664,0.059660763,0.011753485,0.03913729,-0.050032094,-0.036047645,0.057615757,0.04851717,0.055908404,-0.053800892,0.053050924,0.04644453,-0.038177785,-0.060153045,0.05319475,0.03855626,-0.058881596,-0.05908641,0.015492667,-0.012882073,0.0420319,0.06085894,-0.018212536,-0.059201248,0.060916957,-0.052739013,-0.060345266,0.022361318,0.045201495,0.050818756,0.055459816,-0.000647567,0.030948633,-0.057397723,-0.05702187,0.04911891,0.03864828,0.054456443,0.060651056,-0.05862524,-0.06072182,0.020683352,-0.053076368,0.059532143,0.014895706,0.060675677,-0.058329925,0.002934151,-0.05895371,-0.05017367,0.049530797,-0.05177633,-0.004112791,-0.052565105,0.016372312,-0.014711838,-0.011252089,0.060877375,0.022916745,0.06090415,-0.058371622,0.060718715,-0.05007024,-0.056062963,-0.050003942,-0.060825095,-0.010490991,-0.048179336,0.06020021,0.028636811,0.05543033,-0.048158545,-0.023843642,-0.051043883,-0.045275416,0.050086055,-0.007732769,0.03649937,-0.056932367,0.041289702,-0.06033332,0.060473014,-0.04235775,0.008332456,-0.051543973,0.05365427,0.04156393,-0.05848667,0.05879549,0.030649712,-0.024333213,0.005518884,0.06040108,0.026051922,-0.060398784,-0.011317606,-0.02309895,0.011021694,0.044875614,0.04590585,0.059842445,-0.04666044,0.038097594,-0.036838282,-0.010549059,-0.001264066,-0.035142474,0.048371647,-0.017669985,0.056603696,0.051957875,-0.060913403,-0.060915608,-0.008823135,0.00454967,-0.025272734,-0.05835903,-0.019299343,-0.003014745,-0.050780803,0.032829717,0.00605328,-0.004323322,-0.060916215,-0.034226306,-0.054310054,-0.010183257,-0.017999146,-0.060754627,-0.060028132,0.059196074,0.024283493,-0.043855794,0.06088379,0.058093626,0.006680466,0.004271814,0.03921175,-0.05618052,-0.052928634,-0.060896724,0.06078042,0.032512475,0.05834722,-0.013734322,0.030957049,-0.059721455,-0.034768157,0.05846809,0.05999996,0.010271857,0.048352074,-0.057536192,0.044604275,-0.050526742,0.055969317,0.03288818,-0.001871215,-0.058469675,0.05896731,-0.054013878,-0.03157988,0.060080197,-0.010105401,-0.05772301,0.04894308,-0.047200233,-0.010579634,0.025251163,-0.029974392,-0.043907143,0.049411815,-0.059955083,-0.033173516,0.03959069,0.0463289,0.0561

Contribution of a Multifunctional Polymerase Region of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus to Lethal Mutagenesis,"Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) are major determinants of high mutation rates and generation of mutant spectra that mediate RNA virus adaptability. The RdRp of the picornavirus foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), termed 3D, is a multifunctional protein that includes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in its N-terminal region. Previous studies documented that some amino acid substitutions within the NLS altered nucleotide recognition and enhanced the incorporation of the mutagenic purine analogue ribavirin in viral RNA, but the mutants tested were not viable and their response to lethal mutagenesis could not be studied. Here we demonstrate that NLS amino acid substitution M16A of FMDV serotype C does not affect infectious virus production but accelerates ribavirin-mediated virus extinction. The mutant 3D displays polymerase activity, RNA binding, and copying processivity that are similar to those of the wild-type enzyme but shows increased ribavirin-triphosphate incorporation. Crystal structures of the mutant 3D in the apo and RNA-bound forms reveal an expansion of the template entry channel due to the replacement of the bulky Met by Ala. This is a major difference with other 3D mutants with altered nucleotide analogue recognition. Remarkably, two distinct loop β9-α11 conformations distinguish 3Ds that exhibit higher or lower ribavirin incorporation than the wild-type enzyme. This difference identifies a specific molecular determinant of ribavirin sensitivity of FMDV. Comparison of several polymerase mutants indicates that different domains of the molecule can modify nucleotide recognition and response to lethal mutagenesis. The connection of this observation with current views on quasispecies adaptability is discussed. IMPORTANCE The nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) polymerase includes residues that modulate the sensitivity to mutagenic agents. Here we have described a viable NLS mutant with an amino acid replacement that facilitates virus extinction by ribavirin. The corresponding polymerase shows increased incorporation of ribavirin triphosphate and local structural modifications that implicate the template entry channel. Specifically, comparison of the structures of ribavirin-sensitive and ribavirin-resistant FMDV polymerases has identified loop β9-α11 conformation as a determinant of sensitivity to ribavirin

Respiratory viruses in returning Hajj & Umrah pilgrims with acute respiratory illness in 2014-2015,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Respiratory tract infections are common among Hajj and Umrah pilgrims which pose a public health risk of spread of respiratory infections. Influenza has been reported from Indian Hajj and Umrah returning pilgrims, but data on other respiratory pathogens are sparse in India. Here we report the presence of common respiratory viral pathogens in returning Hajj and Umrah pilgrims suffering from acute respiratory illness (ARI) in 2014-2015. METHODS: Respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and throat swabs) were collected from 300 consenting pilgrims with ARI in the past one week and tested for influenza and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and other respiratory viruses using in-house standardized quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Clinical features among the pathogen positive and negative patients were compared. The patients received symptomatic treatment and antivirals where appropriate and were followed telephonically to collect data on illness outcome. RESULTS: Ninety seven (32.3%) of the 300 participants were tested positive for any virus, most common being influenza viruses (n=33, 11%). Other respiratory viruses that were detected included human coronaviruses [n=26, 8.7%; OC43 (n=19, 6.3%) and C229E (n=7, 2.3%)], rhinovirus (n=20, 6%), adenoviruses (n=8, 2.6%), parainfluenza viruses (n=7, 2.3%), respiratory syncytial virus (n=3, 1%) and bocaviruses (n=2, 0.6%). Clinical features observed in pathogen positive and pathogen negative patients did not differ significantly. Eighteen influenza positive patients were treated with oseltamivir. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Pilgrims returning from mass gatherings are often afflicted with respiratory pathogens with a potential to facilitate transmission of respiratory pathogens across international borders. The study reinforces the need for better infection prevention and control measures such as vaccination, health education on cough etiquette and hand

Strand-Specific Dual RNA Sequencing of Bronchial Epithelial Cells Infected with Influenza A/H3N2 Viruses Reveals Splicing of Gene Segment 6 and Novel Host-Virus Interactions,"Host-influenza virus interplay at the transcript level has been extensively characterized in epithelial cells. Yet, there are no studies that simultaneously characterize human host and influenza A virus (IAV) genomes. We infected human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells with two seasonal IAV/H3N2 strains, Brisbane/10/07 and Perth/16/09 (reference strains for past vaccine seasons) and the well-characterized laboratory strain Udorn/307/72. Strand-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of the infected BEAS-2B cells allowed for simultaneous analysis of host and viral transcriptomes, in addition to pathogen genomes, to reveal changes in mRNA expression and alternative splicing (AS). In general, patterns of global and immune gene expression induced by the three IAVs were mostly shared. However, AS of host transcripts and small nuclear RNAs differed between the seasonal and laboratory strains. Analysis of viral transcriptomes showed deletions of the polymerase components (defective interfering-like RNAs) within the genome. Surprisingly, we found that the neuraminidase gene undergoes AS and that the splicing event differs between seasonal and laboratory strains. Our findings reveal novel elements of the host-virus interaction and highlight the importance of RNA-seq in identifying molecular changes at the genome level that may contribute to shaping RNA-based innate immunity. IMPORTANCE The use of massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has revealed insights into human and pathogen genomes and their evolution. Dual RNA-seq allows simultaneous dissection of host and pathogen genomes and strand-specific RNA-seq provides information about the polarity of the RNA. This is important in the case of negative-strand RNA viruses like influenza virus, which generate positive (complementary and mRNA) and negative-strand RNAs (genome) that differ in their potential to trigger innate immunity. Here, we characterize interactions between human bronchial epithelial cells and three influenza A/H3N2 strains using strand-specific dual RNA-seq. We focused on this subtype because of its epidemiological importance in causing significant morbidity and mortality during influenza epidemics. We report novel elements that differ between seasonal and laboratory strains highlighting the complexity of the host-virus interplay at the RNA

Orally Efficacious Broad-Spectrum Ribonucleoside Analog Inhibitor of Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Viruses,"Morbidity and mortality resulting from influenza-like disease are a threat, especially for older adults. To improve case management, next-generation broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics that are efficacious against major drivers of influenza-like disease, including influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), are urgently needed. Using a dual-pathogen high-throughput screening protocol for influenza A virus (IAV) and RSV inhibitors, we have identified N(4)-hydroxycytidine (NHC) as a potent inhibitor of RSV, influenza B viruses, and IAVs of human, avian, and swine origins. Biochemical in vitro polymerase assays and viral RNA sequencing revealed that the ribonucleotide analog is incorporated into nascent viral RNAs in place of cytidine, increasing the frequency of viral mutagenesis. Viral passaging in cell culture in the presence of an inhibitor did not induce robust resistance. Pharmacokinetic profiling demonstrated dose-dependent oral bioavailability of 36 to 56%, sustained levels of the active 5′-triphosphate anabolite in primary human airway cells and mouse lung tissue, and good tolerability after extended dosing at 800 mg/kg of body weight/day. The compound was orally efficacious against RSV and both seasonal and highly pathogenic avian IAVs in mouse models, reducing lung virus loads and alleviating disease biomarkers. Oral dosing reduced IAV burdens in a guinea pig transmission model and suppressed virus spread to uninfected contact animals through direct transmission. Based on its broad-spectrum efficacy and pharmacokinetic properties, NHC is a promising candidate for future clinical development as a treatment option for influenza-like

Human Norovirus NS3 Has RNA Helicase and Chaperoning Activities,"RNA-remodeling proteins, including RNA helicases and chaperones, act to remodel RNA structures and/or protein-RNA interactions and are required for all processes involving RNAs. Although many viruses encode RNA helicases and chaperones, their in vitro activities and their roles in infected cells largely remain elusive. Noroviruses are a diverse group of positive-strand RNA viruses in the family Caliciviridae and constitute a significant and potentially fatal threat to human health. Here, we report that the protein NS3 encoded by human norovirus has both ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity that unwinds RNA helices and ATP-independent RNA-chaperoning activity that can remodel structured RNAs and facilitate strand annealing. Moreover, NS3 can facilitate viral RNA synthesis in vitro by norovirus polymerase. NS3 may therefore play an important role in norovirus RNA replication. Lastly, we demonstrate that the RNA-remodeling activity of NS3 is inhibited by guanidine hydrochloride, an FDA-approved compound, and, more importantly, that it reduces the replication of the norovirus replicon in cultured human cells. Altogether, these findings are the first to demonstrate the presence of RNA-remodeling activities encoded by Caliciviridae and highlight the functional significance of NS3 in the noroviral life cycle. IMPORTANCE Noroviruses are a diverse group of positive-strand RNA viruses, which annually cause hundreds of millions of human infections and over 200,000 deaths worldwide. For RNA viruses, cellular or virus-encoded RNA helicases and/or chaperones have long been considered to play pivotal roles in viral life cycles. However, neither RNA helicase nor chaperoning activity has been demonstrated to be associated with any norovirus-encoded proteins, and it is also unknown whether norovirus replication requires the participation of any viral or cellular RNA helicases/chaperones. We found that a norovirus protein, NS3, not only has ATP-dependent helicase activity, but also acts as an ATP-independent RNA chaperone. Also, NS3 can facilitate in vitro viral RNA synthesis, suggesting the important role of NS3 in norovirus replication.

β-d-N(4)-Hydroxycytidine Is a Potent Anti-alphavirus Compound That Induces a High Level of Mutations in the Viral Genome,"Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a representative member of the New World alphaviruses. It is transmitted by mosquito vectors and causes highly debilitating disease in humans, equids, and other vertebrate hosts. Despite a continuous public health threat, very few compounds with anti-VEEV activity in cell culture and in mouse models have been identified to date, and rapid development of virus resistance to some of them has been recorded. In this study, we investigated the possibility of using a modified nucleoside analog, β-d-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (NHC), as an anti-VEEV agent and defined the mechanism of its anti-VEEV activity. The results demonstrate that NHC is a very potent antiviral agent. It affects both the release of genome RNA-containing VEE virions and their infectivity. Both of these antiviral activities are determined by the NHC-induced accumulation of mutations in virus-specific RNAs. The antiviral effect is most prominent when NHC is applied early in the infectious process, during the amplification of negative- and positive-strand RNAs in infected cells. Most importantly, only a low-level resistance of VEEV to NHC can be developed, and it requires acquisition and cooperative function of more than one mutation in nsP4. These adaptive mutations are closely located in the same segment of nsP4. Our data suggest that NHC is more potent than ribavirin as an anti-VEEV agent and likely can be used to treat other alphavirus infections. IMPORTANCE Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) can cause widespread epidemics among humans and domestic animals. VEEV infections result in severe meningoencephalitis and long-term sequelae. No approved therapeutics exist for treatment of VEEV infections. Our study demonstrates that β-d-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (NHC) is a very potent anti-VEEV compound, with the 50% effective concentration being below 1 μM. The mechanism of NHC antiviral activity is based on induction of high mutation rates in the viral genome. Accordingly, NHC treatment affects both the rates of particle release and the particle infectivity. Most importantly, in contrast to most of the anti-alphavirus drugs that are under development, resistance of VEEV to NHC develops very inefficiently. Even low levels of resistance require acquisition of multiple mutations in the gene of the VEEV-specific RNA-dependent RNA polymerase

Zinc Salts Block Hepatitis E Virus Replication by Inhibiting the Activity of Viral RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes an acute, self-limiting hepatitis in healthy individuals and leads to chronic disease in immunocompromised individuals. HEV infection in pregnant women results in a more severe outcome, with the mortality rate going up to 30%. Though the virus usually causes sporadic infection, epidemics have been reported in developing and resource-starved countries. No specific antiviral exists against HEV. A combination of interferon and ribavirin therapy has been used to control the disease with some success. Zinc is an essential micronutrient that plays crucial roles in multiple cellular processes. Zinc salts are known to be effective in reducing infections caused by few viruses. Here, we investigated the effect of zinc salts on HEV replication. In a human hepatoma cell (Huh7) culture model, zinc salts inhibited the replication of genotype 1 (g-1) and g-3 HEV replicons and g-1 HEV infectious genomic RNA in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis of a replication-defective mutant of g-1 HEV genomic RNA under similar conditions ruled out the possibility of zinc salts acting on replication-independent processes. An ORF4-Huh7 cell line-based infection model of g-1 HEV further confirmed the above observations. Zinc salts did not show any effect on the entry of g-1 HEV into the host cell. Furthermore, our data reveal that zinc salts directly inhibit the activity of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), leading to inhibition of viral replication. Taken together, these studies unravel the ability of zinc salts in inhibiting HEV replication, suggesting their possible therapeutic value in controlling HEV infection. IMPORTANCE Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a public health concern in resource-starved countries due to frequent outbreaks. It is also emerging as a health concern in developed countries owing to its ability to cause acute and chronic infection in organ transplant and immunocompromised individuals. Although antivirals such as ribavirin have been used to treat HEV cases, there are known side effects and limitations of such therapy. Our discovery of the ability of zinc salts to block HEV replication by virtue of their ability to inhibit the activity of viral RdRp is important because these findings pave the way to test the efficacy of zinc supplementation therapy in HEV-infected patients.

Zinc Finger-Containing Cellular Transcription Corepressor ZBTB25 Promotes Influenza Virus RNA Transcription and Is a Target for Zinc Ejector Drugs,"Influenza A virus (IAV) replication relies on an intricate interaction between virus and host cells. How the cellular proteins are usurped for IAV replication remains largely obscure. The aim of this study was to search for novel and potential cellular factors that participate in IAV replication. ZBTB25, a transcription repressor of a variety of cellular genes, was identified by an RNA interference (RNAi) genomic library screen. Depletion of ZBTB25 significantly reduced IAV production. Conversely, overexpression of ZBTB25 enhanced it. ZBTB25 interacted with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein and modulated its transcription activity. In addition, ZBTB25 also functioned as a viral RNA (vRNA)-binding protein, binding preferentially to the U-rich sequence within the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of vRNA. Both protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions involving ZBTB25 facilitated viral RNA transcription and replication. In addition, ZBTB25 suppressed interferon production, further enhancing viral replication. ZBTB25-associated functions required an intact zinc finger domain and posttranslational SUMO-1 modification of ZBTB25. Furthermore, treatment with disulfiram (a zinc ejector) of ZBTB25-overexpressing cells showed significantly reduced IAV production as a result of reduced RNA synthesis. Our findings indicate that IAV usurps ZBTB25 for IAV RNA synthesis and serves as a novel and potential therapeutic antiviral target. IMPORTANCE IAV-induced seasonal influenza causes severe illness and death in high-risk populations. However, IAV has developed resistance to current antiviral drugs due to its high mutation rate. Therefore, development of drugs targeting cellular factors required for IAV replication is an attractive alternative for IAV therapy. Here, we discovered a cellular protein, ZBTB25, that enhances viral RdRp activity by binding to both viral RdRp and viral RNA to stimulate viral RNA synthesis. A unique feature of ZBTB25 in the regulation of viral replication is its dual transcription functions, namely, promoting viral RNA transcription through binding to the U-rich region of vRNA and suppressing cellular interferon production. ZBTB25 contains a zinc finger domain that is required for RNA-inhibitory activity by chelating zinc ions. Disulfiram treatment disrupts the zinc finger functions, effectively repressing IAV replication. Based on our findings, we demonstrate that ZBTB25 regulates IAV RNA transcription and replication and serves as a promising antiviral target for IAV

Novel Alphacoronaviruses and Paramyxoviruses Cocirculate with Type 1 and Severe Acute Respiratory System (SARS)-Related Betacoronaviruses in Synanthropic Bats of Luxembourg,"Several infectious disease outbreaks with high mortality in humans have been attributed to viruses that are thought to have evolved from bat viruses. In this study from Luxembourg, the genetic diversity and epidemiology of paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses shed by the bat species Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and Myotis emarginatus were evaluated. Feces collection (n = 624) was performed longitudinally in a mixed-species colony in 2015 and 2016. In addition, feces (n = 254) were collected cross-sectionally from six Myotis emarginatus colonies in 2016. By use of degenerate primers in a nested format, overall prevalences of 1.1% (10/878) and 4.9% (43/878) were determined for paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses. Sequences of the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and spike glycoprotein genes of coronaviruses, as well as sequences of the partial L gene of paramyxoviruses, were obtained. Novel paramyxovirus and Alphacoronavirus strains were identified in different Myotis emarginatus colonies, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related Betacoronavirus strains were shed by Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. Logistic regression revealed that the level of Alphacoronavirus shedding was highest in July (odds ratio, 2.8; P < 0.01), probably due to periparturient stress. Phylogenetic analyses point to close virus-host coevolution, and the high genetic similarity of the study strains suggests that the Myotis emarginatus colonies in Luxembourg are socially connected. Most interestingly, we show that bats also host Betacoronavirus 1 strains. The high similarity of the spike gene sequences of these viruses with mammalian Betacoronavirus 1 strains may be of concern. Both the SARS-related and Betacoronavirus 1 strains detected in bats in Luxembourg may cross the species barrier after a host adaptation process. IMPORTANCE Bats are a natural reservoir of a number of zoonotic pathogens. Several severe outbreaks in humans (e.g., a Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia in 1998, and the almost global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003) have been caused by bat-borne viruses that were transmitted to humans mostly after virus adaptation (e.g., in intermediate animal hosts). Despite the indigenousness of bat species that host viruses with suspected zoonotic potential and despite the zoonotic transmission of European bat 1 lyssavirus in Luxembourg, knowledge about the diversity and epidemiology of bat viruses remains limited in this country. Moreover, in contrast to other European countries, bat viruses are currently not included in the national surveillance activities of this land-locked country. We suggest that this gap in disease surveillance should be addressed, since we show here that synanthropic bats host viruses that may be able to cross the species

Partially Uncleaved Alphavirus Replicase Forms Spherule Structures in the Presence and Absence of RNA Template,"Alphaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses expressing their replicase as a polyprotein, P1234, which is cleaved to four final products, nonstructural proteins nsP1 to nsP4. The replicase proteins together with viral RNA and host factors form membrane invaginations termed spherules, which act as the replication complexes producing progeny RNAs. We have previously shown that the wild-type alphavirus replicase requires a functional RNA template and active polymerase to generate spherule structures. However, we now find that specific partially processed forms of the replicase proteins alone can give rise to membrane invaginations in the absence of RNA or replication. The minimal requirement for spherule formation was the expression of properly cleaved nsP4, together with either uncleaved P123 or with the combination of nsP1 and uncleaved P23. These inactive spherules were morphologically less regular than replication-induced spherules. In the presence of template, nsP1 plus uncleaved P23 plus nsP4 could efficiently assemble active replication spherules producing both negative-sense and positive-sense RNA strands. P23 alone did not have membrane affinity, but could be recruited to membrane sites in the presence of nsP1 and nsP4. These results define the set of viral components required for alphavirus replication complex assembly and suggest the possibility that it could be reconstituted from separately expressed nonstructural proteins. IMPORTANCE All positive-strand RNA viruses extensively modify host cell membranes to serve as efficient platforms for viral RNA replication. Alphaviruses and several other groups induce protective membrane invaginations (spherules) as their genome factories. Most positive-strand viruses produce their replicase as a polyprotein precursor, which is further processed through precise and regulated cleavages. We show here that specific cleavage intermediates of the alphavirus replicase can give rise to spherule structures in the absence of viral RNA. In the presence of template RNA, the same intermediates yield active replication complexes. Thus, partially cleaved replicase proteins play key roles that connect replication complex assembly, membrane deformation, and the different stages of RNA synthesis.",-0.021902844,-0.044811424,-0.019300465,-0.02274808,0.056667186,0.057948686,0.055113267,0.01646843,0.001142672,0.054774858,0.058228087,0.006072776,-0.054828696,0.012895254,0.05251597,-0.058249984,-0.056767352,-0.054891065,0.05055592,0.03035257,0.018730052,0.05334645,-0.056872968,0.05680246,0.011895596,0.014005342,0.04749351,-0.027093856,-0.04725449,-0.046149343,0.057172082,0.056467265,0.004166117,-0.053864148,0.046306677,0.002419967,-0.006802662,0.04887596,-0.054507382,0.018272478,-0.012215982,-0.057026614,0.0442193,-0.05714053,0.05819852,-0.051576786,-0.045107923,-0.051629473,0.019977931,-0.045845557,-0.054034565,0.052524235,-0.054746572,-0.052343603,-0.0144605,-0.025309458,-0.055331897,0.022590933,0.049539167,-0.04926679,0.005198624,-0.04427477,0.05542089,-0.047582433,0.040812515,-0.05798616,0.05593225,-0.050714597,0.057538405,-0.031105973,0.037186015,0.053456392,0.017573742,0.0525484,-0.037251666,-0.026986977,0.057965968,0.020500608,-0.04025643,0.051147494,-0.058119867,0.05825328,-0.04872771,-0.056794744,-0.056996312,0.056666113,-0.022213457,0.03805785,-0.041817162,0.013143642,0.027859893,-0.0523339,-0.05778159,0.025579402,0.039848346,0.047525875,0.053942747,0.058123954,0.05825663,-0.05641613,-0.017029969,0.019475767,-0.036119513,-0.029283667,-0.029423153,0.05665655,0.039956573,0.016158115,-0.04097702,-0.039583206,-0.020579612,0.055228233,-0.009600378,0.045381114,0.05813333,-0.007453986,-0.05749758,0.026867727,-0.036817927,-0.023898298,-0.058071308,0.05825209,0.029031921,-0.037722066,0.050808515,0.05306331,-0.05149278,-0.016315104,0.003858744,0.03112385,-0.029954223,0.058260355,0.054771993,-0.015496696,-0.0189243,-0.039483137,0.034920108,0.02227988,-0.04786839,0.03877566,-0.02062559,0.05826026,-0.051718604,-0.023959966,-0.054523133,-0.05756539,0.009383271,-0.057786934,-0.050461356,0.023276012,0.041084703,-0.058214426,-0.038465235,-0.024047218,0.05826037,0.040107574,-0.046791527,0.022082984,0.043589167,-0.000346674,0.02675691,-0.03774019,-0.025420422,0.05469587,-0.02316794,0.025101561,-0.05193198,-0.043485116,-0.03370378,-0.05241321,-0.031739846,0.025308985,-0.055605337,0.035771005,0.05434628,0.014663822,0.04001996,-0.047661033,0.058187414,-0.057751115,-0.011234563,0.05699262,0.008524848,0.038690187,0.031532522,-0.04270427,-0.058189053,0.057284106,0.045324445,-0.048957475,0.051084902,-0.056391727,0.01803815,0.030765584,0.058120504,-0.014000858,0.055519335,-0.0542108,-0.043791667,-0.04697396,-0.023355976,0.056877334,-0.05563952,-0.04907256,0.057816256,-0.02226815,0.03873666,0.05733123,-0.015108941,0.05788797,0.012339894,0.057216495,0.051610325,0.000752968,-0.053223554,-0.0565116,0.057619017,0.033217423,-0.05802641,0.055181492,0.05545619,-0.054886054,0.053396814,-0.027013954,-0.051845618,-0.009888169,-0.057911426,-0.052995842,-0.011387344,0.022085154,-0.04351448,0.025024101,0.040849872,-0.058260046,0.058232456,0.056677118,0.045091845,-0.057427038,0.012551798,0.044875167,0.039914127,-0.047677793,-0.056297265,0.014627217,0.049463827,-0.052243512,0.009675665,0.05805102,0.005345367,0.03415578,-0.058258045,0.015785273,0.002800663,-0.039133728,0.05768674,-0.039952807,-0.038300097,0.05826037,-0.057286423,0.046180435,0.053157024,0.05640914,0.056644306,0.05553799,0.021509338,0.03777119,-0.04291679,0.006491979,0.04819387,0.040578615,0.019041168,0.057488035,0.014650341,0.058220007,0.03209245,-0.05711063,0.008324713,0.05300353,0.058203,0.013562987,0.011042469,-0.025142353,-0.052037727,0.05765985,-0.04904185,-0.008760223,-0.046128854,-0.019417947,-0.05588824,-0.01209073,0.05825051,-0.034672454,0.05589822,0.019184731,0.010357237,-0.056000445,-0.010122445,-0.043531384,-0.058148026,-0.003131068,-0.049082804,0.057361457,0.046003792,0.054596357,-0.009552225,-0.035893474,-0.02964835,-0.012362117,0.054615814,-0.056863226,0.05437789,0.003719287,0.05218787,-0.05800072,0.058208473,0.049596373,0.019926237,0.00637032,0.057764772,-0.008142361,-0.034875456,0.018126726,0.014790819,-0.057073757,0.043298863,0.02766034,-0.015617447,-0.039251145,0.057611976,-0.0494656,0.045955867,0.047259156,0.017351944,0.057921078,0.04216153,0.000565681,0.05629943,0.026274715,0.03382209,-0.037528306,0.011133366,-0.034123946,0.05772757,0.021909593,-0.05826037,-0.0582554,0.0521759,0.056344084,-0.002672995,-0.056205932,0.008198218,0.022943046,-0.05744855,-0.02123219,0.001552248,-0.056804307,-0.05826027,-0.05143025,-0.057363573,0.020291751,0.02861259,-0.057575155,-0.058031354,0.04077064,-0.037722245,-0.034767684,0.05825945,0.05616512,0.057457224,-0.004845033,0.038154647,-0.057086103,-0.035839412,-0.05826037,0.058039702,0.052941285,0.05819929,-0.028857777,0.050533928,-0.05681341,-0.05825987,0.05810232,0.0561075,-0.030213265,0.05155004,-0.0572141,-0.026225392,-0.056381185,0.046488974,0.043345183,0.039422352,0.022781668,0.057558924,-0.05561257,-0.050557427,0.054427724,0.018734204,-0.056680225,0.047935225,-0.04407399,0.0444081,-0.028618826,0.042262148,-0.002447023,0.042835888,-0.015176242,-0.0451178,-0.014429926,0.013231392,0.04576501,0.053919252,-0.0

Attenuation of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus by Engineered Viral Polymerase Fidelity,"Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (3D(pol)) catalyzes viral RNA synthesis. Its characteristic low fidelity and absence of proofreading activity allow FMDV to rapidly mutate and adapt to dynamic environments. In this study, we used the structure of FMDV 3D(pol) in combination with previously reported results from similar picornaviral polymerases to design point mutations that would alter replication fidelity. In particular, we targeted Trp237 within conserved polymerase motif A because of the low reversion potential inherent in the single UGG codon. Using biochemical and genetic tools, we show that the replacement of tryptophan 237 with phenylalanine imparts higher fidelity, but replacements with isoleucine and leucine resulted in lower-fidelity phenotypes. Viruses containing these W237 substitutions show in vitro growth kinetics and plaque morphologies similar to those of the wild-type (WT) A(24) Cruzeiro strain in BHK cells, and both high- and low-fidelity variants retained fitness during coinfection with the wild-type virus. The higher-fidelity W237F (W237F(HF)) mutant virus was more resistant to the mutagenic nucleoside analogs ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil than the WT virus, whereas the lower-fidelity W237I (W237I(LF)) and W237L(LF) mutant viruses exhibited lower ribavirin resistance. Interestingly, the variant viruses showed heterogeneous and slightly delayed growth kinetics in primary porcine kidney cells, and they were significantly attenuated in mouse infection experiments. These data demonstrate, for a single virus, that either increased or decreased RdRp fidelity attenuates virus growth in animals, which is a desirable feature for the development of safer and genetically more stable vaccine candidates. IMPORTANCE Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is the most devastating disease affecting livestock worldwide. Here, using structural and biochemical analyses, we have identified FMDV 3D(pol) mutations that affect polymerase fidelity. Recombinant FMDVs containing substitutions at 3D(pol) tryptophan residue 237 were genetically stable and displayed plaque phenotypes and growth kinetics similar to those of the wild-type virus in cell culture. We further demonstrate that viruses harboring either a W237F(HF) substitution or W237I(LF) and W237L(LF) mutations were highly attenuated in animals. Our study shows that obtaining 3D(pol) fidelity variants by protein engineering based on polymerase structure and function could be exploited for the development of attenuated FMDV vaccine candidates that are safer and more stable than strains obtained by selective pressure via mutagenic nucleotides or adaptation approaches.",-0.03899144,-0.01010634,-0.057059966,-0.012850842,-0.017082233,0.057752404,0.045388233,-0.056948997,-0.030663244,0.04535446,0.05818351,0.018767864,-0.023576606,-0.046104766,0.0349814,-0.058156688,-0.05818241,-0.038377687,0.05801216,-0.017330589,0.021076338,-0.001917932,-0.053735424,0.057975095,0.057382025,0.050401554,0.036141414,0.04188395,0.011703769,0.033180892,0.04843355,0.058181796,0.030277258,-0.030279422,-0.021595195,0.013615889,-0.05816251,-0.009944347,-0.052511316,0.037413098,0.027197396,-0.0464958,-0.049380876,-0.051035415,-0.047456395,-0.02383076,-0.026691724,0.04335506,0.054578196,-0.002996119,0.05551449,0.027738199,-0.058124654,0.021256054,-0.057203203,0.034974962,-0.055253096,-0.055320483,0.038051393,-0.0568335,-0.016250694,0.002025424,0.03238068,-0.010570467,0.022251902,-0.057765003,0.058070462,0.039465617,0.050403856,0.028554864,0.011019644,0.056220606,0.054123543,0.05277397,-0.057626013,0.044098496,0.057940997,0.042863093,-0.05746798,0.05122707,-0.038762394,0.058180176,0.03147335,-0.043039285,-0.053565737,0.053690795,0.023047095,0.015949309,-0.046506166,-0.031224985,-0.04655668,0.004304712,-0.057833686,0.041616663,0.021684367,0.047161594,0.049572464,0.05817511,0.05818325,-0.025507996,-0.05382459,-0.05268487,-0.033299837,-0.004118208,0.05741361,0.035414807,0.043137547,0.006643406,-0.04815103,-0.02097292,0.035104502,0.023685904,0.054640643,0.05170028,0.05795745,0.007011533,-0.058000147,-0.038135227,-0.03662792,-0.05162441,-0.034558084,0.05533379,0.05395726,-0.035141356,0.04833835,0.028321315,0.03676014,-0.017030157,0.02633926,0.019184768,-0.047783405,0.05818353,0.05715043,-0.042134922,-0.012416017,-0.03678838,-0.006924886,0.053681232,-0.047136277,0.037543986,0.052615706,0.058183517,-0.056603473,-0.043458845,0.023082731,-0.056724254,0.040574063,-0.05790446,0.053395044,0.05022538,0.03284603,-0.056216836,-0.058112852,0.038216226,0.05818352,0.0411708,0.05672352,0.028973097,-0.008139134,-0.037432067,-0.05464781,-0.014588067,0.01235769,0.058054075,0.03197326,-0.04964022,-0.058149986,0.05101524,-0.05411319,-0.058046117,-0.053932425,-0.05812501,-0.05451028,0.051083528,0.03689904,-0.04817945,0.024477176,-0.037305027,0.057990354,-0.021881122,-0.015330481,0.017767437,-0.042920176,-0.016765218,0.05704952,-0.049062848,-0.055612303,-0.03955591,0.05770129,-0.008186119,0.057351224,-0.007113818,-0.054604366,0.045250874,0.05814065,-0.037929595,0.03831596,0.047420826,0.033858523,-0.0479109,-0.05658386,0.05734114,0.000384173,0.021826198,0.04929578,-0.054356687,-0.04728149,0.058123324,0.039790984,0.0581588,0.029648554,0.058149207,0.048180006,0.053367857,-0.057781436,0.004085206,0.056693446,0.054198846,-0.030977279,-0.041795094,-0.003373556,-0.048280142,-0.038318526,0.01778752,-0.035031833,-0.017896105,-0.057823505,-0.057691798,0.0378863,0.033827372,-0.008703833,0.05725413,0.037954427,-0.05818323,0.057614677,-0.022302963,-0.021191292,-0.055092186,-0.014129616,0.05547819,0.05214933,0.04543048,-0.056926344,-0.037013553,0.054668557,-0.044261575,0.031564582,0.03459869,0.017870456,-0.046366066,-0.0581388,0.007877935,-0.039327063,0.002045282,0.05792514,-0.024791615,-0.058041174,0.05818353,-0.040384937,-0.050820626,-0.035204954,0.040916037,0.05515262,0.057696372,0.041411452,-0.04490587,-0.050669987,0.037565883,-0.02823089,0.040493846,0.049758583,0.05817135,0.02071267,0.053245734,0.033411562,-0.05768492,0.05149717,0.05649876,0.0581381,-0.054527216,-0.034050766,-0.03826034,-0.03369833,0.03289694,-0.056122154,0.028900493,-0.057798106,0.05717723,-0.056240704,0.027621554,0.05818109,0.04938939,0.05802779,-0.023844458,0.042450313,-0.055262923,0.02439282,-0.014800352,-0.058183387,0.054214355,-0.043986112,0.053789414,0.047776166,0.043376498,-0.056150932,0.011653851,-0.05612213,-0.0256637,0.05746895,-0.04706575,0.053851116,-0.033797264,-0.007548862,-0.056919247,0.05327682,0.052484654,0.019652633,0.019872775,0.05807001,-0.035722584,-0.050634846,0.041532032,0.05585455,-0.057610814,-0.04056599,0.05807573,-0.05725418,-0.05792977,-0.05393154,-0.05576833,-0.021582427,0.020763127,0.051239356,0.05817035,-0.035411566,-0.021061031,0.054363143,-0.0316453,0.025768317,-0.037960917,0.022567572,-0.044997513,0.05207273,-0.021654932,-0.058183074,-0.05818309,-0.047725596,0.057580046,-0.005289763,-0.05809878,0.048152994,-0.03825141,-0.025183715,-0.04738161,0.008459398,-0.006832709,-0.05818347,-0.05434045,-0.02185533,-0.05798069,0.014727402,-0.057486817,-0.057544645,0.05407413,0.04953749,-0.051049028,0.05817987,0.040656276,0.043974716,0.052100852,-0.019773038,-0.03844619,0.03279629,-0.058183502,0.05807176,0.052823532,0.057469685,0.052326582,0.03716535,-0.056731276,-0.053405337,0.05804802,0.054535177,0.034408815,0.050684556,-0.040198617,-0.04473183,-0.058090463,0.049709383,0.0361487,0.027860314,-0.046028648,0.008059441,-0.049161468,-0.03458513,0.05373337,0.014217627,-0.05766552,0.011841846,-0.057877596,0.05573253,0.035565276,-0.03508311,0.057101138,-0.051296856,-0.053188764,-0.047104172,-0.046580795,0.043846674,0.032999884,0.030304857,-0.0

Respiratory Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction: An Important Diagnostic Tool in Immunocompromised Patients,"BACKGROUND: Viruses and atypical pathogens can cause significant respiratory illness in immunocompromised patients. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MPCR) has improved the diagnostic yield of pathogens, and it is easier to identify the co-infections also. The present study was done to evaluate the performance of MPCR on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples in immunocompromised patients. METHODS: Atotal of 177 BAL specimens collected over a 19 months period from immunocompromised patients with respiratory illness were analyzed with the MPCR and aerobic culture. Patients were divided into four according to the pathogens. Category V (only viral), Category NV (nonviral, i.e., bacteria and atypical), Category M (mixed, i.e., both viral and nonviral pathogen), and Category UK (unknown etiology). RESULTS: MPCR identified the causative pathogen in 59.3% of patients while culture could identify only in 37.8% of patients. Most frequent etiological agent was Klebsiella pneumoniae (32%), followed by cytomegalovirus (21%), and Pneumocystis jirovecii (10%). Numbers of patients in each category were Category V (9.6%), Category NV (43.5%), Category M (19.8%), and Category UK (27.1%). Mortality was significantly higher in patients of Category M having mixed infections. CONCLUSION: MPCR is highly sensitive and rapid tool which can be considered in the routine diagnostic algorithm of respiratory illness in immunocompromised

Atypical RNA Elements Modulate Translational Readthrough in Tobacco Necrosis Virus D,"Tobacco necrosis virus, strain D (TNV-D), is a positive-strand RNA virus in the genus Betanecrovirus and family Tombusviridae. The production of its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, p82, is achieved by translational readthrough. This process is stimulated by an RNA structure that is positioned immediately downstream of the recoding site, termed the readthrough stem-loop (RTSL), and a sequence in the 3′ untranslated region of the TNV-D genome, called the distal readthrough element (DRTE). Notably, a base pairing interaction between the RTSL and the DRTE, spanning ∼3,000 nucleotides, is required for enhancement of readthrough. Here, some of the structural features of the RTSL, as well as RNA sequences and structures that flank either the RTSL or DRTE, were investigated for their involvement in translational readthrough and virus infectivity. The results revealed that (i) the RTSL-DRTE interaction cannot be functionally replaced by stabilizing the RTSL structure, (ii) a novel tertiary RNA structure positioned just 3′ to the RTSL is required for optimal translational readthrough and virus infectivity, and (iii) these same activities also rely on an RNA stem-loop located immediately upstream of the DRTE. Functional counterparts for the RTSL-proximal structure may also be present in other tombusvirids. The identification of additional distinct RNA structures that modulate readthrough suggests that regulation of this process by genomic features may be more complex than previously appreciated. Possible roles for these novel RNA elements are discussed. IMPORTANCE The analysis of factors that affect recoding events in viruses is leading to an ever more complex picture of this important process. In this study, two new atypical RNA elements were shown to contribute to efficient translational readthrough of the TNV-D polymerase and to mediate robust viral genome accumulation in infections. One of the structures, located close to the recoding site, could have functional equivalents in related genera, while the other structure, positioned 3′ proximally in the viral genome, is likely limited to betanecroviruses. Irrespective of their prevalence, the identification of these novel RNA elements adds to the current repertoire of viral genome-based modulators of translational readthrough and provides a notable example of the complexity of regulation of this

Ebola Preparedness: Diagnosis Improvement Using Rapid Approaches for Proficiency Testing,"The unprecedented 2015 Ebolavirus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa was declared a public health emergency, making diagnosis and quality of testing a global issue. The accuracy of laboratory diagnostic capacity for EBOV was assessed in 2014 to 2016 using a proficiency testing (PT) strategy developed by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia Quality Assurance Programs (RCPAQAP) in Biosecurity. Following a literature search, EBOV-specific gene targets were ranked according to the frequency of their use in published methods. The most commonly used gene regions (nucleoprotein [NP], glycoprotein [GP], and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [L]) were selected for the design of in vitro RNA transcripts to be included in the simulated EBOV specimens used for EBOV detection with PCR-based assays. Specimens were tested for stability and found to be stable on long-term storage (1 year) at −80°C and on shorter-term storage in lyophilized form (1 week at ambient temperature and a subsequent week at −80°C). These specimens were used in three EBOV PTs offered from April 2014 to March 2016. In the first and third PTs, all laboratories (3/3 and 9/9, respectively) correctly identified specimens containing EBOV RNA transcripts, while in the second PT, all but one laboratory (5/6) correctly confirmed the presence of EBOV. The EBOV PT panel was useful for ensuring the competency of laboratories in detecting EBOV in the absence of readily available clinical samples. The simulated EBOV specimen was safe, stable, and reliable and can be used in lyophilized form for future EBOV PT programs, allowing simplicity of

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome,"Between September 2012 and January 20, 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) received reports from 27 countries of 1879 laboratory-confirmed cases in humans of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by infection with the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and at least 659 related deaths. Cases of MERS-CoV infection continue to occur, including sporadic zoonotic infections in humans across the Arabian Peninsula, occasional importations and associated clusters in other regions, and outbreaks of nonsustained human-to-human transmission in health care settings. Dromedary camels are considered to be the most likely source of animal-to-human transmission. MERS-CoV enters host cells after binding the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) receptor and the carcinoembryonic antigen–related cell-adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) cofactor ligand, and it replicates efficiently in the human respiratory epithelium. Illness begins after an incubation period of 2 to 14 days and frequently results in hypoxemic respiratory failure and the need for multiorgan support. However, asymptomatic and mild cases also occur. Real-time reverse-transcription–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) testing of respiratory secretions is the mainstay for diagnosis, and samples from the lower respiratory tract have the greatest yield among seriously ill patients. There is no antiviral therapy of proven efficacy, and thus treatment remains largely supportive; potential vaccines are at an early developmental stage. There are multiple gaps in knowledge regarding the evolution and transmission of the virus, disease pathogenesis, treatment, and prospects for a vaccine. The ongoing occurrence of MERS in humans and the associated high mortality call for a continued collaborative approach toward gaining a better understanding of the infection both in humans and in animals. MERS-CoV was first identified in September 20121 in a patient from Saudi Arabia who had hypoxemic respiratory failure and multiorgan illness.

Viral aetiology of wheezing in children under five,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Wheezing is a common problem in children under five with acute respiratory infections (ARIs). Viruses are known to be responsible for a considerable proportion of ARIs in children. This study was undertaken to know the viral aetiology of wheezing among the children less than five years of age, admitted to a tertiary care hospital in eastern India. METHODS: Seventy five children, under the age of five years admitted with wheezing, were included in the study. Throat and nasal swabs were collected, and real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used to screen for influenza 1 and 2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1, 2, 3 and 4, rhinovirus, human meta-pneumovirus, bocavirus (HBoV), Coronavirus, adenovirus, Enterovirus and Parechovirus. RESULTS: The total viral detection rate was 28.57 per cent. Viral RNA markers were detected from children diagnosed to be having pneumonia (3 cases), bronchiolitis (9 cases), episodic wheeze (2 cases) and multitrigger wheeze (6 cases). RSV was the most common virus (35%) followed by PIV1, 2 and 3 (20%), HBoV (10%) and rhinovirus (5%). However, mixed infection was observed in 30 per cent of cases. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The study reported the presence of respiratory viral agents in 28.57 per cent of children with wheezing; RSV and PIV were most common, accounting to 55 per cent of the total cases. Mixed infection was reported in 30 per cent of cases. Seasonal variation in the occurrence of these viruses was also noted. Further studies need to be done with a large sample and longer follow up period to verify these

The Many Faces of the Flavivirus NS5 Protein in Antagonism of Type I Interferon Signaling,"The vector-borne flaviviruses cause severe disease in humans on every inhabited continent on earth. Their transmission by arthropods, particularly mosquitoes, facilitates large emergence events such as witnessed with Zika virus (ZIKV) or West Nile virus in the Americas. Every vector-borne flavivirus examined thus far that causes disease in humans, from dengue virus to ZIKV, antagonizes the host type I interferon (IFN-I) response by preventing JAK-STAT signaling, suggesting that suppression of this pathway is an important determinant of infection. The most direct and potent viral inhibitor of this pathway is the nonstructural protein NS5. However, the mechanisms utilized by NS5 from different flaviviruses are often quite different, sometimes despite close evolutionary relationships between viruses. The varied mechanisms of NS5 as an IFN-I antagonist are also surprising given that the evolution of NS5 is restrained by the requirement to maintain function of two enzymatic activities critical for virus replication, the methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This review discusses the different strategies used by flavivirus NS5 to evade the antiviral effects of IFN-I and how this information can be used to better model disease and develop antiviral countermeasures.",-0.051176906,0.052919738,-0.006377436,-0.049698945,0.060854226,0.061835255,0.050728783,-0.03791874,0.04101028,0.046573978,0.064754985,-0.04063231,-0.02838296,-0.0450882,0.040051248,-0.06242629,-0.06470566,-0.064202376,0.037316646,0.007554446,-0.03257134,-0.042853378,-0.036341723,0.05831932,0.051273547,0.03750855,-0.00892472,-0.017879983,-0.04915564,-0.000672406,-0.009110114,0.064754955,0.005723611,-0.021143364,0.017035006,0.045571838,-0.04558751,-0.00524764,-0.035353765,-0.047411762,-0.008078509,-0.044676717,0.025900334,-0.059338532,-0.061694168,0.017329624,-0.008896072,-0.041927744,0.028771166,0.039501447,0.05397191,0.019524744,-0.060508225,-0.032374337,-0.06321398,-0.033156157,-0.055232048,-0.03518237,0.06395359,0.014700281,-0.030913856,0.044368275,-0.012929659,0.02724331,-0.03372486,-0.0642058,0.05987918,-0.042726927,0.011684286,0.02174803,-0.04425901,0.038078845,0.04636726,0.05386454,-0.043416973,0.018396964,0.0580429,0.03153378,-0.06455828,0.06317561,-0.01569249,0.064155154,0.05873091,0.013481751,-0.058878817,-0.000401165,0.032393478,0.054054797,-0.05823861,-0.056124948,-0.03732116,0.001502761,-0.05105331,0.04202957,-0.016308716,0.060435046,0.061808493,0.0646256,0.06472711,-0.041550975,-0.04197599,-0.037847575,-0.03675375,0.028990345,0.038328253,0.04982753,0.057551928,-0.014329951,0.025334926,0.00330282,0.001165925,-0.057773754,0.0388982,0.02652037,0.06225872,0.054996785,-0.06152694,-0.012196712,-0.026870722,0.00472215,0.044543736,0.038007308,0.005043159,-0.02237143,0.029244376,-0.006160894,0.057478804,-0.016545825,0.035545774,-0.00657712,-0.028243748,0.0647551,0.06324415,-0.03433879,-0.005047956,-0.058570255,0.05217947,0.048002765,-0.06359653,-0.04977444,0.059571017,0.06474452,-0.04805389,-0.023202788,0.05559718,-0.04823725,0.019494321,-0.063529976,0.048889816,-0.003501918,0.061165564,-0.06374063,-0.014640618,-0.025750445,0.06463946,-0.047196183,0.061665054,0.056851186,0.030060414,0.030034723,-0.02456281,0.014904264,0.022325674,0.05974727,-0.050737064,-0.01231014,-0.039776966,0.008150447,-0.06365225,-0.03985072,-0.031089539,-0.06471829,-0.021867638,0.04169524,0.018371748,0.019259043,-0.003989604,-0.0554926,0.062304698,-0.03377515,0.020793453,0.015194666,-0.008264668,-0.03081194,0.052033983,-0.045168184,-0.06366262,-0.027454628,0.058917385,-0.042764988,-0.01581433,-0.046180893,-0.05787381,0.04402599,0.0645325,-0.04050094,0.060003545,0.024536625,-0.001759208,-0.052340128,-0.0627186,0.05880503,-0.014084225,-0.042269044,0.015209783,-0.056896348,-0.05490897,0.06424751,0.023722008,0.06434966,0.015098258,0.06424861,0.063277215,0.061261095,-0.05158105,0.054059267,0.009424051,-0.012236448,-0.06334697,-0.015442077,0.008524285,-0.04019486,0.005560823,-0.029012268,-0.017715795,0.011259083,-0.06448387,-0.06199262,0.04049632,0.06076214,0.060546536,0.062162098,0.05657342,-0.064688854,0.038235847,-0.008888769,-0.023986148,-0.051023733,-0.029801048,0.054383576,-0.011510209,0.039995253,-0.0598257,-0.04265891,-0.029008646,-0.019208863,-0.012283653,0.04834924,0.061227944,-0.03067823,-0.05994231,-0.020329818,-0.014642237,-0.039059114,0.06445324,0.031640302,-0.024896983,0.06475509,-0.049589258,-0.05791698,0.01791307,0.03109021,-0.007130212,0.054075822,0.040699724,0.0270029,-0.046422865,-0.05112536,0.033506516,0.04438643,-0.038363013,0.061868276,-0.061519,-0.039453257,-0.038662426,-0.032093916,0.0504451,0.056044392,0.06413768,-0.029782178,0.033020187,-0.05866619,-0.0358471,0.045640316,0.03376126,-0.006634306,-0.039093453,0.062032834,-0.05603336,0.058734138,0.06412614,0.040800355,0.064716995,-0.048730057,0.062400687,-0.023359308,0.03749058,-0.05302291,-0.06465212,0.015759675,0.025266504,0.05963617,0.0383415,0.047720704,-0.055877957,-0.024937553,0.013302272,-0.006525762,0.05577939,-0.06041733,0.03931479,0.004941979,-0.05546284,-0.05586041,0.06281146,-0.047293298,0.056146998,0.016276812,0.06421009,0.018614743,-0.059860054,0.060194314,0.058980025,-0.0628026,-0.016664919,0.064553134,-0.03647696,-0.06013334,0.04518979,-0.041382268,0.033463016,0.04932105,-0.000991975,0.06437725,-0.014845974,0.021565631,0.00397114,0.002889177,-0.008505764,-0.01958071,0.016676683,-0.044764657,0.05758979,0.04301829,-0.06460717,-0.064737484,0.047903024,0.05280429,-0.030456414,-0.06367203,0.055687215,-0.002128613,0.036257163,0.014556991,0.04854113,0.02539768,-0.064750455,-0.04441669,-0.027684752,0.019971188,0.05275337,-0.06044679,-0.05565505,0.04071788,-0.054660514,-0.03940132,0.06449019,0.0610366,0.019050341,0.048700847,-0.010301936,0.037047066,-0.05265067,-0.064167455,0.06396108,0.01967071,0.064172566,0.050219644,0.03505175,-0.009608383,0.02925849,0.062610626,0.06068717,0.051614393,-0.013977401,-0.061079048,0.002014625,-0.06369253,0.032710977,0.05059663,0.05319829,0.023835013,0.06394285,-0.04248764,-0.056145,0.04063437,-0.022762185,-5.04E-05,0.02853488,0.020805413,-0.040503204,0.014204588,-0.053751193,-0.005942598,-0.012033217,-0.012824523,-0.055153225,-0.006215611,0.035085224,0.051373553,0.062029228,0.047146007,-0.05079599,-0.06288

"Development of polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostic tests for detection of Malsoor virus & adenovirus isolated from Rousettus species of bats in Maharashtra, India","BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Bats are recognized as important reservoirs for emerging infectious disease and some unknown viral diseases. Two novel viruses, Malsoor virus (family Bunyaviridae, genus, Phlebovirus) and a novel adenovirus (AdV) (family, Adenoviridae genus, Mastadenovirus), were identified from Rousettus bats in the Maharashtra State of India. This study was done to develop and optimize real time reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for Malsoor virus and real time and nested PCR for adenovirus from Rousettus bats. METHODS: For rapid and accurate screening of Malsoor virus and adenovirus a nested polymerase chain reaction and TaqMan-based real-time PCR were developed. Highly conserved region of nucleoprotein gene of phleboviruses and polymerase gene sequence from the Indian bat AdV isolate polyprotein gene were selected respectively for diagnostic assay development of Malsoor virus and AdV. Sensitivity and specificity of assays were calculated and optimized assays were used to screen bat samples. RESULTS: Molecular diagnostic assays were developed for screening of Malsoor virus and AdV and those were found to be specific. Based on the experiments performed with different parameters, nested PCR was found to be more sensitive than real-time PCR; however, for rapid screening, real-time PCR can be used and further nested PCR can be used for final confirmation or in those laboratories where real-time facility/expertise is not existing. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the development and optimization of nested RT-PCR and a TaqMan-based real-time PCR for Malsoor virus and AdV. The diagnostic assays can be used for rapid detection of these novel viruses to understand their prevalence among bat

"Viruses causing severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in children ≤5 years of age at a tertiary care hospital in Rajasthan, India","BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) is one of the leading causes of death among children worldwide. As different respiratory viruses exhibit similar symptoms, simultaneous detection of these viruses in a single reaction mixture can save time and cost. The present study was done in a tertiary care children's hospital for rapid identification of viruses causing SARI among children less than or equal to five years of age using multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit. METHODS: A total of 155 throat swabs were collected from equal number of children suspected to have SARI and processed for extraction of nucleic acids using automated extraction system. Multiplex real-time RT-PCR was done to identify the viruses in the samples. RESULTS: The overall positivity for viruses in the study was found to be 72.9 per cent with a co-infection rate of 19.5 per cent. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) was the predominant virus detected in 25.7 per cent children followed by influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, human rhinovirus (HRV) and human adenovirus (HAdV) in 19.9, 11.0 and 8.8 per cent children, respectively. The HMPV was at its peak in February 2013, HAdV showed two peaks in March-April, 2012 and November 2012-March 2013 while HRV was detected throughout the year. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex real-time PCR helped in rapid identification of viruses. Seventeen viruses were detected in SARI cases with overall positivity of 72.9 per cent.

Intragraft Antiviral-specific Gene Expression as a Distinctive Transcriptional Signature for Studies in Polyomavirus Associated Nephropathy,"BACKGROUND: Polyomavirus nephropathy (PVAN) is a common cause of kidney allograft dysfunction and loss. To identify PVAN-specific gene expression and underlying molecular mechanisms we analyzed kidney biopsies with and without PVAN. METHODS: The study included 168 posttransplant renal allograft biopsies (T cell mediated rejection=26, PVAN=10, normal functioning graft (STA) =73, and interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA) =59) from 168 unique kidney allograft recipients. We performed gene expression assays and bioinformatics analysis to identify a set of PVAN-specific genes. Validity and relevance of a subset of these genes are validated by QPCR and IHC. RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of all the biopsies revealed high similarity between PVAN and TCMR gene expression. Increased statistical stringency identified 158 and 252 unique PVAN and TCMR injury-specific gene transcripts respectively. While TCMR-specific genes were overwhelmingly involved in immune response costimulation and TCR signaling, PVAN-specific genes were mainly related to DNA replication process, RNA polymerase assembly and pathogen recognition receptors. A principal component analysis using these genes further confirmed the most optimal separation between the 3 different clinical phenotypes. Validation of 4 PVAN-specific genes (RPS15, CFD, LTF, and NOSIP) by QPCR and confirmation by immunohistochemistry of 2 PVAN-specific proteins with anti-viral function (LTF and IFITM1) was done. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, even though PVAN and TCMR kidney allografts share great similarities on gene perturbation, PVAN-specific genes were identified with well-known anti-viral properties that provide tools for discerning PVAN and AR as well as attractive targets for rational drug

In Vivo Conditions Enable IFNAR-Independent Type I Interferon Production by Peritoneal CD11b(+) Cells upon Thogoto Virus Infection,"Type I interferons (IFNs) crucially contribute to host survival upon viral infections. Robust expression of type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) and induction of an antiviral state critically depend on amplification of the IFN signal via the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR). A small amount of type I IFN produced early upon virus infection binds the IFNAR and activates a self-enhancing positive feedback loop, resulting in induction of large, protective amounts of IFN-α. Unexpectedly, we found robust, systemic IFN-α expression upon infection of IFNAR knockout mice with the orthomyxovirus Thogoto virus (THOV). The IFNAR-independent IFN-α production required in vivo conditions and was not achieved during in vitro infection. Using replication-incompetent THOV-derived virus-like particles, we demonstrate that IFNAR-independent type I IFN induction depends on viral polymerase activity but is largely independent of viral replication. To discover the cell type responsible for this effect, we used type I IFN reporter mice and identified CD11b(+) F4/80(+) myeloid cells within the peritoneal cavity of infected animals as the main source of IFNAR-independent type I IFN, corresponding to the particular tropism of THOV for this cell type. IMPORTANCE Type I IFNs are crucial for the survival of a host upon most viral infections, and, moreover, they shape subsequent adaptive immune responses. Production of protective amounts of type I IFN critically depends on the positive feedback amplification via the IFNAR. Unexpectedly, we observed robust IFNAR-independent type I IFN expression upon THOV infection and unraveled molecular mechanisms and determined the tissue and cell type involved. Our data indicate that the host can effectively use alternative pathways to induce type I IFN responses if the classical feedback amplification is not available. Understanding how type I IFN can be produced in large amounts independently of IFNAR-dependent enhancement will identify mechanisms which might contribute to novel therapeutic strategies to fight viral

Viral Macro Domains Reverse Protein ADP-Ribosylation,"ADP-ribosylation is a posttranslational protein modification in which ADP-ribose is transferred from NAD(+) to specific acceptors to regulate a wide variety of cellular processes. The macro domain is an ancient and highly evolutionarily conserved protein domain widely distributed throughout all kingdoms of life, including viruses. The human TARG1/C6orf130, MacroD1, and MacroD2 proteins can reverse ADP-ribosylation by acting on ADP-ribosylated substrates through the hydrolytic activity of their macro domains. Here, we report that the macro domain from hepatitis E virus (HEV) serves as an ADP-ribose-protein hydrolase for mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) and poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) chain removal (de-MARylation and de-PARylation, respectively) from mono- and poly(ADP)-ribosylated proteins, respectively. The presence of the HEV helicase in cis dramatically increases the binding of the macro domain to poly(ADP-ribose) and stimulates the de-PARylation activity. Abrogation of the latter dramatically decreases replication of an HEV subgenomic replicon. The de-MARylation activity is present in all three pathogenic positive-sense, single-stranded RNA [(+)ssRNA] virus families which carry a macro domain: Coronaviridae (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E), Togaviridae (Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus), and Hepeviridae (HEV), indicating that it might be a significant tropism and/or pathogenic determinant. IMPORTANCE Protein ADP-ribosylation is a covalent posttranslational modification regulating cellular protein activities in a dynamic fashion to modulate and coordinate a variety of cellular processes. Three viral families, Coronaviridae, Togaviridae, and Hepeviridae, possess macro domains embedded in their polyproteins. Here, we show that viral macro domains reverse cellular ADP-ribosylation, potentially cutting the signal of a viral infection in the cell. Various poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases which are notorious guardians of cellular integrity are demodified by macro domains from members of these virus families. In the case of hepatitis E virus, the adjacent viral helicase domain dramatically increases the binding of the macro domain to PAR and simulates the demodification

Homology-Based Identification of a Mutation in the Coronavirus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase That Confers Resistance to Multiple Mutagens,"Positive-sense RNA viruses encode RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) essential for genomic replication. With the exception of the large nidoviruses, such as coronaviruses (CoVs), RNA viruses lack proofreading and thus are dependent on RdRps to control nucleotide selectivity and fidelity. CoVs encode a proofreading exonuclease in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN), which confers a greater-than-10-fold increase in fidelity compared to other RNA viruses. It is unknown to what extent the CoV polymerase (nsp12-RdRp) participates in replication fidelity. We sought to determine whether homology modeling could identify putative determinants of nucleotide selectivity and fidelity in CoV RdRps. We modeled the CoV murine hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp12-RdRp structure and superimposed it on solved picornaviral RdRp structures. Fidelity-altering mutations previously identified in coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3) were mapped onto the nsp12-RdRp model structure and then engineered into the MHV genome with [nsp14-ExoN(+)] or without [nsp14-ExoN(−)] ExoN activity. Using this method, we identified two mutations conferring resistance to the mutagen 5-fluorouracil (5-FU): nsp12-M611F and nsp12-V553I. For nsp12-V553I, we also demonstrate resistance to the mutagen 5-azacytidine (5-AZC) and decreased accumulation of mutations. Resistance to 5-FU, and a decreased number of genomic mutations, was effectively masked by nsp14-ExoN proofreading activity. These results indicate that nsp12-RdRp likely functions in fidelity regulation and that, despite low sequence conservation, some determinants of RdRp nucleotide selectivity are conserved across RNA viruses. The results also indicate that, with regard to nucleotide selectivity, nsp14-ExoN is epistatic to nsp12-RdRp, consistent with its proposed role in a multiprotein replicase-proofreading complex. IMPORTANCE RNA viruses have evolutionarily fine-tuned replication fidelity to balance requirements for genetic stability and diversity. Responsibility for replication fidelity in RNA viruses has been attributed to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, with mutations in RdRps for multiple RNA viruses shown to alter fidelity and attenuate virus replication and virulence. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are the only known RNA viruses to encode a proofreading exonuclease (nsp14-ExoN), as well as other replicase proteins involved in regulation of fidelity. This report shows that the CoV RdRp (nsp12) likely functions in replication fidelity; that residue determinants of CoV RdRp nucleotide selectivity map to similar structural regions of other, unrelated RNA viral polymerases; and that for CoVs, the proofreading activity of the nsp14-ExoN is epistatic to the function of the RdRp in

The Effects of Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine on Nasopharyngeal Bacteria in Healthy 2 to 4 Year Olds. A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Rationale: Viral infections of the upper respiratory tract may influence the commensal nasopharyngeal bacteria. Changes in the bacterial niche could affect transmission dynamics. Attenuated vaccine viruses can be used to investigate this empirically in humans. Objectives: To study the effects of mild viral upper respiratory infections on nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization using live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) as a surrogate. Methods: We used trivalent LAIV to evaluate the effects of viral infection on bacterial carriage and density of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 151 healthy children were randomized 1:1 to receive the vaccine starting either at recruitment (n = 74) or 28 days later (n = 77) in a stepped wedge fashion, allowing comparisons between recipients and nonrecipients as well as whole-group comparisons pre- and postvaccination. Bacterial carriage and density were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 151 children were recruited, 77 in the LAIV group and 74 in the control group. LAIV recipients (n = 63 analyzed) showed an apparent transient increase in H. influenzae carriage but no further significant differences in carriage prevalence of the four bacterial species compared with controls (n = 72 analyzed). S. pneumoniae density was substantially higher in vaccine recipients (16,687 vs. 1935 gene copies per milliliter) 28 days after the first dose (P < 0.001). Whole-group multivariable analysis (prevaccine, after one dose, and after two doses) also showed increases in density of other species and H. influenzae carriage prevalence. Conclusions: In the absence of any safety signals despite widespread use of the vaccine, these findings suggest that bacterial density, and thus transmission rates among children and to people in other age groups, may rise following attenuated influenza infections without associated clinical disease. LAIV could therefore be used as an experimental tool to elucidate the dynamics of transmission of nasopharyngeal bacteria.",0.006429323,0.015860077,-0.058714535,-0.038144995,-0.028608358,0.04700023,0.05918825,-0.05655616,0.02233713,0.042163327,0.059959874,0.048275005,0.030649822,-0.03930622,0.05160918,-0.058494,-0.059959304,-0.041616045,-0.030628558,-0.0326973,-0.04674817,-0.033119526,-0.059802905,0.058222268,0.05523768,0.059653405,-0.040949073,0.015607127,-0.016643785,-0.043487355,-0.02769253,0.05995932,0.01120309,0.028590435,0.058000438,0.038468413,-0.05980773,-0.013775382,-0.050609354,-0.042597957,0.014090104,0.048555024,-0.055621654,-0.049191717,-0.057863645,0.05391288,0.01626304,0.010680627,0.05715554,0.013350788,-0.03991992,0.03814888,-0.059903387,-0.027453331,-0.05987605,0.007021196,-0.057907257,-0.05075995,0.028931987,0.048208576,-0.013690483,0.05350409,0.027616795,-0.02730451,0.014674753,-0.059630886,0.05870621,0.050828457,0.042290393,-0.053067647,-0.055855133,0.04757397,-0.032045744,0.057645716,-0.026147282,0.034661915,-0.045548704,-0.042290278,-0.059814222,0.03352669,0.022230204,0.055640973,0.05529925,-0.05588023,-0.039546356,0.057889257,0.049905617,0.04668845,-0.049409706,-0.058952875,-0.048573934,-0.046151195,-0.025254536,-0.02177612,0.02174703,0.056538343,0.05437218,0.059937175,0.05988443,-0.053069472,-0.059350032,-0.0313409,-0.013264687,0.03323684,0.03708206,0.032338154,0.05149319,-0.035403155,-0.050921854,-0.016697804,-0.020247074,0.050164122,0.018285608,-0.024891417,0.059747588,0.011900762,-0.050696522,-0.034149993,-0.02922319,0.019340366,0.0505603,0.046766687,0.03635418,-0.038454678,0.040905606,0.023182014,-0.04861648,0.051078577,-0.016559877,0.032151304,0.008220559,0.05995989,0.057799302,-0.056445878,-0.027721858,-0.053012695,0.0482873,0.053902805,-0.049395528,-0.042582765,-0.032809228,0.05995936,-0.059585184,-0.009112266,0.05029787,0.015667211,0.058815498,-0.059538543,0.05933228,0.018764077,0.03698574,0.014964566,-0.05938895,-0.05318009,0.059874725,0.032998003,0.058452938,0.018602254,0.05063531,0.026976474,0.053554773,-0.025933178,-0.0554547,0.057611454,-0.043890532,-0.05823041,-0.039840437,0.018771319,-0.054757364,-0.053128686,-0.030602241,-0.059692603,-0.049839985,0.037796136,-0.004971014,-0.007448846,0.025684586,-0.056347024,0.057805277,0.019893235,0.014727567,0.055215914,0.014221929,-0.013090685,0.059334695,-0.007244658,-0.030742312,-0.04751714,0.057341233,-0.03994531,0.05915224,-0.05980214,-0.03544015,0.057455562,0.04909881,-0.055165723,-0.053427063,0.025400234,0.026500994,-0.023050284,-0.047722466,0.057376016,-0.016744096,-0.022429457,0.048298366,-0.055985566,0.03562053,0.0399837,0.039196093,0.0598482,-0.006618913,-0.026133312,0.011883098,0.05895403,-0.052684177,0.046666637,0.057928514,0.03927971,-0.04796548,-0.021619473,0.02668901,-0.007433106,0.05465611,-0.0539668,-0.01900187,0.00368414,-0.055326696,-0.059670053,0.005248213,0.041077316,0.053361334,0.058959857,0.05152252,-0.059958722,0.043490686,0.03952771,0.03957595,-0.059770964,0.009496358,0.058366086,0.021083798,0.05849421,-0.05881308,-0.054769624,0.0591522,-0.058139857,-0.046516195,-0.02434726,-0.00556697,-0.058110848,0.05544573,0.005792805,-0.03235982,0.024716446,0.05965154,0.03481708,-0.058675516,0.05995989,0.021785388,-0.056146994,0.016224299,0.003629102,-0.052864175,0.058137864,-0.04569072,-0.044999167,-0.013934183,0.041328926,0.054811347,0.040761564,0.03832562,0.059768934,-0.017333066,-0.042971298,0.000548108,-0.04181812,0.018396018,0.02295999,0.059164017,-0.051230647,-0.04007181,-0.058033764,-0.04162735,0.047980558,-0.024675127,-0.03712595,-0.05789661,0.057733424,-0.058971457,0.023729762,0.059663747,0.028156519,0.05802126,-0.05804432,-0.048384026,-0.036906954,0.017404525,-0.026491066,-0.053485062,0.059566807,0.015579006,0.003208571,0.04977122,-0.037660502,-0.058513958,-0.04881058,0.018772976,-0.05586238,0.035502996,-0.05265133,0.057817273,0.044568956,-0.023523802,-0.040591422,0.05870269,0.03967388,0.039811045,0.049927942,0.05949357,-0.026573777,-0.044727102,0.042049363,0.055661775,-0.016193954,-0.058811843,0.059847746,-0.03331463,-0.025840316,-0.059957195,-0.059893604,0.059401445,0.05609101,0.029432155,0.059918825,0.024415225,0.011613215,0.02978566,0.0589791,-0.05010456,-0.0087701,0.016904341,0.029529251,0.05988069,0.048034802,-0.05983207,-0.059959672,0.04771964,0.052076522,-0.05607353,-0.059933662,0.044055693,0.006855973,-0.046777807,-0.03143595,0.053311784,0.029480709,-0.059959527,0.010253151,-0.021597393,-0.059464205,-0.04487933,-0.046435367,-0.059088115,0.003104172,-0.044663213,-0.058028065,0.05982218,0.0209873,0.051005207,0.020384315,-0.056022514,0.000896171,-0.05880259,-0.05936979,0.059908308,0.048783325,0.05189467,-0.00732539,0.059277385,-0.050810687,-0.029515838,-0.023683885,-0.021029862,0.023726908,-0.01562175,-0.037402116,-0.023114925,-0.059899177,-0.042019326,0.057735685,0.05336014,0.017683262,0.02124642,0.018678993,-0.044748973,0.052666005,0.03767434,-0.058672298,0.05137199,-0.056488115,0.013728071,0.0393302,0.013020223,0.05792525,-0.046936773,0.020136248,-0.021752339,0.012447547,0.053072058,-0.056576535,0.052566316,0.0

Approved Antiviral Drugs over the Past 50 Years,"Since the first antiviral drug, idoxuridine, was approved in 1963, 90 antiviral drugs categorized into 13 functional groups have been formally approved for the treatment of the following 9 human infectious diseases: (i) HIV infections (protease inhibitors, integrase inhibitors, entry inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogues), (ii) hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections (lamivudine, interferons, nucleoside analogues, and acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogues), (iii) hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections (ribavirin, interferons, NS3/4A protease inhibitors, NS5A inhibitors, and NS5B polymerase inhibitors), (iv) herpesvirus infections (5-substituted 2′-deoxyuridine analogues, entry inhibitors, nucleoside analogues, pyrophosphate analogues, and acyclic guanosine analogues), (v) influenza virus infections (ribavirin, matrix 2 protein inhibitors, RNA polymerase inhibitors, and neuraminidase inhibitors), (vi) human cytomegalovirus infections (acyclic guanosine analogues, acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogues, pyrophosphate analogues, and oligonucleotides), (vii) varicella-zoster virus infections (acyclic guanosine analogues, nucleoside analogues, 5-substituted 2′-deoxyuridine analogues, and antibodies), (viii) respiratory syncytial virus infections (ribavirin and antibodies), and (ix) external anogenital warts caused by human papillomavirus infections (imiquimod, sinecatechins, and podofilox).

Dynamic Nucleolar Targeting of Dengue Virus Polymerase NS5 in Response to Extracellular pH,"The nucleolar subcompartment of the nucleus is increasingly recognized as an important target of RNA viruses. Here we document for the first time the ability of dengue virus (DENV) polymerase, nonstructural protein 5 (NS5), to accumulate within the nucleolus of infected cells and to target green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the nucleolus of live transfected cells. Intriguingly, NS5 exchange between the nucleus and nucleolus is dynamically modulated by extracellular pH, responding rapidly and reversibly to pH change, in contrast to GFP alone or other nucleolar and non-nucleolar targeted protein controls. The minimal pH-sensitive nucleolar targeting region (pHNTR), sufficient to target GFP to the nucleolus in a pH-sensitive fashion, was mapped to NS5 residues 1 to 244, with mutation of key hydrophobic residues, Leu-165, Leu-167, and Val-168, abolishing pHNTR function in NS5-transfected cells, and severely attenuating DENV growth in infected cells. This is the first report of a viral protein whose nucleolar targeting ability is rapidly modulated by extracellular stimuli, suggesting that DENV has the ability to detect and respond dynamically to the extracellular environment. IMPORTANCE Infections by dengue virus (DENV) threaten 40% of the world's population yet there is no approved vaccine or antiviral therapeutic to treat infections. Understanding the molecular details that govern effective viral replication is key for the development of novel antiviral strategies. Here, we describe for the first time dynamic trafficking of DENV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) to the subnuclear compartment, the nucleolus. We demonstrate that NS5's targeting to the nucleolus occurs in response to acidic pH, identify the key amino acid residues within NS5 that are responsible, and demonstrate that their mutation severely impairs production of infectious DENV. Overall, this study identifies a unique subcellular trafficking event and suggests that DENV is able to detect and respond dynamically to environmental

Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus Nucleocapsid Protein Interacts with Nsp9 and Cellular DHX9 To Regulate Viral RNA Synthesis,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) nucleocapsid (N) protein is the main component of the viral capsid to encapsulate viral RNA, and it is also a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of host cell processes. Nonstructural protein 9 (Nsp9) is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that plays a critical role in viral RNA transcription and replication. In this study, we demonstrate that PRRSV N protein is bound to Nsp9 by protein-protein interaction and that the contacting surface on Nsp9 is located in the two predicted α-helixes formed by 48 residues at the C-terminal end of the protein. Mutagenesis analyses identified E646, E608, and E611 on Nsp9 and Q85 on the N protein as the pivotal residues participating in the N-Nsp9 interaction. By overexpressing the N protein binding fragment of Nsp9 in infected Marc-145 cells, the synthesis of viral RNAs, as well as the production of infectious progeny viruses, was dramatically inhibited, suggesting that Nsp9-N protein association is involved in the process of viral RNA production. In addition, we show that PRRSV N interacts with cellular RNA helicase DHX9 and redistributes the protein into the cytoplasm. Knockdown of DHX9 increased the ratio of short subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs); in contrast, DHX9 overexpression benefited the synthesis of longer sgmRNAs and the viral genomic RNA (gRNA). These results imply that DHX9 is recruited by the N protein in PRRSV infection to regulate viral RNA synthesis. We postulate that N and DHX9 may act as antiattenuation factors for the continuous elongation of nascent transcript during negative-strand RNA synthesis. IMPORTANCE It is unclear whether the N protein of PRRSV is involved in regulation of the viral RNA production process. In this report, we demonstrate that the N protein of the arterivirus PRRSV participates in viral RNA replication and transcription through interacting with Nsp9 and its RdRp and recruiting cellular RNA helicase to promote the production of longer viral sgmRNAs and gRNA. Our data here provide some new insights into the discontinuous to continuous extension of PRRSV RNA synthesis and also offer a new potential anti-PRRSV strategy targeting the N-Nsp9 and/or N-DHX9 interaction.",0.039236303,0.006494367,-0.05002601,-0.0466739,0.03592142,0.055498183,0.03805452,-0.016838046,0.03905638,0.029462105,0.056009144,-0.039834887,-0.05452964,0.01629854,0.045285296,-0.056009326,-0.054922175,-0.043382637,0.053952552,-0.014422764,-0.032871753,0.048378408,-0.053224985,0.05285038,-0.03866489,0.04610676,0.05482469,-0.021282872,-0.055428047,-0.05493013,0.055423964,0.055896576,-0.03814267,-0.04087924,0.05274148,0.031167608,-0.050462086,-0.004216003,-0.045401767,0.03741227,0.04564958,-0.039192572,-0.018575076,-0.052249208,0.055719994,-0.040381927,-0.036689263,-0.032629784,0.052084483,-0.051587306,-0.038359378,0.04260335,-0.05588616,-0.038497627,-0.04884282,0.00990146,-0.047381155,0.031309355,0.054596033,-0.045335785,0.017000083,-0.002913636,0.041722413,0.040573124,0.00392688,-0.055754118,0.055388693,0.021351537,0.050862055,-0.04041339,0.023059292,0.020441627,0.001274876,0.013022631,-0.033922236,-0.05568186,0.05584805,-0.009650543,-0.05503928,0.023651496,-0.054614965,0.0559966,0.020804085,-0.053436875,-0.028798088,0.04278624,-0.03498612,-0.050453298,-0.055755667,0.005021598,-0.0480231,-0.025442567,-0.054566022,0.055310834,-0.008389586,0.05432042,0.053663813,0.05485397,0.056005727,-0.018801793,-0.05551289,0.01418305,0.025143983,0.015322573,0.008715477,0.055375934,0.04803568,-0.005805434,-0.029452564,-0.049837206,-0.026541594,0.046710264,-0.040063996,0.05533131,0.055939376,-0.039404754,-0.055800945,-0.039219074,-0.054538414,-0.029296191,-0.053230323,0.056001257,0.055007588,-0.050216123,0.051671654,0.051371463,0.023430256,0.042563803,-0.01446042,0.053740833,0.010294838,0.056010712,0.05514537,0.025750957,0.012425561,-0.0538726,-0.022845592,0.051426973,-0.052741222,0.03810314,-0.028110059,0.05601065,-0.055524815,-0.05231883,-0.032419942,-0.05557347,-0.007718077,-0.055987705,-0.02328285,0.055504806,-0.029087028,-0.05597889,-0.040716887,-0.02786742,0.056010716,0.03242912,0.001474515,0.037029494,0.033938535,0.044659052,0.036732048,-0.042288356,-0.0213927,0.050986096,-0.009975023,0.039742276,-0.055717587,-0.05236176,-0.051371325,-0.05565358,0.043546177,0.02245975,-0.055739544,0.04213275,0.05597059,0.001727312,0.05460493,-0.048117664,0.05480458,-0.04973328,-0.03840131,0.048865702,-0.038304165,0.029119562,0.05538147,-0.043952476,-0.05572449,0.054500367,0.054957073,-0.036562618,0.055485096,-0.05516839,0.007915396,0.015142037,0.056009457,-0.051358886,0.034801394,-0.012582331,0.034839954,0.003937905,-0.031033263,0.05296109,-0.046205338,-0.004391869,0.037104256,-0.05022322,0.013389954,0.055968326,0.049723268,0.055977833,0.032252844,0.055734508,0.0288973,-0.018833447,-0.055206235,-0.038120788,0.0554706,0.01914559,-0.052816615,0.037968315,0.025412569,-0.05401825,0.017601153,-0.011732649,-0.04426029,-0.048495278,-0.05552015,-0.046036385,0.05453994,0.005321702,0.024085172,0.05485613,0.049041674,-0.056010514,0.05597662,0.054960806,0.045643643,-0.055749588,-0.018788934,0.055512637,0.05022427,0.03417491,-0.050749745,0.022637906,0.054264702,-0.051846866,-0.022534167,0.04985031,0.022123072,-0.0453591,-0.0560098,0.05440945,-0.013212184,-0.045418546,0.054715905,-0.04299718,-0.032181725,0.056010716,-0.053868454,0.02483039,0.02908345,0.043711178,-0.041808587,0.05528157,0.021679219,0.023569295,-0.04389051,0.044132292,-0.046678927,0.024680387,0.047426272,0.055965457,-0.026024422,0.05308376,0.049381204,-0.05590591,-0.0273404,0.05465141,0.05599115,-0.055064075,-0.04862489,-0.05127844,-0.053094003,0.055194873,-0.03284465,-0.043183383,-0.05523572,0.013874725,-0.055760987,-0.027361833,0.056007706,-0.046930235,0.055857502,-0.026203858,0.002165052,-0.054031625,-0.041904777,0.006217874,-0.056008857,-0.04472681,-0.052104376,0.055977277,0.051894296,0.055727713,-0.053752344,0.040803008,-0.050834604,0.01386044,0.054948032,-0.055615593,0.055966392,-0.011771729,0.030542716,-0.05579935,0.05570348,0.039891705,0.001869699,0.04744794,-0.001386869,0.050686423,-0.029754438,0.04844356,0.052106325,-0.04812276,0.052739743,0.02939029,-0.003209152,-0.055828672,0.018594755,-0.055600908,0.053517688,0.020107007,0.000761531,0.055708837,0.05263249,-0.053175695,0.055901594,0.014389863,0.03518799,0.010143975,0.05075421,-0.034556434,0.055991698,0.024368638,-0.0560107,-0.056010656,-0.042451147,0.049019545,0.019840702,-0.054626126,-0.00870189,-0.041215304,-0.05565421,0.042976335,-0.001711926,-0.05560479,-0.056010656,-0.05535772,-0.050929286,-0.0524933,0.043371256,-0.055852804,-0.055926006,-0.03727674,0.04654865,-0.043455027,0.056008346,0.021555394,0.054408614,0.051565234,0.04631041,0.029856563,-0.054119714,-0.056010712,0.05579213,0.05337837,0.0532344,0.041935116,0.046691034,-0.054657724,-0.056004524,0.053460196,0.0363099,-0.027733052,-0.002074855,-0.055701613,-0.048787296,-0.055773906,0.04945158,0.04901366,0.04610334,-0.014215799,0.055728775,-0.055447668,-0.051036157,0.02092937,0.007624224,-0.055717472,0.027676526,-0.041027814,0.020503156,0.05062012,0.052911103,0.04374488,0.054289185,-0.052782644,-0.049559873,0.000584864,0.03188219,0.04183421,0.01472586

Evaluation of epidemiological and clinical features of influenza and other respiratory viruses,"AIM: In our study, we aimed to clinically and epidemiologically evaluate respiratory tract infections the viral agents of which were detected by molecular methods and to compare influenza and other respiratory tract viruses in this context. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The records of 178 patients aged above 2 years who presented to pediatric emergency outpatient clinic with fever and respiratory tract infection findings between December 2013 and April 2014 were examined retrospectively. RESULTS: At least one respiratory tract pathogen was detected by polymerase chain reaction in 78.6% (n=140) of the patients: influenza A 33.5%, influenza B 16.4%, respiratory syncytial virus 9.2%, adenovirus 7.8%, rhinovirus 7.1%, coronavirus 7.1%, human metapneumovirus 5.7%, human bocavirus 5.7%, parainfluenza virus 3.5%, coinfection 2.8%. The mean age of the patients was 6.3±3.6 years. Sixty-nine patients (49.2%) were aged between 2 and 5 years. Seventy-one patients (50.7%) were aged 5 years and above. Upper respiratory tract infection was found with a rate of 65.7% and lower respiratory tract infection was found with a rate of 34.2%. It was observed that the distribution of respiratory tract viruses showed variance by age groups. Influenza A infection was observed with the highest rate in both age groups. Influenza B was the second leading agent (p=0.008) above the age of 5 years and respiratory syncytial virus was the second leading agent in the 2–5 year age group (p=0.003). Influenza viruses were detected in 55.9% of 118 patients who were found to be compatible with the definition of “influenza-like illness” specified in the Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and other viral agenst were detected in 44%. No difference could be found between the clinical pictures and radiological findings caused by influenza and other respiratory tract viruses. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, it was concluded that influenza and other respiratory viruses can not be differentiated definitely by clinical and radiological findings, though there are some

Biochemical Evaluation of the Inhibition Properties of Favipiravir and 2′-C-Methyl-Cytidine Triphosphates against Human and Mouse Norovirus RNA Polymerases,"Norovirus (NoV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that causes acute gastroenteritis and is responsible for 200,000 deaths per year worldwide. No effective vaccine or treatment is available. Recent studies have shown that the nucleoside analogs favipiravir (T-705) and 2′-C-methyl-cytidine (2CM-C) inhibit NoV replication in vitro and in animal models, but their precise mechanism of action is unknown. We evaluated the molecular interactions between nucleoside triphosphates and NoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NoVpol), the enzyme responsible for replication and transcription of NoV genomic RNA. We found that T-705 ribonucleoside triphosphate (RTP) and 2CM-C triphosphate (2CM-CTP) equally inhibited human and mouse NoVpol activities at concentrations resulting in 50% of maximum inhibition (IC(50)s) in the low micromolar range. 2CM-CTP inhibited the viral polymerases by competing directly with natural CTP during primer elongation, whereas T-705 RTP competed mostly with ATP and GTP at the initiation and elongation steps. Incorporation of 2CM-CTP into viral RNA blocked subsequent RNA synthesis, whereas T-705 RTP did not cause immediate chain termination of NoVpol. 2CM-CTP and T-705 RTP displayed low levels of enzyme selectivity, as they were both recognized as substrates by human mitochondrial RNA polymerase. The level of discrimination by the human enzyme was increased with a novel analog of T-705 RTP containing a 2′-C-methyl substitution. Collectively, our data suggest that 2CM-C inhibits replication of NoV by acting as a classic chain terminator, while T-705 may inhibit the virus by multiple mechanisms of action. Understanding the precise mechanism of action of anti-NoV compounds could provide a rational basis for optimizing their inhibition potencies and selectivities.",0.00376014,0.005988237,-0.056627832,-0.045435745,0.039659385,0.059658457,0.052493848,-0.05305721,0.044833384,0.05557791,0.06112864,-0.033118397,0.030151242,0.023202255,-0.047266074,-0.061109085,-0.06011463,-0.010739037,0.060509063,0.0360776,-0.007660572,0.04851206,-0.058078233,0.058718283,-0.018560408,0.056935243,0.046606913,0.028805181,-0.057649124,-0.008763186,0.05436982,0.06091134,0.017271707,-0.034529597,0.01305777,-0.014481186,-0.008962829,-0.056886625,-0.055267695,-0.028914971,-0.026202759,-0.030983336,-0.019376615,-0.05505096,0.053170957,0.012492377,-0.04948589,-0.045510728,0.024761196,-0.046369538,-0.055751625,0.046421696,-0.06082763,-0.036969364,-0.05437494,-0.02481562,-0.05954482,0.026765049,0.058696564,-0.057372987,0.002583511,-0.03365995,0.049061414,0.02649449,-0.013115699,-0.06049426,0.060381413,0.046458043,0.014236462,-0.02759735,-0.024618488,-0.033943962,-0.023740634,0.04749413,-0.041408308,-0.042468935,0.056531128,0.007334686,-0.057843436,0.057477754,-0.053051747,0.061092198,0.009089723,-0.024840461,-0.036299642,0.05731397,-0.039585818,-0.030012455,-0.04483367,0.03397606,-0.023593094,-0.03898022,-0.04865033,0.03826969,-0.002456131,0.059431378,0.05972255,0.060788136,0.061129406,-0.05321235,-0.014987024,0.0531067,-0.031614263,0.029707273,-0.007505052,0.053276792,-0.012214174,0.023457106,-0.03254485,-0.05537612,-0.047618113,-0.01879305,0.03247446,0.030426882,0.059745967,0.019367756,-0.060885265,-0.026089082,-0.000647369,0.015589523,-0.0501772,0.060281813,-0.04250169,-0.03684734,0.05911288,0.056740653,0.008234759,-0.016518576,0.038942255,0.04351454,-0.053993635,0.061137926,0.059190016,-0.0357288,0.041403852,-0.05807648,-0.015747128,-0.019834617,-0.044797447,-0.025447741,0.02714817,0.06113775,-0.060741425,-0.05252968,-0.03718634,-0.045069184,0.024255179,-0.060522113,0.003127967,0.011878544,0.008451488,-0.059231367,-0.040026944,-0.05685113,0.061137937,0.055005167,-0.002255941,0.03895618,0.006055484,-0.018649604,-0.010597873,-0.026948689,-0.018839506,0.05203887,-0.00669831,0.006673215,-0.058832143,-0.050024193,-0.053405184,-0.046110068,0.002725136,-0.057254467,0.014156684,0.038191695,0.041142743,-0.011327894,0.051622603,-0.034095403,0.060698517,-0.04934108,0.004578101,0.036938656,0.015336457,0.03883229,0.060644493,-0.05321926,-0.045038927,0.02617775,0.04675617,0.002559422,0.047607683,-0.052365575,-0.014975386,0.038010042,0.060675237,-0.051677592,0.008062056,-0.026507901,0.03139833,-0.05996991,-0.040745977,0.058686275,-0.04363765,-0.000360449,0.050099816,-0.0377599,0.010538224,0.06097317,0.04680451,0.060133073,-0.027728323,0.0506145,0.002652711,0.05629988,-0.060523003,-0.015673654,0.015222213,0.047521286,-0.060952593,-0.012365861,0.019665457,-0.050217204,0.018854408,-0.05570594,-0.04437103,-0.024634233,-0.06057082,-0.056070596,-0.0500576,0.058417268,0.05168857,0.05807412,0.052255146,-0.061137296,0.059553355,0.04764558,0.0552543,-0.060687397,-0.051226534,0.058195047,0.020958666,0.043432314,-0.044016883,-0.000463295,0.043558132,-0.0380497,-0.054374635,0.05119167,0.05807642,-0.054587934,-0.060822316,-0.022881648,-0.0453892,0.031701118,0.060792506,-0.044462424,0.0167266,0.061137944,-0.05452825,0.018121881,0.050016053,-0.039012335,0.007664408,0.052235954,-0.016847903,-0.015896354,-0.0599639,0.037371192,0.028886748,0.05859833,0.043160923,0.06012369,0.040862273,0.05180662,0.015820801,-0.041941315,0.04030386,0.0600826,0.061020494,-0.003773508,-0.054683983,-0.051978096,-0.052183494,0.060984105,0.012801713,-0.045954634,-0.056216545,0.043391895,-0.05937366,0.003559551,0.061119728,-0.0380635,0.06065733,-0.05582513,0.011490985,-0.052010875,-0.02491444,-0.054992143,-0.060868394,-0.005469983,-0.03807314,0.059987646,0.00997827,0.038264785,-0.052719012,0.042943303,-0.018729368,-0.03380469,0.052370273,-0.059098545,0.05993959,-0.048278287,0.058218352,-0.05741594,0.061033547,0.037814885,-0.054069493,0.05847384,0.057671584,-0.035530932,-0.060231887,0.030357659,0.055073403,-0.009841501,0.014483796,0.04614327,-0.030388921,-0.0596601,-0.00289663,0.01308128,0.053398084,0.058103625,0.05109534,0.060606964,0.046797168,-0.017576916,0.05657829,0.04447273,0.02504636,-0.04001111,0.044532303,0.003571641,0.059776377,0.039633255,-0.0611375,-0.061137136,0.014944867,0.058671415,0.003481122,-0.059262834,0.024208294,0.03387091,-0.05789487,0.019328786,0.03802058,-0.04947465,-0.061137423,-0.054728154,-0.05897996,-0.00644816,0.057489246,-0.060837198,-0.059930343,0.004942764,-0.007361905,-0.055979583,0.061114147,0.045905616,0.039719302,0.055722184,-0.005743193,-0.039616402,-0.026520086,-0.06113793,0.06088401,0.048565593,0.06040205,-0.021902336,0.001549353,-0.060141593,-0.061026014,0.059429277,-0.012834937,0.023446225,0.056257874,-0.058203645,-0.04057831,-0.054237295,0.05870627,0.054618042,0.052902497,0.049068034,0.05866903,-0.05601341,-0.019150166,0.05823048,0.018994115,-0.057467397,0.031486146,-0.05469209,0.049278382,0.01284108,0.025429156,0.01698063,0.055852402,-0.049611334,-0.04958467,0.025456144,0.012363412,0.016126838,-0

The Non-structural Protein of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Disrupts the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and Induces Apoptosis,"Viruses have developed distinct strategies to overcome the host defense system. Regulation of apoptosis in response to viral infection is important for virus survival and dissemination. Like other viruses, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is known to regulate apoptosis. This study, for the first time, suggests that the non-structural protein NSs of CCHFV, a member of the genus Nairovirus, induces apoptosis. In this report, we demonstrated the expression of CCHFV NSs, which contains 150 amino acid residues, in CCHFV-infected cells. CCHFV NSs undergoes active degradation during infection. We further demonstrated that ectopic expression of CCHFV NSs induces apoptosis, as reflected by caspase-3/7 activity and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, in different cell lines that support CCHFV replication. Using specific inhibitors, we showed that CCHFV NSs induces apoptosis via both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. The minimal active region of the CCHFV NSs protein was determined to be 93–140 amino acid residues. Using alanine scanning, we demonstrated that Leu-127 and Leu-135 are the key residues for NSs-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, CCHFV NSs co-localizes in mitochondria and also disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential. We also demonstrated that Leu-127 and Leu-135 are important residues for disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential by NSs. Therefore, these results indicate that the C terminus of CCHFV NSs triggers mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, leading to activation of caspases, which, ultimately, leads to apoptosis. Given that multiple factors contribute to apoptosis during CCHFV infection, further studies are needed to define the involvement of CCHFV NSs in regulating apoptosis in infected

Evidence for an Ancestral Association of Human Coronavirus 229E with Bats,"We previously showed that close relatives of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) exist in African bats. The small sample and limited genomic characterizations have prevented further analyses so far. Here, we tested 2,087 fecal specimens from 11 bat species sampled in Ghana for HCoV-229E-related viruses by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Only hipposiderid bats tested positive. To compare the genetic diversity of bat viruses and HCoV-229E, we tested historical isolates and diagnostic specimens sampled globally over 10 years. Bat viruses were 5- and 6-fold more diversified than HCoV-229E in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and spike genes. In phylogenetic analyses, HCoV-229E strains were monophyletic and not intermixed with animal viruses. Bat viruses formed three large clades in close and more distant sister relationships. A recently described 229E-related alpaca virus occupied an intermediate phylogenetic position between bat and human viruses. According to taxonomic criteria, human, alpaca, and bat viruses form a single CoV species showing evidence for multiple recombination events. HCoV-229E and the alpaca virus showed a major deletion in the spike S1 region compared to all bat viruses. Analyses of four full genomes from 229E-related bat CoVs revealed an eighth open reading frame (ORF8) located at the genomic 3′ end. ORF8 also existed in the 229E-related alpaca virus. Reanalysis of HCoV-229E sequences showed a conserved transcription regulatory sequence preceding remnants of this ORF, suggesting its loss after acquisition of a 229E-related CoV by humans. These data suggested an evolutionary origin of 229E-related CoVs in hipposiderid bats, hypothetically with camelids as intermediate hosts preceding the establishment of HCoV-229E. IMPORTANCE The ancestral origins of major human coronaviruses (HCoVs) likely involve bat hosts. Here, we provide conclusive genetic evidence for an evolutionary origin of the common cold virus HCoV-229E in hipposiderid bats by analyzing a large sample of African bats and characterizing several bat viruses on a full-genome level. Our evolutionary analyses show that animal and human viruses are genetically closely related, can exchange genetic material, and form a single viral species. We show that the putative host switches leading to the formation of HCoV-229E were accompanied by major genomic changes, including deletions in the viral spike glycoprotein gene and loss of an open reading frame. We reanalyze a previously described genetically related alpaca virus and discuss the role of camelids as potential intermediate hosts between bat and human viruses. The evolutionary history of HCoV-229E likely shares important characteristics with that of the recently emerged highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)

"Contact tracing the first Middle East respiratory syndrome case in the Philippines, February 2015","BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an illness caused by a coronavirus in which infected persons develop severe acute respiratory illness. A person can be infected through close contacts. This is an outbreak investigation report of the first confirmed MERS case in the Philippines and the subsequent contact tracing activities. METHODS: Review of patient records and interviews with health-care personnel were done. Patient and close contacts were tested for MERS-coronavirus (CoV) by real time-polymerase chain reaction. Close contacts were identified and categorized. All traced contacts were monitored daily for appearance of illness for 14 days starting from the date of last known exposure to the confirmed case. A standard log sheet was used for symptom monitoring. RESULTS: The case was a 31-year-old female who was a health-care worker in Saudi Arabia. She had mild acute respiratory illness five days before travelling to the Philippines. On 1 February, she travelled with her husband to the Philippines while she had a fever. On 2 February, she attended a health facility in the Philippines. On 8 February, respiratory samples were tested for MERS-CoV and yielded positive results. A total of 449 close contacts were identified, and 297 (66%) were traced. Of those traced, 15 developed respiratory symptoms. All of them tested negative for MERS. DISCUSSION: In this outbreak investigation, the participation of health-care personnel in conducting vigorous contact tracing may have reduced the risk of transmission. However, being overly cautious to include more contacts for the outbreak response should be further reconsidered.",-0.060666487,0.059917383,-0.027252164,-0.004842135,0.05939317,0.005590985,0.05997248,-0.058992,0.001707546,-0.04484918,0.06153671,0.02568984,0.06028159,-0.05250791,0.061104678,-0.039436985,-0.06153671,-0.04699107,-0.053149227,0.059623506,-0.04468288,-0.027992114,0.011115606,-0.04354071,0.052936416,-0.058424763,-0.053830985,0.048247457,0.013926934,-0.008144225,0.04357189,0.06153733,-0.05556405,-0.011950443,0.057015345,-0.05454242,-0.061533418,-0.05780023,0.000992792,0.026741741,0.051644962,0.039408296,0.057247892,0.0368784,0.01732326,0.056436863,-0.024039842,0.017248817,0.059204232,-0.054308437,-0.05623144,-0.01914154,-0.04651324,-0.036890533,-0.056978073,-0.00763228,-0.059762932,0.031143181,0.060791403,0.043121506,-0.054996517,0.059134662,-0.061455533,-0.04107417,-0.029734679,-0.06084662,0.059474748,-0.042116564,0.056923732,0.058963075,0.06041275,0.011749832,-0.019487621,0.05895327,0.007084304,-0.030752856,-0.025858168,-0.039207608,-0.06145675,-0.012358765,0.052154195,0.02138417,0.043334816,0.05543877,-0.051942836,0.058155466,-0.03691262,0.057696518,-0.015101185,-0.043602906,-0.04548695,0.03849685,-0.026600447,0.04649446,-0.045748025,3.12E-06,0.049082384,0.060826972,0.05877806,-0.000102408,-0.04891422,-0.019861644,-0.037368294,0.060817663,0.04392605,0.02529785,0.058479372,-0.015771676,0.036688562,0.033526428,-0.0476352,0.05516162,-0.011639298,0.02411962,0.056433693,-4.45E-05,-0.039005257,0.055598844,-0.03708106,-0.012885059,0.04443885,0.023572853,-0.04999553,-0.060417652,-0.008543438,0.020022804,0.061426062,-0.029519713,-0.016588619,0.023639472,-0.03989393,0.06153733,0.043310255,-0.006928315,0.004187238,-0.06124132,-0.026998887,-0.00236589,0.011456731,-0.031631958,0.004545884,0.06153722,-0.06029773,0.025260005,0.02591341,0.010800434,-0.019177852,-0.055376604,0.06132556,0.011874381,-0.030992683,-0.025082182,0.022103736,-0.007596815,-0.047409568,-0.002016929,0.06040756,0.06003542,0.055760514,-0.008543931,-0.046572145,0.038672723,-0.000795655,0.013430659,-0.03265898,-0.050246574,0.04515536,0.028336627,-0.057978455,-0.02744164,0.061289515,-0.06152981,0.0510072,-0.03325539,-0.060519107,0.04246324,0.005421152,0.05532126,0.03267626,-0.02291192,-0.02491829,-0.003198382,0.011853796,0.051179904,0.051530432,0.005605517,-0.059084594,-0.032806437,-0.05545577,0.036898904,0.054266334,0.033131078,-0.028357912,-0.003843741,0.031776674,-0.036754996,-0.041767627,0.020573296,0.061520122,-0.032541174,-0.061355703,0.055721577,0.053113002,-0.007323224,0.06073212,-0.057076976,0.027372664,-0.055966962,-0.050325397,0.05017225,0.049611233,-0.01218313,0.058169823,0.061302166,-0.033931714,-0.016120262,0.04115363,0.061044056,0.043463577,0.047964096,-0.043118637,-0.054526325,0.046793126,0.05320692,0.040475275,0.0363563,-0.053178277,-0.059272226,0.03504773,0.049914613,0.045839384,0.036594633,0.054600943,-0.06153731,0.05285839,-0.012214601,0.037408214,0.026571333,-0.045662384,-0.045402717,-0.024464892,0.047967833,0.0341901,-0.04985132,0.03132502,-0.030165609,-0.06144191,0.051384896,0.045495808,-0.05993368,0.060805105,0.005585723,-0.051895663,0.03485438,0.027642256,0.027041845,-0.056315176,0.061537314,-0.034164954,0.04338938,0.02410011,0.05116724,0.029528167,-0.01905615,-0.01626478,-0.05319826,0.05948059,-0.04519814,-0.021495659,0.04671702,0.026191756,0.060754273,-0.05522698,-0.060859725,-0.021820005,-0.053434554,-0.014567161,-0.023068465,0.056713987,-0.000540897,-0.061450735,-0.045750476,0.016790094,-0.04390296,0.009329001,-0.05262114,0.030812167,-0.04173866,-0.04830697,0.011664772,-0.018177722,-0.039844655,0.06132447,-0.053396814,-0.038721718,-0.058561333,0.05288552,-0.048429545,-0.054932136,0.021171685,-0.011263338,0.003104641,0.05328288,-0.024051191,-0.059435632,0.045192167,0.060528256,-0.058752704,0.052806452,-0.01345529,-0.05139057,-0.031011516,-0.042816564,0.037071336,0.06128882,-0.05548381,0.049334902,0.036864966,0.06148875,0.059674446,-0.02465082,0.058616392,0.06067174,-0.057648264,-0.060760807,0.061498046,-0.05521858,-0.045422103,-0.06094376,-0.045991823,0.004808406,0.04020658,0.028868522,0.050563335,0.05010815,0.053956777,0.030141527,0.057998743,-0.00251889,-0.018244259,0.055754233,-0.06148515,0.057850536,0.058785927,-0.014653323,-0.061420914,0.049431883,0.05003449,-0.059935924,-0.06127784,0.03782271,0.018367764,-0.05835284,0.05563005,0.051014774,-0.060223173,-0.06153602,-0.060223237,-0.002731707,-0.031923756,0.051798783,-0.023530925,0.010875419,0.05888297,-0.026083995,-0.037185438,0.061468147,0.01768426,0.057398584,-0.026783146,0.036359545,0.057397414,-0.061212722,0.00617714,0.060565047,0.06033566,0.03996719,0.0588413,0.02129364,0.05815664,0.057219677,-0.05786417,-0.02121715,0.00460254,-0.056363847,-0.048068367,0.054022558,-0.059349798,-0.060771465,0.03266442,0.045808744,0.060720358,-0.043293957,0.05129661,-0.0599421,-0.000973639,0.05922258,-0.060763292,-0.053535696,-0.061497282,-0.05516557,0.032308307,0.005881533,0.03325858,0.014430731,-0.043166563,-0.038290158,0.034751646,0.055408522,-0.04663588,0.05857721,0.013

Cross-Protection of Influenza A Virus Infection by a DNA Aptamer Targeting the PA Endonuclease Domain,"Amino acid residues in the N-terminal of the PA subunit (PA(N)) of the influenza A virus polymerase play critical roles in endonuclease activity, protein stability, and viral RNA (vRNA) promoter binding. In addition, PA(N) is highly conserved among different subtypes of influenza virus, which suggests PA(N) to be a desired target in the development of anti-influenza agents. We selected DNA aptamers targeting the intact PA protein or the PA(N) domain of an H5N1 virus strain using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). The binding affinities of selected aptamers were measured, followed by an evaluation of in vitro endonuclease inhibitory activity. Next, the antiviral effects of enriched aptamers against influenza A virus infections were examined. A total of three aptamers targeting PA and six aptamers targeting PA(N) were selected. Our data demonstrated that all three PA-selected aptamers neither inhibited endonuclease activity nor exhibited antiviral efficacy, whereas four of the six PA(N)-selected aptamers inhibited both endonuclease activity and H5N1 virus infection. Among the four effective aptamers, one exhibited cross-protection against infections of H1N1, H5N1, H7N7, and H7N9 influenza viruses, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of around 10 nM. Notably, this aptamer was identified at the 5th round but disappeared after the 10th round of selection, suggesting that the identification and evaluation of aptamers at early rounds of selection may be highly helpful for screening effective aptamers. Overall, our study provides novel insights for screening and developing effective aptamers for use as anti-influenza

Bordetella Pertussis is an Uncommon Pathogen in Children Hospitalized with Bronchiolitis During the Winter Season,"BACKGROUND: In the United States (U.S.), Bordetella pertussis incidence has increased. Cough and apnea are common findings in pertussis and also in bronchiolitis, the most common cause of hospitalization in U.S. infants. The objective was to determine the prevalence of B. pertussis infection in children hospitalized with bronchiolitis and to describe its clinical course. METHODS: Children hospitalized with bronchiolitis and age <2 years were eligible for a prospective, multicenter cohort study during three consecutive winter seasons (November to March) from 2007 to 2010. 16 sites in 12 states participated using a standardized enrollment protocol. Families were asked the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) pertussis classification questions. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained and tested by real time polymerase chain reaction for 16 viruses, Mycoplama pneumoniae and B. pertussis. RESULTS: 2068 (94%) of 2,207 children had one or more respiratory pathogens. B. pertussis was identified in 4 children (0.2%; 95% CI, 0.1–0.5%) with 3 having a viral co-infection. All 4 were younger than four months; 2 met the CDC definition of probable pertussis, and 3 had received at least one dose of an acellular pertussis vaccine. During the hospitalization, 2 had paroxysmal cough, 1 required ICU care, and the median length of stay was 13 days. CONCLUSION: Our data support that B. pertussis is an uncommon pathogen in U.S. children hospitalized with bronchiolitis in the winter. Making a diagnosis of pertussis can be challenging because the disease can be atypical, and may not meet the CDC definition of probable infection.",-0.055792738,0.044480465,-0.05326092,0.00052683,-0.061184436,0.053550776,0.058036894,-0.048829675,-0.010547113,-0.005160415,0.062395282,0.043148328,-0.001841417,-0.021502752,0.036340065,-0.04566279,-0.062395483,-0.045728188,-0.051991235,-0.05366344,-0.06087273,-0.04964166,-0.052931387,0.005482105,-0.004972986,0.03981013,0.048100296,-0.04775124,0.061240975,-0.024646308,-0.021186898,0.062395483,0.01419664,-0.000795085,0.026504813,0.05377647,-0.06197277,-0.04973527,-0.05988442,-0.027955886,0.052383315,0.05268667,0.032287255,0.044451173,-0.02110371,0.016114268,-0.031857487,-0.033402458,-0.029876424,-0.039227106,-0.0552201,0.050814,-0.061247546,-0.053216875,-0.061093815,-0.033538833,-0.0559863,0.014923261,0.058455057,0.052870538,-0.06120675,0.006074852,0.001176189,-0.029344037,-0.011827367,-0.061954513,0.0573073,-0.061153814,0.018716028,0.055518307,0.03693226,-0.03003853,0.02985373,0.062363885,0.01961098,0.05477196,-0.04470038,-0.018696534,-0.06224313,-0.012878816,0.062274378,0.035881206,0.059085637,0.001749895,-0.026188718,0.060431283,0.005574747,-0.04207764,-0.01013689,-0.0621915,-0.055718694,-0.015638813,-0.009814957,0.036067378,-0.044349935,0.060482793,-0.009765304,0.061807416,0.059929695,-0.020552974,-0.0493829,0.039909594,0.021232741,0.015454956,0.057255734,-0.031855293,0.06026746,-0.039816923,0.05252637,-0.03177672,-0.021459728,0.022122879,-0.013527745,0.04488275,0.062346824,-0.00641494,-0.06153971,0.059320427,-0.013326971,-0.022686103,0.011824666,0.056526687,0.056974623,-0.050674226,0.04000791,0.05220343,0.022231592,0.000960751,-0.027104914,-0.022696825,-0.02025106,0.062395483,0.052273367,-0.024891896,0.030013489,-0.05963084,0.036764506,0.045877624,-0.02883333,0.017806314,0.020750428,0.062395252,-0.062249474,-0.008799871,0.026507659,-0.041535508,-0.021012396,-0.02959531,0.062112268,-0.05177593,-0.012390978,-0.002087432,-0.04795005,-0.05073685,-0.016225882,-0.002696253,0.042523224,0.04878554,0.020202136,0.037718765,0.017201915,0.06098887,-0.033988085,0.06157601,-0.00217726,-0.050762054,0.04102706,-0.047894944,-0.058648475,-0.049633108,0.06079195,-0.062337402,-0.019619849,0.055188812,0.054614242,0.004402881,-0.000467522,-0.041120954,0.016149858,-0.045719903,-0.00906135,0.05648697,0.05244527,0.061999094,0.061792724,-0.0467627,-0.05447418,-0.028495912,-0.030657908,0.022571404,0.042709783,-0.058204036,0.036620602,0.019911667,0.051336315,-0.033783462,-0.032263726,-0.008329204,0.049354617,0.016690847,-0.025819482,0.058979515,-0.025145922,-0.059070494,0.046223015,-0.05339182,0.05321401,0.05952511,-0.053028688,0.06074294,0.009854699,0.001928154,0.051717896,0.062277067,-0.02053206,0.04415035,0.061331775,0.04885632,-0.0386205,0.026989829,-0.058575556,-0.021997193,0.056045085,-0.060457323,0.053282995,-0.040564828,-0.059264813,-0.06154602,-0.021061182,0.059118576,0.027650105,0.052969024,0.059908736,-0.062395472,0.05512077,0.023148272,0.028316887,0.03932442,-0.030359806,-0.05849056,-0.004176832,0.02888327,-0.01922152,-0.060281444,0.01637259,-0.01903982,-0.054632086,0.058510087,0.039554473,-0.061093792,0.062302638,-0.058198493,-0.05537233,-0.00838109,0.05887384,0.04852161,0.016450353,0.062395472,0.04112838,-0.017818112,0.020285985,0.06049331,-0.002397479,0.02443511,-0.026107576,-0.007842615,0.052179918,-0.014295123,0.02014198,0.062111985,-0.024751836,0.05727039,-0.042859685,-0.061087072,-0.056659635,-0.053257547,0.04877431,0.054955933,0.048539795,0.001025851,-0.054021288,0.034021202,-0.016380664,0.05586922,-0.033835128,-0.002891806,-0.013176729,-0.033906333,-0.025848772,0.052935645,0.03974996,-0.045402013,0.061711054,-0.06066104,-0.053524286,-0.043672565,0.058476403,-0.049531344,-0.04537722,0.05407102,-0.03713421,0.019312428,0.017189315,-0.040635448,-0.03545178,0.039396282,0.012155742,-0.04453824,0.04570379,-0.044011217,0.035891466,-0.00964582,0.013209656,0.010847627,0.06218735,-0.05754134,0.051915035,0.045194864,0.06227899,0.001946118,-0.05019119,0.05552548,0.055389494,-0.060494754,-0.055852495,0.06234759,0.000716282,0.017659223,-0.061976723,-0.046117984,0.05921873,-0.014721738,0.006725958,0.058837596,0.058572765,0.058441818,-0.012337275,0.05857238,-0.030148385,0.045870412,0.004071857,-0.04837016,0.061655905,0.056000534,-0.049458258,-0.06236021,0.05910033,0.055001464,-0.053605508,-0.060796004,0.031245967,0.005914272,-0.015505183,0.059954803,0.05734968,-0.037993304,-0.062394775,0.01006702,-0.002131704,-0.05664452,0.025714176,-0.052024137,-0.044276584,0.0620338,-0.059151728,-0.020665612,0.06214912,-0.010335601,0.024492636,-0.020929536,-0.03686362,0.060634695,0.011510878,0.05639842,0.030918071,0.061082922,0.055360664,0.036740363,-0.011004914,-0.058018908,0.04404047,0.05424464,-0.059726432,-0.03990841,-0.038877584,-0.045585703,-0.0429837,-0.061242964,-0.050997283,0.053938255,0.048862036,0.04269512,0.05355357,0.054467235,-0.04510659,0.049147487,-0.05100202,-0.061883494,0.04137533,-0.06212646,-0.0598863,-0.007459951,0.030641692,0.019956121,0.014774784,0.055147257,-0.056204338,0.046514723,0.040386003,0.04640171,0

"Protective Efficacy of the Conserved NP, PB1, and M1 Proteins as Immunogens in DNA- and Vaccinia Virus-Based Universal Influenza A Virus Vaccines in Mice","The conventional hemagglutinin (HA)- and neuraminidase (NA)-based influenza vaccines need to be updated most years and are ineffective if the glycoprotein HA of the vaccine strains is a mismatch with that of the epidemic strain. Universal vaccines targeting conserved viral components might provide cross-protection and thus complement and improve conventional vaccines. In this study, we generated DNA plasmids and recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the conserved proteins nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase basic 1 (PB1), and matrix 1 (M1) from influenza virus strain A/Beijing/30/95 (H3N2). BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly with a single vaccine based on NP, PB1, or M1 alone or a combination vaccine based on all three antigens and were then challenged with lethal doses of the heterologous influenza virus strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). Vaccines based on NP, PB1, and M1 provided complete or partial protection against challenge with 1.7 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) of PR8 in mice. Of the three antigens, NP-based vaccines induced protection against 5 LD(50) and 10 LD(50) and thus exhibited the greatest protective effect. Universal influenza vaccines based on the combination of NP, PB1, and M1 induced a strong immune response and thus might be an alternative approach to addressing future influenza virus pandemics.",-0.03739864,-0.05578074,-0.055514455,-0.058301773,-0.0050584,0.058516774,0.0591312,-0.056168158,0.036418155,-0.013388715,0.059787497,-0.010791751,-0.053985976,-0.050986823,0.05178655,-0.05725912,-0.05978749,-0.059593014,0.039060846,-0.031534966,-0.009931093,-0.049004056,-0.05972645,0.059771955,0.05483789,0.059322312,0.052114934,-0.045351923,0.05762036,0.047785886,0.055814642,0.0597875,-0.016180148,0.043269772,0.059659604,0.056888998,-0.05663281,-0.051399935,-0.059236854,-0.055848666,0.017586313,0.051345363,-0.02533907,-0.001162105,-0.007995334,0.031120086,-0.04534494,-0.023091247,-0.006596528,0.04708443,-0.056926645,-0.03967748,-0.05938329,-0.037624843,-0.05977566,0.031171355,-0.05352939,-0.05618958,-0.048960246,-0.007688994,-0.02903967,0.05510814,0.011596344,-0.024864368,0.02864999,-0.035730913,0.059633818,0.010492016,-0.000767881,0.05698109,0.019312268,0.058316614,-0.05766136,0.059045732,-0.001861584,0.017838284,0.017002523,-0.05703879,-0.059755933,0.00849036,0.058626264,-0.001365588,0.013259168,-0.047487676,-0.04000496,0.049046073,-0.027280947,0.014801346,-0.046928704,-0.04176206,-0.04481689,-0.012092487,-0.0591069,0.05402956,0.020810064,0.055929154,0.05721759,0.05744051,0.05875566,-0.056113876,-0.03474572,0.022284612,0.05809713,0.005497313,0.054356236,-0.04574063,0.052861918,0.05062621,-0.046076324,-0.057672482,0.03099635,-0.0206042,0.039148256,0.05214912,0.059752926,-0.019021023,-0.05896557,-0.006082208,-0.05679244,0.03640739,-0.036580037,-0.002789632,0.05779215,-0.003709132,0.018690215,-0.010601985,0.011053597,-0.002711687,-0.05628098,-0.012735293,-0.058839735,0.0597875,0.058470804,-0.04437916,0.020290956,-0.036972843,0.025363063,0.0585238,0.02398872,0.056495544,0.05974549,0.059786867,-0.04059664,0.047150027,-0.005239596,0.01593784,0.05632683,-0.0590391,0.058683112,0.058788687,0.05421347,0.004708024,-0.05560759,-0.053971387,0.059657205,0.051049497,0.045699004,0.046843827,0.016788594,0.059749633,0.054552387,0.047047492,0.05415216,0.059683733,0.051664364,-0.051812712,-0.05789184,-0.027951792,-0.030021662,-0.041875437,-0.003081545,-0.059590228,-0.057972368,0.05867063,0.045002263,-0.027590055,0.05654225,-0.023909647,-0.006087407,-0.054566644,-0.052011784,-0.013402633,0.043933272,0.02642291,0.059147343,-0.05965679,-0.009085364,-0.03999405,-0.009775044,-0.049457166,0.053334936,-0.057722583,0.020017128,0.039230403,0.058756378,0.034613755,0.027814535,0.007463088,0.054134823,-0.043027617,-0.026830245,0.05365492,-0.005699156,0.011719133,0.017869646,-0.05913214,-0.030131614,0.053109143,-0.023412585,0.059712324,-0.00183849,0.05094491,0.048973545,0.055404633,-0.05945398,0.03407047,0.05976166,0.057642158,-0.058198377,0.057594687,-0.018573413,-0.056901332,0.05901823,-0.040150426,0.01355288,0.03806935,-0.04622397,-0.05644767,0.012946679,-0.024306074,-0.05774249,0.036123253,0.05921278,-0.059782743,0.041095085,0.03878412,0.02927673,-0.051208194,0.023927057,-0.004716287,0.04524454,-0.05184198,-0.05465953,-0.0595016,0.052468505,-0.04841926,-0.048100013,0.054122567,0.049078364,-0.05828205,0.043358207,-0.015401552,0.018076103,-0.017895967,-0.019019993,0.026485758,-0.059071325,0.059787486,0.052716024,-0.057069156,0.023171267,0.027294416,-0.009949144,0.056924153,-0.027003584,-0.056902613,0.04898246,0.049719974,0.059466112,0.059745707,0.01422957,0.059548322,0.04338045,-0.05737294,-0.049870744,-0.053829946,0.05944046,0.034625206,0.059352383,0.05318941,0.029810626,0.014387668,0.02319431,0.009676549,-0.043195263,-0.034316793,-0.05968537,0.05216345,-0.051193073,0.054169524,0.05941783,-0.02592618,0.05970748,-0.051337514,0.002513459,0.002315969,0.059550986,-0.050765373,-0.052778274,0.058377728,-0.05708076,0.000924955,-0.012781805,0.032408364,-0.027973795,-0.04851265,-0.023613313,0.03634121,0.039065264,0.041246146,0.059410654,-0.010291884,-0.052397095,-0.050918568,0.059756543,0.024830434,0.041363906,0.056385078,0.02281284,-0.00104653,-0.003653564,0.019510623,0.057174634,-0.021758249,-0.040157612,0.059787355,-0.03439615,0.059659936,-0.056108244,-0.059546556,0.059473276,0.034140024,0.05471538,0.0596041,0.037864383,0.04553602,0.058726285,0.057044234,0.000253681,0.002137499,0.03613262,0.02908966,0.059786685,0.005389679,-0.05952814,-0.059786685,-0.002375194,0.059558928,0.05333813,-0.059323,0.04906509,0.047850683,0.04009881,0.016073763,0.053077433,0.03138645,-0.05976126,-0.003410775,-0.0512901,-0.05812622,0.042604875,-0.032106582,-0.026617736,0.039647665,0.002417547,-0.054696366,0.05962723,0.005116894,-0.054344162,0.057955485,-0.04418015,0.03562992,-0.046935182,-0.05959429,0.059667416,0.038056813,0.05962587,0.013455915,0.05977777,-0.059534226,-0.028205268,-0.04976494,-0.058823828,0.05868411,0.0060726,-0.042813573,-0.058304183,-0.05977722,-0.024466546,0.055480808,-0.00802291,-0.053991895,0.047199316,-0.057001546,-0.05517685,-0.005098392,0.005926894,-0.03250982,0.003864517,-0.006415794,0.05615127,0.04683459,-0.029968992,0.058633875,-0.046971265,-0.003417432,-0.015776856,0.021130776,0.01809733,-0.030827988,0.022074878,0.003871245

Mutations in Coronavirus Nonstructural Protein 10 Decrease Virus Replication Fidelity,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are unique in encoding a 3′→5′ exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is required for high-fidelity replication, likely via proofreading. nsp14 associates with the CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12-RdRp), and nsp14-ExoN activity is enhanced by binding nsp10, a small nonenzymatic protein. However, it is not known whether nsp10 functions in the regulation of CoV replication fidelity. To test this, we engineered single and double alanine substitution mutations into the genome of murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) containing ExoN activity [ExoN(+)] at positions within nsp10 known to disrupt the nsp10-nsp14 interaction in vitro. We show that an nsp10 mutant, R80A/E82A-ExoN(+), was five to ten times more sensitive to treatment with the RNA mutagen 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) than wild-type (WT)-ExoN(+), suggestive of decreased replication fidelity. This decreased-fidelity phenotype was confirmed using two additional nucleoside analogs, 5-azacytidine and ribavirin. R80A/E82A-ExoN(+) reached a peak titer similar to and demonstrated RNA synthesis kinetics comparable to those seen with WT-ExoN(+). No change in 5-FU sensitivity was observed for R80A/E82A-ExoN(−) relative to MHV-ExoN(−), indicating that the decreased-fidelity phenotype of R80A/E82A-ExoN(−) is linked to the presence of ExoN activity. Our results demonstrate that nsp10 is important for CoV replication fidelity and support the hypothesis that nsp10 functions to regulate nsp14-ExoN activity during virus replication. IMPORTANCE The adaptive capacity of CoVs, as well as all other RNA viruses, is partially attributed to the presence of extensive population genetic diversity. However, decreased fidelity is detrimental to CoV replication and virulence; mutant CoVs with decreased replication fidelity are attenuated and more sensitive to inhibition by RNA mutagens. Thus, identifying the viral protein determinants of CoV fidelity is important for understanding CoV replication, pathogenesis, and virulence. In this report, we show that nsp10, a small, nonenzymatic viral protein, contributes to CoV replication fidelity. Our data support the hypothesis that CoVs have evolved multiple proteins, in addition to nsp14-ExoN, that are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the largest known RNA

Influenza A Virus Protein PA-X Contributes to Viral Growth and Suppression of the Host Antiviral and Immune Responses,"Influenza virus infection causes global inhibition of host protein synthesis in infected cells. This host shutoff is thought to allow viruses to escape from the host antiviral response, which restricts virus replication and spread. Although the mechanism of host shutoff is unclear, a novel viral protein expressed by ribosomal frameshifting, PA-X, was found to play a major role in influenza virus-induced host shutoff. However, little is known about the impact of PA-X expression on currently circulating influenza A virus pathogenicity and the host antiviral response. In this study, we rescued a recombinant influenza A virus, A/California/04/09 (H1N1, Cal), containing mutations at the frameshift motif in the polymerase PA gene (Cal PA-XFS). Cal PA-XFS expressed significantly less PA-X than Cal wild type (WT). Cal WT, but not Cal PA-XFS, induced degradation of host β-actin mRNA and suppressed host protein synthesis, supporting the idea that PA-X induces host shutoff via mRNA decay. Moreover, Cal WT inhibited beta interferon (IFN-β) expression and replicated more rapidly than Cal PA-XFS in human respiratory cells. Mice infected with Cal PA-XFS had significantly lower levels of viral growth and greater expression of IFN-β mRNA in their lungs than mice infected with Cal WT. Importantly, more antihemagglutinin and neutralizing antibodies were produced in Cal PA-XFS-infected mice than in Cal WT-infected mice, despite the lower level of virus replication in the lungs. Our data indicate that PA-X of the pandemic H1N1 virus has a strong impact on viral growth and the host innate and acquired immune responses to influenza virus. IMPORTANCE Virus-induced host protein shutoff is considered to be a major factor allowing viruses to evade innate and acquired immune recognition. We provide evidence that the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus protein PA-X plays a role in virus replication and inhibition of host antiviral response by means of its host protein synthesis shutoff activity both in vitro and in vivo. We also demonstrated that, while the growth of Cal PA-XFS was attenuated in the lungs of infected animals, this mutant induced a stronger humoral response than Cal WT. Our findings clearly highlight the importance of PA-X in counteracting the host innate and acquired immune responses to influenza virus, an important global pathogen. This work demonstrates that inhibition of PA-X expression in influenza virus vaccine strains may provide a novel way of safely attenuating viral growth while inducing a more robust immune

Early Detection of Dengue Virus by Use of Reverse Transcription-Recombinase Polymerase Amplification,"A method for the rapid diagnosis of early dengue virus (DENV) infection is highly needed. Here, a prototype reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay was developed. The assay detected DENV RNA in <20 min without the need for thermocycling amplification. The assay enabled the detection of as few as 10 copies of DENV RNA. The designed RT-RPA primers and exo probe detected the DENV genome of at least 12 genotypes of DENV circulating globally without cross-reacting with other arboviruses. We assessed the diagnostic performance of the RT-RPA assay for the detection of DENV RNA in 203 serum samples of patients with clinically suspected dengue. The sera were simultaneously tested for DENV using a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and IgM- and IgG-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Acute DENV infection was confirmed in 130 samples and 61 of the samples (46.9%) were classified as viremic with qRT-PCR. The RT-RPA assay showed good concordance (κ of ≥0.723) with the RT-LAMP and qRT-PCR assays in detecting the dengue viremic samples. When used in combination with ELISA, both the RT-RPA and RT-LAMP assays increased the detection of acute DENV infection to ≥95.7% (≥45/47) in samples obtained within 5 days of illness. The results from the study suggest that the RT-RPA assay is the most rapid molecular diagnostic tool available for the detection of DENV. Hence, it is possible to use the RT-RPA assay in a laboratory to complement routine serology testing for

Perturbation in the Conserved Methyltransferase-Polymerase Interface of Flavivirus NS5 Differentially Affects Polymerase Initiation and Elongation,"The flavivirus NS5 is a natural fusion of a methyltransferase (MTase) and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). Analogous to DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, the NS5 polymerase initiates RNA synthesis through a de novo mechanism and then makes a transition to a processive elongation phase. However, whether and how the MTase affects polymerase activities through intramolecular interactions remain elusive. By solving the crystal structure of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) NS5, we recently identified an MTase-RdRP interface containing a set of six hydrophobic residues highly conserved among flaviviruses. To dissect the functional relevance of this interface, we made a series of JEV NS5 constructs with mutations of these hydrophobic residues and/or with the N-terminal first 261 residues and other residues up to the first 303 residues deleted. Compared to the wild-type (WT) NS5, full-length NS5 variants exhibited consistent up- or downregulation of the initiation activities in two types of polymerase assays. Five representative full-length NS5 constructs were then tested in an elongation assay, from which the apparent single-nucleotide incorporation rate constant was estimated. Interestingly, two constructs exhibited different elongation kinetics from the WT NS5, with an effect rather opposite to what was observed at initiation. Moreover, constructs with MTase and/or the linker region (residues 266 to 275) removed still retained polymerase activities, albeit at overall lower levels. However, further removal of the N-terminal extension (residues 276 to 303) abolished regular template-directed synthesis. Together, our data showed that the MTase-RdRP interface is relevant in both polymerase initiation and elongation, likely with different regulation mechanisms in these two major phases of RNA synthesis. IMPORTANCE The flavivirus NS5 is very unique in having a methyltransferase (MTase) placed on the immediate N terminus of its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). We recently solved the crystal structure of the full-length NS5, which revealed a conserved interface between MTase and RdRP. Building on this discovery, here we carried out in vitro polymerase assays to address the functional relevance of the interface interactions. By explicitly probing polymerase initiation and elongation activities, we found that perturbation in the MTase-RdRP interface had different impacts on different phases of synthesis, suggesting that the roles and contribution of the interface interactions may change upon phase transitions. By comparing the N-terminal-truncated enzymes with the full-length NS5, we collected data to indicate the indispensability to regular polymerase activities of a region that was functionally unclarified previously. Taken together, we provide biochemical evidence and mechanistic insights for the cross talk between the two enzyme modules of flavivirus

Hepatitis B Virus Polymerase Disrupts K63-Linked Ubiquitination of STING To Block Innate Cytosolic DNA-Sensing Pathways,"The cellular innate immune system recognizing pathogen infection is essential for host defense against viruses. In parallel, viruses have developed a variety of strategies to evade the innate immunity. The hepatitis B virus (HBV), a DNA virus that causes chronic hepatitis, has been shown to inhibit RNA helicase RIG-I-mediated interferon (IFN) induction. However, it is still unknown whether HBV could affect the host DNA-sensing pathways. Here we report that in transiently HBV-transfected Huh7 cells, the stably HBV-producing cell line HepAD38, and HBV-infected HepaRG cells and primary human hepatocytes, HBV markedly interfered with IFN-β induction and antiviral immunity mediated by the stimulator of interferon genes (STING), which has been identified as a central factor in foreign DNA recognition and antiviral innate immunity. Screening analysis demonstrated that the viral polymerase (Pol), but not other HBV-encoded proteins, was able to inhibit STING-stimulated interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation and IFN-β induction. Moreover, the reverse transcriptase (RT) and the RNase H (RH) domains of Pol were identified to be responsible for the inhibitory effects. Furthermore, Pol was shown to physically associate with STING and dramatically decrease the K63-linked polyubiquitination of STING via its RT domain without altering the expression level of STING. Taken together, these observations suggest that besides its inherent catalytic function, Pol has a role in suppression of IFN-β production by direct interaction with STING and subsequent disruption of its K63-linked ubiquitination, providing a new mechanism for HBV to counteract the innate DNA-sensing pathways. IMPORTANCE Although whether and how HBV infection induces the innate immune responses are still controversial, it has become increasingly clear that HBV has developed strategies to counteract the pattern recognition receptor-mediated signaling pathways. Previous studies have shown that type I IFN induction activated by the host RNA sensors could be inhibited by HBV. However, it remains unknown whether HBV as a DNA virus utilizes evasion mechanisms against foreign DNA-elicited antiviral signaling. In recent years, the cytosolic DNA sensor and key adaptor STING has been demonstrated to be essential in multiple foreign DNA-elicited innate immune signalings. Here, for the first time, we report STING as a new target of HBV to antagonize IFN induction and identify the viral polymerase responsible for the inhibitory effect, thus providing an additional molecular mechanism by which HBV evades the innate immunity; this implies that in addition to its inherent catalytic function, HBV polymerase is a multifunctional immunomodulatory

Structural Dynamics as a Contributor to Error-prone Replication by an RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase,"RNA viruses encoding high- or low-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) are attenuated. The ability to predict residues of the RdRp required for faithful incorporation of nucleotides represents an essential step in any pipeline intended to exploit perturbed fidelity as the basis for rational design of vaccine candidates. We used x-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, NMR spectroscopy, and pre-steady-state kinetics to compare a mutator (H273R) RdRp from poliovirus to the wild-type (WT) enzyme. We show that the nucleotide-binding site toggles between the nucleotide binding-occluded and nucleotide binding-competent states. The conformational dynamics between these states were enhanced by binding to primed template RNA. For the WT, the occluded conformation was favored; for H273R, the competent conformation was favored. The resonance for Met-187 in our NMR spectra reported on the ability of the enzyme to check the correctness of the bound nucleotide. Kinetic experiments were consistent with the conformational dynamics contributing to the established pre-incorporation conformational change and fidelity checkpoint. For H273R, residues comprising the active site spent more time in the catalytically competent conformation and were more positively correlated than the WT. We propose that by linking the equilibrium between the binding-occluded and binding-competent conformations of the nucleotide-binding pocket and other active-site dynamics to the correctness of the bound nucleotide, faithful nucleotide incorporation is achieved. These studies underscore the need to apply multiple biophysical and biochemical approaches to the elucidation of the physical basis for polymerase fidelity.",-0.034693092,-0.03822935,-0.060601015,-0.038687423,0.039418593,0.04146044,0.001665677,-0.04727906,-0.042138707,0.058147267,0.014534402,0.020992978,0.003813063,-0.02368173,0.05912057,-0.06286708,0.002536844,0.0360924,0.038007796,0.019774612,-0.037004367,0.055006377,-0.03692623,0.061127886,0.054345652,0.04657647,0.040341128,0.060298394,-0.047189824,-0.044644788,0.026569605,-0.05930779,-0.03249119,0.042609133,-0.059900757,-0.014557954,-0.06282935,-0.016924813,-0.046151802,0.04335273,-0.04379548,-0.054163817,-0.02279678,-0.05182953,0.06272363,0.045195766,0.010999827,0.004958404,0.052168973,-0.04911129,-0.05227115,0.004794764,-0.061176836,-0.056520175,-0.057972856,0.025209969,-0.03247234,-0.006668457,0.060841005,-0.060087167,-0.043119293,-0.024429996,0.05275633,-0.041514248,-0.00897576,-0.062109996,0.06250474,0.059813928,0.050480153,0.002018622,0.024837561,0.06018799,-0.034222238,0.038004532,-0.04245045,0.054421384,-0.021394141,-0.014384397,-0.04286982,0.041776363,-0.057443857,0.062375747,0.005415,-0.042922594,-0.03972484,0.047386892,-0.019241689,-0.027254893,-0.03216755,0.016027046,-0.044106625,0.02243124,-0.05805989,-0.004212625,0.006096775,0.033349738,0.042115167,0.06185948,0.06266287,-0.03816895,0.006190503,0.0413041,0.049027417,0.019730244,0.061144557,-0.014602096,0.012981537,-0.01942467,-0.049493924,-0.024524787,0.054882497,0.06052458,-0.00915711,-0.019623572,0.05523931,0.058919184,-0.061371133,0.03880753,-0.043128375,-0.007003628,-0.030311387,0.049989957,0.03609526,-0.05870772,0.028283704,0.06028413,-0.03913208,0.015773578,0.030530797,0.028693931,-0.0456725,0.06293981,0.061706863,0.012671016,-0.027165452,-0.003874035,0.056705795,0.055478346,-0.054730598,-0.003821376,0.021291018,0.062939,-0.056004576,-0.05468499,0.00286287,-0.06007143,0.039042633,-0.059115857,0.03949138,0.043819264,0.04346204,0.006086592,-0.025077568,-0.053759564,0.06294161,0.059613597,0.012519366,0.059386205,0.05279702,-0.04969783,-0.05744408,-0.014187722,-0.005352817,0.03837694,-0.051622994,0.015935445,-0.061176833,0.050531425,-0.047200385,-0.053357907,0.012904057,0.05293895,-0.023295235,-0.018945223,0.047386117,-0.043811772,-0.003257421,0.034050412,0.06270952,0.013450181,-0.05496348,0.054044362,0.03922591,-0.006899552,0.04512955,-0.008025817,-0.059878476,0.05504885,0.061144363,-0.011514575,0.062434837,-0.04973968,0.031198772,0.027854472,0.05311771,-0.061111335,-0.039764006,-0.056735206,0.043565683,-0.05962386,0.047441233,0.01506581,-0.03215466,0.0621336,0.062726416,-0.06095525,-0.009566451,0.060210023,0.040294796,-0.024363104,-0.046842948,0.04285838,0.05853485,0.058484834,-0.061689153,-0.055598903,0.007349956,0.001348624,-0.051097408,0.043463428,0.020023435,-0.022079587,-0.044251386,-0.01958562,-0.02857914,-0.03747664,-0.062397394,0.043246087,-0.055983055,0.057120904,0.022815932,0.016676052,0.023501234,-0.062905096,0.062330265,-0.016149122,-0.021204207,-0.052946627,-0.057545055,0.060323633,0.030758115,-0.052855764,-0.05246304,-0.026947768,0.048607264,-0.009501739,-0.009510381,-0.002330436,0.043596722,-0.013497779,-0.059531335,0.04982443,0.0122578,0.03833045,0.032551687,-0.05087192,-0.059729133,0.062941656,0.043920606,0.02748281,0.013034166,-0.004007239,0.02069413,0.060469374,0.03513349,0.024398148,-0.060916007,-0.017906114,0.018474203,-0.008453401,0.060192276,0.06228569,0.060708877,0.062801726,0.006850119,-0.017798891,0.03269676,0.016345318,0.062607855,-0.054254647,-0.06170784,-0.05011985,-0.054384056,0.048388455,-0.042114474,-0.026717413,-0.0570236,0.06187085,-0.013160795,-0.024629047,0.061008725,0.06038841,0.059490353,0.004444147,0.044241827,-0.03664007,-0.003021264,-0.011018465,-0.061643492,-0.048235275,-0.021815967,0.062154744,0.05426154,0.046808977,-0.05802551,0.059840027,-0.06097223,-0.06163728,0.0624929,-0.06168006,0.054357298,0.002055474,0.056466825,-0.061833926,0.062600955,0.017065305,0.03896486,-0.001748989,0.049470894,-0.059672832,-0.05504545,0.036170237,0.006335094,-0.0618516,0.05023098,-0.03999953,-0.057094187,-0.061859876,-0.01264563,-0.04541361,-0.051783852,-0.024075162,0.05216025,0.06289139,0.00720186,0.012848162,0.04931412,0.05934003,0.05773644,-0.02428257,-0.05863877,0.032589886,-0.00038951,0.023264911,-0.06294157,-0.062910326,0.031342905,0.062716335,-0.057484083,-0.055144526,0.009893599,-0.022552406,-0.0627101,0.036217064,0.032833192,0.041829657,-0.062940165,-0.025378862,-0.006059527,-0.058080703,0.049305428,-0.05818152,-0.060999762,0.044108767,0.02536989,-0.00814401,0.06271119,0.030227194,0.060189173,0.05161295,-0.047232557,-0.052418545,-0.04816822,-0.062941656,0.061371196,0.057445303,0.03575981,-0.03515067,-0.008751354,-0.060637534,-0.06262043,0.06282865,0.031698067,-0.044275783,-0.057770524,-0.053723637,-0.058808982,-0.0601975,0.055308886,0.056213554,0.033181388,0.028888857,0.049025398,-0.03828417,0.054930054,0.029526642,0.060513135,-0.062512174,-0.003998128,-0.04000508,0.035246998,-0.044527337,0.04358124,0.044171378,-0.051937304,-0.056610625,0.01275906,0.026501674,0.05310874,0.04701473,0.0371188,-0.0454

Methyltransferase-Defective Avian Metapneumovirus Vaccines Provide Complete Protection against Challenge with the Homologous Colorado Strain and the Heterologous Minnesota Strain,"Avian metapneumovirus (aMPV), also known as avian pneumovirus or turkey rhinotracheitis virus, is the causative agent of turkey rhinotracheitis and is associated with swollen head syndrome in chickens. Since its discovery in the 1970s, aMPV has been recognized as an economically important pathogen in the poultry industry worldwide. The conserved region VI (CR VI) of the large (L) polymerase proteins of paramyxoviruses catalyzes methyltransferase (MTase) activities that typically methylate viral mRNAs at guanine N-7 (G-N-7) and ribose 2′-O positions. In this study, we generated a panel of recombinant aMPV (raMPV) Colorado strains carrying mutations in the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) binding site in the CR VI of L protein. These recombinant viruses were specifically defective in ribose 2′-O, but not G-N-7 methylation and were genetically stable and highly attenuated in cell culture and viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) young turkeys. Importantly, turkeys vaccinated with these MTase-defective raMPVs triggered a high level of neutralizing antibody and were completely protected from challenge with homologous aMPV Colorado strain and heterologous aMPV Minnesota strain. Collectively, our results indicate (i) that aMPV lacking 2′-O methylation is highly attenuated in vitro and in vivo and (ii) that inhibition of mRNA cap MTase can serve as a novel target to rationally design live attenuated vaccines for aMPV and perhaps other paramyxoviruses. IMPORTANCE Paramyxoviruses include many economically and agriculturally important viruses such as avian metapneumovirus (aMPV), and Newcastle disease virus (NDV), human pathogens such as human respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, human parainfluenza virus type 3, and measles virus, and highly lethal emerging pathogens such as Nipah virus and Hendra virus. For many of them, there is no effective vaccine or antiviral drug. These viruses share common strategies for viral gene expression and replication. During transcription, paramyxoviruses produce capped, methylated, and polyadenylated mRNAs. Using aMPV as a model, we found that viral ribose 2′-O methyltransferase (MTase) is a novel approach to rationally attenuate the virus for vaccine purpose. Recombinant aMPV (raMPV) lacking 2′-O MTase were not only highly attenuated in turkeys but also provided complete protection against the challenge of homologous and heterologous aMPV strains. This novel approach can be applicable to other animal and human paramyxoviruses for rationally designing live attenuated

Influenza A Virus Polymerase Is a Site for Adaptive Changes during Experimental Evolution in Bat Cells,"The recent identification of highly divergent influenza A viruses in bats revealed a new, geographically dispersed viral reservoir. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of host-restricted viral tropism and the potential for transmission of viruses between humans and bats, we exposed a panel of cell lines from bats of diverse species to a prototypical human-origin influenza A virus. All of the tested bat cell lines were susceptible to influenza A virus infection. Experimental evolution of human and avian-like viruses in bat cells resulted in efficient replication and created highly cytopathic variants. Deep sequencing of adapted human influenza A virus revealed a mutation in the PA polymerase subunit not previously described, M285K. Recombinant virus with the PA M285K mutation completely phenocopied the adapted virus. Adaptation of an avian virus-like virus resulted in the canonical PB2 E627K mutation that is required for efficient replication in other mammals. None of the adaptive mutations occurred in the gene for viral hemagglutinin, a gene that frequently acquires changes to recognize host-specific variations in sialic acid receptors. We showed that human influenza A virus uses canonical sialic acid receptors to infect bat cells, even though bat influenza A viruses do not appear to use these receptors for virus entry. Our results demonstrate that bats are unique hosts that select for both a novel mutation and a well-known adaptive mutation in the viral polymerase to support replication. IMPORTANCE Bats constitute well-known reservoirs for viruses that may be transferred into human populations, sometimes with fatal consequences. Influenza A viruses have recently been identified in bats, dramatically expanding the known host range of this virus. Here we investigated the replication of human influenza A virus in bat cell lines and the barriers that the virus faces in this new host. Human influenza A and B viruses infected cells from geographically and evolutionarily diverse New and Old World bats. Viruses mutated during infections in bat cells, resulting in increased replication and cytopathic effects. These mutations were mapped to the viral polymerase and shown to be solely responsible for adaptation to bat cells. Our data suggest that replication of human influenza A viruses in a nonnative host drives the evolution of new variants and may be an important source of genetic

Interactome Analysis of the Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus RNA Polymerase Complex Identifies Protein Chaperones as Important Cofactors That Promote L-Protein Stability and RNA Synthesis,"The human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) core viral RNA polymerase comprises the large polymerase protein (L) and its cofactor, the phosphoprotein (P), which associate with the viral ribonucleoprotein complex to replicate the genome and, together with the M2-1 protein, transcribe viral mRNAs. While cellular proteins have long been proposed to be involved in the synthesis of HRSV RNA by associating with the polymerase complex, their characterization has been hindered by the difficulty of purifying the viral polymerase from mammalian cell culture. In this study, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged L- and P-protein expression was coupled with high-affinity anti-GFP antibody-based immunoprecipitation and quantitative proteomics to identify cellular proteins that interacted with either the L- or the P-proteins when expressed as part of a biologically active viral RNP. Several core groups of cellular proteins were identified that interacted with each viral protein including, in both cases, protein chaperones. Ablation of chaperone activity by using small-molecule inhibitors confirmed previously reported studies which suggested that this class of proteins acted as positive viral factors. Inhibition of HSP90 chaperone function in the current study showed that HSP90 is critical for L-protein function and stability, whether in the presence or absence of the P-protein. Inhibition studies suggested that HSP70 also disrupts virus biology and might help the polymerase remodel the nucleocapsid to allow RNA synthesis to occur efficiently. This indicated a proviral role for protein chaperones in HRSV replication and demonstrates that the function of cellular proteins can be targeted as potential therapeutics to disrupt virus replication. IMPORTANCE Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) represents a major health care and economic burden, being the main cause of severe respiratory infections in infants worldwide. No vaccine or effective therapy is available. This study focused on identifying those cellular proteins that potentially interact specifically with the viral proteins that are central to virus replication and transcription, with a view to providing potential targets for the development of a specific, transient therapeutic which disrupts virus biology but prevents the emergence of resistance, while maintaining cell viability. In particular, protein chaperones (heat shock proteins 70 and 90), which aid protein folding and function, were identified. The mechanism by which these chaperones contribute to virus biology was tested, and this study demonstrates to the field that cellular protein chaperones may be required for maintaining the correct folding and therefore functionality of specific proteins within the virus replication

Rational Design of Human Metapneumovirus Live Attenuated Vaccine Candidates by Inhibiting Viral mRNA Cap Methyltransferase,"The paramyxoviruses human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hPIV3) are responsible for the majority of pediatric respiratory diseases and inflict significant economic loss, health care costs, and emotional burdens. Despite major efforts, there are no vaccines available for these viruses. The conserved region VI (CR VI) of the large (L) polymerase proteins of paramyxoviruses catalyzes methyltransferase (MTase) activities that typically methylate viral mRNAs at positions guanine N-7 (G-N-7) and ribose 2′-O. In this study, we generated a panel of recombinant hMPVs carrying mutations in the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site in CR VI of L protein. These recombinant viruses were specifically defective in ribose 2′-O methylation but not G-N-7 methylation and were genetically stable and highly attenuated in cell culture and viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of cotton rats. Importantly, vaccination of cotton rats with these recombinant hMPVs (rhMPVs) with defective MTases triggered a high level of neutralizing antibody, and the rats were completely protected from challenge with wild-type rhMPV. Collectively, our results indicate that (i) amino acid residues in the SAM binding site in the hMPV L protein are essential for 2′-O methylation and (ii) inhibition of mRNA cap MTase can serve as a novel target to rationally design live attenuated vaccines for hMPV and perhaps other paramyxoviruses, such as hRSV and hPIV3. IMPORTANCE Human paramyxoviruses, including hRSV, hMPV, and hPIV3, cause the majority of acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in humans, particularly in infants, children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Currently, there is no licensed vaccine available. A formalin-inactivated vaccine is not suitable for these viruses because it causes enhanced lung damage upon reinfection with the same virus. A live attenuated vaccine is the most promising vaccine strategy for human paramyxoviruses. However, it remains a challenge to identify an attenuated virus strain that has an optimal balance between attenuation and immunogenicity. Using reverse genetics, we generated a panel of recombinant hMPVs that were specifically defective in ribose 2′-O methyltransferase (MTase) but not G-N-7 MTase. These MTase-defective hMPVs were genetically stable and sufficiently attenuated but retained high immunogenicity.

"RNA Virus Population Diversity, an Optimum for Maximal Fitness and Virulence","The ability of an RNA virus to exist as a population of genetically distinct variants permits the virus to overcome events during infections that would otherwise limit virus multiplication or drive the population to extinction. Viral genetic diversity is created by the ribonucleotide misincorporation frequency of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We have identified a poliovirus (PV) RdRp derivative (H273R) possessing a mutator phenotype. GMP misincorporation efficiency for H273R RdRp in vitro was increased by 2–3-fold that manifested in a 2–3-fold increase in the diversity of the H273R PV population in cells. Circular sequencing analysis indicated that some mutations were RdRp-independent. Consistent with the population genetics theory, H273R PV was driven to extinction more easily than WT in cell culture. Furthermore, we observed a substantial reduction in H273R PV virulence, measured as the ability to cause paralysis in the cPVR mouse model. Reduced virulence correlated with the inability of H273R PV to sustain replication in tissues/organs in which WT persists. Despite the attenuated phenotype, H273R PV was capable of replicating in mice to levels sufficient to induce a protective immune response, even when the infecting dose used was insufficient to elicit any visual signs of infection. We conclude that optimal RdRp fidelity is a virulence determinant that can be targeted for viral attenuation or antiviral therapies, and we suggest that the RdRp may not be the only source of mutations in a RNA virus

Severity of Rhinovirus Infection in Hospitalized Adults Is Unrelated to Genotype,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether rhinovirus (RV) species is associated with more severe clinical illness in adults. METHODS: Seventy-two RV-positive viral respiratory samples from adult patients were sequenced and analyzed phylogenetically after reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of the region spanning the VP4 gene and 5′ terminus of the VP2 gene. The clinical features and severity of illness associated with the different RV species were compared. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis identified three distinct clusters as RV-A (54%), B (11%), or C (35%) species. In an unadjusted model, patients with RV-B infection were significantly more likely to have the composite outcome variable of death or intensive care unit admission (P = .03), but this effect diminished when controlling for patient sex. A logistic model of the relationship between RV species and adverse outcomes produced nonsignificant odds ratios when controlling for patient sex. CONCLUSIONS: Infection with RV-A or RV-B was associated with greater severity of illness in our adult population; however, the association disappeared after controlling for

Respiratory Syncytial Virus Increases the Virulence of Streptococcus pneumoniae by Binding to Penicillin Binding Protein 1a. A New Paradigm in Respiratory Infection,"Rationale: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Streptococcus pneumoniae are major respiratory pathogens. Coinfection with RSV and S. pneumoniae is associated with severe and often fatal pneumonia but the molecular basis for this remains unclear. Objectives: To determine if interaction between RSV and pneumococci enhances pneumococcal virulence. Methods: We used confocal microscopy and Western blot to identify the receptors involved in direct binding of RSV and pneumococci, the effects of which were studied in both in vivo and in vitro models of infection. Human ciliated respiratory epithelial cell cultures were infected with RSV for 72 hours and then challenged with pneumococci. Pneumococci were collected after 2 hours exposure and changes in gene expression determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Measurements and Main Results: Following incubation with RSV or purified G protein, pneumococci demonstrated a significant increase in the inflammatory response and bacterial adherence to human ciliated epithelial cultures and markedly increased virulence in a pneumonia model in mice. This was associated with extensive changes in the pneumococcal transcriptome and significant up-regulation in the expression of key pneumococcal virulence genes, including the gene for the pneumococcal toxin, pneumolysin. We show that mechanistically this is caused by RSV G glycoprotein binding penicillin binding protein 1a. Conclusions: The direct interaction between a respiratory virus protein and the pneumococcus resulting in increased bacterial virulence and worsening disease outcome is a new paradigm in respiratory

"Preclinical Characterization of BMS-791325, an Allosteric Inhibitor of Hepatitis C Virus NS5B Polymerase","BMS-791325 is an allosteric inhibitor that binds to thumb site 1 of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. BMS-791325 inhibits recombinant NS5B proteins from HCV genotypes 1, 3, 4, and 5 at 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) below 28 nM. In cell culture, BMS-791325 inhibited replication of HCV subgenomic replicons representing genotypes 1a and 1b at 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) of 3 nM and 6 nM, respectively, with similar (3 to 18 nM) values for genotypes 3a, 4a, and 5a. Potency against genotype 6a showed more variability (9 to 125 nM), and activity was weaker against genotype 2 (EC(50), 87 to 925 nM). Specificity was demonstrated by the absence of activity (EC(50)s of >4 μM) against a panel of mammalian viruses, and cytotoxic concentrations (50%) were >3,000-fold above the HCV EC(50). Resistance substitutions selected by BMS-791325 in genotype 1 replicons mostly mapped to a single site, NS5B amino acid 495 (P495A/S/L/T). Additive or synergistic activity was observed in combination studies using BMS-791325 with alfa interferon plus ribavirin, inhibitors of NS3 protease or NS5A, and other classes of NS5B inhibitor (palm site 2-binding or nucleoside analogs). Plasma and liver exposures in vivo in several animal species indicated that BMS-791325 has a hepatotropic disposition (liver-to-plasma ratios ranging from 1.6- to 60-fold across species). Twenty-four hours postdose, liver exposures across all species tested were ≥10-fold above the inhibitor EC(50)s observed with HCV genotype 1 replicons.

Identification of Diverse Alphacoronaviruses and Genomic Characterization of a Novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Like Coronavirus from Bats in China,"Although many severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses (SARS-like CoVs) have been identified in bats in China, Europe, and Africa, most have a genetic organization significantly distinct from human/civet SARS CoVs in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which mediates receptor binding and determines the host spectrum, resulting in their failure to cause human infections and making them unlikely progenitors of human/civet SARS CoVs. Here, a viral metagenomic analysis of 268 bat rectal swabs collected from four counties in Yunnan Province has identified hundreds of sequences relating to alpha- and betacoronaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis based on a conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene revealed that alphacoronaviruses had diversities with some obvious differences from those reported previously. Full genomic analysis of a new SARS-like CoV from Baoshan (LYRa11) showed that it was 29,805 nucleotides (nt) in length with 13 open reading frames (ORFs), sharing 91% nucleotide identity with human/civet SARS CoVs and the most recently reported SARS-like CoV Rs3367, while sharing 89% with other bat SARS-like CoVs. Notably, it showed the highest sequence identity with the S gene of SARS CoVs and Rs3367, especially in the RBD region. Antigenic analysis showed that the S1 domain of LYRa11 could be efficiently recognized by SARS-convalescent human serum, indicating that LYRa11 is a novel virus antigenically close to SARS CoV. Recombination analyses indicate that LYRa11 is likely a recombinant descended from parental lineages that had evolved into a number of bat SARS-like CoVs. IMPORTANCE Although many severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses (SARS-like CoVs) have been discovered in bats worldwide, there are significant different genic structures, particularly in the S1 domain, which are responsible for host tropism determination, between bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS CoVs, indicating that most reported bat SARS-like CoVs are not the progenitors of human SARS CoV. We have identified diverse alphacoronaviruses and a close relative (LYRa11) to SARS CoV in bats collected in Yunnan, China. Further analysis showed that alpha- and betacoronaviruses have different circulation and transmission dynamics in bat populations. Notably, full genomic sequencing and antigenic study demonstrated that LYRa11 is phylogenetically and antigenically closely related to SARS CoV. Recombination analyses indicate that LYRa11 is a recombinant from certain bat SARS-like CoVs circulating in Yunnan

Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Host-virus Interactions Reveals a Role for Golgi Brefeldin A Resistance Factor 1 (GBF1) in Dengue Infection,"Dengue virus is considered to be the most important mosquito-borne virus worldwide and poses formidable economic and health care burdens on many tropical and subtropical countries. Dengue infection induces drastic rearrangement of host endoplasmic reticulum membranes into complex membranous structures housing replication complexes; the contribution(s) of host proteins and pathways to this process is poorly understood but is likely to be mediated by protein-protein interactions. We have developed an approach for obtaining high confidence protein-protein interaction data by employing affinity tags and quantitative proteomics, in the context of viral infection, followed by robust statistical analysis. Using this approach, we identified high confidence interactors of NS5, the viral polymerase, and NS3, the helicase/protease. Quantitative proteomics allowed us to exclude a large number of presumably nonspecific interactors from our data sets and imparted a high level of confidence to our resulting data sets. We identified 53 host proteins reproducibly associated with NS5 and 41 with NS3, with 13 of these candidates present in both data sets. The host factors identified have diverse functions, including retrograde Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum transport, biosynthesis of long-chain fatty-acyl-coenzyme As, and in the unfolded protein response. We selected GBF1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor responsible for ARF activation, from the NS5 data set for follow up and functional validation. We show that GBF1 plays a critical role early in dengue infection that is independent of its role in the maintenance of Golgi structure. Importantly, the approach described here can be applied to virtually any organism/system as a tool for better understanding its molecular

Comparison of Viral Load in Individuals with and without Asthma during Infections with Rhinovirus,"Rationale: Most virus-induced attacks of asthma are caused by rhinoviruses (RVs). Objectives: To determine whether people with asthma are susceptible to an increased viral load during RV infection. Methods: Seventy-four children (4–18 yr old) were enrolled; 28 with wheezing, 32 with acute rhinitis, and 14 without respiratory tract symptoms. Nasal washes were evaluated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction for RV to judge viral load along with gene sequencing to identify strains of RV. Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, IFN-λ(1), and eosinophil cationic protein in nasal washes, along with blood eosinophil counts and total and allergen-specific IgE in sera, were also evaluated. Similar assessments were done in 24 young adults (16 with asthma, 8 without) who participated in an experimental challenge with RV (serotype 16). Measurements and Main Results: Fifty-seven percent of wheezing children and 56% with acute rhinitis had nasal washes testing positive for RV. The geometric mean of viral loads by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in washes from wheezing children was 2.8-fold lower, but did not differ significantly from children with rhinitis (7,718 and 21,612 copies of viral RNA per microliter nasal wash, respectively; P = 0.48). The odds for wheezing were increased if children who tested positive for RV were sensitized to one or more allergens (odds ratio, 3.9; P = 0.02). Similarly, neither peak nor cumulative viral loads differed significantly in washes from adults with asthma compared with those without asthma during the experimental RV challenge. Conclusions: During acute symptoms, children infected with RV enrolled for wheezing or acute rhinitis had similar viral loads in their nasal washes, as did adults with and without asthma infected with

Incidence and Etiology of Acute Lower Respiratory Tract Infections in Hospitalized Children Younger Than 5 Years in Rural Thailand,"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia remains a leading cause of under-five morbidity and mortality globally. Comprehensive incidence, epidemiologic and etiologic data are needed to update prevention and control strategies. METHODS: We conducted active, population-based surveillance for hospitalized cases of acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI) among children <5 years of age in rural thailand. ALRI cases were systematically sampled for an etiology study that tested nasopharyngeal specimens by polymerase chain reaction; children without ALRI were enrolled as controls from outpatient clinics. RESULTS: We identified 28,543 hospitalized ALRI cases from 2005 to 2010. Among the 49% with chest radiographs, 63% had findings consistent with pneumonia as identified by 2 study radiologists. The hospitalized ALRI incidence rate was 5772 per 100,000 child-years (95% confidence interval: 5707, 5837) and was higher in boys versus girls (incidence rate ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval: 1.35–1.41) and in children 6–23 months of age versus other age groups (incidence rate ratio 1.76, 95% confidence interval: 1.69–1.84). Viruses most commonly detected in ALRI cases were respiratory syncytial virus (19.5%), rhinoviruses (18.7%), bocavirus (12.8%) and influenza viruses (8%). Compared with controls, ALRI cases were more likely to test positive for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3 (P ≤ 0.01 for all). Bloodstream infections, most commonly Streptococcus pneumoniae and nontyphoidal Salmonella, accounted for 1.8% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the high burden of hospitalization for ALRI and the importance of viral pathogens among children in Thailand. Interventions targeting viral pathogens coupled with improved diagnostic approaches, especially for bacteria, are critical for better understanding of ALRI etiology, prevention and control.",-0.058080833,0.05435806,-0.053821553,-0.048160695,-0.041388076,0.020318992,0.05851136,-0.04888327,-0.032452736,0.022476155,0.059105717,0.02974756,-0.033892393,-0.04844668,0.05347989,-0.055210635,-0.059105743,0.012523246,-0.04224058,-0.05295922,-0.043707207,-0.011460304,-0.05398591,0.051538773,0.009593879,0.0495833,-0.056152552,-0.017911917,-0.03824319,-0.04075204,-0.008980649,0.059105743,0.03271338,-0.015325706,-0.03361539,-0.006631573,-0.059096694,-0.05246372,-0.056109525,0.000375967,0.028485175,0.052133817,0.031685036,0.0179648,0.004614701,0.023155624,0.03448759,-0.020647768,0.02758831,-0.030348862,-0.057614572,-0.016302265,-0.059102166,-0.049289223,-0.05893368,-0.02776415,-0.057963125,0.007499958,0.058840718,0.03313584,-0.041800085,0.010391079,0.026044264,-0.03178017,0.048054364,-0.058442667,0.05890855,-0.017603863,0.0567024,-0.047112335,-0.010015508,0.046470936,0.03143145,0.059074152,0.03551485,0.013870443,-0.05877974,-0.033521023,-0.05868864,-0.044337388,0.057254847,0.05886247,0.05818018,0.004852387,-0.041897204,0.05593761,0.02104119,0.03229015,-0.021978576,-0.05765073,-0.05659098,0.024587698,-0.033615887,0.015999287,-0.044131424,0.051392455,0.042087708,0.058959577,0.05835087,-0.046046115,-0.05879635,0.050822563,0.05432215,0.057637837,0.024761226,-0.041973233,0.032546684,0.008041857,0.046495188,0.014046278,-0.037926834,0.03050164,0.047887523,0.0377571,0.058947235,0.046166293,-0.025058638,0.056933284,0.053865634,-0.050355818,-0.032849472,0.046413306,0.050601576,-0.011071011,0.0536847,0.028492339,0.01731859,0.004879781,-0.051900953,-0.024210664,-0.035207167,0.059105746,0.058469,-0.048682496,0.04689981,-0.056127768,0.049814507,0.053872623,-0.022485226,-0.021956963,0.053695638,0.05910504,-0.055662863,-0.05226518,0.04859744,-0.010965868,0.037097942,-0.05861458,0.058757048,-0.0347788,0.056747347,0.032412544,-0.054445386,-0.043155447,0.023509873,-0.004270076,0.055522352,0.05376941,0.030755647,0.05580817,-0.026033487,0.026348619,-0.035022207,0.05625463,2.60E-05,-0.058659025,0.02379231,0.046295844,-0.05733199,-0.05847699,0.04096629,-0.05910471,-0.048806336,0.057512876,-0.008078228,0.040770996,0.0265324,-0.042415798,0.053967398,0.03238286,-0.025298625,0.037336096,0.04431731,0.053059094,0.058987398,-0.004456337,-0.0570596,-0.041207656,-0.034024425,0.026503094,0.05765986,-0.036195558,0.016832417,0.052494265,0.05885208,-0.018450394,-0.027944794,0.049203265,0.007786289,-0.05673559,-0.052468587,0.05339873,-0.05677516,0.018792804,0.033232383,-0.047025513,-0.022463555,0.05078311,0.008121342,0.058922097,0.049893126,-0.013952723,0.012836378,0.058814984,-0.055816207,0.021925477,0.049242906,0.05110243,-0.039804082,-0.028791295,0.029542768,-0.018496795,0.047878873,-0.042298067,0.03125446,0.017744867,-0.058596537,-0.05893347,0.05613246,0.05850665,0.055684887,0.05897675,0.058649227,-0.059092786,0.05079391,0.01779811,0.023846645,-0.021758363,-0.005919357,0.020061083,0.005540791,0.03650421,-0.024838485,-0.053662553,0.0585471,-0.039781336,-0.046177957,0.057874855,0.058511425,-0.058882657,0.05595281,-0.050197214,-0.037510123,-0.027512172,0.0574684,0.047682066,-0.055443037,0.059105743,-0.012607743,-0.052917816,0.050955202,-0.040769447,-0.056435987,0.038233496,-0.04179042,-0.018738773,0.006999915,-0.027027227,0.044133503,0.057147287,0.010925304,0.058429554,-0.044644926,-0.058488917,0.027538912,-0.058582656,0.05808682,-0.036229927,0.058565218,0.008969525,-0.058844935,0.023928907,-0.028740877,0.049588077,-0.0489558,-0.028121008,0.040904578,-0.02498485,-0.0500538,0.049629763,0.0488109,0.007113884,0.056968253,-0.04909277,0.010114729,-0.036975812,0.025259675,-0.058784924,-0.053408172,0.053359333,-0.023077205,0.0554195,0.04234888,-0.000154327,-0.05873284,0.04940067,0.043068506,-0.05014569,0.05844388,-0.045613304,-0.040364876,-0.01422436,-0.055926703,0.03274024,0.05866185,-0.053115264,0.05152275,0.005484292,0.058752898,-0.000540283,0.003413382,0.05864342,0.054498643,-0.024529956,-0.05785015,0.05909666,-0.04091179,-0.040036436,-0.059105366,-0.05796629,0.030240988,0.044579126,-0.037083942,0.058550294,0.05089763,-0.014333218,-0.002485361,0.05369879,0.027715188,-0.008785532,0.000371289,-0.036389895,0.056925826,0.05089712,-0.058660246,-0.059051875,0.056814097,0.057484962,-0.056970537,-0.059043895,0.028939867,-0.025803551,0.04432441,0.043558203,0.05829082,-0.009991582,-0.059105396,-0.050701957,0.030683897,-0.048405044,0.042508367,-0.057990983,-0.058635745,0.030559031,-0.054619756,0.03730801,0.058974985,0.056345582,0.02281663,-0.036609206,0.023923872,0.057122216,-0.04717589,0.002075406,0.05282998,0.049553864,0.02308485,0.023679603,0.021193054,-0.052138552,-0.046306793,0.056058016,0.05526828,0.03260201,-0.040612392,0.013458916,-0.03121633,-0.058818527,-0.0533836,0.043723527,0.055256825,0.048300482,-0.044913042,0.012186394,-0.05369627,0.054368112,-0.005054167,-0.0590842,0.056064077,-0.05845501,-0.003163178,0.0445191,0.022488732,0.058987677,0.005728486,-0.004842214,-0.044827532,0.051813144,0.057775673,0.015032284,0.05744211,-0.004169209,-

Vaccine-derived Mutation in Motif D of Poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase Lowers Nucleotide Incorporation Fidelity,"All viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) have a conserved structural element termed motif D. Studies of the RdRp from poliovirus (PV) have shown that a conformational change of motif D leads to efficient and faithful nucleotide addition by bringing Lys-359 into the active site where it serves as a general acid. The RdRp of the Sabin I vaccine strain has Thr-362 changed to Ile. Such a drastic change so close to Lys-359 might alter RdRp function and contribute in some way to the attenuated phenotype of Sabin type I. Here we present our characterization of the T362I RdRp. We find that the T362I RdRp exhibits a mutator phenotype in biochemical experiments in vitro. Using NMR, we show that this change in nucleotide incorporation fidelity correlates with a change in the structural dynamics of motif D. A recombinant PV expressing the T362I RdRp exhibits normal growth properties in cell culture but expresses a mutator phenotype in cells. For example, the T362I-containing PV is more sensitive to the mutagenic activity of ribavirin than wild-type PV. Interestingly, the T362I change was sufficient to cause a statistically significant reduction in viral virulence. Collectively, these studies suggest that residues of motif D can be targeted when changes in nucleotide incorporation fidelity are desired. Given the observation that fidelity mutants can serve as vaccine candidates, it may be possible to use engineering of motif D for this purpose.",-0.024572412,0.025869185,-0.06082626,-0.03655994,-0.02709279,0.06534138,-0.007724291,-0.003307207,0.038761143,0.052863594,0.06286372,-0.041178986,0.048633255,0.061769877,0.06395001,-0.066545025,-0.0584832,-0.01574634,0.060571115,-0.021840815,-0.059010167,0.026437724,-0.004614814,0.053897504,0.034951217,0.06236921,0.002677414,0.031681914,0.025237992,0.022071546,0.027928667,-0.031068396,0.027393341,0.001624928,-0.050520305,0.010337495,-0.06580431,0.015508365,-0.054565527,0.025873419,0.032558255,-0.029598635,-0.009867184,-0.056478705,0.003764884,-0.016448023,0.038532738,-0.026955431,0.04652348,-0.039097942,-0.0460296,-0.04139129,-0.063881256,-0.011947007,-0.061679102,0.024019103,-0.051558033,-0.027456675,0.06534977,-0.06531284,0.012736702,-0.03730348,0.041447546,-0.04772807,-0.05673404,-0.065563165,0.04897215,0.057935618,0.05512256,0.059327215,0.016852655,0.050571032,0.004610194,0.039056823,-0.057842612,0.05408504,0.04952154,0.036220778,-0.048344087,0.06240303,0.001678422,0.06594332,-0.034497056,0.008374997,-0.017031593,0.002025146,0.03810238,-0.002145598,-0.019235875,0.051983953,0.007892625,0.040995445,-0.060435947,0.04221674,0.017088132,0.040975444,0.007152192,0.058387253,0.0666262,-0.029520132,-0.0455357,0.006615617,-0.06312204,0.045442805,0.056790307,0.029717635,-0.001994668,-0.011267754,0.046664402,-0.003687514,0.056352977,0.06606099,0.031696625,-0.002771602,0.053309664,0.055688873,-0.064167485,-0.056415133,0.017299978,0.03386019,-0.00650483,0.038895495,0.04562265,-0.0627027,-0.041610193,0.05293527,-0.03612734,-0.0238529,0.052479394,0.039780255,-0.025270037,0.066647016,0.059789274,0.005454343,-0.001737089,-0.001571455,0.04042374,0.06574451,-0.065589726,0.050329596,0.009952293,0.066654496,-0.06597047,-0.057250574,0.03788394,-0.05472283,0.038148984,-0.066105016,0.03863421,0.04753593,0.012638762,-0.040821135,-0.03041783,-0.043834604,0.066656254,0.02457693,0.04605844,0.06163391,0.06527131,-0.042376146,-0.06422961,0.000155574,-0.03969722,0.032896068,-0.06388029,-0.020085312,-0.05105549,0.010660025,-0.03180362,-0.060983162,0.007579001,0.05429868,-0.027079964,0.051342927,-0.020159729,-0.05049743,-0.043509364,-0.041231763,0.05776271,0.049997944,-0.035717875,0.011209892,-0.013938417,-0.05081145,0.041404337,-0.03794166,-0.021947758,0.048231676,0.0646984,0.028806208,0.05994342,-0.035414074,-0.04194717,0.010725196,0.04451825,-0.060947046,0.036562935,-0.051596865,0.04221121,-0.059503946,-0.006271726,0.060362183,0.027686134,0.055254124,0.05156877,-0.06619659,-0.062656045,0.06091366,0.020424206,0.06136875,0.005361338,0.05574033,0.059180886,0.06342921,-0.06323979,-0.0390955,0.033464417,-0.026587918,0.024505764,0.005497219,0.048460662,-0.032027666,-0.051296152,-0.05933365,-0.049521156,-0.041833088,-0.06620862,-0.05548845,-0.0400935,0.057772752,0.043394253,0.053497907,-0.02427063,-0.06662996,0.065440826,-0.010833168,0.015460984,-0.046848875,-0.051567648,0.06264353,0.041180015,0.033175457,-0.05585531,-0.05058936,0.051274758,-0.046650507,-0.00844732,-0.033294052,-0.007800989,-0.02774422,-0.062876865,-0.03386013,-0.006825943,-7.78E-05,0.06573471,0.010399659,-0.061532937,0.06665972,-0.04442073,0.028093131,-0.05556664,-0.0082603,-0.03299974,0.059411902,0.04949108,-0.017270753,-0.029630095,-0.051767733,0.001285169,-0.012651559,0.061102137,0.0658238,0.041331217,0.06563736,0.032843553,-0.03435715,0.04044379,-0.017088626,0.06506107,-0.041476168,-0.027054548,-0.06398401,-0.006011362,0.06249949,-0.058502823,-0.03470662,-0.06500246,0.06067561,-0.046553377,0.017230982,0.06655805,0.028609192,0.06525026,-0.000798883,0.036429808,-0.04170364,-0.030047135,0.006935992,-0.066199094,0.030177215,-0.035744954,0.061892822,0.05056396,-0.003125971,-0.058259677,0.023298489,-0.064212255,-0.057712376,0.041995402,-0.04374319,0.051036548,0.05905549,-0.03878104,-0.03930041,0.06433903,0.046703484,-0.047725454,-0.052004673,0.060843147,-0.06304067,-0.046049036,0.06148414,0.015820462,-0.03207537,-0.024684463,0.028337723,-0.05429008,-0.06532164,-0.05488354,0.01140684,-0.018692577,0.026991108,0.03192622,0.06658712,-0.008664235,0.0365457,0.049049933,-0.021672726,0.032700744,-0.062341362,-0.01488493,0.001333906,0.01731162,0.025910744,-0.066658214,-0.06649506,-0.033000972,0.06529142,-0.047819294,-0.059666682,-0.013315211,-0.03596054,-0.057171673,-0.020436192,0.023911988,0.005487497,-0.06664953,0.019132422,0.011378472,-0.063757434,-0.0461272,0.014125401,-0.06546642,0.061418705,0.011187186,0.000516299,0.065026976,0.02760575,0.055774912,0.022093564,-0.038966157,-0.05091641,0.04234374,-0.06665876,0.058566894,0.002893648,0.046711564,-0.018571947,0.05665716,-0.063677736,-0.066201374,0.066310816,0.048334323,0.035303317,-0.04623546,-0.043413054,-0.041088253,-0.06508981,0.061901774,0.047877997,-0.046582136,0.035585195,0.050454944,-0.038608678,0.047285102,0.048087783,0.058569547,-0.056751344,-0.00889349,-0.004792807,-0.014389714,-0.008392914,0.006273964,0.005876127,-0.05434945,-0.02773327,-0.023327548,-0.004336809,0.036431413,0.010074562,0.013537346,-0.04931691,-

Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Gene Expression in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"Although most cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occur in smokers, only a fraction of smokers develop the disease. We hypothesized distinct molecular signatures for COPD and emphysema in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of current and former smokers. To test this hypothesis, we identified and validated PBMC gene expression profiles in smokers with and without COPD. We generated expression data on 136 subjects from the COPDGene study, using Affymetrix U133 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Multiple linear regression with adjustment for covariates (gender, age, body mass index, family history, smoking status, and pack-years) was used to identify candidate genes, and ingenuity pathway analysis was used to identify candidate pathways. Candidate genes were validated in 149 subjects according to multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, which included 75 subjects not previously profiled. Pathways that were differentially expressed in subjects with COPD and emphysema included those that play a role in the immune system, inflammatory responses, and sphingolipid (ceramide) metabolism. Twenty-six of the 46 candidate genes (e.g., FOXP1, TCF7, and ASAH1) were validated in the independent cohort. Plasma metabolomics was used to identify a novel glycoceramide (galabiosylceramide) as a biomarker of emphysema, supporting the genomic association between acid ceramidase (ASAH1) and emphysema. COPD is a systemic disease whose gene expression signatures in PBMCs could serve as novel diagnostic or therapeutic

The Endosomal Pathway and the Golgi Complex Are Involved in the Infectious Bursal Disease Virus Life Cycle,"Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), a double-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Birnaviridae family, causes immunosuppression in chickens. In this study, we defined the localization of IBDV replication complexes based on colocalization analysis of VP3, the major protein component of IBDV ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). Our results indicate that VP3 localizes to vesicular structures bearing features of early and late endocytic compartments located in the juxtanuclear region. Interfering with the endocytic pathway with a dominant negative version of Rab5 after the internalization step leads to a reduction in virus titer. Triple-immunostaining studies between VP3, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase VP1, and viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) showed a well-defined colocalization, indicating that the three critical components of the RNPs colocalize in the same structure, likely representing replication complexes. Interestingly, recombinant expressed VP3 also localizes to endosomes. Employing Golgi markers, we found that VP3-containing vesicles were closely associated with this organelle. Depolymerization of microtubules with nocodazole caused a profound change in VP3 localization, showing a punctate distribution scattered throughout the cytoplasm. However, these VP3-positive structures remained associated with Golgi ministacks. Similarly, brefeldin A (BFA) treatment led to a punctate distribution of VP3, scattered throughout the cytoplasm of infected cells. In addition, analysis of intra- and extracellular viral infective particles after BFA treatment of avian cells suggested a role for the Golgi complex in viral assembly.

Genetic Characterization of Betacoronavirus Lineage C Viruses in Bats Reveals Marked Sequence Divergence in the Spike Protein of Pipistrellus Bat Coronavirus HKU5 in Japanese Pipistrelle: Implications for the Origin of the Novel Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,"While the novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is closely related to Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV HKU4) and Pipistrellus bat CoV HKU5 (Pi-BatCoV HKU5) in bats from Hong Kong, and other potential lineage C betacoronaviruses in bats from Africa, Europe, and America, its animal origin remains obscure. To better understand the role of bats in its origin, we examined the molecular epidemiology and evolution of lineage C betacoronaviruses among bats. Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5 were detected in 29% and 25% of alimentary samples from lesser bamboo bat (Tylonycteris pachypus) and Japanese pipistrelle (Pipistrellus abramus), respectively. Sequencing of their RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes revealed that MERS-CoV is more closely related to Pi-BatCoV HKU5 in RdRp (92.1% to 92.3% amino acid [aa] identity) but is more closely related to Ty-BatCoV HKU4 in S (66.8% to 67.4% aa identity) and N (71.9% to 72.3% aa identity). Although both viruses were under purifying selection, the S of Pi-BatCoV HKU5 displayed marked sequence polymorphisms and more positively selected sites than that of Ty-BatCoV HKU4, suggesting that Pi-BatCoV HKU5 may generate variants to occupy new ecological niches along with its host in diverse habitats. Molecular clock analysis showed that they diverged from a common ancestor with MERS-CoV at least several centuries ago. Although MERS-CoV may have diverged from potential lineage C betacoronaviruses in European bats more recently, these bat viruses were unlikely to be the direct ancestor of MERS-CoV. Intensive surveillance for lineage C betaCoVs in Pipistrellus and related bats with diverse habitats and other animals in the Middle East may fill the evolutionary

The Unexpected Roles of Eukaryotic Translation Elongation Factors in RNA Virus Replication and Pathogenesis,"SUMMARY: The prokaryotic translation elongation factors were identified as essential cofactors for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of the bacteriophage Qβ more than 40 years ago. A growing body of evidence now shows that eukaryotic translation elongation factors (eEFs), predominantly eEF1A, acting in partially characterized complexes sometimes involving additional eEFs, facilitate virus replication. The functions of eEF1A as a protein chaperone and an RNA- and actin-binding protein enable its “moonlighting” roles as a virus replication cofactor. A diverse group of viruses, from human immunodeficiency type 1 and West Nile virus to tomato bushy stunt virus, have adapted to use eEFs as cofactors for viral transcription, translation, assembly, and pathogenesis. Here we review the mechanisms used by viral pathogens to usurp these abundant cellular proteins for their replication.",-0.01897183,0.007552085,-0.031739336,0.015928794,0.05368396,0.060351703,0.01331533,-0.013859767,-0.005812479,0.008514547,0.063988835,-0.021408299,-0.057365116,-0.050697953,0.052107867,-0.063925326,-0.06383023,-0.031782005,0.063848495,-0.020525651,-0.01755418,-0.022948662,-0.06062029,0.063088104,0.05461066,0.056817792,0.020556033,-0.042691614,-0.04605019,-0.007185679,0.050150875,0.0639259,-0.02747818,-0.052735902,0.059071887,0.015523046,-0.04352106,0.043318044,-0.061039213,-0.027200347,0.044039793,-0.0622418,-0.028649319,-0.043203022,0.04466451,-0.05520554,0.005492119,-0.027390799,0.05704528,0.019593515,-0.012475141,0.058413636,-0.060552347,-0.019306686,-0.060184605,0.045841675,-0.047076732,0.008222033,0.05957951,-0.04425293,-0.056773778,-0.025785265,0.060420368,0.02704734,0.025999531,-0.06372626,0.06126834,-0.004289982,0.046352975,-0.030150902,0.025604729,0.039189428,0.017871503,0.03791875,-0.042663023,-0.047728892,0.063708626,0.039052367,-0.063071065,0.06229274,-0.053900238,0.06373368,0.044734295,-0.037241668,-0.048354328,0.05115293,-0.007893569,-0.003303213,-0.058978833,0.03909935,-0.043723088,-0.051370174,-0.057685032,0.052289285,0.048742346,0.062024932,0.058679827,0.063693285,0.063951895,-0.009186083,-0.046602033,-0.041442864,-0.04460704,-0.026661266,-0.03213931,0.059982616,0.031098066,-0.055298425,-0.020358441,0.016271597,-0.038886998,0.029025285,0.04381141,0.05081582,0.062484495,-0.03689548,-0.06041467,0.009453909,-0.054663446,-0.035207897,-0.05951763,0.060432304,0.061842233,0.011900824,0.02974922,0.009572447,0.034485757,-0.010577619,0.03270505,0.01008434,-0.045943018,0.063992344,0.05204032,-0.039306093,0.008387005,-0.04676329,0.05184322,0.03447182,-0.060816705,0.030532554,-0.005991897,0.06395944,-0.056220736,-0.026447572,-0.044508785,-0.056069363,-0.024460431,-0.06314973,-0.024558255,0.057546422,0.028589783,-0.06377149,-0.050183717,0.049344312,0.0639885,-0.054745942,0.04408175,0.041386798,0.02461202,0.054053534,0.038427003,0.014044313,0.029630804,0.05234269,0.01785771,-0.031725276,-0.05925736,-0.005745039,-0.05212743,-0.06322417,0.012639537,-0.049550448,-0.051624395,-0.01881725,0.061736885,-0.022876322,0.03370331,-0.050102618,0.061330512,-0.013136467,0.008942735,0.024667606,-0.047688253,0.007345512,0.058316957,-0.054615363,-0.062080223,0.027177092,0.053566117,-0.034732424,0.04529651,-0.0047936,0.013863144,0.025932567,0.06208281,-0.04650814,0.060825042,0.014610165,-0.04039117,0.007414772,-0.04713301,0.058786552,-0.028678307,-0.013530427,0.05627646,-0.022972437,0.018167056,0.057116248,0.019940477,0.063539825,0.021395555,0.058382798,0.04375839,0.012687398,-0.02094246,-0.001161343,0.05902429,-0.04420556,-0.062219527,0.003656633,0.040700395,-0.019810315,0.00304323,0.013082068,-0.06156641,0.008770078,-0.062698,-0.05423623,0.03375044,0.048496973,-0.004039333,0.06048431,0.039971825,-0.06387277,0.055352755,0.01178933,0.028101964,-0.06315774,0.009913726,0.04127017,0.04068922,0.0495107,-0.024825105,0.03137692,0.04547497,-0.024289502,0.019938892,0.053499885,0.061138257,-0.00452514,-0.06375898,0.037045874,0.003298304,-0.029917687,0.063087836,-0.023123747,-0.04958364,0.06399197,-0.0401837,0.00894239,0.036024615,0.06173266,-0.020354623,0.06139423,0.002388509,0.009487986,-0.050349448,-0.037044317,0.05365129,-0.006522153,-0.007911697,0.058646183,-0.055206843,0.05005145,-0.012003987,-0.057874706,0.01028352,0.05702489,0.0628643,-0.052531905,-0.02826604,-0.015864657,-0.044319678,0.050438322,-0.053835794,-0.031864174,-0.059686806,-0.029237907,-0.063190974,0.033617884,0.06386429,0.020010144,0.05477447,0.026254479,0.02719275,-0.050790086,-0.023846494,-0.024257248,-0.06355909,0.050842956,-0.042483393,0.062310223,0.05072336,0.062170308,-0.024477622,-0.006533174,0.005355372,-0.024532914,0.05668017,-0.05059052,0.06026549,-0.03609067,0.007298646,-0.03519582,0.058195155,0.016880566,0.055184375,0.03567118,0.06176397,0.038902957,0.020474544,0.05333838,0.057499334,-0.063450195,0.032263547,0.06319543,-0.008032149,-0.05765908,0.051061906,-0.06248086,0.04395059,0.019032435,0.04793704,0.059625022,0.041645125,-0.044022195,0.058199223,0.023147786,-0.024969501,0.018536398,0.005986789,-0.036626633,0.062291373,-0.001421536,-0.06398225,-0.063742116,0.043245036,0.029350515,-0.039835274,-0.06250999,0.002734219,0.025820535,-0.050475672,-0.039786186,0.02671093,-0.059824385,-0.063981496,-0.05719021,-0.0104927,-0.017850727,0.031611964,-0.06366192,-0.06336127,0.008919873,0.019165969,-0.040680487,0.06376254,0.05096142,0.060053807,0.04964034,0.009622482,-0.051520396,-0.028961709,-0.06398748,0.059102725,-0.03364925,0.061673295,0.02030489,0.043067887,-0.028628036,-0.061975025,0.060077343,0.04323741,-0.005996559,-0.03227541,-0.055391584,0.004674351,-0.063447416,0.037475582,0.04776011,0.05694365,-0.052272692,0.05999581,-0.055789273,-0.053155344,0.052649353,-0.011479811,-0.0555762,0.024788354,-0.050945688,-0.013061335,-0.03476465,-0.003642765,-0.028975688,0.045869313,-0.030960856,-0.057872087,0.00969589,0.007471479,0.050523695,0.052145813,0.

"1918 Influenza Virus Hemagglutinin (HA) and the Viral RNA Polymerase Complex Enhance Viral Pathogenicity, but Only HA Induces Aberrant Host Responses in Mice","The 1918 pandemic influenza virus was the most devastating infectious agent in human history, causing fatal pneumonia and an estimated 20 to 50 million deaths worldwide. Previous studies indicated a prominent role of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene in efficient replication and high virulence of the 1918 virus in mice. It is, however, still unclear whether the high replication ability or the 1918 influenza virus HA gene is required for 1918 virus to exhibit high virulence in mice. Here, we examined the biological properties of reassortant viruses between the 1918 virus and a contemporary human H1N1 virus (A/Kawasaki/173/2001 [K173]) in a mouse model. In addition to the 1918 influenza virus HA, we demonstrated the role of the viral RNA replication complex in efficient replication of viruses in mouse lungs, whereas only the HA gene is responsible for lethality in mice. Global gene expression profiling of infected mouse lungs revealed that the 1918 influenza virus HA was sufficient to induce transcriptional changes similar to those induced by the 1918 virus, despite difference in lymphocyte gene expression. Increased expression of genes associated with the acute-phase response and the protein ubiquitination pathway were enriched during infections with the 1918 and 1918HA/K173 viruses, whereas reassortant viruses bearing the 1918 viral RNA polymerase complex induced transcriptional changes similar to those seen with the K173 virus. Taken together, these data suggest that HA and the viral RNA polymerase complex are critical determinants of Spanish influenza pathogenesis, but only HA, and not the viral RNA polymerase complex and NP, is responsible for extreme host responses observed in mice infected with the 1918 influenza virus.",-0.008121062,0.044091057,-0.034997713,0.01684826,0.047388628,0.05354697,0.04871905,-0.02107247,0.054208886,0.04859148,0.054459844,-0.037733722,-0.051422883,-0.04877785,0.048284158,-0.05441984,-0.054459807,-0.054435913,0.054451857,-0.011319396,-0.053198814,-0.030955827,-0.0507081,0.054423552,0.04479117,0.050504416,0.008051068,0.022779297,-0.04248949,0.04077246,0.054372147,0.054459844,-0.009346075,-0.054033868,0.05443547,0.048286892,-0.0543239,-0.04008465,-0.051585995,0.018051075,0.03219501,-0.050591063,0.049240615,-0.023468947,-0.030394156,-0.05238922,0.006159586,-0.0511479,0.04991013,-0.039287638,0.05225629,0.043939684,-0.05394287,0.027536357,-0.0541378,0.027455948,-0.054414455,-0.040351067,0.052298553,-0.047955442,-0.04483232,0.048242975,0.001195024,0.049765036,0.04707163,-0.05438362,0.054138534,0.041055713,0.04868528,0.048263967,-0.036969334,0.028960839,0.007940842,0.054102615,0.02650933,-0.051149562,0.023916826,0.029937077,-0.054459523,0.053131465,0.001449698,0.05386584,0.049853772,0.040368546,-0.033814717,0.054201555,-0.028491523,0.052328385,-0.053290017,-0.053085938,-0.052148197,-0.053551495,-0.04283212,0.022357536,0.054224204,0.053451773,0.054360878,0.054110266,0.054459836,-0.005663149,-0.05312361,0.039699316,-0.02243853,-0.03571393,0.043789145,0.050289184,0.04926375,-0.054050323,0.034794282,0.012697565,-0.05330328,-0.026784007,0.033858232,0.053569585,0.054446355,-0.006256875,-0.05433301,-0.048009824,-0.053464312,0.03748318,-0.054443404,0.044444207,0.04093489,-0.026044285,-0.034850452,-0.008567175,0.01305654,-0.05103714,0.031075373,-0.04323092,-0.04621479,0.054459844,0.04506651,0.030592324,0.021970572,-0.054257467,0.019344548,0.054068137,-0.049679007,0.018061977,0.053413395,0.054455794,-0.05165227,-0.030603169,0.0444992,-0.027260747,0.050730985,-0.0543005,0.050318193,0.05125783,0.05440044,-0.052721806,-0.02899518,-0.054119848,0.054457378,0.035949033,0.052751467,-0.014741907,0.012411503,0.053628888,-0.009825183,-0.020765048,0.009028252,0.040300522,0.044130772,-0.046251945,-0.054238196,0.053365342,-0.049398392,-0.05392678,0.041219648,-0.054387536,-0.05267044,0.05409462,-0.04086871,-0.029452188,0.010552947,-0.045653943,0.020069467,-0.04955698,0.05252847,-0.021296592,-0.02269296,-0.011749859,0.05427009,-0.05420078,-0.05442465,-0.041015193,0.013752639,-0.016977562,0.05331686,-0.052138183,0.024963452,0.045826677,0.054243,0.024184009,0.052451998,0.049377613,0.037495516,-0.013708475,-0.0475009,0.0540899,-0.011494745,-0.05304105,0.011928457,-0.03609081,-0.012409304,0.054447312,0.0438334,0.05445702,0.046174914,0.05398183,0.044122133,-0.038522802,-0.053351942,0.03747732,0.053382803,0.038907096,-0.052585024,0.038375515,-0.04860241,-0.025691409,0.050518658,-0.018810736,-0.043414153,0.03853672,-0.054336876,-0.054402467,0.054286607,0.04892118,-0.026006754,0.051094424,0.054352872,-0.054459833,0.008054623,0.051610142,0.04011116,-0.053882316,0.003304598,0.04591975,0.033737168,-0.020835629,-0.051016822,-0.05296577,0.054458156,-0.053980626,-0.036622696,0.044048857,0.053905047,0.034084167,-0.050019745,-0.03894063,-0.029034737,-0.051855855,0.054400217,0.05072328,-0.053449396,0.054459844,0.04767032,-0.048386276,0.048915595,0.031700987,-0.002028981,0.04502527,-0.03832144,-0.03161252,-0.0506445,0.005962754,0.054379646,0.054405127,-0.04516196,0.05426578,-0.053355474,-0.051404726,-0.044341017,-0.053940687,0.05325905,0.0543326,0.05445343,-0.04710247,0.023837574,-0.04090892,0.000318993,0.049298074,-0.01160919,-0.042780522,-0.0544514,0.053121362,-0.053764302,0.051441737,0.054453038,-0.04061074,0.05445971,-0.046312183,-0.053832766,-0.033412375,0.053706817,-0.054107934,-0.054456875,0.03529964,-0.041592047,0.054259025,-0.010395639,0.05209761,-0.054225754,-0.020915471,-0.006640238,-0.045410484,0.05265092,-0.03713049,0.054107595,-0.053488202,-0.04762206,-0.04770532,0.054443922,-0.049748033,0.05330931,0.054313757,0.04887093,0.027725095,0.03039363,0.045438386,0.046972584,-0.05322255,-0.010951052,0.05445969,-0.054159578,0.003198281,-0.053304706,-0.046453837,0.05376453,0.04812352,0.04315344,0.05403714,0.042062405,0.044005614,0.054193333,0.05285237,-0.051736746,-0.048136555,0.0536013,-0.05089753,0.05445494,0.040411927,-0.05445532,-0.054457203,0.053937327,0.054337017,0.04326977,-0.054380246,-0.007395047,0.054274052,0.03964666,0.003694797,0.036626443,-0.0505995,-0.054459747,-0.054295152,-0.047057632,0.01395978,0.026204439,-0.053847753,-0.053844936,0.054322526,0.001104759,-0.024773847,0.054457497,0.05157491,0.002711106,-0.053292777,-0.043577082,-0.04044423,-0.052160025,-0.054435,0.054376006,0.014003326,0.054432,-0.029349657,0.054336384,-0.052350737,-0.051276233,0.030049112,0.046746574,0.054036018,0.017354624,-0.016143262,0.027968654,-0.054459833,-0.02484115,0.020571308,0.050249327,0.038107663,0.049782038,-0.044702742,-0.05427712,0.034290653,-0.05395908,-0.054093666,0.016856182,-0.05439063,-0.05180276,0.046019636,0.0442295,0.05425859,0.025415957,0.032194685,-0.039255157,0.021214316,0.052536853,-0.002355463,0.0526001,0.029100496,-0.00616

The PA-Gene-Mediated Lethal Dissemination and Excessive Innate Immune Response Contribute to the High Virulence of H5N1 Avian Influenza Virus in Mice,"Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus remains a substantial threat to public health. To understand the molecular basis and host mechanism for the high virulence of H5N1 viruses in mammals, we compared two H5N1 isolates which have similar genetic backgrounds but greatly differ in their virulence in mice. A/Chicken/Jiangsu/k0402/2010 (CK10) is highly pathogenic, whereas A/Goose/Jiangsu/k0403/2010 (GS10) is nonpathogenic. We first showed that CK10 elicited a more potent innate immune response than did GS10 in mouse lungs by increasing the number and expression levels of activated genes. We then generated a series of reassortants between the two viruses and evaluated their virulence in mice. Inclusion of the CK10 PA gene in the GS10 background resulted in a dramatic increase in virulence. Conversely, expression of the GS10 PA gene in the CK10 background significantly attenuated the virulence. These results demonstrated that the PA gene mainly determines the pathogenicity discrepancy between CK10 and GS10 in mice. We further determined that arginine (R) at position 353 of the PA gene contributes to the high virulence of CK10 in mice. The reciprocal substitution at position 353 in PA or the exchange of the entire PA gene largely caused the transfer of viral phenotypes, including virus replication, polymerase activity, and manipulation of the innate response, between CK10 and GS10. We therefore defined a novel molecular marker associated with the high virulence of H5N1 influenza viruses, providing further insights into the pathogenesis of H5N1 viruses in mammals.",-0.018837951,0.05323378,-0.03949832,-0.017028617,0.031632096,0.06017954,-0.013834749,-0.058576036,0.053374108,0.055556156,0.06056621,0.00186344,-0.05821396,0.004843024,0.023664787,-0.060244933,-0.060562238,-0.05553712,0.060372107,-0.051673327,-0.04901966,0.022341097,-0.04521498,0.05391421,0.019928707,0.050091967,-0.015635926,0.056977622,-0.03683679,0.048695933,0.059202988,0.060565844,0.005833631,-0.05678739,0.012998418,0.035990298,-0.058226537,0.010789329,-0.060115356,-0.001953197,0.054694913,0.0349686,0.03159667,-0.030410107,-0.059080515,-0.040186126,0.015991364,-0.045943636,0.054060183,-0.030263217,0.059340112,0.021051994,-0.058824103,-0.036293488,-0.037298575,0.02114043,-0.06046205,-0.048596382,0.06017417,-0.051943902,0.046989538,0.054006778,-0.055591963,0.020928044,0.01795201,-0.060516637,0.05873003,0.04710581,0.043696895,0.04266467,-0.05432657,0.045459744,-0.03660694,0.056971945,-0.046617616,-0.006969221,-0.005314739,0.033227175,-0.06045288,0.05696132,-0.02785663,0.060235832,0.055923942,0.05349397,-0.043543547,0.059860677,0.003510846,0.003959838,-0.05021413,-0.04751864,-0.05085275,-0.002265701,-0.050443996,-0.03704351,0.046467498,0.05922067,0.059914768,0.059373736,0.060565066,-0.034861658,-0.04824288,0.00163721,-0.05200637,0.03831884,0.05817634,-0.020170785,0.038531892,-0.022744456,0.056081392,0.038577843,0.042837627,0.05005832,0.046787817,0.0583908,0.060501,0.051439833,-0.059953958,-0.014447206,0.009315059,0.027563155,-0.053588815,0.047251835,0.003519006,-0.054169443,0.04358767,0.040973634,0.03324124,0.003238836,0.021143524,-0.01085588,-0.055072375,0.060566243,0.05891783,-0.008558346,-0.005272358,-0.05341592,0.015495081,0.057499874,-0.051609285,-0.040594574,0.038285613,0.06056437,-0.058508284,-0.046172068,-0.009054249,-0.05278473,0.05543911,-0.057111938,0.041727487,0.05150778,0.058862627,-0.048149213,-0.05451758,-0.05827666,0.06055637,-0.003923883,0.05900389,0.033394482,0.051194802,-0.035771366,-0.052400097,-0.037200157,-0.02985041,0.054169167,-0.033220384,0.024353683,-0.056579124,0.024100652,-0.056916986,-0.054756176,-0.047393266,-0.057240345,-0.057030424,0.059879962,-0.059100423,-0.019018907,0.01976977,-0.02350238,0.05947891,0.04675738,0.059306856,-0.039054204,-0.05583077,0.019881485,0.05747603,-0.040093068,-0.055987123,-0.040340655,0.05659855,-0.04163288,0.05731881,-0.046247773,-0.036026478,0.026937533,0.060326938,-0.022446765,0.056655094,0.03460313,-0.006120533,-0.048089538,-0.046216704,0.054916352,-0.042171933,0.015225366,0.005364655,-0.041027583,9.05E-05,0.06056044,0.042309776,0.06053223,0.043881826,0.05999932,0.05707275,0.058114644,-0.058621764,0.00586547,0.049563322,0.010754675,-0.046708755,0.029900191,-0.010917065,-0.025273552,0.025016896,-0.026087448,-0.023901472,0.032800164,-0.059954308,-0.060452994,0.054843675,0.05834708,0.012054932,0.060399026,0.056787644,-0.060556866,0.018026134,0.031195054,0.04503364,-0.05897352,-0.04490913,0.0596098,0.024821121,0.03159617,-0.059847247,-0.044413455,0.059979353,-0.059051204,-0.04357133,-0.02949114,0.055709407,-0.046735886,-0.022136923,0.025541183,-0.040623076,0.013807907,0.060380835,0.048679985,-0.049083967,0.060566235,0.007751697,-0.0478608,-0.008868823,0.02037033,-0.031937875,-0.002234287,-0.035568807,-0.034885913,-0.017987443,-0.001351226,0.051482677,0.035584524,0.045996495,0.05967425,-0.057495475,0.012801017,-0.042463455,-0.055999618,0.052547812,0.056543075,0.060181145,-0.0590281,-0.009817786,-0.058465816,-0.03966047,0.055445403,-0.047619224,-0.03222692,-0.06011777,0.060006224,-0.052866425,0.02512903,0.060555384,-0.018296506,0.06052181,-0.05962303,-0.030743834,-0.035604537,0.026880011,-0.05574517,-0.06056515,0.031952795,-0.001239098,0.0520589,0.041421168,-0.003563326,-0.059860382,0.042117424,0.02431865,-0.04692994,0.019251565,-0.04721063,0.059453856,0.000167555,-0.043657012,-0.056287635,0.05970359,-0.039192464,0.011544992,0.007946279,0.0597116,-0.008242051,-0.00866994,0.027402973,0.038724042,-0.028323771,-0.032856323,0.059395667,-0.055278245,-0.05931404,-0.059138134,0.01518832,0.040671546,0.035813745,0.052298427,0.060407024,-0.028903475,0.004771109,0.042597383,0.05296734,0.017439468,-0.024334392,0.05022819,-0.047226675,0.05737118,0.018475229,-0.06054169,-0.060407273,0.021889446,0.055053685,-0.005207898,-0.060281955,0.0428461,0.00845264,-0.022773199,0.04747461,0.034004398,-0.027139338,-0.06056474,-0.03479344,-0.05455937,-0.05229731,0.0084718,-0.048934672,-0.059760883,0.035945408,-0.033633053,-0.012933372,0.060551185,0.045411713,0.029581808,-0.02039958,-0.03861605,-0.040736526,-0.046650693,-0.060427383,0.059172124,-0.007975387,0.059044078,-0.037412826,0.046465557,-0.05745888,-0.037339266,-0.041879997,0.056932498,0.056948412,0.027885783,-0.03479625,-0.004374785,-0.060462102,0.026979266,-0.002856089,0.04272821,0.052864756,0.04659256,0.002852616,-0.025721978,0.033148047,-0.04532349,-0.05835148,-0.017947365,-0.05534889,-0.016144698,0.054457825,-0.010317031,0.060372293,-0.018836275,-0.025300147,-0.043833382,0.018734412,0.054060638,0.001998938,0.03

ADP Ribosylation Factor 1 Plays an Essential Role in the Replication of a Plant RNA Virus,"Eukaryotic positive-strand RNA viruses replicate using the membrane-bound replicase complexes, which contain multiple viral and host components. Virus infection induces the remodeling of intracellular membranes. Virus-induced membrane structures are thought to increase the local concentration of the components that are required for replication and provide a scaffold for tethering the replicase complexes. However, the mechanisms underlying virus-induced membrane remodeling are poorly understood. RNA replication of red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV), a positive-strand RNA plant virus, is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, and ER morphology is perturbed in RCNMV-infected cells. Here, we identified ADP ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) in the affinity-purified RCNMV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase fraction. Arf1 is a highly conserved, ubiquitous, small GTPase that is implicated in the formation of the coat protein complex I (COPI) vesicles on Golgi membranes. Using in vitro pulldown and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses, we showed that Arf1 interacted with the viral p27 replication protein within the virus-induced large punctate structures of the ER membrane. We found that inhibition of the nucleotide exchange activity of Arf1 using the inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA) disrupted the assembly of the viral replicase complex and p27-mediated ER remodeling. We also showed that BFA treatment and the expression of dominant negative Arf1 mutants compromised RCNMV RNA replication in protoplasts. Interestingly, the expression of a dominant negative mutant of Sar1, a key regulator of the biogenesis of COPII vesicles at ER exit sites, also compromised RCNMV RNA replication. These results suggest that the replication of RCNMV depends on the host membrane traffic

p33-Independent Activation of a Truncated p92 RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase of Tomato Bushy Stunt Virus in Yeast Cell-Free Extract,"Plus-stranded RNA viruses replicate in membrane-bound structures containing the viral replicase complex (VRC). A key component of the VRC is the virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which should be activated and incorporated into the VRC after its translation. To study the activation of the RdRp of Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV), a small tombusvirus of plants, we used N-terminal truncated recombinant RdRp, which supported RNA synthesis in a cell-free yeast extract-based assay. The truncated RdRp required a cis-acting RNA replication element and soluble host factors, while unlike the full-length TBSV RdRp, the truncated RdRp did not need the viral p33 replication cofactor or cellular membranes for RNA synthesis. Interestingly, the truncated RdRp used 3′-terminal extension for initiation and terminated prematurely at an internal cis-acting element. However, the truncated RdRp could perform de novo initiation on a TBSV plus-strand RNA template in the presence of the p33 replication cofactor, cellular membranes, and soluble host proteins. Altogether, the data obtained with the truncated RdRp indicate that this RdRp still requires activation, but with the participation of fewer components than with the full-length RdRp, making it suitable for future studies on dissection of the RdRp activation mechanism.",-0.027012058,-0.050182194,-0.02896139,-0.05567732,-0.012820257,0.058240864,0.043320496,-0.005457512,0.03766804,0.052089345,0.06250211,-0.040928096,0.006031903,-0.005053662,0.023858711,-0.061485626,-0.05280609,-0.019682217,0.058593262,0.026151724,-0.01536539,0.053124703,-0.060945038,0.037273847,-0.011618916,0.047180686,0.054967426,-0.05738978,-0.056292612,-0.03515864,0.05319134,0.033276845,-0.03321471,-0.033481248,0.052651107,-0.03081247,-0.04748983,0.05720194,-0.051014166,-0.023423174,0.034306318,-0.060124032,0.045476574,-0.053941045,0.06123111,-0.053004306,-0.007823494,-0.05543352,-0.001233138,-0.042210203,-0.048103414,0.0344212,-0.06085071,-0.055858657,-0.008342264,0.028140785,-0.045568213,0.020399947,0.059096973,-0.012310033,0.002700873,-0.029588332,0.0517812,-0.001650483,0.03725841,-0.061191298,0.059023563,-0.022264775,0.058343593,-0.034717273,0.006060568,0.0418452,0.017368045,0.025854217,-0.042465832,-0.049063776,0.06032687,0.022375498,0.024396446,0.031994157,-0.035675224,0.06252009,-0.044384703,-0.060331825,-0.042463683,0.060597423,-0.0481868,0.02473443,-0.055593204,0.006834555,-0.025648376,-0.04216869,-0.06035455,-0.010015615,0.035984863,0.051012624,0.046688125,0.05667222,0.062405102,-0.05436287,-0.059977874,0.000301846,0.013662749,-0.057342894,0.014522494,0.05573767,0.05852384,-0.045036938,-0.015841072,-0.049787812,-0.052171428,0.026744569,-0.009033902,0.05867403,0.060349017,0.01567055,-0.06161336,0.009827336,-0.04862693,-0.009685501,-0.059319697,0.06202603,0.049930386,-0.037838954,0.054078925,0.053324584,-0.03135221,0.005356044,0.025701508,0.030868793,-0.007014103,0.06264928,0.061813902,0.003477964,-0.034043822,-0.03309286,0.028088592,0.041178066,-0.05082154,0.016426455,-0.045782927,0.06264852,-0.061156876,-0.026272036,-0.05117625,-0.058988586,0.039067294,-0.061448883,0.000632532,0.03997797,0.043195527,-0.062443223,-0.030882642,-0.034130692,0.062653325,0.055738173,-0.059628926,0.05979653,0.004760391,0.016231818,0.02601941,0.022789808,-0.05784973,0.026836615,-0.011239772,0.005429768,-0.062137246,-0.040671177,-0.016318485,-0.0515225,-0.046452757,0.016738549,-0.06056675,0.006302748,0.0607382,-0.044040263,0.01914341,-0.004073015,0.062154934,-0.048882023,-0.000162959,0.056722812,0.038095914,-0.026604915,0.058611456,-0.03204995,-0.057959363,0.062131718,0.04614914,-0.024310164,0.057584524,-0.05142903,0.031172222,0.012623983,0.062059414,0.019893074,0.0571051,-0.023273697,0.023969637,-0.05782777,-0.048855025,0.055799697,-0.056025777,-0.010234012,0.052445997,-0.043038584,-0.026729837,0.05826804,-0.004990973,0.06179216,-0.000122478,0.06102999,0.058280595,-0.03078943,-0.06030853,-0.060572818,0.054284755,0.014057157,-0.061398637,0.044376228,0.045635127,-0.050171692,0.03887437,-0.052405525,-0.021968504,0.005951671,-0.06149104,-0.008596772,0.030649327,-0.039003037,-0.044440925,-0.013254625,-0.00630013,-0.062629476,0.059530154,0.032215,0.045214426,-0.055761803,-0.024753053,0.04825595,0.057319205,0.002801143,-0.011481398,0.008250897,0.04575244,-0.012299945,0.01529316,0.05655078,0.05254293,0.027904542,-0.06264866,0.046503905,-0.000677974,0.032979563,0.06182827,-0.018511044,-0.03969466,0.06265334,-0.05978405,0.028154323,0.014020805,0.026018737,0.019381417,0.059894312,-0.008616926,0.051186018,-0.006387973,0.027253542,-0.054798212,0.059584953,0.033747204,0.062046286,-0.039008234,0.061926376,0.027317202,-0.06069886,0.05524884,0.05740599,0.062078305,-0.044033166,-0.04958593,-0.06031005,-0.05688992,0.059197396,-0.046573058,-0.04591725,-0.06119566,0.04198297,-0.058360387,-0.03503021,0.06227988,-0.05566673,0.04893008,0.02978639,0.017035093,-0.05708346,-0.008336117,-0.04023893,-0.061886285,-0.013500802,-0.047588777,0.059886746,0.005616052,0.01694883,0.046887405,0.013192412,-0.059027016,-0.04190749,0.03423302,-0.05317206,0.054102268,-0.018476741,0.044775896,-0.06101031,0.06112507,0.044967756,0.03810671,-0.027869513,0.01302454,0.004740813,0.0212777,0.025781587,-0.03916334,-0.05971448,0.040632285,0.043251187,0.002723621,-0.056702927,0.041773587,-0.059588265,0.014216607,0.060817197,-0.016048806,0.061836965,0.048612013,0.03570963,0.048631325,0.053003874,0.048885487,-0.000159549,-0.019754978,-0.012188761,0.05985654,-0.02494587,-0.06265295,-0.06264513,-0.019626835,0.0487243,-0.02274945,-0.043252088,0.02599719,0.02629509,-0.05973003,-0.007442629,-0.032552786,-0.041678853,-0.06264679,-0.053227693,-0.041501544,0.03500222,0.040728334,-0.059058744,-0.061029054,-0.009071883,0.048886675,-0.036671005,0.06260499,0.059376284,0.05959528,0.035729177,-0.025246006,-0.03988816,-0.030772358,-0.06265325,0.058950163,0.055108096,0.0566547,-0.05491434,0.030015929,-0.056455832,-0.0626371,0.061029594,-0.000584967,0.009438866,-0.000702275,-0.06150731,-0.057769492,-0.044407297,0.060268383,0.05226314,0.02985681,0.045608282,0.0575481,-0.052256323,-0.044630505,0.038357053,0.013780898,-0.05939937,0.029015074,-0.058890235,0.05275357,0.019145388,0.019678459,-0.007667297,-0.003987988,-0.008508108,-0.028535347,-0.031242136,0.036286272,0.046816364,0.03

Inclusion Bodies Are a Site of Ebolavirus Replication,"Inclusion bodies are a characteristic feature of ebolavirus infections in cells. They contain large numbers of preformed nucleocapsids, but their biological significance has been debated, and they have been suggested to be aggregates of viral proteins without any further biological function. However, recent data for other viruses that produce similar structures have suggested that inclusion bodies might be involved in genome replication and transcription. In order to study filovirus inclusion bodies, we fused mCherry to the ebolavirus polymerase L, which is found in inclusion bodies. The resulting L-mCherry fusion protein was functional in minigenome assays and incorporated into virus-like particles. Importantly, L-mCherry fluorescence in transfected cells was readily detectable and distributed in a punctate pattern characteristic for inclusion bodies. A recombinant ebolavirus encoding L-mCherry instead of L was rescued and showed virtually identical growth kinetics and endpoint titers to those for wild-type virus. Using this virus, we showed that the onset of inclusion body formation corresponds to the onset of viral genome replication, but that viral transcription occurs prior to inclusion body formation. Live-cell imaging further showed that inclusion bodies are highly dynamic structures and that they can undergo dramatic reorganization during cell division. Finally, by labeling nascent RNAs using click technology we showed that inclusion bodies are indeed the site of viral RNA synthesis. Based on these data we conclude that, rather than being inert aggregates of nucleocapsids, ebolavirus inclusion bodies are in fact complex and dynamic structures and an important site at which viral RNA replication takes

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Replication Inhibitor That Interferes with the Nucleic Acid Unwinding of the Viral Helicase,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious disease, caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), for which there are no approved treatments. We report the discovery of a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV that blocks replication by inhibiting the unwinding activity of the SARS-CoV helicase (nsp13). We used a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based helicase assay to screen the Maybridge Hitfinder chemical library. We identified and validated a compound (SSYA10-001) that specifically blocks the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and dsDNA unwinding activities of nsp13, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) of 5.70 and 5.30 μM, respectively. This compound also has inhibitory activity (50% effective concentration [EC(50)] = 8.95 μM) in a SARS-CoV replicon assay, with low cytotoxicity (50% cytotoxic concentration [CC(50)] = >250 μM), suggesting that the helicase plays a still unidentified critical role in the SARS-CoV life cycle. Enzyme kinetic studies on the mechanism of nsp13 inhibition revealed that SSYA10-001 acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of nsp13 with respect to nucleic acid and ATP substrates. Moreover, SSYA10-001 does not affect ATP hydrolysis or nsp13 binding to the nucleic acid substrate. SSYA10-001 did not inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) helicase, other bacterial and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, or reverse transcriptase. These results suggest that SSYA10-001 specifically blocks nsp13 through a novel mechanism and is less likely to interfere with the functions of cellular enzymes that process nucleic acids or ATP. Hence, it is possible that SSYA10-001 inhibits unwinding by nsp13 by affecting conformational changes during the course of the reaction or translocation on the nucleic acid.

"Respiratory virus laboratory pandemic planning and surveillance in central Viet Nam, 2008–2010","INTRODUCTION: Laboratory capacity is needed in central Viet Nam to provide early warning to public health authorities of respiratory outbreaks of importance to human health, for example the outbreak of influenza A(H1N1) pandemic in 2009. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedures established as part of a capacity-building process were used to conduct prospective respiratory surveillance in a region where few previous studies have been undertaken. METHODS: Between October 2008 and September 2010, nose and throat swabs from adults and children (approximately 20 per week) presenting with an acute respiratory illness to the Ninh Hoa General Hospital were collected. Same-day PCR testing and result reporting for 13 respiratory viruses were carried out by locally trained scientists. RESULTS: Of 2144 surveillance samples tested, 1235 (57.6%) were positive for at least one virus. The most common were influenza A strains (17.9%), with pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 and seasonal H3N2 strain accounting for 52% and 43% of these, respectively. Other virus detections included: rhinovirus (12.4%), enterovirus (8.9%), influenza B (8.3%), adenovirus (5.3%), parainfluenza (4.7%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (3.9%), human coronavirus (3.0%) and human metapneumovirus (0.3%). The detection rate was greatest in the 0–5 year age group. Viral co-infections were identified in 148 (6.9%) cases. DISCUSSION: The outbreak in 2009 of the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic strain provided a practical test of the laboratory’s pandemic plan.

S1 gene sequence analysis of new variant isolates of avian infectious bronchitis virus in Tunisia,"PURPOSE: Tissue samples were collected from suspected broiler flocks showing respiratory signs to identify infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), characterize emerging field strains, and study their relationships with the Massachusetts H120 strain, the only IB vaccine used in Tunisia. SAMPLES AND METHODS: Several IBV isolates were identified from field samples collected from flocks located in different regions in the northeast of Tunisia. The IBV isolates were characterized and compared to commonly used vaccine strains (including 793B, D274, and H120 types), other reference IBV strains from Europe, and the recently characterized Tunisian field variants TN20/00, TN200/01, and TN335/01. Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing analyses of the hypervariable regions of the S1 gene were carried out. RESULTS: Four new IBV variants were isolated during the period 2007–10 and were designated TN295/07, TN296/07, TN556/07, and TN557/07. The amino acid sequence data showed 100% similarity between TN295/07 and TN296/07, suggesting that these two isolates are identical and belong to the same genotype. Similar results were demonstrated for TN556/07 and TN557/07. Sequence identity values indicated that TN296/07 and TN556/07 share 55% amino acid homologies between each other, but are very different from the reference IBV serotypes, in particular the H120 strain. It was also shown that they have 50%–77% similarities with the Tunisian virus isolated between 2000 and 2001. Phylogenetic clustering allowed classification of these Tunisian isolates as new genotypes that are closer to TN200/01, TN335/01 Tunisian field variants, and Italy02 variant than MassH120 vaccine strain. CONCLUSION: S1 sequence analyses confirmed the cocirculation of H120 vaccine strain with novel IBV variants isolated from Tunisian

Development of a Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay for Rapid Detection of Capripoxviruses,"Sheep pox (SP), goat pox (GP), and lumpy skin disease (LSD), caused by capripoxviruses (CaPVs), are economically important diseases of sheep, goats, and cattle, respectively. Here, we report the development of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for rapid detection of CaPVs. LAMP primers were designed to target a conserved gene encoding the poly(A) polymerase small subunit (VP39) of CaPVs. Hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) was incorporated to monitor assay progress by color change from violet when negative to sky blue when positive, and results were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The LAMP assay was shown to be highly specific for CaPVs, with no apparent cross-reactivity to other related viruses (near neighbors) or viruses that cause similar clinical signs (look-a-like viruses). The performance of LAMP was compared to that of a highly sensitive quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay. LAMP and qPCR exhibited similar analytical sensitivities, with limits of detection of 3 and 8 viral genome copies, respectively. Diagnostic specificity was assessed on 36 negative specimens, including swabs and EDTA blood from control sheep, goats, and cattle. Diagnostic sensitivity was assessed on 275 specimens, including EDTA blood, swabs, and tissues from experimentally infected sheep, goats, and cattle. Overall agreement on diagnostic test results between the two assays was 90 to 95% for specificity and 89 to 100% for sensitivity. The LAMP assay described in this report is simple to use, inexpensive, highly sensitive, and particularly well suited for the diagnosis of capripox in less well equipped laboratories and in rural settings where resources are

"Isolation and Characterization of a Novel Betacoronavirus Subgroup A Coronavirus, Rabbit Coronavirus HKU14, from Domestic Rabbits","We describe the isolation and characterization of a novel Betacoronavirus subgroup A coronavirus, rabbit coronavirus HKU14 (RbCoV HKU14), from domestic rabbits. The virus was detected in 11 (8.1%) of 136 rabbit fecal samples by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), with a viral load of up to 10(8) copies/ml. RbCoV HKU14 was able to replicate in HRT-18G and RK13 cells with cytopathic effects. Northern blotting confirmed the production of subgenomic mRNAs coding for the HE, S, NS5a, E, M, and N proteins. Subgenomic mRNA analysis revealed a transcription regulatory sequence, 5′-UCUAAAC-3′. Phylogenetic analysis showed that RbCoV HKU14 formed a distinct branch among Betacoronavirus subgroup A coronaviruses, being most closely related to but separate from the species Betacoronavirus 1. A comparison of the conserved replicase domains showed that RbCoV HKU14 possessed <90% amino acid identities to most members of Betacoronavirus 1 in ADP-ribose 1″-phosphatase (ADRP) and nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU), indicating that RbCoV HKU14 should represent a separate species. RbCoV HKU14 also possessed genomic features distinct from those of other Betacoronavirus subgroup A coronaviruses, including a unique NS2a region with a variable number of small open reading frames (ORFs). Recombination analysis revealed possible recombination events during the evolution of RbCoV HKU14 and members of Betacoronavirus 1, which may have occurred during cross-species transmission. Molecular clock analysis using RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes dated the most recent common ancestor of RbCoV HKU14 to around 2002, suggesting that this virus has emerged relatively recently. Antibody against RbCoV was detected in 20 (67%) of 30 rabbit sera tested by an N-protein-based Western blot assay, whereas neutralizing antibody was detected in 1 of these 20 rabbits.",-0.05374181,0.044839144,-0.019366164,-0.029774906,0.030353801,0.061489787,-0.04100983,0.005806013,0.051403906,0.059280265,0.06175043,-0.02154471,-0.00266329,0.04987592,0.043725684,-0.060307972,-0.040702097,-0.04627217,0.058007486,0.003224008,-0.059125423,-0.011027789,-0.059891272,0.054964952,0.036981124,0.055186883,0.03862455,0.04952816,0.015262277,0.003118432,0.057766695,0.058664404,-0.043171167,-0.029725127,0.03769909,0.05488587,-0.061403006,0.007359657,-0.06130797,0.023210205,0.043877095,-0.008592429,-0.019212145,-0.046056375,-0.059277,-0.04290189,-0.031730037,-0.055079326,0.058921114,-0.046276383,0.056952253,0.028636169,-0.06162789,-0.05916834,-0.004886739,0.053613655,-0.060719762,-0.053124048,0.05984012,-0.05604054,0.013435118,0.008898402,-0.036086656,0.001634024,0.026766667,-0.061406694,0.05899941,0.013195834,0.057333566,-0.040126286,0.013600661,0.058868397,0.026956152,0.06139259,-0.025810027,0.053712547,0.043634754,0.035871767,-0.060120266,0.016709836,-0.04135368,0.061601516,-0.012640573,-0.013023713,-0.02261479,0.059207276,-0.02172644,0.05294838,-0.05847344,0.020017153,0.007653152,-0.042999826,-0.03541531,0.02289297,0.035536002,0.05902152,0.05855039,0.05526707,0.06169621,0.03688085,0.017705517,0.055315766,-0.033016313,-0.017419398,0.022162508,0.039025046,0.025151882,0.025853511,0.05079877,0.024539316,0.032849215,0.03294322,0.032241218,-0.011124909,0.05677991,0.019637914,-0.05819346,0.032139223,-0.018990539,-0.038867265,-0.038224723,0.027226457,0.029204158,-0.012269472,0.01384085,0.05653899,0.05089867,-0.032848362,-0.001951615,-0.02953528,-0.026894934,0.061752222,0.061409075,0.033874728,-0.019336639,-0.058784317,-0.0457259,0.042970542,-0.058223028,-0.006966485,-0.003072219,0.061761413,-0.061206486,-0.05152364,0.013591331,-0.044572156,0.06003533,-0.060018454,0.05023421,0.037834242,-0.030465111,-0.0416557,-0.058243956,-0.044457298,0.06174491,0.031677283,0.042604383,0.060388383,0.05319251,-0.024370005,-0.05108006,-0.055329535,-0.025193201,0.058634534,0.002475177,-0.035664327,-0.05892696,0.006269197,-0.059714075,-0.05638793,0.054500677,0.03228344,-0.05912567,0.010071596,-0.059475277,0.022247666,0.0539316,0.012284377,0.06063222,-0.04205147,0.034413055,-0.04491098,-0.03862403,0.04408234,0.021442804,-0.002775969,-0.058491785,0.0549159,0.022127058,0.020364694,0.061588522,-0.04346655,0.03895823,0.021607282,0.061647773,-0.032377105,-0.022754494,0.00943121,0.05273474,-0.011136111,-0.05977114,0.057156317,0.05686678,-0.015846211,0.060714554,-0.045695897,-0.001936024,0.061718326,0.04057352,0.061648455,0.022602897,0.061759077,0.05331951,0.061440606,-0.061593443,-0.002319313,0.0531241,0.059136882,0.031196134,0.031021686,0.034197267,0.026625676,0.03828391,0.055927277,0.044874396,-0.026072484,-0.054371268,-0.060104407,0.049680334,-0.013154647,0.003773765,0.06054306,-0.022162138,-0.061761413,0.05849603,0.054777455,0.058517426,-0.059077863,-0.040811192,0.053749423,0.038790025,0.009056457,-0.053272642,-0.018705253,0.061051585,-0.030795846,-0.045604877,0.012843537,0.055360913,-0.048674818,-0.057377577,-0.02025551,-0.047287922,0.022670204,0.058910195,0.051776163,-0.059486415,0.06176143,0.019212151,0.005035498,0.02693488,0.058580562,0.017456025,0.06042855,-0.037462063,-0.025401842,-0.025404004,-0.0501783,-0.04453202,0.02015302,0.035291716,0.061722204,0.026253905,-0.02338195,-0.03176779,-0.057991397,-0.003735245,-0.032241248,0.06103447,-0.012623319,-0.060696665,-0.057996973,-0.04908981,0.0583315,-0.060359456,-0.034208048,-0.055745013,0.061591495,-0.053173944,-0.033989564,0.06145185,-0.054248024,0.06124802,-0.030619716,-0.05845878,-0.049759302,-0.051273093,-0.057811487,-0.06153762,0.052356463,-0.03413656,0.05659497,0.05655032,-0.020559933,-0.053076718,0.054192137,0.056873605,-0.058068506,0.007788838,-0.010734953,0.055443756,-0.011458145,-0.006999568,0.003518409,0.060345106,0.003326655,-0.018433217,-0.047034174,0.059714213,-0.018490378,-0.05896376,0.00740188,0.045381468,-0.046575435,-0.038667046,0.027034424,-0.00896995,-0.05329881,-0.06153017,-0.033852864,0.048984405,0.030026179,0.012400137,0.06034877,-0.047178805,-0.03859519,0.057884704,-0.01348045,-0.015357486,-0.004411703,0.021834245,-0.018908909,0.057802316,0.05221543,-0.061744135,-0.05945823,0.041198324,0.05981395,-0.054060485,-0.04564152,0.019987348,0.011559882,-0.050655495,-0.0411647,0.05369842,0.024316102,-0.06176024,-0.048143264,0.021659661,-0.061420597,0.03634986,-0.042572003,-0.05743253,0.055608865,0.04689398,-0.028274765,0.061687347,0.057046592,0.06061957,-0.013643452,-0.018968407,0.037704673,-0.007896153,-0.061196394,0.05988277,0.009868717,0.051739722,-0.033862025,0.033037636,-0.05699134,-0.060012303,0.047304545,0.027887471,0.058524232,0.00241446,-0.030974021,-0.060503755,-0.048820347,0.039501045,0.020431653,0.00058861,0.052850243,0.054901853,-0.034115657,-0.01833163,0.053231668,0.030900845,-0.061248675,0.018159976,-0.061619047,0.05408665,-0.020818437,-0.012876842,0.03081782,0.029113058,-0.05287164,-0.050525393,0.043199778,0.04758569,0.01846922,0.0326486

Visualizing Coronavirus RNA Synthesis in Time by Using Click Chemistry,"Coronaviruses induce in infected cells the formation of replicative structures, consisting of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes, where viral RNA synthesis supposedly takes place and to which the nonstructural proteins (nsp's) localize. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), the presumed intermediate in RNA synthesis, is localized to the DMV interior. However, as pores connecting the DMV interior with the cytoplasm have not been detected, it is unclear whether RNA synthesis occurs at these same sites. Here, we studied coronavirus RNA synthesis by feeding cells with a uridine analogue, after which nascent RNAs were detected using click chemistry. Early in infection, nascent viral RNA and nsp's colocalized with or occurred adjacent to dsRNA foci. Late in infection, the correlation between dsRNA dots, then found dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, and nsp's and nascent RNAs was less obvious. However, foci of nascent RNAs were always found to colocalize with the nsp12-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. These results demonstrate the feasibility of detecting viral RNA synthesis by using click chemistry and indicate that dsRNA dots do not necessarily correspond with sites of active viral RNA synthesis. Rather, late in infection many DMVs may harbor dsRNA molecules that are no longer functioning as intermediates in RNA

Nonstructural Proteins 7 and 8 of Feline Coronavirus Form a 2:1 Heterotrimer That Exhibits Primer-Independent RNA Polymerase Activity,"Nonstructural proteins 7 and 8 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have previously been shown by X-ray crystallography to form an 8:8 hexadecamer. In addition, it has been demonstrated that N-terminally His(6)-tagged SARS-CoV Nsp8 is a primase able to synthesize RNA oligonucleotides with a length of up to 6 nucleotides. We present here the 2.6-Å crystal structure of the feline coronavirus (FCoV) Nsp7:Nsp8 complex, which is a 2:1 heterotrimer containing two copies of the α-helical Nsp7 with conformational differences between them, and one copy of Nsp8 that consists of an α/β domain and a long-α-helix domain. The same stoichiometry is found for the Nsp7:Nsp8 complex in solution, as demonstrated by chemical cross-linking, size exclusion chromatography, and small-angle X-ray scattering. Furthermore, we show that FCoV Nsp8, like its SARS-CoV counterpart, is able to synthesize short oligoribonucleotides of up to 6 nucleotides in length when carrying an N-terminal His(6) tag. Remarkably, the same protein harboring the sequence GPLG instead of the His(6) tag at its N terminus exhibits a substantially increased, primer-independent RNA polymerase activity. Upon addition of Nsp7, the RNA polymerase activity is further enhanced so that RNA up to template length (67 nucleotides) can be synthesized. Further, we show that the unprocessed intermediate polyprotein Nsp7-10 of human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E is also capable of synthesizing oligoribonucleotides up to a chain length of six. These results indicate that in case of FCoV as well as of HCoV 229E, the formation of a hexadecameric Nsp7:Nsp8 complex is not necessary for RNA polymerase activity. Further, the FCoV Nsp7:Nsp8 complex functions as a noncanonical RNA polymerase capable of synthesizing RNA of up to template

Presence of Viral Nucleic Acids in the Middle Ear: Acute Otitis Media Pathogen or Bystander?,"Viruses play an important role in acute otitis media (AOM) pathogenesis and live viruses may cause AOM in absence of pathogenic bacteria. Detection of AOM pathogens generally relies on bacterial culture of middle ear fluid. When viral culture is used and live viruses are detected in the middle ear fluid of children with AOM, the viruses are generally accepted as AOM pathogens. Because viral culture is not sensitive and does not detect the comprehensive spectrum of respiratory viruses, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are commonly used to detect viral nucleic acids in the middle ear fluid. While PCR assays have greatly increased the viral detection rate, new questions arise on the significance of viral nucleic acids detected in the middle ear because nucleic acids of multiple viruses are detected simultaneously, and nucleic acids of specific viruses are detected repeatedly and in a high proportion of asymptomatic children. This article first reviews the role of live viruses in AOM and presents the point-counter point arguments on whether viral nucleic acids in the middle ear represent an AOM pathogen or a bystander status. While there is evidence to support both directions, helpful information for interpretation of the data and future research direction are outlined.",0.012479111,0.05206597,0.028966587,0.007274504,0.050585907,0.057324097,0.05490155,0.007301717,-0.04013932,0.022658724,0.058114085,0.031055575,-0.040903974,-0.03792679,0.05547002,-0.0580604,-0.058091372,-0.05074919,0.048682235,-0.043259293,-0.051135875,-0.03430623,-0.050592825,0.05781152,-0.057539396,0.03810287,-0.038197212,-0.054683566,-0.009643214,-0.054562714,0.031700984,0.058107167,0.036328048,0.05256344,0.012255466,-0.000743857,-0.05740026,0.02783447,-0.057734184,0.012119303,0.039640028,-0.047118384,0.042222366,-0.002413677,0.04743057,-0.05701834,-0.000310028,-0.024767777,-0.008943608,-0.029961677,0.04277282,0.046554662,-0.05554857,0.03925145,-0.058018547,-0.03785123,-0.05357093,0.012669781,0.05802765,0.05738362,-0.04772439,-0.023401573,0.050038267,-0.01756078,0.013577541,-0.057998635,0.053000532,-0.021460954,0.046849515,-0.046672884,-0.044251442,0.040707316,0.055644535,0.05685985,0.041087817,-0.05244423,0.031952504,-0.050098762,-0.05810864,0.049229007,-0.043851856,0.055843808,0.05629921,-0.04031981,-0.028727897,0.035875067,0.040261112,0.05553732,-0.054496642,-0.052896988,0.041755028,-0.052415576,-0.054354526,-0.012508352,0.029867439,0.049337327,0.009840737,0.057482243,0.05811314,0.035689812,-0.05691213,0.027034651,0.0063025,0.046353187,-0.034708153,0.057847586,0.044260435,-0.05678041,0.038513724,-0.02413996,-0.01691998,0.050510474,0.049168244,0.0513675,0.057622854,0.033562202,0.025217187,-0.027426803,-0.022700962,0.051242903,-0.046620715,0.0421369,0.056589782,-0.056895506,0.009324611,0.015084622,0.013711662,-0.05254639,0.022334965,0.0278592,-0.022357728,0.058114126,0.041048985,0.04575748,0.05093887,-0.04769723,0.032636385,0.03132812,-0.046061985,-0.056284145,0.03713817,0.05778622,-0.05576461,-0.054743905,0.03703744,-0.05713996,-0.028183611,-0.05804083,0.037020843,0.03538646,0.051135648,-0.04826256,-0.023242582,-0.035609398,0.05811368,-0.056036055,0.05468914,-0.04617918,-0.05683742,0.041472424,0.052876476,-0.020866932,-0.034637846,0.007656391,0.05469957,-0.04682508,-0.057091802,0.056632217,-0.05596555,-0.056501616,0.012932265,-0.054371286,-0.052323036,-0.025272569,0.056623176,0.003253163,-0.02139495,-0.047281496,0.041034512,-0.046611853,-0.005823771,0.05699821,0.013110607,0.04925963,0.051419552,-0.05569507,-0.05811065,-0.014028744,0.029019013,0.006310879,0.056753792,-0.050972123,-0.026062666,-0.027046533,0.054811038,-0.027280167,0.015578828,0.035011116,-0.04502286,0.017235594,-0.04700224,0.058023695,-0.00905514,-0.057443775,0.039453853,-0.057016116,0.018617842,0.051508963,0.0457837,0.058084533,0.04890361,0.02854605,0.043938957,0.041928854,0.046185642,0.035469063,-0.021389393,-0.007227801,-0.057603214,0.036872305,0.036582716,0.009922604,0.029770782,0.05338966,-0.05436418,0.052571684,-0.057721414,-0.05806963,0.055270545,0.049882524,0.051114336,0.04948401,0.032450005,-0.05811358,0.047864746,0.05640002,0.02119503,-0.057968136,-0.002624688,-0.049466882,-0.056019194,0.014128987,-0.007269996,-0.056721423,0.042104878,-0.057371303,0.041089945,0.046955667,0.046108626,0.039306197,-0.05805976,-0.023340972,0.02398055,0.04994723,0.057972677,0.016438229,-0.055918172,0.05811412,0.008126699,-0.05080508,0.05390206,0.025735447,-0.016764311,0.055158097,-0.028002061,-0.04428056,-0.057630625,0.005855169,0.042955197,0.056056768,-0.03269468,0.030400435,-0.057844553,-0.05430926,-0.030307528,-0.049303774,0.054011926,0.026701253,0.05804758,-0.0387585,-0.05765801,-0.054686405,0.019118493,-0.01821297,-0.0514374,0.011378989,-0.054989774,-0.030543735,-0.05512497,0.05755767,0.057162616,0.016676072,0.058031335,-0.044347577,-0.0164352,-0.043760326,-0.041668866,-0.03629456,-0.056969088,0.029407997,-0.039039,0.058063697,0.010552784,0.05754868,-0.042869672,0.05502035,0.003493701,-0.04125528,0.055159993,-0.022763632,0.052048534,-0.028653782,-0.021459976,-0.038345177,0.058077358,0.004954822,0.056992188,0.052728273,0.058051415,0.03393134,-0.030948728,0.05716204,0.045119807,-0.051536974,0.007483995,0.058051914,-0.010541091,-0.05335889,-0.017461227,-0.048800185,0.053752862,0.05780629,0.026066076,0.05779511,0.022093011,-0.032099817,0.002567635,-0.042303685,-0.03888099,-0.042633288,0.040090173,0.025949232,0.051855043,0.05717158,-0.05811333,-0.058113497,0.040791903,0.056524232,-0.054432858,-0.056581404,0.039857365,-0.030798936,0.022546722,-0.022300292,0.054156695,0.004866276,-0.058113724,-0.037950534,-0.009521275,-0.007775873,0.006589587,-0.0577703,-0.057861052,0.055788133,-0.04989639,0.018253513,0.05810481,0.006155977,-0.028700033,-0.050165746,0.032002237,0.028156884,-0.058021795,-0.05807983,0.05665845,0.026309144,0.053405486,0.038387798,-0.054992925,-0.021400781,-0.054290183,0.053469323,0.032199126,0.04027577,-0.0468733,-0.054931812,0.05347615,-0.058099262,-0.05119735,-0.005477557,0.05454722,-0.05613112,0.0450701,-0.035100132,-0.033461414,0.04572218,-0.056027118,-0.051908202,0.027121631,0.055801976,-0.038581844,0.05694286,0.043484513,0.05674085,0.053490896,0.003294093,-0.050079394,0.05581057,0.037293766,0.011897562,0.057792194,0.03386

"Natural Occurrence and Characterization of Two Internal Ribosome Entry Site Elements in a Novel Virus, Canine Picodicistrovirus, in the Picornavirus-Like Superfamily","Dicistroviridae and Picornaviridae are two phylogenetically related families of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses in the picornavirus-like superfamily with similar gene contents but different genome organizations and hosts. In a surveillance study involving 1,472 samples from 368 dogs over a 22-month period, we identified a novel picornavirus-like virus from 47 fecal and urine samples by the use of reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of three complete genomes revealed that, although it seemed that the virus was most closely related to other picornaviruses, P1, P2, and P3 of the virus possessed very low amino acid identities of <30% to those of all other known picornaviruses and that the amino acid identities between the 3D(pol) and 2C of the virus and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and helicases of all other picornaviruses were <35%. Distinct from other picornaviruses, the genomes of the virus contain two putative internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) and two open reading frames, encoding two polyprotein precursors (844 and 1,406 amino acids), separated by an intergenic region (IGR) of 588 bases. A dual-luciferase activity assay using DNA and RNA transfection revealed that both IRESs were functional. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that numbers of viral RNAs ranged from 7.55 × 10(6) to 1.26 × 10(9) copies/ml of urine and 1.82 × 10(6) to 4.97 × 10(10) copies/ml of fecal sample. This is the first report of the natural occurrence of two functional IRESs in nondicistroviruses. Based on our results, we have proposed a novel species, canine picodicistrovirus (CPDV), to describe this novel member of the picornavirus-like superfamily, which could represent a novel family of viruses.",-0.0581069,0.030195884,-0.05179983,0.03433627,0.05557163,0.059760585,0.033074945,-0.039715815,-0.023741856,0.027081372,0.060716152,-0.031443767,-0.059457466,0.013169997,0.016239343,-0.06033741,-0.060599726,-0.04327282,0.055621214,0.02555753,-0.03829597,0.003311822,-0.058938004,0.0603917,0.03148378,0.054426823,0.058575418,-0.001630411,0.04416926,-0.057654962,0.05393527,0.060708996,-0.040027212,-0.015525257,0.028348835,-0.002936404,-0.059069976,0.018084794,-0.06030039,0.055901263,0.04517386,-0.035308164,0.008419866,-0.03566622,-0.015864667,-0.04843353,-0.026273731,-0.029825477,0.057805445,-0.039314736,-0.04534274,0.041284632,-0.0606094,-0.058499392,-0.05834123,0.040868748,-0.060082283,0.016699517,0.043678913,-0.038316254,0.052557997,0.044097833,-0.009803503,0.02030187,0.051056407,-0.06057644,0.059011485,-0.05137749,0.05148697,0.029571757,-0.03143495,0.05837227,-7.11E-05,0.059649386,-0.039345138,0.047848348,0.05287456,-0.006359156,-0.05987194,0.045469206,-0.030573687,0.05967474,0.04232346,-0.04721984,-0.044363473,0.06002198,-0.043503378,-0.002658269,-0.05603179,-0.010781461,-0.045272484,-0.052686173,-0.040460605,0.03831401,-0.007748629,0.059821203,0.052415345,0.05886294,0.060669795,0.023526743,-0.03768787,0.042358976,-0.037894722,0.03678578,0.023523385,0.05337079,0.0353932,0.02385983,0.020415196,-0.006651222,0.03495978,0.043060552,0.01243584,0.050099757,0.05865951,-0.016803836,-0.059588414,-0.026635608,-0.042664014,-0.002832994,-0.018273667,0.056177426,0.056514602,-0.051374674,-0.000766275,0.034554977,0.034589704,-0.008519717,0.030920696,0.012921142,-0.000353073,0.060719073,0.051926903,-0.002955911,0.023956561,-0.054999113,-0.04511736,0.026456209,-0.045310713,-0.037943717,-0.03588735,0.06071914,-0.0569799,-0.00860266,0.050652403,-0.056096558,0.035357956,-0.05446399,0.028519165,0.008649061,-0.03777984,-0.054804478,-0.05810816,-0.007965754,0.06071757,0.047394194,0.040712096,0.04804865,-0.011959673,0.04332615,-0.05718155,-0.01935922,0.0164702,0.059779458,0.001513685,0.002438974,-0.05174313,0.030043077,-0.056452166,-0.05665267,0.04844823,0.002067372,-0.059611104,0.038278487,0.03159798,0.031136341,0.05440755,0.058071267,0.056470197,-0.038411345,-0.00517959,-0.007861021,-0.036327884,0.05491607,0.03465065,-0.029289277,-0.057716068,0.050928876,0.03515378,-0.008697281,0.060333442,-0.03288518,-0.001028457,0.011915022,0.060644522,-0.05125986,0.05009613,0.024241839,0.019209418,-0.002326066,-0.045414157,0.04775817,-0.036637742,0.011660287,0.021670027,-0.05717234,0.054058883,0.05994165,0.011172936,0.060215387,-0.006186798,0.057978388,-0.000906671,0.054069344,-0.0601769,-0.026884861,0.025386777,0.04354217,-0.034210164,-0.047038525,0.05079665,-0.005039495,0.05630728,0.026288094,-0.04782882,-0.005718854,-0.049534317,-0.05746277,0.0597435,0.03175843,0.04912429,0.060225874,-0.013161525,-0.060719173,0.054460384,0.028689133,0.055870764,-0.06042156,-0.04239281,0.04312547,0.052282337,0.05720981,-0.05917558,-0.054336704,0.060139854,0.02091872,-0.036629394,0.050571006,0.058802444,-0.029513251,-0.05771115,0.042639155,-0.004105449,0.025030024,0.045557715,0.03541761,-0.057083227,0.06071924,0.03291875,0.04850806,0.052742314,0.05867733,-0.048680242,0.05671562,-0.016420793,-0.034168832,-0.026259735,0.016027458,0.002824124,0.047747187,-0.022413865,0.060679663,0.01511052,-0.027827337,-0.00135993,-0.058867205,0.056764178,0.039268773,0.06016919,-0.050621875,-0.05679909,-0.013612119,-0.052510045,0.059545483,-0.048201565,-0.034894727,-0.055590063,0.058375698,-0.052018847,-0.013723592,0.060680646,-0.05497578,0.060284015,-0.011892499,-0.057705596,-0.05941637,-0.020228062,-0.056459352,-0.060614992,0.051885843,0.01702099,0.06058215,0.052958254,0.043362148,-0.060582954,0.043448333,-0.010140357,-0.033313334,0.044360597,-0.046121612,0.017007615,-0.023518935,0.018101053,-0.035027858,0.06046556,-0.028729342,0.029592004,-0.016362153,0.06013182,0.021841988,-0.027321132,-0.02947684,0.05530583,-0.054261446,-0.006980859,0.039598603,-0.055386808,-0.022178348,-0.06005066,-0.053976376,0.05088762,0.032126073,0.044165008,0.058710184,-0.014862224,-0.04681848,0.036512017,0.042276092,0.01560338,0.022101264,0.019311212,-0.045533367,0.056383725,0.025661303,-0.060712393,-0.06013149,0.05034924,0.060470052,-0.058243774,-0.057416026,-0.048788253,-0.04403192,-0.05335072,-0.013356502,0.044024307,0.027991267,-0.060718264,-0.059967026,-0.033555873,-0.05942942,0.052942403,-0.059104346,-0.05612079,0.05223667,0.025715448,-0.052031007,0.06065314,0.05660571,0.058949005,-0.02284646,-0.003719777,0.02778661,-0.012720671,-0.059826013,0.058117386,-0.013214801,0.058716033,0.018750265,0.007590682,-0.05756724,-0.04989068,0.053633045,0.000479462,-0.026563702,-0.022679,-0.04725117,-0.050253328,-0.060208593,0.013995644,0.04826611,0.040496003,0.008630747,0.052269533,-0.056503296,-0.036926966,0.031055056,-0.056362517,-0.059971243,0.030069772,-0.06056808,-0.002250729,0.04509285,0.04334484,0.05898317,0.0293854,-0.043402195,-0.050546795,0.042948686,0.041196764,0.01904353,-0.002789721,0.00

"Transmissible Gastroenteritis Coronavirus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase and Nonstructural Proteins 2, 3, and 8 Are Incorporated into Viral Particles","Coronavirus replication and transcription are processes mediated by a protein complex, with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) as a main component. Proteomic analysis of highly purified transmissible gastroenteritis virus showed the RdRp to be a component of the viral particles. This finding was confirmed by Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and immunoelectron microscopy analyses. Interestingly, the replicase nonstructural proteins 2, 3, and 8 colocalized with the RdRp in the viral factories and were also incorporated into the

Arterivirus and Nairovirus Ovarian Tumor Domain-Containing Deubiquitinases Target Activated RIG-I To Control Innate Immune Signaling,"The innate immune response constitutes the first line of defense against viral infection and is extensively regulated through ubiquitination. The removal of ubiquitin from innate immunity signaling factors by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) therefore provides a potential opportunity for viruses to evade this host defense system. It was previously found that specific proteases encoded by the unrelated arteri- and nairoviruses resemble the ovarian tumor domain-containing (OTU) family of DUBs. In arteriviruses, this domain has been characterized before as a papain-like protease (PLP2) that is also involved in replicase polyprotein processing. In nairoviruses, the DUB resides in the polymerase protein but is not essential for RNA replication. Using both in vitro and cell-based assays, we now show that PLP2 DUB activity is conserved in all members of the arterivirus family and that both arteri- and nairovirus DUBs inhibit RIG-I-mediated innate immune signaling when overexpressed. The potential relevance of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling for the innate immune response against arterivirus infection is supported by our finding that in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the production of beta interferon primarily depends on the recognition of arterivirus RNA by the pattern-recognition receptor MDA5. Interestingly, we also found that both arteri- and nairovirus DUBs inhibit RIG-I ubiquitination upon overexpression, suggesting that both MDA5 and RIG-I have a role in countering infection by arteriviruses. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that arteri- and nairoviruses employ their deubiquitinating potential to inactivate cellular proteins involved in RLR-mediated innate immune

Replication of the Rotavirus Genome Requires an Active Ubiquitin-Proteasome System,"Here we show that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is required for the efficient replication of rotavirus RRV in MA104 cells. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 decreased the yield of infectious virus under conditions where it severely reduces the synthesis of not only viral but also cellular proteins. Addition of nonessential amino acids to the cell medium restored both viral protein synthesis and cellular protein synthesis, but the production of progeny viruses was still inhibited. In medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids, we showed that MG132 does not affect rotavirus entry but inhibits the replication of the viral genome. It was also shown that it prevents the efficient incorporation into viroplasms of viral polymerase VP1 and the capsid proteins VP2 and VP6, which could explain the inhibitory effect of MG132 on genome replication and infectious virus yield. We also showed that ubiquitination is relevant for rotavirus replication since the yield of rotavirus progeny in cells carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme was reduced at the restrictive temperature. In addition, overexpression of ubiquitin in MG132-treated MA104 cells partially reversed the effect of the inhibitor on virus yield. Altogether, these data suggest that the ubiquitin-proteasome (UP) system has a very complex interaction with the rotavirus life cycle, with both the ubiquitination and proteolytic activities of the

Mechanism of Glycyrrhizic Acid Inhibition of Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus: Disruption of CTCF-Cohesin-Mediated RNA Polymerase II Pausing and Sister Chromatid Cohesion,"Glycyrrhizic acid (GA), a derivative of licorice, selectively inhibits the growth of lymphocytes latently infected with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. The mechanism involves the deregulation of the multicistronic latency transcript, including the failure to generate the mature forms of viral mRNA encoding LANA. We show here that GA disrupts an RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complex that accumulates at the CTCF-cohesin binding site within the first intron of the latency transcript. GA altered the enrichment of the RNAPII pausing complex, along with pausing factors SPT5 and NELF-A, at the intragenic CTCF-cohesin binding sites. GA blocked the interaction of cohesin subunit SMC3 with another cohesin subunit, RAD21, and reduced SPT5 interaction with RNAPII. Covalent coupling of GA to a solid support revealed that GA interacts with several cellular proteins, including SMC3 and SPT5, but not their respective interaction partners RAD21 and RNAPII. GA treatment also inhibited the transcription of some cellular genes, like c-myc, which contain a similar CTCF-cohesin binding site within the first intron. We also found that GA leads to a more general loss of sister chromatid cohesion for cellular chromosomes. These findings suggest that RNAPII pauses at intragenic CTCF-cohesin binding sites and that abrogation of this pausing by GA leads to loss of proper mRNA production and defects in sister chromatid cohesion, a process important for both viral and cellular chromosome stability.",0.047419604,0.029808924,0.001651288,-0.04404247,0.001793702,0.032612037,-0.03454585,-0.033257686,0.03937319,0.059414495,0.06236795,0.026350316,-0.050549585,0.012554254,-0.001811352,-0.057489254,-0.03607663,-0.02108223,0.005978499,0.018449541,-0.039876398,0.04856489,0.044609156,0.054321583,-0.050092485,0.021539766,0.052838206,0.041011315,-0.059450485,-0.05234724,0.061306108,0.007800326,0.038131982,-0.059419017,0.044659596,0.0568281,-0.05400192,0.028683102,-0.052170355,0.010040966,0.04792038,0.03280854,0.014952631,-0.05491105,0.060743343,0.038230587,-0.027258603,-0.054971457,0.04045549,-0.051486555,-0.028488476,0.020943107,-0.059852894,-0.03970555,0.038957924,0.03179653,-0.046720568,0.042957395,0.053638406,-0.03764224,-0.028176686,-0.05301863,-0.016813587,0.028358527,-0.03564468,-0.062361047,0.061520245,0.038954347,0.04397993,-0.060362544,-0.012955788,0.033306684,0.05747797,0.03012632,-0.048518464,0.02039825,0.05847416,0.033161927,-0.014985831,0.006543872,-0.05167352,0.062186826,0.03589665,-0.034787074,-0.05107715,0.05251233,0.016453566,-0.036659367,-0.060033344,0.024979834,0.014086433,-0.001688304,-0.0340018,0.052912496,-0.05250547,0.053847708,0.059773374,0.062369082,0.06253598,0.03415319,-0.007791073,0.006325997,-0.051948406,0.031590156,0.014966176,0.056119394,-0.04626032,-0.003824444,0.035011005,-0.054180223,0.019744843,-0.040493246,0.05569913,0.002448404,0.06251566,0.012977533,-0.062293656,0.03752792,-0.05506047,-0.059376795,-0.059950773,0.061870877,0.05937294,-0.05523543,0.06122549,0.05902991,0.059021667,-0.03493128,0.035787933,0.048113447,-0.027822355,0.062458027,0.062119726,-0.002365925,-0.018018635,-0.060352262,-0.021292895,-0.03071656,-0.058681082,-0.02180162,0.038395617,0.062624395,-0.059199184,-0.04120721,-0.05914944,-0.059371192,0.036677547,-0.050686922,0.010173743,0.038686056,-0.036350366,-0.060886808,-0.015989408,-0.034876496,0.06262243,0.052440513,0.059302,0.05471742,0.04812326,0.060046017,-0.04806228,-0.040508382,0.03293114,0.062039327,-0.026436657,0.01229175,-0.048216034,0.010853728,-0.05479776,0.013170809,0.00141212,-0.059184678,-0.032110292,0.018841507,0.05903428,-0.00218527,0.059420656,-0.019049464,0.05458417,-0.03921908,-0.029918294,0.0507196,-0.033228397,-0.017961523,0.059983388,-0.03153389,-0.060216364,0.053652003,0.058914565,-0.020939384,0.049498413,-0.028918762,-0.019665098,0.006218474,0.06152534,-0.05324033,-0.008939164,0.039926175,0.060816433,-0.03482729,-0.041808877,0.059303243,-0.00056705,-0.000572104,0.048465643,0.015962116,-0.046274666,0.06040487,0.047982387,0.052507814,-0.006753143,0.048531115,0.048732497,0.060600266,-0.06211092,-0.016722657,0.058156237,0.042605273,-0.04686636,0.001942678,-0.026246445,-0.062261406,-0.010531047,-0.020062285,0.006695804,-0.03507357,-0.06119221,-0.058613997,0.009208842,0.013156408,-0.0488307,0.036209278,0.052173994,-0.06262139,0.061038394,0.056740645,0.032930527,-0.054072566,-0.03196996,0.060370058,0.0435899,0.03850079,-0.059373047,0.011291394,0.055095166,-0.015347157,-0.052428003,0.03343889,0.04205522,-0.035039738,-0.062519796,0.04432096,-0.05933453,0.000475508,0.039182477,-0.022174014,0.018934812,0.06262443,-0.03806045,0.02796461,0.027488584,0.011957974,0.024897732,0.05941296,0.055122767,0.03279501,-0.05776147,-0.02563614,-0.054853518,-0.015303411,0.053554226,0.061256528,-0.035681497,0.040127605,0.04351348,-0.021706598,-0.038984634,0.047304463,0.061063696,-0.042915948,-0.02538621,-0.049048033,-0.054412283,0.060811486,-0.049046267,-0.05009939,0.027099527,0.005541323,-0.062566124,0.052610792,0.061373286,-0.028192885,0.060676914,-0.024023212,0.018229544,-0.052113984,-0.060048748,-0.02421167,-0.06153468,0.02683972,-0.062014464,0.060447756,0.054380555,0.044363543,0.011819316,0.05303516,0.033179127,0.035636287,0.055460244,-0.05159408,0.058345646,-0.03947438,0.046910528,-0.046566363,0.047204316,0.03693966,0.05175496,-0.018372996,0.05523956,-0.052157775,-0.04808151,-0.013446847,0.043539517,-0.057091843,0.010750786,0.039350625,-0.03897414,-0.060983688,-0.00436144,-0.022965351,0.057069488,0.037539653,0.001968332,0.061288342,0.026501788,-0.03311166,0.054790884,0.012822866,0.022865746,-0.00911338,0.00887659,-0.053891964,0.051336367,0.026183043,-0.06256752,-0.06081001,0.013441321,-0.05049623,-0.038956895,-0.057006396,0.016246876,0.042755708,-0.05091432,-0.03131681,0.05458113,0.001891796,-0.06261473,-0.03652721,-0.036910474,-0.04831058,0.029317157,-0.05911246,-0.051573623,0.003706445,0.041328747,0.00635947,0.062432863,0.053069334,0.058971927,0.060670495,0.027624588,-0.03685672,-0.007136581,-0.06258901,0.059468225,0.046120126,0.051963735,0.024853755,0.025523966,-0.03599107,-0.061576445,0.056167148,0.037040155,-0.037608013,0.042057667,-0.06104696,-0.0396705,-0.054209005,0.060203772,0.002667439,0.04689238,0.04650121,0.062031027,-0.040347114,0.06063312,0.058855485,0.05877025,-0.057685845,0.012206402,-0.028379703,0.053947236,-0.039885525,-0.04982603,-0.006279295,0.05764872,-0.013496036,-0.030540388,0.018995525,0.0545512,0.057105225,-0.005318419,-0.0256

Molecular Epidemiology of Human Coronavirus OC43 Reveals Evolution of Different Genotypes over Time and Recent Emergence of a Novel Genotype due to Natural Recombination,"Although human coronavirus OC43-OC43 (HCoV-OC43) is the coronavirus most commonly associated with human infections, little is known about its molecular epidemiology and evolution. We conducted a molecular epidemiology study to investigate different genotypes and potential recombination in HCoV-OC43. Twenty-nine HCoV-OC43 strains from nasopharyngeal aspirates, collected from 2004 to 2011, were subjected to RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike, and nucleocapsid gene analysis. Phylogenetic analysis showed at least three distinct clusters of HCoV-OC43, although 10 unusual strains displayed incongruent phylogenetic positions between RdRp and spike genes. This suggested the presence of four HCoV-OC43 genotypes (A to D), with genotype D most likely arising from recombination. The complete genome sequencing of two genotype C and D strains and bootscan analysis showed recombination events between genotypes B and C in the generation of genotype D. Of the 29 strains, none belonged to the more ancient genotype A, 5 from 2004 belonged to genotype B, 15 from 2004 to 2006 belonged to genotype C, and 1 from 2004 and all 8 from 2008 to 2011 belonged to the recombinant genotype D. Molecular clock analysis using spike and nucleocapsid genes dated the most recent common ancestor of all genotypes to the 1950s, genotype B and C to the 1980s, genotype B to the 1990s, and genotype C to the late 1990s to early 2000s, while the recombinant genotype D strains were detected as early as 2004. This represents the first study to describe natural recombination in HCoV-OC43 and the evolution of different genotypes over time, leading to the emergence of novel genotype D, which is associated with pneumonia in our elderly

Coronavirus Infection Induces DNA Replication Stress Partly through Interaction of Its Nonstructural Protein 13 with the p125 Subunit of DNA Polymerase δ,"Perturbation of cell cycle regulation is a characteristic feature of infection by many DNA and RNA viruses, including Coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). IBV infection was shown to induce cell cycle arrest at both S and G(2)/M phases for the enhancement of viral replication and progeny production. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well explored. In this study we show that activation of cellular DNA damage response is one of the mechanisms exploited by Coronavirus to induce cell cycle arrest. An ATR-dependent cellular DNA damage response was shown to be activated by IBV infection. Suppression of the ATR kinase activity by chemical inhibitors and siRNA-mediated knockdown of ATR reduced the IBV-induced ATR signaling and inhibited the replication of IBV. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid screens and subsequent biochemical and functional studies demonstrated that interaction between Coronavirus nsp13 and DNA polymerase δ induced DNA replication stress in IBV-infected cells. These findings indicate that the ATR signaling activated by IBV replication contributes to the IBV-induced S-phase arrest and is required for efficient IBV replication and progeny

Assembly of Alphavirus Replication Complexes from RNA and Protein Components in a Novel trans-Replication System in Mammalian Cells,"For positive-strand RNA viruses, the viral genomic RNA also acts as an mRNA directing the translation of the replicase proteins of the virus. Replication takes place in association with cytoplasmic membranes, which are heavily modified to create specific replication compartments. Here we have expressed by plasmid DNA transfection the large replicase polyprotein of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) in mammalian cells from a nonreplicating mRNA and provided a separate RNA containing the replication signals. The replicase proteins were able to efficiently and specifically replicate the template in trans, leading to accumulation of RNA and marker gene products expressed from the template RNA. The replicase proteins and double-stranded RNA replication intermediates localized to structures similar to those seen in SFV-infected cells. Using correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) with fluorescent marker proteins to relocate those transfected cells, in which active replication was ongoing, abundant membrane modifications, representing the replication complex spherules, were observed both at the plasma membrane and in intracellular endolysosomes. Thus, replication complexes are faithfully assembled and localized in the trans-replication system. We demonstrated, using CLEM, that the replication proteins alone or a polymerase-negative polyprotein mutant together with the template did not give rise to spherule formation. Thus, the trans-replication system is suitable for cell biological dissection and examination in a mammalian cell environment, and similar systems may be possible for other positive-strand RNA

"Development and Initial Results of a Low Cost, Disposable, Point-of-Care Testing Device for Pathogen Detection","Development of small footprint, disposable, fast, and inexpensive devices for pathogen detection in the field and clinic would benefit human and veterinary medicine by allowing evidence-based responses to future out breaks. We designed and tested an integrated nucleic acid extraction and amplification device employing a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) or reverse transcriptase-LAMP assay. Our system provides a screening tool with polymerase-chain-reaction-level sensitivity and specificity for outbreak detection, response, and recovery. Time to result is ~90 min. The device utilizes a swab that collects sample and then transfers it to a disc of cellulose-based nucleic acid binding paper. The disc is positioned within a disposable containment tube with a manual loading port. In order to test for the presence of target pathogens, LAMP reagents are loaded through the tube’s port into contact with the sample containing cellulose disc. The reagents then are isothermally heated to 63°C for ~1 h to achieve sequence-specific target nucleic acid amplification. Due to the presence of a colorimetric dye, amplification induces visible color change in the reagents from purple to blue. As initial demonstrations, we detected methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus genomic DNA, as well as recombinant and live foot-and-mouth disease

Viral Infection in Acute Exacerbation of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,"Rationale: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive, uniformly fatal interstitial lung disease. An acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is an episode of acute respiratory worsening without an identifiable etiology. Occult viral infection has been proposed as a possible cause of acute exacerbation. Objectives: To use unbiased genomics-based discovery methods to define the role of viruses in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Methods: Bronchoalveolar lavage and serum from patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, stable disease, and acute lung injury were tested for viral nucleic acid using multiplex polymerase chain reaction, pan-viral microarray, and high-throughput cDNA sequencing. Measurements and Main Results: Four of forty-three patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis had evidence of common respiratory viral infection (parainfluenza [n = 1], rhinovirus [n = 2], coronavirus [n = 1]); no viruses were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage from stable patients. Pan-viral microarrays revealed additional evidence of viral infection (herpes simplex virus [n = 1], Epstein-Barr virus [n = 2], and torque teno virus [TTV] [n = 12]) in patients with acute exacerbation. TTV infection was significantly more common in patients with acute exacerbation than stable controls (P = 0.0003), but present in a similar percentage of acute lung injury controls. Deep sequencing of a subset of acute exacerbation cases confirmed the presence of TTV but did not identify additional viruses. Conclusions: Viral infection was not detected in most cases of acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. TTV was present in a significant minority of cases, and cases of acute lung injury; the clinical significance of this finding remains to be determined.",-0.056323666,0.051042415,-0.045139138,-0.002426216,0.041612048,0.039475303,0.056820657,-0.042051636,0.0557251,0.029050494,0.05740757,0.040967084,-0.00297725,0.03839894,0.0573262,-0.05549433,-0.05740757,-0.054510463,0.031243585,0.042512495,-0.053093757,0.020060258,-0.014383535,0.025496302,-0.04595318,-0.045601603,0.056489073,-0.051752225,-0.044001315,-0.047885068,0.055399925,0.05740757,0.023355525,0.012145453,-0.034619655,-0.057291284,-0.056988474,0.041729692,-0.057039805,0.001355543,0.03260912,-0.0365017,0.056221563,0.052649625,0.03746291,-0.007388579,-0.034208626,0.038507726,0.015946617,0.024284005,-0.055530872,-0.049315304,-0.057403915,-0.030978002,-0.047716916,0.018365534,-0.016790802,-0.007472869,0.0573842,0.045755096,-0.05295672,0.04349826,-0.000996095,-0.050982565,-0.036628205,-0.057388708,0.053626224,-0.04685938,0.054551564,-0.032751452,0.002072773,0.013025193,0.05629861,0.05713279,-0.018721053,-0.019141536,-0.011123898,-0.003439802,-0.057398982,-0.005360128,0.053570032,0.05727476,0.056798752,0.05488925,-0.056648884,0.05709414,0.016202744,0.037255865,0.015633557,-0.05738102,-0.030247144,0.010833756,-0.05695634,-0.022345789,0.03374394,-0.008125547,-0.019803224,0.057187743,0.05727694,-0.04540142,-0.05563257,-0.03911289,-0.05207597,0.03396822,0.030093025,0.04747506,0.053738337,0.044231094,0.030654583,-0.0541238,-0.032145325,0.031654447,0.044811435,0.05555946,0.057396848,0.020858023,-0.010812009,0.052662365,0.05348733,0.026172677,-0.024523692,0.043202266,0.02902296,-0.05505148,0.047588635,0.049836915,-0.05214299,-0.011488978,0.013076171,-0.050020684,-0.056485835,0.05740757,0.05630182,0.03183698,0.051641185,-0.051085163,0.049787372,0.032385327,-0.051837016,0.051042024,-0.045060787,0.05740756,-0.05736527,-0.019442072,-0.05451156,-0.05464949,0.013392734,-0.05728638,0.0571358,-0.05261357,0.012446944,-0.05724091,-0.05464974,-0.05721692,0.05739964,-0.003729547,0.0169451,0.053464618,-0.050856285,-0.03636814,-0.04335876,0.017170975,-0.053765643,0.020153359,0.05342785,-0.048704382,-0.056742612,0.04230796,-0.054388624,-0.04003972,-0.03060078,-0.057407547,-0.057007156,0.048510466,-0.001943763,0.03210033,0.047709804,-0.014386955,0.057039198,-0.0218281,-0.044987757,0.05549964,0.00544872,0.048230812,0.020855566,-0.05613074,-0.057087664,0.00898509,0.04459486,0.01410593,0.04572896,-0.031202935,0.042065077,-0.037693623,0.057155468,-0.029791955,-0.013121634,-0.013139254,0.03914439,0.00682048,-0.056368183,0.052661598,-0.038336292,-0.004968985,0.056325503,-0.034810185,0.032999836,-0.045927405,0.03943703,0.057234857,0.056357548,-0.004281401,0.032940805,0.056313742,-0.05611724,0.01873803,0.045566823,0.049850743,-0.048947494,0.05706583,0.041276775,0.011342343,0.056698803,-0.047926303,0.027281705,0.010837541,-0.05620802,-0.057062093,0.056602407,0.05299428,0.010034032,0.055069253,0.05683082,-0.057392344,0.057040587,0.000998621,0.05050341,-0.017717732,-0.05085808,-0.05453258,0.004129347,0.030679712,-0.012482835,-0.057104003,0.023346618,-0.042882893,-0.05616864,0.056444384,0.042108513,-0.0567745,-0.04375389,0.006797463,-0.04688391,-0.05536635,0.055254165,-0.01699976,-0.048106335,0.05740757,-0.053154316,-3.07E-05,0.056977008,0.0572024,-0.000573477,0.055589993,-0.033204626,-0.039605804,-0.05035563,-0.05304038,0.015576649,0.055244032,-0.007533647,0.05739789,-0.05504461,-0.0574004,0.003146766,-0.05226919,-0.029762497,0.0424159,0.057342693,-0.05678497,-0.022126777,0.04512838,0.05292343,0.046197683,0.040186834,0.008775529,-0.01640044,-0.038769793,0.024052586,0.05657218,-0.024727449,-0.00422118,0.045891624,-0.05713123,-0.04925275,-0.055419784,-0.026000494,-0.040402874,-0.038994793,0.055443536,-0.055972382,0.054936953,-0.011491388,0.026212575,-0.039565433,0.038240027,0.047445696,-0.03206838,0.05730793,0.040258806,-0.055247124,-0.04883435,-0.054195933,0.044706043,0.057295505,-0.056844763,0.026485424,-0.023334589,-0.007690458,0.051085915,-0.045362853,-0.025430348,0.05535301,-0.056984436,-0.05053444,0.057393238,-0.04534982,-0.054672025,-0.057139013,-0.052179955,0.033523306,0.05682915,-0.030463677,0.057351526,0.010224055,0.036918923,-0.018354708,0.03628089,0.033263188,0.041896936,0.025345664,-0.04080234,0.05729119,0.04225819,-0.057361975,-0.057407416,0.05288132,0.050748736,-0.053391498,-0.057320993,-0.010143882,-0.007221561,-0.024136262,0.03078847,0.05723298,0.027594808,-0.057406962,-0.05421298,0.007860745,-0.046203014,0.03593447,-0.033885982,-0.057330772,0.04635535,0.0396958,-0.037459575,0.057202052,0.04710626,0.05729609,-0.05727967,0.029488599,0.055017382,-0.049389068,-0.057094,0.0572758,0.052938037,0.05733642,-0.009336225,-0.040768076,-0.05688757,-0.047209453,0.055507835,0.028924258,0.04111773,0.026993807,-0.05098515,-0.05048562,-0.05722179,-0.042346448,0.049835168,-0.009705711,0.055045795,0.007088839,-0.010140904,-0.023117106,0.04924635,0.02341342,-0.0572483,0.042718776,-0.057197597,0.012712684,0.026294358,0.055834416,0.057198673,0.054140475,-0.03589029,-0.017915204,-0.05369029,0.05576677,0.04206593,0.051269427,-0.048318267,0

Functional Analysis of Two Cavities in Flavivirus NS5 Polymerase,"Flavivirus NS5 protein encodes methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activities. Structural analysis of flavivirus RdRp domains uncovered two conserved cavities (A and B). Both cavities are located in the thumb subdomains and represent potential targets for development of allosteric inhibitors. In this study, we used dengue virus as a model to analyze the function of the two RdRp cavities. Amino acids from both cavities were subjected to mutagenesis analysis in the context of genome-length RNA and recombinant NS5 protein; residues critical for viral replication were subjected to revertant analysis. For cavity A, we found that only one (Lys-756) of the seven selected amino acids is critical for viral replication. Alanine substitution of Lys-756 did not affect the RdRp activity, suggesting that this residue functions through a nonenzymatic mechanism. For cavity B, all four selected amino acids (Leu-328, Lys-330, Trp-859, and Ile-863) are critical for viral replication. Biochemical and revertant analyses showed that three of the four mutated residues (Leu-328, Trp-859, and Ile-863) function at the step of initiation of RNA synthesis, whereas the fourth residue (Lys-330) functions by interacting with the viral NS3 helicase domain. Collectively, our results have provided direct evidence for the hypothesis that cavity B, but not cavity A, from dengue virus NS5 polymerase could be a target for rational drug

Rotavirus Replication Requires a Functional Proteasome for Effective Assembly of Viroplasms,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system has been shown to play an important role in the replication cycle of different viruses. In this study, we describe a strong impairment of rotavirus replication upon inhibition of proteasomal activity. The effect was evidenced at the level of accumulation of viral proteins, viral RNA, and yield of infective particles. Kinetic studies revealed that the early steps of the replicative cycle following attachment, entry, and uncoating were clearly more sensitive to proteasome inhibition. We ruled out a direct inhibition of the viral polymerase activities and stability of viral proteins and found that the crucial step that was impaired by blocking proteasome activity was the assembly of new viroplasms. This was demonstrated by using chemical inhibitors of proteasome and by gene silencing using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific for different proteasomal subunits and for the ubiquitin precursor RPS27A. In addition, we show that the effect of proteasome inhibition on virus infection is not due to increased levels of beta interferon (IFN-β).",0.02778363,0.042220913,-0.050466925,-0.06388651,-0.013438183,0.064832434,0.001910782,-0.010303557,0.043245155,0.04899611,0.06657792,-0.015257181,0.037983883,0.003225845,-0.034672897,-0.06636589,-0.065968566,-0.04403127,0.060821924,-0.014042522,-0.044890445,0.022701727,-0.05842686,0.053229462,-0.038975745,0.059798695,0.018203704,-0.040331315,-0.051770903,0.006285949,0.029271742,0.065691315,0.007452679,-0.02740711,-0.013292822,0.011289318,-0.01893161,-0.04862465,-0.05093122,-0.04837668,-0.028102977,0.022593848,-0.01901524,-0.031333182,0.016094618,-0.000123994,-0.042290714,-0.047449145,0.018462028,-0.035777748,-0.03904484,-0.054038797,-0.06600499,-0.016553361,-0.05331992,-0.008339986,-0.05157549,-0.057175066,0.065541156,-0.04243317,-0.010974361,-0.04962425,0.049971156,-0.02556893,-0.017793084,-0.065383226,0.06294428,0.04783296,0.054394387,-0.051487803,0.025235895,-0.026868384,-0.051401302,0.05818611,-0.033495426,0.02217549,0.051320642,0.03863045,-0.061668944,0.03769111,-0.050332975,0.065772176,0.043200605,-0.047227267,-0.03285763,0.061494756,-0.001795962,0.039600864,-0.042283636,0.012387608,0.035077482,-0.012412684,-0.04576057,0.010323012,-0.008396024,0.06500698,0.03307227,0.063145,0.06628879,-0.053669684,-0.036002237,0.034980543,-0.057742696,0.022969298,0.051791046,0.03828739,-0.035112396,0.027995003,0.02408513,-0.05593917,0.009081564,0.051526673,0.039260637,0.041257206,0.06384133,0.027163299,-0.042572293,-0.03121696,0.060862824,-0.018434241,-0.039435636,0.06577465,0.008994644,-0.04323656,0.036462914,0.039751872,-0.06074294,-0.021070901,0.03706788,-0.004137063,-0.044897564,0.06663683,0.062342826,-0.04900887,0.014117754,-0.0629846,0.027004812,0.057676964,-0.059328616,-0.0360865,0.03175695,0.066562854,-0.058490675,-0.06280674,-0.04279514,-0.040946033,0.056249443,-0.06560751,-0.008929243,0.023669291,0.00576659,-0.06478728,-0.04441092,-0.000346855,0.06662886,0.008127739,0.04768722,0.007598465,0.028964821,-0.018003736,0.044338167,-0.001618209,0.002545546,0.05010712,-0.022703191,-0.01947301,-0.04881814,-0.007465499,-0.062668875,-0.06432936,-0.041002687,-0.066208705,-0.043972023,0.04382784,0.052760385,-1.42E-05,0.03106091,-0.05722937,0.0658928,0.034632888,0.020893103,0.06178866,-0.033821244,0.04710831,0.06596666,-0.042357158,0.014454152,0.005466263,0.06594382,-0.001877479,0.017079888,-0.040441383,-0.02884653,0.02956172,0.05897532,-0.06125468,0.003944433,0.023858124,-0.02470862,-0.056328587,-0.049209442,0.05607443,-0.011099155,0.024882406,0.058174808,-0.048285272,-0.051620483,0.057200897,0.05604031,0.0661189,0.022434745,-0.004040049,-0.002601798,0.06384595,-0.058579102,-0.026462704,0.013566523,0.01889546,-0.063284755,-0.02874255,0.019821187,-0.015606763,-0.002036174,-0.061090767,-0.05619032,-0.023699608,-0.066512056,-0.050837442,-0.00140822,0.05645744,0.05432484,0.06623429,0.05554926,-0.0658791,0.051181823,0.023297245,0.037269294,-0.06320681,-0.027076604,0.057801563,0.052961476,0.03817838,-0.042233534,-0.04220486,-0.018428802,-0.061964083,-0.02826146,0.056466587,0.06267262,-0.05245628,-0.06554853,0.05319531,-0.02805179,-0.03355844,0.06632362,0.014147312,-0.035123494,0.06663962,-0.058908496,-0.003890141,0.018501196,0.012793737,0.010664859,0.062331855,-0.004701178,-0.044753805,-0.06394599,0.017600626,0.0397433,0.03143341,0.053136114,0.06572305,-0.016852401,0.03848909,-0.034114394,-0.03501185,0.0613283,0.037146553,0.06404644,-0.064659975,-0.03743154,-0.052832115,-0.051728453,0.061277363,-0.04228412,-0.032246325,-0.035255056,0.053692594,-0.03358003,0.050180733,0.06506996,0.011439561,0.06288692,-0.05370283,0.04620843,-0.043530505,-0.056051765,-0.061097827,-0.06108438,-0.04770403,-0.022380989,0.06557658,0.019568559,0.054258693,0.030272461,0.032678615,-0.00222467,0.011363371,0.057508264,-0.06585536,0.057455394,-0.041065603,-0.003155537,-0.03253109,0.06337298,-0.017864568,-0.012124543,-0.029468125,0.011079767,-0.032868464,-0.052735537,0.042518504,0.060514595,0.016686609,0.021675123,0.061083574,-0.005356661,-0.06274773,-0.03756691,-0.002754929,-0.043678567,0.061065894,0.001970145,0.059374973,0.03293997,-0.025540195,0.030882848,0.01562424,-0.007039908,-0.019190907,0.036506414,0.0379906,-0.019187212,0.052556258,-0.06662158,-0.06660767,-0.045334067,0.04944688,-0.033489704,-0.06053423,-0.002119321,0.028585412,-0.000645667,-0.002147764,0.05553448,-0.007859048,-0.06661704,-0.010379579,-0.031282946,-0.02881656,0.015593532,-0.057624977,-0.06591046,-0.03586462,-0.008986854,-0.03538399,0.06652226,0.053472776,0.058843177,0.052874938,0.03245124,-0.014961866,-0.038919628,-0.066596,0.06502491,0.051974185,0.061297532,0.03251038,0.057258286,-0.053601336,-0.05970907,0.05409549,0.059998848,0.015899634,0.063896954,-0.05860011,0.003436766,-0.06488778,0.06076818,0.041207254,0.062002808,0.03441471,0.013909209,-0.059887245,0.043660086,0.029864365,0.021773964,-0.037854314,0.05098949,-0.065699525,0.047995366,0.004793023,0.017041026,0.015500954,0.04055191,-0.061882805,-0.03881776,0.020856678,0.007872988,0.050210197,0.05319317,-0.04620956,0.0

Nuclear Import of Cytoplasmic Poly(A) Binding Protein Restricts Gene Expression via Hyperadenylation and Nuclear Retention of mRNA,"Poly(A) tail length is emerging as an important marker of mRNA fate, where deviations from the canonical length can signal degradation or nuclear retention of transcripts. Pathways regulating polyadenylation thus have the potential to broadly influence gene expression. Here we demonstrate that accumulation of cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein (PABPC) in the nucleus, which can occur during viral infection or other forms of cellular stress, causes mRNA hyperadenylation and nuclear accumulation of poly(A) RNA. This inhibits gene expression but does not affect mRNA stability. Unexpectedly, PABPC-induced hyperadenylation can occur independently of mRNA 3′-end processing yet requires the canonical mRNA poly(A) polymerase II. We find that nuclear PABPC-induced hyperadenylation is triggered by multiple divergent viral factors, suggesting that altering the subcellular localization of PABPC may be a commonly used mechanism to

MTA1 Coregulator Regulates LPS Response via MyD88-dependent Signaling,"Although metastasis tumor antigen 1 (MTA1) contributes to the responsiveness of macrophages to LPS, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we investigated the role of MTA1 in the regulation of expression and function of MyD88, a proximal component of NF-κB signaling. We discovered that MTA1 targets MyD88 and that MyD88 is a NF-κB-responsive gene in LPS-stimulated macrophages. We found that MTA1 is required for MyD88-dependent stimulation of NF-κB signaling and expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, MIP2, and TNF-α as MTA1 depletion leads to a substantial reduction in the expression of NF-κB target genes. In addition, LPS-mediated stimulation of MyD88 transcription was accompanied by an enhanced recruitment of MTA1, RNA polymerase II, and p65RelA complex to the NF-κB consensus sites in the MyD88 promoter. Interestingly, the recruitment of both MTA1 and MyD88 expression is effectively blocked by NF-κB inhibitor parthenolide. Selective knockdown of MyD88 by a dominant negative mutant of MyD88 or selective siRNA also impairs the ability of LPS to stimulate the NF-κB target genes. These findings reveal an inherent coregulatory role of MTA1 upon the expression of MyD88 and suggest that MTA1 regulation of MyD88 may constitute at least one of the mechanisms by which MTA1

Coexistence of Different Genotypes in the Same Bat and Serological Characterization of Rousettus Bat Coronavirus HKU9 Belonging to a Novel Betacoronavirus Subgroup,"Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9 (Ro-BatCoV HKU9), a recently identified coronavirus of novel Betacoronavirus subgroup D, from Leschenault's rousette, was previously found to display marked sequence polymorphism among genomes of four strains. Among 10 bats with complete RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes sequenced, three and two sequence clades for all three genes were codetected in two and five bats, respectively, suggesting the coexistence of two or three distinct genotypes of Ro-BatCoV HKU9 in the same bat. Complete genome sequencing of the distinct genotypes from two bats, using degenerate/genome-specific primers with overlapping sequences confirmed by specific PCR, supported the coexistence of at least two distinct genomes in each bat. Recombination analysis using eight Ro-BatCoV HKU9 genomes showed possible recombination events between strains from different bat individuals, which may have allowed for the generation of different genotypes. Western blot assays using recombinant N proteins of Ro-BatCoV HKU9, Betacoronavirus subgroup A (HCoV-HKU1), subgroup B (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV), and subgroup C (Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5) coronaviruses were subgroup specific, supporting their classification as separate subgroups under Betacoronavirus. Antibodies were detected in 75 (43%) of 175 and 224 (64%) of 350 tested serum samples from Leschenault's rousette bats by Ro-BatCoV HKU9 N-protein-based Western blot and enzyme immunoassays, respectively. This is the first report describing coinfection of different coronavirus genotypes in bats and coronavirus genotypes of diverse nucleotide variation in the same host. Such unique phenomena, and the unusual instability of ORF7a, are likely due to recombination which may have been facilitated by the dense roosting behavior and long foraging range of Leschenault's rousette.",-0.05431184,-0.03802508,-0.001782395,-0.009548135,0.025050428,0.05900109,0.055911683,-0.04068358,-0.05869213,0.058180172,0.05935615,0.047231507,-0.036580972,0.05230853,0.058259368,-0.058966726,-0.05695137,-0.053011473,0.030063,-0.04314872,-0.055276386,-0.02436981,-0.057672042,0.0551095,0.006718718,0.059146028,0.057812307,0.0316874,0.04654738,-0.048505105,0.05882257,0.04609828,-0.010351156,0.015394029,0.04562707,0.05083011,-0.023646818,-0.001003044,-0.059335317,-0.02546269,0.034950316,0.05172886,0.006720922,-0.053713463,-0.05818229,-0.002533768,0.014019338,-0.024643954,-0.036881145,0.018935647,0.05919569,-0.005977921,-0.059196457,-0.05775973,-0.052385975,0.01857302,-0.05885616,-0.03047946,0.0209146,0.002556716,0.015307006,-0.013392332,-0.01288702,-0.003016748,0.012031865,-0.05863151,0.056838732,-0.055458605,0.059320785,-0.026778473,-0.024834676,0.04239927,0.046683047,0.059335776,-0.050886754,0.05628929,0.010763113,0.000634382,-0.054755364,0.053731237,-0.049315613,0.059349887,-0.02666777,-0.027010687,-0.051619265,0.05638653,0.018434593,-0.007061885,-0.05588652,-0.039677206,-0.030052496,-0.038008936,-0.03635353,0.04624187,0.045816172,0.054803435,0.052344482,0.05917665,0.059325006,-0.016024645,0.039980724,0.02526523,-0.05698221,0.0589451,-0.0399868,0.03856335,0.052670397,0.047940362,-0.05637798,0.02288747,0.059144814,0.055553008,0.00786878,0.05234673,0.057553284,0.022117667,-0.05445372,0.04973763,0.018844506,0.024716612,-0.046288755,0.05886381,0.05094635,-0.055850986,0.0225394,0.057848252,0.001558777,-0.03458359,-0.038891107,0.026411789,-0.042402063,0.05936688,0.057746384,0.019265877,-0.05166247,-0.013941886,-0.042249966,0.056171708,-0.05048437,0.04799038,0.05447722,0.059367597,-0.055391833,-0.042626675,-0.018491,-0.04785205,0.053202234,-0.057052493,0.058770273,0.058987662,0.03749033,-0.027309533,-0.05017572,-0.041434515,0.059365835,-0.000135061,-0.03081387,0.05587586,0.052694343,0.0416033,-0.04840301,-0.052054174,-0.046177957,0.05935628,-0.017921973,0.036639147,-0.05839101,0.040173534,-0.03868757,-0.02417562,-0.024173876,0.057623327,-0.058558073,0.05894015,-0.047062468,-0.025722053,0.022263907,-0.05433031,0.05809876,-0.009941669,0.044988655,0.0173186,-0.006440814,0.039588287,-0.030636039,-0.05561557,-0.030033661,0.054558326,0.010581171,0.003038072,0.059139196,-0.043503944,-0.020169834,0.054818116,0.059257213,-0.05512311,0.030195476,-0.035745416,-0.022556204,-0.04927562,-0.047967285,0.057529565,0.04813253,0.014509453,0.05617361,-0.057006415,0.03428829,0.05929349,-0.03557861,0.05907171,-0.027669212,0.05936546,0.028238628,0.05858988,-0.059237894,0.032711472,0.05896411,0.056564696,-0.03692839,0.022674093,-0.026044283,-0.04250762,0.04234568,-0.051734194,0.005678326,-0.047921967,-0.000902758,-0.058975454,0.03192987,-0.008120094,0.04173901,0.04603389,-0.012780865,-0.059367526,0.059295077,0.042574935,0.057968467,-0.054970946,-0.048019372,0.05151956,0.028040856,-0.002177991,-0.059287272,-0.05337134,0.058507342,0.034373596,-0.05516397,-0.05494985,0.058830164,-0.03684267,0.017306125,0.01986288,0.014639901,0.04458553,0.056084927,-0.025221067,-0.028713448,0.059367623,0.057220675,-0.052766297,0.03036562,0.056403734,0.000854212,0.059078977,-0.006315735,-0.023272714,-0.004963567,-0.03538155,-0.054781094,0.0373512,0.039777424,0.059323728,0.056247775,0.005219785,-0.048831236,-0.055487927,-0.027713021,0.042978752,0.0592844,0.054576617,-0.027084764,-0.047381222,-0.049028777,0.05724264,0.025307177,-0.030418694,0.039604343,0.059314113,-0.03290726,-0.05464073,0.059283916,-0.05692018,0.0588094,-0.056034315,-0.044963717,-0.046282593,-0.025524698,-0.013543353,-0.059365597,0.056601178,-0.04982242,0.049308937,0.05455582,-0.03163295,-0.056708336,-0.036410026,0.03281077,-0.03528641,0.050753597,0.05036217,0.058073495,0.043461975,-0.02095635,-0.05777071,0.047065508,0.018019203,-0.005281986,0.000446865,0.059365243,-0.044661116,-0.057893004,-0.020379381,0.057578158,-0.054522265,-0.059117813,-0.036359847,-0.033118345,-0.04002322,-0.05850098,-0.039125036,0.04611347,0.000452729,0.003108817,0.05926869,-0.034710176,0.010448407,0.056893423,-0.004510607,-0.030848445,0.020378258,-0.013096954,0.040880833,0.059285194,0.042390507,-0.059367508,-0.05801841,0.05142102,0.056823645,0.052744392,-0.058936242,-0.049054153,0.055600833,-0.001420457,-0.045096986,0.05085981,0.04346596,-0.059366934,-0.002854145,0.050087024,-0.05921789,-0.019752214,0.040347226,-0.059269916,0.002214725,0.03899103,0.043160275,0.059339933,0.032093342,0.0592046,-0.05610819,0.017721398,-0.058828924,0.050829165,-0.058967076,0.05746877,-0.020792928,0.038641736,-0.023887526,0.054393638,-0.059308033,-0.055237062,0.052016277,0.00392933,0.024040265,-0.028119292,-0.030180855,-0.059154823,-0.004538382,-0.036866236,0.01772723,-0.047657616,0.04910752,0.03192451,0.052735824,-0.024843724,0.0564386,0.04807472,-0.057268128,0.034551628,-0.056809556,0.058011718,0.00672583,0.020835485,0.040145636,-0.021367928,0.020418603,-0.049153693,-0.056722123,0.047567137,-0.057245508,-0.025400495,-0.01822490

Genomic Characterization of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus in European Bats and Classification of Coronaviruses Based on Partial RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Gene Sequences,"Bats may host emerging viruses, including coronaviruses (CoV). We conducted an evaluation of CoV in rhinolophid and vespertilionid bat species common in Europe. Rhinolophids carried severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related CoV at high frequencies and concentrations (26% of animals are positive; up to 2.4 × 10(8) copies per gram of feces), as well as two Alphacoronavirus clades, one novel and one related to the HKU2 clade. All three clades present in Miniopterus bats in China (HKU7, HKU8, and 1A related) were also present in European Miniopterus bats. An additional novel Alphacoronavirus clade (bat CoV [BtCoV]/BNM98-30) was detected in Nyctalus leisleri. A CoV grouping criterion was developed by comparing amino acid identities across an 816-bp fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) of all accepted mammalian CoV species (RdRp-based grouping units [RGU]). Criteria for defining separate RGU in mammalian CoV were a >4.8% amino acid distance for alphacoronaviruses and a >6.3% distance for betacoronaviruses. All the above-mentioned novel clades represented independent RGU. Strict associations between CoV RGU and host bat genera were confirmed for six independent RGU represented simultaneously in China and Europe. A SARS-related virus (BtCoV/BM48-31/Bulgaria/2008) from a Rhinolophus blasii (Rhi bla) bat was fully sequenced. It is predicted that proteins 3b and 6 were highly divergent from those proteins in all known SARS-related CoV. Open reading frame 8 (ORF8) was surprisingly absent. Surface expression of spike and staining with sera of SARS survivors suggested low antigenic overlap with SARS CoV. However, the receptor binding domain of SARS CoV showed higher similarity with that of BtCoV/BM48-31/Bulgaria/2008 than with that of any Chinese bat-borne CoV.

Persistence of Adenovirus Nucleic Acids in Nasopharyngeal Secretions: A Diagnostic Conundrum,"BACKGROUND: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays increase the rate of viral detection in clinical specimens, compared with conventional virologic methods. Studies suggest that PCR may detect virus nucleic acid (NA) that persists in the respiratory tract. METHODS: We analyzed virologic data from children having frequent upper respiratory infections (URI) who were followed in a longitudinal study. Nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) were collected at URI onset and when acute otitis media (AOM) was diagnosed; virus studies were performed using conventional diagnostics and PCR. Repeated presence of adenovirus by PCR was further studied by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Of 581 URI episodes in 76 children, 510 viruses were detected. Of the viruses detected by PCR, 15% were those detected previously; repeated positives occurred most frequently with adenovirus. Sequencing results were available in 13 children with repeated adenovirus detection; four patterns of infection were identified (16 instances): 1) adenovirus of the same serotype and strain detected continuously (n=8 instances), 2) adenovirus of different serotypes detected during sequential URI episodes (n=3), 3) adenovirus of the same serotype but different strains detected during sequential URI episodes (n=3) and 4) adenovirus of the same serotype and strain detected intermittently (n=2). CONCLUSIONS: Among children with frequent URIs, repeated positive PCR results for adenovirus NA may represent a new serotype/strain, or persistence of viral NA. Results must be interpreted with caution; clinical correlation and presence of other viruses are important. Further longitudinal studies of children during and after infection are required for better understanding of the clinical significance of positive PCR tests for adenovirus NA in the respiratory tract

Outbreak of Canine Norovirus Infection in Young Dogs,"An outbreak of norovirus (NoV) infection was identified in a kennel. Sequence analysis of a short fragment in the polymerase complex indicated the clonal origin of the strains, which were similar to the prototype canine NoV strain GIV.2/Bari/170/07-4/ITA (94.7% nucleotide identity). The findings demonstrate that canine NoV circulates in dogs in Greece and that it can spread easily across a group of animals.",-0.051039696,0.05305796,-0.008117086,-0.000859249,0.001709281,0.023324382,-0.073909365,0.040338222,0.01087584,0.023785098,0.075923435,0.072823845,0.052501775,-0.03487926,0.04331852,-0.046233706,-0.06419841,-0.016976127,-0.006385879,0.06526195,-0.05961644,-0.001294581,-0.06402772,0.07299282,0.041122552,0.07145806,-0.034449458,-0.014166378,0.037211627,0.016460182,0.049221482,0.07011038,0.004819804,0.02267571,0.05581647,0.06765107,-0.07245336,0.011100913,-0.07074348,0.000690297,0.04117037,-0.01911489,-0.024509273,-0.06914769,-0.075932644,-0.005156205,0.044175286,-0.05420695,0.021401182,-0.004305831,0.012414701,0.01705891,-0.02369894,-0.04285551,-0.069805205,0.02597588,-0.06412079,0.031529658,0.04983087,-0.07573836,-0.002622624,0.043320876,-0.045636237,-0.045823626,0.07571996,-0.07254238,0.031105233,-0.04619356,0.024206858,-0.042997736,0.059278775,-0.006523717,-0.050604448,0.01923964,0.06527759,0.014853291,-0.009609039,0.056535922,-0.07053132,0.04218516,-0.02961558,0.060389455,-0.008430576,-0.053779174,-0.022013502,0.061129093,-0.028956583,0.032228667,-0.06433354,0.038981818,0.027663706,-0.021571048,-0.009761702,-0.021802817,0.04406917,0.038636193,0.011013237,0.04136021,0.07484877,0.05096703,-0.02462351,-0.019696943,-0.04844059,0.006102141,0.013453779,0.027423132,0.07515559,-0.03764111,0.020041313,0.01038657,0.014587013,0.036926728,0.053170253,0.02163745,0.062125314,0.018761491,-0.07227781,0.01974822,-0.03035998,-0.050685395,0.012323603,-0.053454626,0.03299916,-0.055542916,-0.021826321,-0.007822515,0.05085414,0.04975014,0.021690885,0.050392065,0.034548596,0.075906426,0.049807306,-0.033066556,-0.010204989,-0.06606002,-0.001595774,0.029328965,-0.06872567,-0.004838671,-0.007262628,0.074226014,-0.069769554,0.053901944,0.038210828,0.04917941,-0.014870138,-0.054578133,0.060793314,-0.004234436,0.045516815,-0.058546204,-0.04909048,0.039980143,0.074188866,-0.01800117,0.007787765,0.07213379,0.047495108,-0.022064619,-0.07492929,0.001083279,0.006340813,0.048186895,-0.025696477,0.05180055,-0.036592025,-0.005944308,-0.042516306,-0.03438094,0.052307438,-0.03216196,0.023990171,0.013774622,-0.057849716,0.000827467,-0.02088808,-0.038189292,0.036373142,0.053911958,0.021370936,-0.028433353,-0.018222485,-0.034984052,0.070099145,0.026186658,-0.05709285,-0.003056493,0.02793303,-0.025711546,0.06877494,-0.02630157,0.018391125,0.031338237,0.03461589,-0.02048616,0.038281415,-0.024021154,-0.06971299,-0.010878838,-0.067969054,0.06367566,0.061303217,0.03553529,0.004475258,-0.060553167,0.005953334,0.07592821,0.003976203,0.071420595,-0.028344197,0.00889368,0.06098498,0.03349558,-0.054365896,-0.026738832,0.027789295,0.03146989,-0.048292395,-0.00786,0.006563907,0.017377371,0.044854898,-0.05403079,-0.020577248,0.023385117,-0.060669247,-0.02977173,0.05264512,-0.01399653,-0.053618684,0.011507092,-0.029730773,-0.07532665,0.03524121,-0.032277793,0.002020827,-0.04868231,0.007249197,0.027446602,0.04029868,0.058257774,-0.03742456,-0.061146945,0.07577114,-0.013133192,-0.065114036,-0.018292127,0.07248408,-0.051459745,0.04908729,0.014354249,-0.023158424,-0.03741991,0.06858078,-0.03566213,-0.033863954,0.07559304,0.043010324,0.037300818,0.000353773,0.062455513,0.007067721,0.039035205,-0.002989486,0.018881982,0.017175127,-0.05838743,-0.0416407,-0.019105315,0.022197802,0.063654244,-0.04409088,0.03231343,-0.03470751,-0.05865829,-0.029000297,0.00018415,0.05680381,-0.010123563,-0.066539034,-0.056558266,-0.03682934,0.059280135,-0.06336356,-0.04125533,-0.050458495,0.07591728,-0.01624284,0.05674025,0.06469591,-0.06553242,0.07586612,0.011733666,-0.048762616,-0.06326558,-0.019166281,-0.06414922,-0.0758364,0.0405728,-0.007270735,0.06064979,0.010594096,0.004120364,-0.047631532,0.007913425,0.004192174,-0.056235798,0.023443595,-0.010939331,-0.02779577,-0.008154691,0.028236633,0.008989946,0.061846286,0.010271677,-0.005849137,0.009830386,0.066241615,0.048201382,-0.070485614,0.031252787,0.06200838,-0.064443186,-0.028847355,-0.001522599,-0.058061574,0.015613146,0.013704879,-0.046064958,0.034085553,0.046577808,0.062240064,0.033684038,0.019507788,0.051442873,0.05290932,0.04686466,-0.066336736,0.020813612,-0.01189814,0.011942545,0.0652291,0.028124604,-0.072351485,-0.07201283,0.042675827,0.005073098,-0.057398044,-0.055351924,-0.041518204,0.027388213,0.013542774,-0.04326747,0.03579972,0.05182177,-0.07465762,-0.02915847,0.048371427,-0.06764388,0.013527694,-0.061111454,-0.047749635,0.016525235,-0.000664973,-0.05072082,0.07077431,0.037153166,0.05556294,0.055344213,-0.060672194,0.018232537,0.05581884,-0.053493623,0.04363068,0.01646921,0.041625865,0.02936013,-0.07577198,0.043067522,0.008174065,0.05216078,-0.015587111,0.048683573,-0.013822699,-0.017782798,-0.046508115,-0.068354934,0.06317609,0.020372847,-0.05247497,0.02430621,0.057640348,0.044665366,0.07560982,-0.016189864,-0.043073103,-0.065177366,0.043703817,-0.068309166,0.020588858,-0.02458588,-0.04864659,0.028882224,0.002601854,0.019711547,-0.06088587,0.03946853,0.0110334,0.010070751,-0.004010902,0.005038177,0.040927295,-

"Distributions of HLA-A and -B alleles and haplotypes in the Yi ethnic minority of Yunnan, China: relationship to other populations","Objective: To investigate the distributions of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A and -B alleles and HLA-A-B haplotypes in the Yi ethnic minority of the Yunnan Province, situated in southwestern China. Methods: DNA typing for HLA-A and -B loci was performed using the polymerase chain reaction-sequence-based typing (PCR-SBT) method on 114 randomly selected healthy individuals of the Yi population. The allelic frequencies of HLA-A and -B loci were calculated by direct counting and HLA-A-B haplotypes were estimated using the expectation maximization algorithm. Results: A total of 17 HLA-A and 38 HLA-B alleles were found in the Yi population. The most frequent alleles were A*2402 (32.46%), A*1101 (26.32%), and A*0203 (10.09%) at the HLA-A locus and B*4601 (12.28%), B*1525 (10.09%), B*4001 (8.77%), and B*3802 (7.89%) at the HLA-B locus. The predominant HLA-A-B haplotypes were A*2402-B*1525 (7.86%) and A*0203-B*3802 (5.64%), followed by A*1101-B*4001 (4.69%). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the Yi population in the Honghe, Yunnan Province of China basically belongs to groups of southeastern Asian origin, but shares some characteristics with northeastern Asian groups. Conclusion: The present study may add to the understanding of HLA polymorphism in the Yi ethnic group that was poorly defined previously, and provide useful information for bone marrow transplantation, anthropological research, and forensic sciences as well as for disease-association studies.",-0.033204127,-0.014401311,0.052977122,0.015061965,0.05303129,0.024589812,0.035091598,-0.05999385,-0.020558184,0.0562586,0.062564634,-0.008595011,0.03276301,-0.007665314,0.060228948,-0.06062534,-0.04384799,-0.025872122,-0.042284403,-0.050784025,-0.04592421,0.02468412,-0.04922044,0.031929865,0.043985557,0.05937,0.046519343,-0.027492566,0.056059603,-0.021524608,0.06302709,0.05905006,0.009911684,-0.059999254,-0.044622313,0.05155209,-0.06320068,0.050649468,-0.051946275,0.058982912,0.020884626,0.059942085,0.05681316,0.008262174,-0.060938578,0.028682088,-0.050679464,-0.020957785,0.012581087,-0.05731793,0.001408306,-0.005924355,-0.0634961,-0.05412746,0.054971494,0.023706758,-0.05955122,0.022875234,0.05917727,-0.049283236,0.011318628,-0.016095463,-0.013909895,-0.001875743,0.046095915,-0.06321289,0.05355737,0.023471646,0.026828948,0.029557083,0.004550386,0.06296146,0.062026806,0.06340958,-0.04192259,0.061773393,-0.031137638,0.027680136,-0.049124084,-0.03373168,-0.04475788,0.063437745,0.0616491,0.009921147,0.024438119,0.050068464,-0.058463283,0.058170084,-0.06195184,0.04131747,-0.059354365,-0.007754403,0.04100685,0.025909726,-0.025916923,0.06271355,0.020747375,0.06311729,0.06349276,-0.030295564,0.023109902,-0.000132072,0.019215884,0.062631674,0.00944942,-0.016884344,0.030784843,-0.03367027,0.032679748,0.012883193,0.05915857,0.03861842,0.058636196,0.002600898,0.05112339,0.020124203,-0.045179337,0.038927145,0.024314215,-0.063417785,-0.037415568,0.05496909,0.04001497,-0.06262218,0.058296822,0.030977363,0.0635582,0.000209474,0.006666465,0.010753037,-0.05161988,0.062598504,0.061383188,0.037491497,-0.011484733,-0.043874133,-0.052049384,0.034197643,-0.059188478,-0.05944086,0.033095133,0.063621804,-0.048590157,-0.045269813,0.04384985,-0.034653444,0.026985819,-0.049933005,0.057966843,0.002714831,0.03981829,-0.013958441,-0.05073414,0.04747778,0.06343003,0.055479243,0.06264761,0.05356171,0.038696703,0.03568132,-0.040876597,-0.06273075,-0.040028222,0.041036356,0.046458624,-0.03203745,0.014323649,-0.008129837,-0.06266536,-0.041570917,0.035232913,0.054498512,-0.007807226,0.033278015,-0.003490658,0.029894497,-0.022288824,0.062430765,0.057120748,-0.016249431,-0.049044028,-0.01558389,0.051731393,0.02812461,-0.054646064,-0.011303127,-0.001958989,0.032833073,-0.019234251,0.003225223,0.06305321,-0.026180176,-0.007174871,0.017744355,0.06316718,0.005363392,0.027367907,0.030311117,0.03382911,-0.038854226,-0.06314362,0.059207078,0.050479982,0.034172192,0.04038172,-0.058215573,-0.017609928,0.061331447,-0.028039737,0.062747255,0.011434338,-0.029127281,-0.021297928,0.06245817,-0.063425876,0.056070667,0.03834652,0.054819416,0.060055196,0.035225827,0.008198891,-0.057915103,0.031182595,0.035300806,0.03781841,0.004096714,-0.03623822,-0.04983881,-0.029846601,-0.004885647,0.05733581,0.0348171,0.058048055,-0.06362177,0.063003115,0.061014973,0.060162265,-0.04966266,-0.036026314,0.030216262,0.014019614,0.017297069,0.023705745,0.015112462,0.06065129,0.005848926,0.006992599,-0.02981494,0.062549554,-0.009170976,0.006183466,-0.039343067,-0.042871088,0.016512176,0.022366691,0.03523776,-0.046107523,0.063621804,0.060962457,0.00016577,0.05070933,0.000672562,-0.04711656,0.060402807,-0.003137593,0.01659667,-0.049138807,0.05652492,-0.03495448,-0.03972697,0.007197102,0.0634729,0.000473321,0.0343267,-0.050344523,-0.06172009,0.033179056,-0.03375239,0.059622046,-0.006924382,-0.062082753,-0.03680563,-0.040468235,0.055807695,-0.004982604,-0.053040057,0.02041057,0.036807436,-0.063058615,0.013183652,0.06302324,-0.04837541,0.06074717,-0.016082121,-0.041697703,-0.05417985,-0.04839981,0.004848493,-0.063422464,0.055792328,0.04281606,0.048660893,0.0577599,0.032254104,-0.058641445,0.04141945,-0.005701495,-0.058407307,0.04067822,0.04418588,0.04759345,0.034835204,0.044105776,-0.06174541,0.05952845,0.013910793,-0.019350087,-0.019000255,0.06317757,0.018373616,-0.051023606,0.0491127,0.061601993,-0.05014498,-0.061834678,0.027371135,-0.019002696,-0.05743444,-0.0635792,0.048640534,0.06242193,-0.04813254,0.021132464,0.06326278,0.006094103,0.017457169,-0.007061359,-0.060209375,-0.009214367,-0.0410458,0.04849673,-0.052918836,0.05897165,0.055547018,-0.06345438,0.00785581,0.04426769,0.060075775,-0.006116561,-0.060380988,-0.062391687,-0.027137462,0.031754103,0.06152892,0.032605484,-0.004568209,-0.06361763,-0.063427165,-0.001492497,-0.061153173,0.04271585,0.028742552,-0.060545325,0.05217027,0.017888684,-0.04851341,0.06359912,-0.05344754,0.058854904,0.03320365,0.031347755,-0.019611621,0.06168683,0.000524687,0.06251356,0.008519889,0.008902152,-0.037657462,-0.059546933,0.014236636,0.055327047,-0.06270174,-0.002143851,0.014410432,-0.03006593,-0.045543116,-0.061315853,-0.020710416,0.04296475,0.04543362,0.05167244,-0.01916176,-0.042517636,-0.02061217,0.061494097,0.013156542,-0.026283737,-0.05932621,0.037135925,-0.060568042,-0.028334726,0.052707076,-0.008501241,-0.030733477,-0.056477968,-0.05037646,-0.05307335,0.05762959,0.053741954,-0.059938096,-0.03841872,-0.03098497,-0.03872188,-0.00843

NTPase and 5′ to 3′ RNA Duplex-Unwinding Activities of the Hepatitis E Virus Helicase Domain,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a causative agent of acute hepatitis, and it is the sole member of the genus Hepevirus in the family Hepeviridae. The open reading frame 1 (ORF1) protein of HEV encodes nonstructural polyprotein with putative domains for methyltransferase, cysteine protease, helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. It is not yet known whether ORF1 functions as a single protein with multiple domains or is processed to form separate functional units. On the basis of amino acid conserved motifs, HEV helicase has been grouped into helicase superfamily 1 (SF-1). In order to examine the RNA helicase activity of the NTPase/helicase domain of HEV, the region (amino acids 960 to 1204) was cloned and expressed as histidine-tagged protein in Escherichia coli (HEV Hel) and purified. HEV Hel exhibited NTPase and RNA unwinding activities. Enzyme hydrolyzed all rNTPs efficiently, dATP and dCTP with moderate efficiency, while it showed less hydrolysis of dGTP and dTTP. Enzyme showed unwinding of only RNA duplexes with 5′ overhangs showing 5′-to-3′ polarity. We also expressed and purified two HEV Hel mutants. Helicase mutant I, with substitution in the nucleotide-binding motif I (GKS to GAS), showed 30% ATPase activity. Helicase mutant II, with substitutions in the Mg(2+) binding motif II (DEAP to AAAP), showed 50% ATPase activity. Both mutants completely lost ability to unwind RNA duplexes with 5′ overhangs. These findings represent the first report demonstrating NTPase/RNA helicase activity of the helicase domain of HEV

An N-Terminal Region of Lassa Virus L Protein Plays a Critical Role in Transcription but Not Replication of the Virus Genome,"The central domain of the 200-kDa Lassa virus L protein is a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. N- and C-terminal domains may harbor enzymatic functions important for viral mRNA synthesis, including capping enzymes or cap-snatching endoribonucleases. In the present study, we have employed a large-scale mutagenesis approach to map functionally relevant residues in these regions. The main targets were acidic (Asp and Glu) and basic residues (Lys and Arg) known to form catalytic and binding sites of capping enzymes and endoribonucleases. A total of 149 different mutants were generated and tested in the Lassa virus replicon system. Nearly 25% of evolutionarily highly conserved acidic and basic side chains were dispensable for function of L protein in the replicon context. The vast majority of the remaining mutants had defects in both transcription and replication. Seven residues (Asp-89, Glu-102, Asp-119, Lys-122, Asp-129, Glu-180, and Arg-185) were selectively important for mRNA synthesis. The phenotype was particularly pronounced for Asp-89, Glu-102, and Asp-129, which were indispensable for transcription but could be replaced by a variety of amino acid residues without affecting genome replication. Bioinformatics disclosed the remote similarity of this region to type IIs endonucleases. The mutagenesis was complemented by experiments with the RNA polymerase II inhibitor α-amanitin, demonstrating dependence of viral transcription from the cellular mRNA pool. In conclusion, this paper describes an N-terminal region in L protein being important for mRNA, but not genome synthesis. Bioinformatics and cell biological experiments lend support to the hypothesis that this region could be part of a cap-snatching enzyme.",-0.035268668,0.016779277,-0.05846082,-0.05488539,0.058394212,0.056251217,-0.036785435,-0.03941589,0.048575938,0.024804283,0.060193345,-0.048441786,-0.056142468,0.05425287,0.043273415,-0.060220953,-0.05770669,-0.02900844,0.053930443,-0.02844099,-0.018594678,0.0503388,-0.053367287,0.059759177,-0.009973662,0.05377763,0.059802283,-0.001072685,-0.011324531,-0.008753475,0.055475853,0.05795312,-0.042171337,-0.0557809,-0.0368627,0.05220942,-0.057602093,0.05807638,-0.055820413,0.03329911,0.034540787,-0.045014326,-0.000208276,-0.043505043,0.058755983,-0.054876752,-0.052347098,-0.005517052,-0.017031107,-0.05352509,-0.005635451,0.04933493,-0.05984534,-0.043105148,0.026811361,0.020879993,-0.057114556,0.05234194,0.053909704,-0.059092425,-0.018448163,-0.026585998,0.059086666,-0.01703268,0.012980178,-0.05798274,0.05872896,-0.045453914,0.05090729,-0.04334358,0.012201197,0.058092657,0.041580852,0.054944247,0.018089041,-0.029913273,0.06018736,-0.017771127,-0.058966648,0.057361327,-0.057900507,0.060221154,0.027572732,-0.011656703,0.01375128,0.05933297,0.03311041,-0.037809238,-0.05891801,0.045187898,0.05026563,-0.047433123,-0.055830896,-0.03760687,-0.02297855,0.059922736,0.05557622,0.059453074,0.060227513,-0.042391688,-0.056597315,0.015021684,-0.02071134,-0.016615447,-0.020543166,0.03611486,0.039506894,-0.03946554,-0.029268105,-0.003861288,-0.03645413,0.02428916,0.007362898,0.057336245,0.05334187,0.029853208,-0.060026933,0.002767253,-0.02313728,0.004687224,-0.05451034,0.060144924,0.05789627,-0.057982665,0.057707634,0.015150514,0.05560627,0.034697853,-0.03594365,0.04087238,-0.010092902,0.060228914,0.058015697,0.025128875,0.03379178,-0.034736738,0.014461478,0.052495167,-0.05777267,-0.015816217,-0.037489574,0.06022869,-0.057671644,-0.031672142,-0.01782256,-0.06017422,0.00807684,-0.058458265,0.014226115,0.0480259,-0.028660478,-0.059795644,-0.05469034,-0.013285549,0.060228925,-0.00163379,0.052343108,0.05386509,0.029394029,0.036975086,-0.014953068,-0.05874303,-0.025916208,0.058203053,0.005544931,0.040176984,-0.05246459,-0.003539355,-0.055400085,-0.059000455,-0.03302871,0.018273778,-0.054672476,0.046090297,0.04896441,-0.028714102,0.04637138,-0.013296996,0.059978668,-0.054532323,0.032732915,-0.03830152,-0.042413633,-0.006323311,0.05882008,-0.04576405,-0.060063936,0.056862153,0.05359756,-0.028429981,0.05977184,-0.05099542,-0.038544618,0.027896265,0.060208034,-0.05206726,0.018438531,-0.025309011,0.029865198,-0.057240847,-0.045498747,0.04765982,-0.020617839,0.038224924,0.016207835,-0.014451924,0.002748266,0.05946782,-0.010046133,0.060144145,0.03220643,0.058870137,0.04380221,-0.006518782,-0.057481293,-0.035355035,0.052000567,0.002836858,-0.048957825,0.01361354,-0.022797946,-0.05511021,-0.02364453,-0.000748561,-0.0580659,0.013725801,-0.05980122,-0.049499176,-0.021724595,-0.001471152,-0.005276826,0.05700041,-0.017836027,-0.06022854,0.059643555,0.05567901,0.05089923,-0.059912972,-0.037299357,0.050964747,0.051633026,0.048057564,-0.006908255,-0.010629524,0.059205934,-0.030127842,0.002059701,0.04500395,0.03910534,0.006883307,-0.06020851,0.04876476,0.028586544,0.022930497,0.059320178,-0.03754212,-0.017963141,0.060228925,0.001328516,0.0527395,0.038541026,0.041974787,-0.017262489,0.056260098,0.058428932,-0.01926178,-0.03142173,0.048592854,-0.05235598,-0.003890654,0.041813146,0.06016456,-0.018084666,0.05993047,0.02800313,-0.05627189,0.033882204,0.059430253,0.060187835,-0.047279373,-0.0461667,0.03403764,-0.056690264,0.05707752,-0.001169565,-0.035589665,-0.058004215,0.057281934,-0.05935612,0.036733117,0.06022327,-0.022344975,0.059785757,-0.04439804,0.002585696,-0.059457127,-0.044524673,0.051284235,-0.06019033,-0.004623667,-0.034870658,0.06012618,0.05561694,0.055837,-0.05165571,0.040177293,-0.038775288,-0.037350077,0.052668873,-0.05137288,0.06002483,-0.015635172,0.051731892,-0.056168243,0.060159225,0.046659745,-0.034299567,-0.04111607,0.0358057,0.023729557,-0.056095604,0.04668803,0.042929795,-0.059472516,-0.027907306,0.015582272,-0.054228425,-0.057710443,0.004231001,-0.023076814,0.027960358,-0.00049931,-0.012977104,0.060150895,0.038429193,-0.037878536,0.05445832,-0.004362826,0.038325034,-0.02754775,-0.0211304,-0.033963174,0.059128173,0.02303596,-0.06022891,-0.060228273,-0.036625415,0.05765893,0.024916241,-0.054723453,0.010052779,0.026602048,-0.05887491,0.05925523,-0.026751515,-0.05132451,-0.060228627,-0.05726845,-0.019355007,0.022756489,0.05508257,-0.059778105,-0.05983469,0.020678902,0.02902105,-0.003062947,0.060213853,0.046086285,0.056267694,0.042757623,-0.025176773,-0.046628766,-0.022232745,-0.060228925,0.056645457,0.05363834,0.058017906,0.050945945,0.012483713,-0.059467107,-0.06022522,0.05732492,0.03462717,-0.002367504,0.001947587,-0.044969734,-0.050739538,-0.059960496,0.05957775,0.04495661,0.018609697,0.029785087,0.055140596,-0.05613122,-0.0092298,0.029739399,0.03890141,-0.05748075,-0.038164493,-0.05806234,0.006692374,0.004289726,0.020983009,0.022978578,-0.006996219,-0.056307208,-0.053592566,0.030202309,0.03773269,0.05199354,-0.015711311,-

Genetic Heterogeneity and Recombination in Canine Noroviruses,"Alphatronlike (genogroup IV [GIV]) noroviruses (NoVs) have been recently identified in carnivores. By screening a collection of 183 fecal samples collected during 2007 from dogs with enteric signs, the overall NoV prevalence was found to be 2.2% (4/183). A unique strain, Bari/91/07/ITA, resembled GIV.2 NoVs in its ORF1 (polymerase complex), while it was genetically unrelated in its full-length ORF2 (capsid gene) to GIV animal and human NoVs (54.0 to 54.4% amino acid identity) and to any other NoV genogroup (<54.7% amino acid identity). It displayed the highest identity (58.1% amino acid identity) to unclassified human strain Chiba/040502/04/Jp. Interestingly, the very 5′ end of ORF2 of the canine virus matched short noroviral sequences (88.9% nucleotide identity and 98.9% amino acid identity) identified from oysters in Japan, indicating that similar viruses may be common environmental contaminants.",-0.056185998,0.03692603,-0.020217242,0.029873036,0.05481268,0.05931363,-0.03198348,-0.011609524,0.029823713,0.006748298,0.066964924,0.059875906,0.02644116,-0.010800671,0.058168028,-0.06359608,-0.06401186,-0.057480875,0.058822054,0.046008978,-0.06096172,-0.038021453,-0.049754,0.0668124,0.058169086,0.061562654,0.011391304,0.008904163,0.05962041,0.021872832,0.06480672,0.065670684,-0.03441455,-0.044343434,-0.025825566,0.05579947,-0.06666411,-0.029508734,-0.054437365,0.04836406,0.045550887,-0.033901956,-0.014146501,-0.05667917,-0.066660754,-0.05881108,-0.006016956,-0.05272844,0.05260875,-0.01843938,0.015408589,-0.009401316,-0.05819496,-0.048258077,-0.055752132,-0.02087755,-0.06196997,0.06345052,0.044167385,-0.06662946,0.04184598,0.053845074,-0.04667106,0.02042847,-0.017551444,-0.065294534,0.058180984,0.014573909,-0.021866053,0.03956649,-0.009376368,0.055188682,0.029936235,0.06260379,-0.013374191,0.055932306,0.061357025,0.011466654,-0.062095646,0.017974263,-0.05952456,0.06434331,-0.003459508,-0.035535775,-0.008371589,0.06230297,0.019628443,-0.002112913,-0.062348284,0.047507748,-0.05179672,0.039755378,-0.020105083,0.032020576,0.029412745,0.01578858,0.021958785,0.065109916,0.0669386,0.052250158,-0.009845726,0.001109715,-0.053520076,0.06485799,0.047237664,-0.00688727,0.061467003,-0.043563288,0.046439193,-0.03644719,-0.010407303,0.050593946,0.046467997,0.033244327,0.047692418,0.01063503,-0.062402733,-0.032911625,0.000282593,-0.008261951,0.047549307,0.008639367,0.029094633,-0.027838256,-0.021922415,0.053331196,0.063531086,0.027468719,0.014653786,0.04754401,0.035478357,0.06701379,0.043190356,0.023543533,0.03136566,-0.027693795,-0.03476318,0.058856335,-0.055870395,-0.058329463,-0.019249957,0.06701497,-0.065130174,0.04287335,0.020463603,-0.054383274,0.034103356,0.057900634,0.05296119,0.045856073,-0.062608704,-0.030962046,-0.053569928,-0.0161558,0.06701035,0.054803263,0.04283193,0.041434765,0.054931827,-0.019624565,-0.06189448,-0.04991584,0.013837952,0.0368987,-0.056075435,0.056785155,-0.045791913,0.009573398,-0.04139663,-0.04555344,0.014688322,-0.008132772,0.065585114,0.04684479,-0.061792478,0.058247402,0.010371154,0.06307905,0.05564583,-0.02368564,0.043506797,0.05153052,-0.053382456,-0.055195753,0.019645346,-0.028647209,-0.059045102,0.031718504,0.003803362,-0.048592094,0.015132785,0.030272717,0.013412121,-0.04470984,0.062511295,-0.031460147,0.054971114,0.04660953,-0.01962697,0.012462853,-0.0508101,0.047036096,0.036474705,-0.004260424,-0.004928333,-0.038808595,-0.030967569,0.06692847,0.03952476,0.062602475,-0.019357676,0.060266834,0.000883752,0.04287825,-0.06250525,-0.00367739,0.035640024,0.053215813,0.048226602,-0.063887484,0.043577157,-0.028905913,0.03162891,-0.007148984,-0.025420286,-0.04428628,-0.050161492,-0.059266545,0.03645352,0.028689118,-0.003863335,0.06441169,0.027834948,-0.06693198,0.007208664,0.032244977,0.019019471,-0.06442957,-0.02034681,0.012320043,0.036449466,0.06539423,0.010619808,-0.011964531,0.06641995,0.01612081,-0.053520575,0.046585668,0.042915203,-0.05216791,-0.052864086,0.025529925,0.017858084,0.012834867,0.057773974,-0.037570335,-0.061617777,0.067012355,-0.026330754,0.019013008,-0.010679588,-0.00196196,0.042374298,0.00481899,-0.019236853,0.024796002,0.022700218,-0.04212216,-0.065595426,-0.024958478,0.022851124,0.065506786,0.03213991,-0.029294845,0.046980575,-0.06349455,0.018489957,0.03659599,0.054179106,0.050321087,-0.05334907,-0.060558014,-0.018369349,0.056930576,-0.058664076,-0.019362658,-0.060059637,0.066349655,0.013178815,0.013253828,0.066154286,-0.056361437,0.0664324,-0.05200334,-0.06500885,-0.023150075,-0.027263625,0.018322133,-0.066904895,0.060166676,-0.014292505,0.0644306,0.06430785,0.043694526,-0.060254384,0.027679902,-0.003915313,-0.059381332,0.025160842,-0.006934837,-0.016199643,0.02695517,0.017815655,-0.011657064,0.061977938,-0.018352106,-0.04917177,-0.047401395,0.06405578,0.044160213,-0.008762038,0.05238469,0.055744726,-0.0448524,-0.059734255,-0.01861905,-0.052155215,-0.03417371,-0.06248979,-0.0570249,0.037811242,-0.004941609,0.040565737,0.035505213,-0.015764343,0.036509078,0.036928765,-0.032958966,-0.020268634,-0.008392697,-0.031659383,-0.061587323,0.044607453,0.003801176,-0.06543839,-0.066762194,0.05466972,0.042238887,-0.040433437,-0.0596542,-0.03065962,-0.02393833,-0.043118652,0.023034712,0.045491967,0.058190398,-0.06697825,-0.059278686,0.034613684,-0.06414832,0.041882634,-0.009340597,0.00752866,0.058228172,0.057940412,-0.04861162,0.06631843,-0.001315421,0.06295078,-0.008986352,0.00899317,-0.023037305,-0.0323543,-0.064933464,0.022684053,0.048941407,0.006687937,0.06115544,-0.0366886,-0.042980004,-0.032369398,0.05235819,-0.003928694,-0.045712844,0.024964577,0.008831882,-0.062036086,-0.04545798,0.06426419,0.025838666,0.035112575,0.03559891,0.041960485,-0.05738547,0.059647687,0.037955754,-0.061479844,-0.014973366,-0.018913783,-0.06392931,0.017555809,-0.043545626,-0.04083224,0.056822468,0.01068814,0.007383801,-0.05558325,0.014160536,0.008032967,-0.03749413,0.007666826,0.0

"Turnip Mosaic Virus RNA Replication Complex Vesicles Are Mobile, Align with Microfilaments, and Are Each Derived from a Single Viral Genome","Nicotiana benthamiana plants were agroinoculated with an infectious cDNA clone of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) that was engineered to express a fluorescent protein (green fluorescent protein [GFP] or mCherry) fused to the viral 6K(2) protein known to induce vesicle formation. Cytoplasmic fluorescent discrete protein structures were observed in infected cells, corresponding to the vesicles containing the viral RNA replication complex. The vesicles were motile and aligned with microfilaments. Intracellular movement of the vesicles was inhibited when cells were infiltrated with latrunculin B, an inhibitor of microfilament polymerization. It was also observed that viral accumulation in the presence of this drug was reduced. These data indicate that microfilaments are used for vesicle movement and are necessary for virus production. Biogenesis of the vesicles was further investigated by infecting cells with two recombinant TuMV strains: one expressed 6K(2)GFP and the other expressed 6K(2)mCherry. Green- and red-only vesicles were observed within the same cell, suggesting that each vesicle originated from a single viral genome. There were also vesicles that exhibited sectors of green, red, or yellow fluorescence, an indication that fusion among individual vesicles is possible. Protoplasts derived from TuMV-infected N. benthamiana leaves were isolated. Using immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy, viral RNA synthesis sites were visualized as punctate structures distributed throughout the cytoplasm. The viral proteins VPg-Pro, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and cytoplasmic inclusion protein (helicase) and host translation factors were found to be associated with these structures. A single-genome origin and presence of protein synthetic machinery components suggest that translation of viral RNA is taking place within the

Biochemical Characterization of Arterivirus Nonstructural Protein 11 Reveals the Nidovirus-Wide Conservation of a Replicative Endoribonuclease,"Nidoviruses (arteriviruses, coronaviruses, and roniviruses) are a phylogenetically compact but diverse group of positive-strand RNA viruses that includes important human and animal pathogens. Nidovirus RNA synthesis is mediated by a cytoplasmic membrane-associated replication/transcription complex that includes up to 16 viral nonstructural proteins (nsps), which carry common enzymatic activities, like the viral RNA polymerase, but also unusual and poorly understood RNA-processing functions. Of these, a conserved endoribonuclease (NendoU) is a major genetic marker that is unique to nidoviruses. NendoU activity was previously verified in vitro for the coronavirus nsp15, but not for any of its distantly related orthologs from other nidovirus lineages, like the arterivirus nsp11. Here, we show that the bacterially expressed nsp11 proteins of two arteriviruses, equine arteritis virus and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus, possess pyrimidine-specific endoribonuclease activity. RNA cleavage was independent of divalent cations in vitro and was greatly reduced by replacement of residues previously implicated in catalysis. Comparative characterization of the NendoU activity in arteriviruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus revealed common and distinct features of their substrate requirements and reaction mechanism. Our data provide the first biochemical evidence of endoribonuclease activity associated with arterivirus nsp11 and support the conclusion that this remarkable RNA-processing enzyme, whose substrate in the infected cell remains to be identified, distinguishes nidoviruses from all other RNA

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Triggers Apoptosis via Protein Kinase R but Is Resistant to Its Antiviral Activity,"In this study, infection of 293/ACE2 cells with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) activated several apoptosis-associated events, namely, cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-8, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP), and chromatin condensation and the phosphorylation and hence inactivation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). In addition, two of the three cellular eIF2α kinases known to be virus induced, protein kinase R (PKR) and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), were activated by SARS-CoV. The third kinase, general control nonderepressible-2 kinase (GCN2), was not activated, but late in infection the level of GCN2 protein was significantly reduced. Reverse transcription-PCR analyses revealed that the reduction of GCN2 protein was not due to decreased transcription or stability of GCN2 mRNA. The specific reduction of PKR protein expression by antisense peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers strongly reduced cleavage of PARP in infected cells. Surprisingly, the knockdown of PKR neither enhanced SARS-CoV replication nor abrogated SARS-CoV-induced eIF2α phosphorylation. Pretreatment of cells with beta interferon prior to SARS-CoV infection led to a significant decrease in PERK activation, eIF2α phosphorylation, and SARS-CoV replication. The various effects of beta interferon treatment were found to function independently on the expression of PKR. Our results show that SARS-CoV infection activates PKR and PERK, leading to sustained eIF2α phosphorylation. However, virus replication was not impaired by these events, suggesting that SARS-CoV possesses a mechanism to overcome the inhibitory effects of phosphorylated eIF2α on viral mRNA translation. Furthermore, our data suggest that viral activation of PKR can lead to apoptosis via a pathway that is independent of eIF2α

Comparative Analysis of Complete Genome Sequences of Three Avian Coronaviruses Reveals a Novel Group 3c Coronavirus,"In this territory-wide molecular epidemiology study of coronaviruses (CoVs) in Hong Kong involving 1,541 dead wild birds, three novel CoVs were identified in three different bird families (bulbul CoV HKU11 [BuCoV HKU11], thrush CoV HKU12 [ThCoV HKU12], and munia CoV HKU13 [MuCoV HKU13]). Four complete genomes of the three novel CoVs were sequenced. Their genomes (26,396 to 26,552 bases) represent the smallest known CoV genomes. In phylogenetic trees constructed using chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL(pro)), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol), helicase, spike, and nucleocapsid proteins, BuCoV HKU11, ThCoV HKU12, and MuCoV HKU13 formed a cluster distantly related to infectious bronchitis virus and turkey CoV (group 3a CoVs). For helicase, spike, and nucleocapsid, they were also clustered with a CoV recently discovered in Asian leopard cats, for which the complete genome sequence was not available. The 3CL(pro), Pol, helicase, and nucleocapsid of the three CoVs possessed higher amino acid identities to those of group 3a CoVs than to those of group 1 and group 2 CoVs. Unique genomic features distinguishing them from other group 3 CoVs include a distinct transcription regulatory sequence and coding potential for small open reading frames. Based on these results, we propose a novel CoV subgroup, group 3c, to describe this distinct subgroup of CoVs under the group 3 CoVs. Avian CoVs are genetically more diverse than previously thought and may be closely related to some newly identified mammalian CoVs. Further studies would be important to delineate whether the Asian leopard cat CoV was a result of interspecies jumping from birds, a situation analogous to that of bat and civet severe acute

Sensitive and Broadly Reactive Reverse Transcription-PCR Assays To Detect Novel Paramyxoviruses,"We have developed a set of reverse transcription-PCR assays for the detection and identification of known and novel paramyxoviruses in clinical specimens. Primers were designed from the conserved motifs of the polymerase pol gene sequences to detect members of the Paramyxovirinae or Pneumovirinae subfamily or groups of genera within the Paramyxovirinae subfamily. The consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primer design and seminested or nested PCR assay design were used to enhance the breadth of reactivity and sensitivity of the respective assays. Using expressed RNA and 10-fold dilution series of virus-infected tissue culture isolates from different members of the family or genera, these assays were able to detect on average between 100 and 500 copies of template RNA.

Functional Characterization of the Cleavage Specificity of the Sapovirus Chymotrypsin-Like Protease,"Sapovirus is a positive-stranded RNA virus with a translational strategy based on processing of a polyprotein precursor by a chymotrypsin-like protease. So far, the molecular mechanisms regulating cleavage specificity of the viral protease are poorly understood. In this study, the catalytic activities and substrate specificities of the predicted forms of the viral protease, the 3C-like protease (NS6) and the 3CD-like protease-polymerase (NS6-7), were examined in vitro. The purified NS6 and NS6-7 were able to cleave synthetic peptides (15 to 17 residues) displaying the cleavage sites of the sapovirus polyprotein, both NS6 and NS6-7 proteins being active forms of the viral protease. High-performance liquid chromatography and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis of digested products showed a specific trans cleavage of peptides bearing Gln-Gly, Gln-Ala, Glu-Gly, Glu-Pro, or Glu-Lys at the scissile bond. In contrast, peptides bearing Glu-Ala or Gln-Asp at the scissile bond (NS4-NS5 and NS5-NS6, or NS6-NS7 junctions, respectively) were resistant to trans cleavage by NS6 or NS6-7 proteins, whereas cis cleavage of the Glu-Ala scissile bond of the NS5-NS6 junction was evidenced. Interestingly, the presence of a Phe at position P4 overruled the resistance to trans cleavage of the Glu-Ala junction (NS5-NS6), whereas substitutions at the P1 and P2′ positions altered the cleavage efficiency. The differential cleavage observed is supported by a model of the substrate-binding site of the sapovirus protease, indicating that the P4, P1, and P2′ positions in the substrate modulate the cleavage specificity and efficiency of the sapovirus chymotrypsin-like protease.",0.040920682,-0.017620688,0.017887976,-0.057397813,0.019523446,0.05884192,-0.01437785,0.015641449,0.011466431,0.054644153,0.0537189,0.022032106,-0.039020415,0.038493507,0.014586635,-0.060138643,-0.04663804,-0.04811335,0.057077352,0.044133704,0.03362611,-0.042979695,-0.056928102,-0.030196508,0.05331911,0.05518261,-0.03883035,-0.026821285,-0.05032724,0.045279242,0.05822669,-0.055226892,0.059713304,-0.044109702,-0.04000156,0.052098986,-0.050868757,0.05144524,-0.04607385,-0.038376067,-0.040324185,-0.014645479,-0.01687177,-0.054217905,0.060052775,-0.044219825,0.009744204,-0.05289319,0.045481477,-0.033634607,-0.05854405,0.047785576,-0.059992786,-0.059617776,-0.039899014,-0.057738304,-0.059116766,-0.017325811,0.019051626,-0.03188795,0.014696183,0.050945133,0.055945143,0.039806467,-0.010762611,-0.058384694,0.052240368,0.051444504,0.059869118,-0.05751595,0.049588233,0.04971861,-0.024123976,0.041268088,-0.048185423,0.007167589,0.05756553,0.05440129,-0.04310636,0.051645715,-0.0591666,0.060127772,-0.032335553,-0.05559465,-0.05931631,0.032377165,0.04820189,0.029235106,-0.059050508,-0.003636692,-0.056852683,0.016449833,-0.056301232,-0.03063695,0.004160824,-0.022721482,0.051873162,0.05632605,0.060007423,-0.025302868,-0.043846603,0.04189507,0.052216846,0.042364895,-0.037671093,0.042332787,-0.02785968,0.056664348,0.045213442,-0.058483016,0.038450893,0.056453224,0.050923638,0.045053933,0.054222416,-0.039990943,0.03554095,0.016621383,0.006065005,-0.02436192,-0.0555851,0.05810107,-0.050583486,0.04795799,0.03997001,0.05957614,-0.049365163,0.015890088,-0.01627082,0.045336414,-0.02786364,0.06008543,0.059811376,0.04756591,0.056980602,-0.031171147,0.024569454,0.046174627,-0.057951987,0.050945822,-0.031324703,0.060138192,-0.051917512,-0.039342448,-0.055560034,-0.0530487,-0.05180647,-0.060081035,0.012877543,0.057514284,-0.05490089,-0.05940803,-0.036412165,-0.05300939,0.06013872,0.0585436,0.056166783,0.052752808,0.050619982,-0.057636015,-0.025674429,-0.022939863,-0.028545542,0.023129994,0.03787477,-0.039526466,-0.05806254,0.037930574,-0.05080478,-0.054309767,-0.044238728,0.05376281,-0.057265896,-0.03862288,0.04365512,-0.04875242,0.006314792,-0.059443668,0.05986994,0.003879087,0.052577395,0.05096333,-0.04895814,0.006980715,0.012123085,-0.02855769,-0.059419584,0.059429243,0.059754338,-0.006461384,0.053326283,-0.053376105,-0.009352795,0.043427415,0.05940041,-0.011108623,-0.036561783,-0.05896512,0.057227924,-0.04114789,-0.054524947,0.012141409,0.020555254,0.04183161,0.04248612,0.0217,0.030429928,0.058963597,-0.044917747,0.053546153,-0.04723678,0.0587401,-0.029010868,0.054515235,-0.06005037,-0.04430834,0.006701937,0.013250845,-0.05737688,0.05091715,0.02119579,-0.0425417,-0.011611427,0.04290553,-0.041508116,-0.02283874,0.007383234,-0.0480895,-0.03877938,0.051612165,-0.046826854,0.05993034,-0.029794721,-0.06010122,0.06002467,-0.03908812,0.05026228,-0.059238195,-0.041189745,0.060001697,0.04390268,-0.03319803,-0.05752682,0.059783503,0.051394008,-0.00765768,-0.010859237,0.020187682,0.012758552,0.0060531,-0.060093123,0.03894999,-0.045775034,-0.038861718,0.04768204,0.021164851,-0.04161954,0.06013874,-0.059283413,0.04543882,0.024161331,-0.003293057,-0.006130591,0.046800386,-0.003730159,0.056285385,-0.04952336,0.034856874,-0.03261946,-0.012537285,0.0553236,0.060076796,0.012735104,0.05922824,0.024409933,0.010868892,-0.03854597,0.00647239,0.059879746,-0.05941627,-0.053354856,-0.023858074,-0.058092616,0.054839447,0.040208016,-0.043374658,-0.00296803,0.051980864,-0.058563873,-0.04135452,0.059681494,-0.008903516,-0.029424002,-0.006898399,-0.054715022,-0.058325555,-0.059324976,-0.036285702,-0.057034463,0.048780426,-0.05336247,0.05818203,0.048811227,0.037707143,0.055873908,0.04814559,-0.054281883,-0.018784747,-0.002908068,-0.041332003,-0.030472077,-0.05284064,0.001627024,0.051535923,0.056506433,0.052377623,-0.044455614,-0.03637843,0.047922418,-0.025676787,-0.057653796,0.033671398,0.03582837,-0.05042385,0.050713103,-0.04374884,-0.052124113,-0.05942122,-0.048166268,-0.001655997,-0.04454804,0.055230442,0.033232264,0.06005234,0.03148252,-0.003878739,0.008689594,0.001783628,0.049777463,0.027250107,-0.048382364,-0.04655781,0.05877881,-0.013230708,-0.06013874,-0.06013873,-0.011347971,0.05168075,-0.018966954,-0.045544803,-0.031426933,0.05510736,-0.024709681,-0.05238556,0.001350377,-0.030011456,-0.060130548,-0.032823537,0.002315054,-0.045737166,0.058335654,-0.002431535,-0.059995834,-0.000307164,0.052702524,-0.042447835,0.059920773,-0.02416368,0.05722888,0.057961658,0.001609017,-0.059353318,-0.008269125,-0.060138736,0.04218589,0.04135942,0.0545558,-0.05161976,0.05159752,-0.04851252,-0.06012459,0.044649314,0.05731072,-0.048479695,0.026812855,-0.060002852,-0.059229206,-0.034967527,0.057954356,-0.052936524,0.0386272,-0.05317933,0.052479,-0.03961764,-0.031614743,0.058365747,0.059901167,-0.053493693,0.04121875,-0.050223242,0.05918307,-0.059526846,-0.023020353,0.05837437,0.022887858,-0.04089305,-0.036949825,0.034937482,0.005556619,0.052742884,-0.04652353,-0.022

Amiloride Derivatives Inhibit Coxsackievirus B3 RNA Replication,"Amiloride derivatives are known blockers of the cellular Na(+)/H(+) exchanger and the epithelial Na(+) channel. More recent studies demonstrate that they also inhibit ion channels formed by a number of viral proteins. We previously reported that 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA) modestly inhibits intracellular replication and, to a larger extent, release of human rhinovirus 2 (HRV2) (E. V. Gazina, D. N. Harrison, M. Jefferies, H. Tan, D. Williams, D. A. Anderson and S. Petrou, Antiviral Res. 67:98-106, 2005). Here, we demonstrate that amiloride and EIPA strongly inhibit coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) RNA replication and do not inhibit CVB3 release, in contrast to our previous findings on HRV2. Passaging of plasmid-derived CVB3 in the presence of amiloride generated mutant viruses with amino acid substitutions in position 299 or 372 of the CVB3 polymerase.

A Highly Divergent Picornavirus in a Marine Mammal,"Nucleic acids from an unidentified virus from ringed seals (Phoca hispida) were amplified using sequence-independent PCR, subcloned, and then sequenced. The full genome of a novel RNA virus was derived, identifying the first sequence-confirmed picornavirus in a marine mammal. The phylogenetic position of the tentatively named seal picornavirus 1 (SePV-1) as an outlier to the grouping of parechoviruses was found consistently in alignable regions of the genome. A mean protein sequence identity of only 19.3 to 30.0% was found between the 3D polymerase gene sequence of SePV-1 and those of other picornaviruses. The predicted secondary structure of the short 506-base 5′-untranslated region showed some attributes of a type IVB internal ribosome entry site, and the polyprotein lacked an apparent L peptide, both properties associated with the Parechovirus genus. The presence of two SePV-1 2A genes and of the canonical sequence required for cotranslational cleavage resembled the genetic organization of Ljungan virus. Minor genetic variants were detected in culture supernatants derived from 8 of 108 (7.4%) seals collected in 2000 to 2002, indicating a high prevalence of SePV-1 in this hunted seal population. The high level of genetic divergence of SePV-1 compared to other picornaviruses and its mix of characteristics relative to its closest relatives support the provisional classification of SePV-1 as the prototype for a new genus in the family

Influenza Virus mRNA Translation Revisited: Is the eIF4E Cap-Binding Factor Required for Viral mRNA Translation?,"Influenza virus mRNAs bear a short capped oligonucleotide sequence at their 5′ ends derived from the host cell pre-mRNAs by a “cap-snatching” mechanism, followed immediately by a common viral sequence. At their 3′ ends, they contain a poly(A) tail. Although cellular and viral mRNAs are structurally similar, influenza virus promotes the selective translation of its mRNAs despite the inhibition of host cell protein synthesis. The viral polymerase performs the cap snatching and binds selectively to the 5′ common viral sequence. As viral mRNAs are recognized by their own cap-binding complex, we tested whether viral mRNA translation occurs without the contribution of the eIF4E protein, the cellular factor required for cap-dependent translation. Here, we show that influenza virus infection proceeds normally in different situations of functional impairment of the eIF4E factor. In addition, influenza virus polymerase binds to translation preinitiation complexes, and furthermore, under conditions of decreased eIF4GI association to cap structures, an increase in eIF4GI binding to these structures was found upon influenza virus infection. This is the first report providing evidence that influenza virus mRNA translation proceeds independently of a fully active translation initiation factor (eIF4E). The data reported are in agreement with a role of viral polymerase as a substitute for the eIF4E factor for viral mRNA

The clinical and public health value of non-culture methods in the investigation of a cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases,"During 2003, a cluster of initially unexplained pneumonia cases (two fatal) occurred in patients aged <50 years in a British city. Routine culture tests were inconclusive, however, pneumococcal infection was suspected and the putative outbreak was investigated using non-culture methods. Clinical samples from ten patients were tested by pneumococcal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), or Binax NOW(®) pneumococcal urine antigen test and serotype-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Lung samples from the deceased patients were PCR positive and yielded different MLST types. Two patients in one family group were serotype 1 pneumococcal antigen positive. Two further patients were serotype 1 antigen positive, and one serotype 4 positive. Two antigen-positive cases were also serum PCR positive. Non-culture methods confirmed the disease aetiology in six cases.

De Novo Initiation of RNA Synthesis by the Arterivirus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase,"All plus-strand RNA viruses encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that functions as the catalytic subunit of the viral replication/transcription complex, directing viral RNA synthesis in concert with other viral proteins and, sometimes, host proteins. RNA synthesis essentially can be initiated by two different mechanisms, de novo initiation and primer-dependent initiation. Most viral RdRps have been identified solely on the basis of comparative sequence analysis, and for many viruses the mechanism of initiation is unknown. In this study, using the family prototype equine arteritis virus (EAV), we address the mechanism of initiation of RNA synthesis in arteriviruses. The RdRp domains of the members of the arterivirus family, which are part of replicase subunit nsp9, were compared to coronavirus RdRps that belong to the same order of Nidovirales, as well as to other RdRps with known initiation mechanisms and three-dimensional structures. We report here the first successful expression and purification of an arterivirus RdRp that is catalytically active in the absence of other viral or cellular proteins. The EAV nsp9/RdRp initiates RNA synthesis by a de novo mechanism on homopolymeric templates in a template-specific manner. In addition, the requirements for initiation of RNA synthesis from the 3′ end of the viral genome were studied in vivo using a reverse genetics approach. These studies suggest that the 3′-terminal nucleotides of the EAV genome play a critical role in viral RNA

Adaptation of Borna Disease Virus to New Host Species Attributed to Altered Regulation of Viral Polymerase Activity,"Borna disease virus (BDV) can persistently infect the central nervous system of a broad range of mammalian species. Mice are resistant to infections with primary BDV isolates, but certain laboratory strains can be adapted to replicate in mice. We determined the molecular basis of adaptation by studying mutations acquired by a cDNA-derived BDV strain during one brain passage in rats and three passages in mice. The adapted virus propagated efficiently in mouse brains and induced neurological disease. Its genome contained seven point mutations, three of which caused amino acid changes in the L polymerase (L1116R and N1398D) and in the polymerase cofactor P (R66K). Recombinant BDV carrying these mutations either alone or in combination all showed enhanced multiplication speed in Vero cells, indicating improved intrinsic viral polymerase activity rather than adaptation to a mouse-specific factor. Mutations R66K and L1116R, but not N1398D, conferred replication competence of recombinant BDV in mice if introduced individually. Virus propagation in mouse brains was substantially enhanced if both L mutations were present simultaneously, but infection remained mostly nonsymptomatic. Only if all three amino acid substitutions were combined did BDV replicate vigorously and induce early disease in mice. Interestingly, the virulence-enhancing effect of the R66K mutation in P could be attributed to reduced negative regulation of polymerase activity by the viral X protein. Our data demonstrate that BDV replication competence in mice is mediated by the polymerase complex rather than the viral envelope and suggest that altered regulation of viral gene expression can favor adaptation to new host

Detection of a Novel and Highly Divergent Coronavirus from Asian Leopard Cats and Chinese Ferret Badgers in Southern China,"Since an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was averted in 2004, many novel coronaviruses have been recognized from different species, including humans. Bats have provided the most diverse assemblages of coronaviruses, suggesting that they may be the natural reservoir. Continued virological surveillance has proven to be the best way to avert this infectious disease at the source. Here we provide the first description of a previously unidentified coronavirus lineage detected from wild Asian leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis) and Chinese ferret badgers (Melogale moschata) during virological surveillance in southern China. Partial genome analysis revealed a typical coronavirus genome but with a unique putative accessory gene organization. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the envelope, membrane, and nucleoprotein structural proteins and the two conserved replicase domains, putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA helicase, of these novel coronaviruses were most closely related to those of group 3 coronaviruses identified from birds, while the spike protein gene was most closely related to that of group 1 coronaviruses from mammals. However, these viruses always fell into an outgroup phylogenetic relationship with respect to other coronaviruses and had low amino acid similarity to all known coronavirus groups, indicating that they diverged early in the evolutionary history of coronaviruses. These results suggest that these viruses may represent a previously unrecognized evolutionary pathway, or possibly an unidentified coronavirus group. This study demonstrates the importance of systematic virological surveillance in market animals for understanding the evolution and emergence of viruses with infectious

Strong and Selective Inhibitors of Hepatitis B Virus Replication among Novel N(4)-Hydroxy- and 5-Methyl-β-l-Deoxycytidine Analogues,"Novel N(4)-hydroxy- and 5-methyl-modified β-l-deoxycytidine analogues were synthesized and evaluated as anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) agents. Their in vitro efficiencies were investigated in HepG2.2.15 cells stably transfected with HBV. β-l-2′,3′-Didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxy-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (β-l-Hyd4C) was most effective in reducing secreted HBV DNA (50% effective concentration [EC(50)], 0.03 μM), followed by β-l-2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thia-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (EC(50), 0.51 μM), β-l-2′,3′-dideoxy-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (EC(50), 0.55 μM), and β-l-5-methyl-2′-deoxycytidine (EC(50), 0.9 μM). The inhibition of the presumed target, the HBV DNA polymerase, by the triphosphates of some of the β-l-cytidine derivatives was also assessed. In accordance with the cell culture data, β-l-Hyd4C triphosphate was the most active inhibitor, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.21 μM. The cytotoxicities of some of the 4-NHOH-modified β-l-nucleosides were dramatically lower than those of the corresponding cytidine analogues with the unmodified 4-NH(2) group. The 50% cytotoxic concentrations for β-l-Hyd4C in HepG2 and HL-60 cells were 2,500 μM and 3,500 μM, respectively. In summary, our results demonstrate that at least β-l-Hyd4C can be recommended as a highly efficient and extremely selective inhibitor of HBV replication for further investigations.",-0.057907254,0.05477816,-0.040464967,-0.044238508,-0.012877576,0.055413168,0.05518443,-0.06345308,-0.02318011,0.036470003,0.066793494,-0.03279516,0.053259343,0.052309275,0.042011242,-0.061546557,-0.047093075,0.012988493,0.054669872,0.040143646,-0.014530119,-0.05380465,-0.06111352,0.03498686,0.03039166,0.050040882,-0.001730259,0.034579195,-0.01841253,0.06397417,0.0597442,0.06542865,0.044523902,-0.061199784,0.057193562,-0.060358707,-0.0464549,-0.04462161,-0.050944958,-0.03855652,-0.00024062,0.029870534,0.04343685,-0.008124433,-0.000886304,0.005743101,-0.05528308,-0.025454622,0.052873872,-0.013498337,-0.04786275,-0.041395474,-0.06651063,-0.054548137,-0.054878954,0.06386241,-0.06617122,-0.04972202,0.002694095,-0.058803882,0.019428689,-0.04079962,0.048129432,-0.004690176,-0.001690046,-0.029816993,0.052561596,0.064502575,0.054519493,-0.05502399,0.020604467,0.061520968,0.009961799,0.061173674,-0.033575553,0.036805876,0.061901268,-0.01247963,-0.0614391,-0.020924969,-0.029806796,0.06531768,0.00563654,-0.022539843,-0.052432835,0.05642773,-0.035025656,0.04302208,-0.014445132,-0.013398881,-0.043933112,0.006952013,-0.044258893,-0.022539653,0.046275083,0.04567593,0.053226694,-0.00312925,0.06512511,-0.029242536,-0.05455637,-0.024877692,-0.006645707,0.026186759,0.06438997,-0.006414319,-0.034240652,0.061367486,-0.004613889,0.01283485,-0.014071438,0.016865622,0.034343462,0.00081661,0.020052606,0.003171553,-0.06574471,-0.040915888,0.045090087,0.024042774,-0.053359218,0.06496228,0.022419525,-0.033862635,0.057917353,0.02264849,-0.02414948,0.004110143,-0.052922193,-0.031075554,-0.04531815,0.066845074,0.05953663,-0.02338484,-0.022255922,0.00775169,0.013575185,0.064021416,0.034682173,-0.032924525,0.06018055,0.067026034,-0.035895523,-0.06019841,-0.008038652,-0.002481084,0.03548073,-0.059718307,0.025525978,0.036813755,-0.055743262,-0.01961905,-0.056623787,0.028306274,0.06701397,0.06464618,0.042132985,0.05432108,0.05236978,0.008268539,-0.017350037,0.019832874,-0.012466336,0.063688494,-0.037441608,-0.057875905,-0.027470568,-0.030093694,-0.064548284,-0.048706733,-0.00622517,-0.044769898,-0.06035962,0.029337836,-0.044899594,-0.016790217,0.056902446,0.052952077,0.0525988,0.02489974,-0.025402442,-0.050371468,0.00488384,0.0626842,0.0659922,0.011281721,0.058571022,-0.00416855,0.052270986,0.011002324,0.06647627,0.022788573,-0.04390673,0.03774742,0.064645715,-0.05646613,-0.047298964,0.007037059,0.04997999,-0.059843138,-0.065088354,0.058224455,0.032383002,0.04902721,0.020872844,-0.041663975,-0.033016212,0.064847454,0.042964485,0.037008278,0.020748911,0.03713687,-0.003705088,0.057523526,-0.065575235,0.009547478,-0.031272512,0.06487157,-0.013486215,-0.06035353,0.010294548,-0.045367315,0.025122697,-0.04686525,0.010617784,0.030137468,-0.06202033,-0.04357254,-0.054113198,0.020134242,0.051502585,0.06625424,0.058840696,-0.06700961,0.06214006,-0.040978998,0.038672887,-0.04040787,0.038786005,0.0654551,-0.003941376,0.06296218,-0.035134282,-0.013404545,0.060250167,-0.06160751,-0.04268651,0.053544685,-0.052584227,-0.064724,-0.054220747,-0.031540673,-0.053736497,0.020945407,-0.002132653,-0.014884047,0.000453854,0.067027345,-0.05190082,0.016830977,0.044048134,-0.03758603,0.03925663,0.053871203,-0.021031033,0.012642303,0.021915289,0.038640484,-0.021722194,0.054772325,0.06380781,0.066562995,0.041986942,-0.030194862,0.043713514,-0.039891686,0.045160692,0.009929021,0.05692321,-0.010043438,-0.039871857,0.034588303,-0.065372564,0.05682735,0.004174022,-0.03440753,-0.015830645,-0.001966326,-0.06110193,-0.040132217,0.06651512,-0.007117376,0.046841677,-0.06353695,0.017707651,-0.045556214,-0.061123364,-0.043816548,-0.040961098,0.03969311,0.041371744,0.053890646,0.040890496,-0.033015992,-0.051067967,-0.002542467,-0.015387542,-0.051671296,0.06428408,-0.05713231,0.028714871,-0.040239785,0.002754724,-0.04677383,0.062166754,0.04111968,-0.052513573,-0.04218352,0.061134927,-0.052643232,-0.0635262,0.059383545,-0.015302249,-0.028589252,-0.010342869,0.020625427,-0.037369467,-0.061229292,-0.066992335,0.06339942,0.003095816,0.000736896,0.04099608,0.06535638,-0.009654814,0.020424025,0.049774274,-0.039730065,0.025255986,-0.049777713,0.05374328,0.053461757,0.048530664,0.026704442,-0.06693502,-0.06542865,-0.035268106,0.06261855,0.020404477,-0.0627452,0.019889278,0.007689285,-0.047506083,-8.90E-05,0.04168755,0.03525477,-0.06688355,0.046470772,-0.04736502,-0.05257494,0.010463846,-0.062487483,-0.051120844,-0.025223004,0.031947598,-0.050137382,0.06676046,-0.003974785,0.060580373,0.057381794,0.054725666,-0.03306968,0.039470665,-0.06656624,0.06614576,0.04759471,0.060107328,-0.047970407,0.013917103,-0.063460246,-0.06577198,0.056588233,0.037308987,0.006819385,0.052636933,-0.002336761,-0.060681388,-0.04917623,0.06422505,0.003182775,0.053290695,0.056874316,0.017781839,-0.029391157,0.048936848,0.051350642,0.05917061,-0.064274155,0.030986479,-0.06651407,0.059178878,0.017525284,0.008017819,0.013734274,0.021807045,-0.005198515,-0.037122265,0.05590131,0.04042647,-0.04135861,-0.0055

"Structure-Function Relationships of the Viral RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase: FIDELITY, REPLICATION SPEED, AND INITIATION MECHANISM DETERMINED BY A RESIDUE IN THE RIBOSE-BINDING POCKET","Studies of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from poliovirus (PV), 3Dpol, have shown that Asn-297 permits this enzyme to distinguish ribose from 2′-deoxyribose. All animal RNA viruses have Asn at the structurally homologous position of their polymerases, suggesting a conserved function for this residue. However, all prokaryotic RNA viruses have Glu at this position. In the presence of Mg(2+), the apparent affinity of Glu-297 3Dpol for 2′-deoxyribonucleotides was decreased by 6-fold relative to wild type without a substantial difference in the fidelity of 2′-dNMP incorporation. The fidelity of ribonucleotide misincorporation for Glu-297 3Dpol was reduced by 14-fold relative to wild type. A 4- to 11-fold reduction in the rate of ribonucleotide incorporation was observed. Glu-297 PV was unable to grow in HeLa cells due to a replication defect equivalent to that observed for a mutant PV encoding an inactive polymerase. Evaluation of the protein-(VPg)-primed initiation reaction showed that only half of the Glu-297 3Dpol initiation complexes were capable of producing VPg-pUpU product and that the overall yield of uridylylated VPg products was reduced by 20-fold relative to wild-type enzyme, a circumstance attributable to a reduced affinity for UTP. These studies identify the first RdRp derivative with a mutator phenotype and provide a mechanistic basis for the elevated mutation frequency of RNA phage relative to animal RNA viruses observed in culture.

The Glycoprotein Cytoplasmic Tail of Uukuniemi Virus (Bunyaviridae) Interacts with Ribonucleoproteins and Is Critical for Genome Packaging,"We have analyzed the importance of specific amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail of the glycoprotein G(N) for packaging of ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) into virus-like particles (VLPs) of Uukuniemi virus (UUK virus), a member of the Bunyaviridae family. In order to study packaging, we added the G(N)/G(C) glycoprotein precursor (p110) to a polymerase I-driven minigenome rescue system to generate VLPs that are released into the supernatant. These particles can infect new cells, and reporter gene expression can be detected. To determine the role of UUK virus glycoproteins in RNP packaging, we performed an alanine scan of the glycoprotein G(N) cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 1 to 81). First, we discovered three regions in the tail (amino acids 21 to 25, 46 to 50, and 71 to 81) which are important for minigenome transfer by VLPs. Further mutational analysis identified four amino acids that were important for RNP packaging. These amino acids are essential for the binding of nucleoproteins and RNPs to the glycoprotein without affecting the morphology of the particles. No segment-specific interactions between the RNA and the cytoplasmic tail could be observed. We propose that VLP systems are useful tools for analyzing protein-protein interactions important for packaging of viral genome segments, assembly, and budding of other members of the Bunyaviridae

Comparative Analysis of Twelve Genomes of Three Novel Group 2c and Group 2d Coronaviruses Reveals Unique Group and Subgroup Features,"Twelve complete genomes of three novel coronaviruses—bat coronavirus HKU4 (bat-CoV HKU4), bat-CoV HKU5 (putative group 2c), and bat-CoV HKU9 (putative group 2d)—were sequenced. Comparative genome analysis showed that the various open reading frames (ORFs) of the genomes of the three coronaviruses had significantly higher amino acid identities to those of other group 2 coronaviruses than group 1 and 3 coronaviruses. Phylogenetic trees constructed using chymotrypsin-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, spike, and nucleocapsid all showed that the group 2a and 2b and putative group 2c and 2d coronaviruses are more closely related to each other than to group 1 and 3 coronaviruses. Unique genomic features distinguishing between these four subgroups, including the number of papain-like proteases, the presence or absence of hemagglutinin esterase, small ORFs between the membrane and nucleocapsid genes and ORFs (NS7a and NS7b), bulged stem-loop and pseudoknot structures downstream of the nucleocapsid gene, transcription regulatory sequence, and ribosomal recognition signal for the envelope gene, were also observed. This is the first time that NS7a and NS7b downstream of the nucleocapsid gene has been found in a group 2 coronavirus. The high Ka/Ks ratio of NS7a and NS7b in bat-CoV HKU9 implies that these two group 2d-specific genes are under high selective pressure and hence are rapidly evolving. The four subgroups of group 2 coronaviruses probably originated from a common ancestor.

Characterization of White Bream Virus Reveals a Novel Genetic Cluster of Nidoviruses,"The order Nidovirales comprises viruses from the families Coronaviridae (genera Coronavirus and Torovirus), Roniviridae (genus Okavirus), and Arteriviridae (genus Arterivirus). In this study, we characterized White bream virus (WBV), a bacilliform plus-strand RNA virus isolated from fish. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence, organization, and expression of the 26.6-kb genome provided conclusive evidence for a phylogenetic relationship between WBV and nidoviruses. The polycistronic genome of WBV contains five open reading frames (ORFs), called ORF1a, -1b, -2, -3, and -4. In WBV-infected cells, three subgenomic RNAs expressing the structural proteins S, M, and N were identified. The subgenomic RNAs were revealed to share a 42-nucleotide, 5′ leader sequence that is identical to the 5′-terminal genome sequence. The data suggest that a conserved nonanucleotide sequence, CA(G/A)CACUAC, located downstream of the leader and upstream of the structural protein genes acts as the core transcription-regulating sequence element in WBV. Like other nidoviruses with large genomes (>26 kb), WBV encodes in its ORF1b an extensive set of enzymes, including putative polymerase, helicase, ribose methyltransferase, exoribonuclease, and endoribonuclease activities. ORF1a encodes several membrane domains, a putative ADP-ribose 1""-phosphatase, and a chymotrypsin-like serine protease whose activity was established in this study. Comparative sequence analysis revealed that WBV represents a separate cluster of nidoviruses that significantly diverged from toroviruses and, even more, from coronaviruses, roniviruses, and arteriviruses. The study adds to the amazing diversity of nidoviruses and appeals for a more extensive characterization of nonmammalian nidoviruses to better understand the evolution of these largest known RNA

Structural and Functional Basis for ADP-Ribose and Poly(ADP-Ribose) Binding by Viral Macro Domains,"Macro domains constitute a protein module family found associated with specific histones and proteins involved in chromatin metabolism. In addition, a small number of animal RNA viruses, such as corona- and toroviruses, alphaviruses, and hepatitis E virus, encode macro domains for which, however, structural and functional information is extremely limited. Here, we characterized the macro domains from hepatitis E virus, Semliki Forest virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV macro domain was determined at 1.8-Å resolution in complex with ADP-ribose. Information derived from structural, mutational, and sequence analyses suggests a close phylogenetic and, most probably, functional relationship between viral and cellular macro domain homologs. The data revealed that viral macro domains have relatively poor ADP-ribose 1""-phosphohydrolase activities (which were previously proposed to be their biologically relevant function) but bind efficiently free and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1-bound poly(ADP-ribose) in vitro. Collectively, these results suggest to further evaluate the role of viral macro domains in host response to viral infection.",-0.011985338,0.024313675,-0.033328425,-0.034375586,0.026942857,-0.035589796,-0.015691109,0.014323429,-0.03969214,0.016614987,0.061297804,0.010037457,-0.05138531,-0.05815734,0.04943586,-0.057335883,-0.061081547,-0.037109673,0.0492822,0.05074682,0.02383374,0.04587554,0.03074532,0.058747772,0.04874402,0.038151823,0.008615766,0.006440568,-0.044377588,-0.055256765,0.03757421,0.06130041,-0.038748942,-0.019597284,0.04915087,0.050182126,-0.05594149,0.058695473,-0.05179609,0.03281881,0.04398361,0.005576556,-0.027081044,0.017950423,0.049926642,-0.057813253,-0.044157136,0.038861345,0.048195485,-0.057725444,-0.04436461,-0.000233644,-0.0603357,0.001243079,-0.025904587,0.054683995,-0.03983494,-0.058846127,0.05513268,-0.059481192,-0.006483123,-0.04426057,0.020939462,0.057037044,0.060107518,-0.05995934,0.060370777,0.048335817,0.05725681,0.03790159,0.038095217,0.055356313,0.031533226,0.028684737,-0.004894865,-0.03286945,0.059163995,0.057262108,-0.05927718,0.033331692,-0.041822243,0.06011469,0.053954065,0.05700906,-0.008727342,0.0481111,0.001607427,0.003540265,-0.05111431,0.033396218,-0.048301455,0.004760381,-0.043903325,-0.012518168,0.057798743,0.03887033,0.058982205,0.06117942,0.060427945,-0.033020705,0.039070368,-0.031086702,-0.05884953,0.032632228,0.04785113,0.047878195,0.033382144,-0.05617586,-0.046801165,-0.05904051,-0.011200956,0.045403257,0.054224763,0.060687013,0.05845405,0.02318773,-0.061071504,0.04173247,0.03208348,-0.05243492,-0.045971196,0.036534414,0.033543624,-0.031068353,0.058925122,-0.024048362,-0.001009465,-0.025645355,0.038054857,-0.041203983,-0.027411232,0.06130872,0.052026093,0.043995705,0.054839134,-0.03404995,-0.003982015,0.020594444,-0.060721625,-0.056940515,-0.0443793,0.061308086,-0.050430134,-0.04138111,-0.051141884,-0.06109433,0.046856068,-0.027179293,-0.019109974,-0.04916435,-0.028336735,-0.060997415,-0.054613158,0.039603055,0.06124108,0.015475034,0.016950704,0.015840897,0.048256703,0.023642635,-0.022207048,-0.053155165,0.001541786,0.038286205,0.013337574,-0.047129113,-0.05829527,0.003764676,-0.05944073,-0.05659625,0.039049778,-0.036726203,-0.024548879,0.035573807,0.018428884,0.051924095,0.048142128,-0.0302175,0.058208477,-0.000790613,0.03603007,0.06031914,-0.059248805,0.053016588,0.048480194,-0.04693908,-0.06096662,0.02418933,0.059435584,0.01126945,0.051966734,0.034790058,-0.022177167,0.026873397,0.06053256,-0.03204523,0.051410735,0.058177,-0.038448475,-0.002670759,-0.059759226,0.059599385,-0.042965923,0.026125805,0.017097048,-0.060124453,-0.01575019,0.060290135,0.036644652,0.061188217,0.003396297,0.059229966,0.004322187,0.0423904,-0.054758042,-0.03304044,0.057845812,0.017759532,-0.008300961,0.031046348,-0.018068584,0.03402077,0.055312045,-0.039230164,-0.059968784,0.008178618,-0.053535417,-0.049082603,0.020074287,0.058770493,0.060414575,0.051047582,0.050013836,-0.06105117,0.060674906,0.03141181,0.034676548,-0.060934316,-0.006272661,0.022026379,0.026998283,0.01857351,-0.006935944,-0.011587389,0.02311576,-0.049183674,0.03605418,0.011417907,0.05728603,-0.050435346,-0.06116197,0.025860546,-0.03665853,-0.040414643,0.058610052,-0.012794956,0.023063608,0.061308824,-0.04415528,0.03671718,0.053107265,0.060547125,0.023470558,0.052720573,0.055528738,-0.049089637,0.023586828,-0.055268113,-0.054229807,0.001061196,0.015996506,0.059821684,-0.051901914,0.047177095,0.04465638,-0.061122704,0.051221386,0.02478385,0.06073813,-0.054632593,-0.021707999,-0.01794186,0.03536428,0.056102894,0.003947767,-0.010251608,-0.044338,-0.021589398,-0.056314778,-0.042591013,0.06022473,0.014474265,0.05642473,0.030297656,0.000322701,-0.04108253,0.014118966,-0.05867867,-0.060927257,0.039972015,-0.05905956,0.061132208,0.035709374,0.041590612,-0.0508811,0.056342784,-0.035541367,-0.016699621,0.027276767,-0.056926522,0.039187144,0.02290051,0.014153435,0.009124981,0.05020544,-0.04524683,0.019471677,-0.041293353,0.044370264,-0.054169107,-0.028817773,-0.005500293,-0.013518487,-0.059473705,-0.03625566,0.050332937,-0.058932997,-0.055168375,-0.02789673,-0.000526021,-0.036928777,0.036085777,-0.039176855,0.06014484,-0.04114022,-0.03760433,0.06060919,-0.05234253,0.05018485,-0.03711904,0.047609214,-0.05482232,0.060921796,-0.013611672,-0.06127315,-0.061105922,0.045601305,-0.013108947,-0.037339624,-0.057995852,-0.033812042,-0.045047604,0.012223542,0.05459777,-0.016062092,-0.04353232,-0.061298776,-0.033653945,0.054611053,-0.020295765,-0.007611453,-0.059069317,-0.0602907,0.030548424,0.005209233,-0.037999127,0.061066,-0.055453192,0.057399783,-0.04059612,-0.030582426,0.031114006,0.033889946,-0.061117634,0.058103986,0.012192547,0.007446376,0.049882602,0.04280275,-0.050007917,-0.05953835,0.05822896,-0.023524119,0.051768143,-0.005083385,-0.018930526,-0.0457339,-0.061101247,0.05478527,0.05726306,0.052601773,0.042477123,0.04395316,-0.025089111,-0.017999278,0.005352584,-0.002329382,-0.05716259,0.047469463,0.004633205,-0.022202047,0.008244296,0.0504993,-0.0143356,0.050263576,0.050035145,-0.05370058,0.04674254,0.046237484,0.026471242,0.05050442,-0.045

Generation and Analysis of Infectious Virus-Like Particles of Uukuniemi Virus (Bunyaviridae): a Useful System for Studying Bunyaviral Packaging and Budding,"In the present report we describe an infectious virus-like particle (VLP) system for the Uukuniemi (UUK) virus, a member of the Bunyaviridae family. It utilizes our recently developed reverse genetic system based on the RNA polymerase I minigenome system for UUK virus used to study replication, encapsidation, and transcription by monitoring reporter gene expression. Here, we have added the glycoprotein precursor expression plasmid together with the minigenome, nucleoprotein, and polymerase to generate VLPs, which incorporate the minigenome and are released into the supernatant. The particles are able to infect new cells, and reporter gene expression can be monitored if the trans-acting viral proteins (RNA polymerase and nucleoprotein) are also expressed in these cells. No minigenome transfer occurred in the absence of glycoproteins, demonstrating that the glycoproteins are absolutely required for the generation of infectious particles. Moreover, expression of glycoproteins alone was sufficient to produce and release VLPs. We show that the ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) are incorporated into VLPs but are not required for the generation of particles. Morphological analysis of the particles by electron microscopy revealed that VLPs, either with or without minigenomes, display a surface morphology indistinguishable from that of the authentic UUK virus and that they bud into Golgi vesicles in the same way as UUK virus does. This infectious VLP system will be very useful for studying the bunyaviral structural components required for budding and packaging of RNPs and receptor binding and may also be useful for the development of new vaccines for the human pathogens from this

Prevalence and Genetic Diversity of Coronaviruses in Bats from China,"Coronaviruses can infect a variety of animals including poultry, livestock, and humans and are currently classified into three groups. The interspecies transmissions of coronaviruses between different hosts form a complex ecosystem of which little is known. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the recent identification of new coronaviruses have highlighted the necessity for further investigation of coronavirus ecology, in particular the role of bats and other wild animals. In this study, we sampled bat populations in 15 provinces of China and reveal that approximately 6.5% of the bats, from diverse species distributed throughout the region, harbor coronaviruses. Full genomes of four coronavirues from bats were sequenced and analyzed. Phylogenetic analyses of the spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleoprotein structural proteins and the two conserved replicase domains, putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA helicase, revealed that bat coronaviruses cluster in three different groups: group 1, another group that includes all SARS and SARS-like coronaviruses (putative group 4), and an independent bat coronavirus group (putative group 5). Further genetic analyses showed that different species of bats maintain coronaviruses from different groups and that a single bat species from different geographic locations supports similar coronaviruses. Thus, the findings of this study suggest that bats may play an integral role in the ecology and evolution of coronaviruses.",-0.040133998,0.0413369,-0.045785993,-0.038694844,0.046677172,0.02197875,0.05061272,-0.040189013,-0.059772756,0.005351377,0.061607733,0.04865495,0.028565295,-0.018647444,0.008395303,-0.05815845,0.044849586,-0.043946363,-0.013046836,-0.053511374,-0.047389004,0.039194744,-0.050557557,0.055908196,-0.016701855,0.057584353,0.054419737,-0.001960683,0.036294464,-0.054624323,0.016121035,0.023354542,-0.055010557,0.036120337,-0.004967711,0.003511084,-0.021750722,0.05898223,-0.060536508,-0.039277427,0.05524017,0.05445442,0.051995978,-0.044052776,-0.061608266,-0.043547187,-0.03099339,-0.05883304,-0.028021159,-0.050047066,0.06159407,0.022411428,-0.05946091,-0.05661541,-0.001060611,0.02154829,-0.060949676,-0.004885768,0.05015413,-0.060423765,-0.045588598,-0.05988979,-0.025570009,-0.01908041,0.045946833,-0.06057949,0.057882033,-0.058622077,0.0612062,-0.027679807,-0.058930267,0.05844864,0.048597798,0.061078236,-0.044224355,0.056225218,0.009014563,-0.026233967,-0.02161429,0.060391314,-0.010265059,0.061531864,0.059958007,-0.057767138,-0.028340232,0.026968895,-0.00995155,-0.007819936,-0.05054074,0.007009366,-0.043668117,-0.02221782,0.02697576,0.04036279,-0.017191635,0.06157036,0.0581791,0.06140862,0.061601635,0.045524552,-0.025401285,0.007125383,-0.000555765,0.058845513,-0.039490614,0.056484804,0.059537996,0.024335444,-0.026905356,-0.022980507,0.060322084,0.047704037,0.028642472,0.043284364,0.05307117,0.049924552,-0.060586613,0.04386435,0.058639172,0.038710125,-0.019243417,0.057049118,-0.015887812,-0.06036528,0.057055257,0.054706283,0.057311635,0.025657171,-0.044894658,-0.012953144,0.002484728,0.06160689,0.0569311,-0.005011576,-0.031005597,0.031687163,0.007335376,0.042247474,-0.056693386,-0.042588476,0.048468903,0.061606888,-0.05799613,0.009672785,0.027323328,-0.03426922,0.05306081,-0.055194978,0.05672031,0.06026052,0.060934868,-0.052840274,-0.04865735,-0.047252826,0.061468363,-0.0554554,-0.045920312,0.04702366,0.03731924,0.045655612,0.024233745,-0.015676878,0.002137779,0.061550524,0.016623849,0.04287574,-0.046834137,-0.003416718,-0.060775723,-0.040135376,0.054533392,0.05729467,-0.053666756,0.060198724,0.03987746,0.017859753,0.017196037,-0.009528932,0.05295746,0.002454078,0.059726447,0.055003535,-0.020752765,-0.029588375,0.029736888,-0.00505975,-0.0548256,-0.04015328,0.04843382,-0.042474043,0.054176684,-0.046493303,-0.05647867,0.038669296,0.060995247,-0.05861582,0.053525407,-0.015114127,-0.044320196,-0.041915826,-0.058726564,0.048178904,-0.004477159,0.05146037,0.030118335,-0.04061694,0.024877599,0.061608285,0.026824115,0.058137756,0.02167398,0.06160843,0.058913447,0.060336903,-0.04779939,0.055223618,0.06136394,0.044033516,-0.04770351,0.006351527,0.051116444,-0.03635328,0.050299246,-0.041224975,-0.018462602,-0.054699425,-0.050933726,-0.061063454,0.055660944,0.06021215,0.05138226,0.054779854,0.051776335,-0.06159969,0.038673896,0.015205471,0.029843675,-0.03245896,0.01773857,0.00285882,0.037368145,-0.024254018,-0.060613237,-0.05534165,-0.045224935,-0.014540521,-0.008215769,0.025372148,0.043240223,0.010245697,0.040796738,0.005785213,0.041675244,0.016450748,0.059775352,-0.025689887,-0.029640479,0.06160831,0.03857968,-0.05289325,0.048452534,0.024435544,-0.04173011,0.047522508,0.014368998,-0.002985836,0.051797025,0.008000216,-0.0464636,0.028565168,0.02912502,0.061442263,-0.016837593,0.05746435,-0.055290174,-0.057153046,0.050933495,0.032460965,0.05784223,0.031826954,-0.04112364,-0.04373178,-0.049336396,0.06119847,0.034115795,-0.022154251,0.04395802,0.061607312,-0.00881645,-0.049415343,0.060815867,-0.034225896,0.061378673,-0.01636224,0.01899298,-0.036304608,0.033056535,-0.057151362,-0.061607894,0.04349374,0.004663885,-0.04447281,0.056886557,0.000541834,-0.060744155,-0.057863932,0.05050562,-0.044829376,0.000613453,-0.039588194,0.053542648,0.005659298,-0.057532832,-0.04315418,0.049675815,-0.059546787,0.05454458,-0.024816671,0.061606128,-0.033809174,-0.0550536,0.025306571,0.058624137,-0.0614977,-0.058963,0.022194875,-0.014856955,-0.049333364,-0.000546736,-0.049283583,0.055930097,0.057694517,-0.037744664,0.05782181,0.022611177,0.01295739,0.05988904,0.034282465,-0.04841377,0.031054242,0.03697908,0.055143856,0.058676377,0.03487411,-0.061425786,-0.061401334,0.004488466,0.037844967,-0.01821435,-0.06077138,-0.028608289,0.055622272,0.04763002,-0.017456645,0.028819682,0.050615143,-0.061605636,0.015988834,0.052827243,-0.036211308,0.051017076,0.027520122,-0.05995784,0.006311868,-0.03496201,-0.045609325,0.06151867,0.02208288,0.06092447,-0.008598666,-0.0396899,-0.051656414,0.03351479,-0.059287608,0.060423933,0.00480092,0.060545847,0.043585602,0.05326749,-0.034498136,-0.013067205,0.025803793,0.044748373,0.059607144,0.005156414,-0.031953502,-0.049637955,-0.05029725,-0.03266894,0.052749507,0.006316781,0.059448857,0.017898291,-0.04215779,-0.054508045,0.05861853,0.002616253,-0.03362344,0.008625287,0.024326026,-0.051623967,0.013636745,-0.010638478,0.012391462,0.011231614,-0.021293737,-0.041853078,-0.040207613,0.044686794,-0.060668252,0.03741

Nuclear Localization of Flavivirus RNA Synthesis in Infected Cells,"Flaviviral replication is believed to be exclusively cytoplasmic, occurring within virus-induced membrane-bound replication complexes in the host cytoplasm. Here we show that a significant proportion (20%) of the total RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity from cells infected with West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and dengue virus is resident within the nucleus. Consistent with this, the major replicase proteins NS3 and NS5 of JEV also localized within the nucleus. NS5 was found distributed throughout the nucleoplasm, but NS3 was present at sites of active flaviviral RNA synthesis, colocalizing with NS5, and visible as distinct foci along the inner periphery of the nucleus by confocal and immunoelectron microscopy. Both these viral replicase proteins were also present in the nuclear matrix, colocalizing with the peripheral lamina, and revealed a well-entrenched nuclear location for the viral replication complex. In keeping with this observation, antibodies to either NS3 or NS5 coimmunoprecipitated the other protein from isolated nuclei along with newly synthesized viral RNA. Taken together these data suggest an absolute requirement for both of the replicase proteins for nucleus-localized synthesis of flavivirus RNA. Thus, we conclusively demonstrate for the first time that the host cell nucleus functions as an additional site for the presence of functionally active flaviviral replicase

Rapid Detection of Norovirus from Fecal Specimens by Real-Time Reverse Transcription-Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay,"In this study, we developed a one-step, single-tube genogroup-specific reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the detection of norovirus (NoV) genomes targeting from the C terminus of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene to the capsid N-terminal/shell domain region. This is the first report on the development of an RT-LAMP assay for the detection of NoV genomes. Because of the diversity of NoV genotypes, we used 9 and 13 specially designed primers containing mixed bases for genogroup I (GI) and II (GII), respectively. The RT-LAMP assay had the advantages of rapidity, simplicity, specificity, and selectively and could obtain results within 90 min, generally even within 60 min, under isothermal conditions at 62°C. The detection limits for NoV genomes were between 10(2) and 10(3) copies/tube for GI and GII with differentiation by genotype, and no cross-reactions among NoV GI and GII and other gastroenteritis viruses, such as sapovirus, human astrovirus, adenovirus type 40 and 41, and group A and C rotavirus, were found. In the evaluation tests with fecal specimens obtained from gastroenteritis outbreaks, the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay with regard to RT-PCR were 100 and 94% for GI and 100 and 100% for GII, respectively. These findings establish that the RT-LAMP assay is potentially useful for the rapid detection of NoV genomes from fecal specimens in outbreaks of food-borne and person-to-person-transmitted gastroenteritis.",-0.042241886,-0.025306245,-0.060640104,-0.014635088,0.059973806,0.057600036,-0.009214168,-0.04699784,0.027944032,0.054919463,0.062886156,-0.050549775,0.050527845,0.03491996,-0.035279024,-0.05909232,-0.062240746,0.016629314,0.061866045,0.021389524,-0.035353623,-0.05616978,-0.0597733,0.03629444,0.05922292,0.053259954,0.01061048,0.009024852,0.021350035,0.03980407,0.059925325,0.0626115,0.03928265,-0.009492658,0.041886285,0.019245107,-0.061802227,-0.05346375,-0.042994846,-0.05303256,0.037701864,-0.022176038,-0.043201704,-0.04754879,0.001935038,0.046849888,-0.019750217,-0.026222307,0.06022153,-0.028783578,-0.046846777,0.04575027,-0.0628098,-0.059419688,-0.057350468,0.044711374,-0.061079077,0.050504055,0.005885517,-0.02679784,0.048619445,0.01633259,0.042199932,-0.057936,-0.035007384,-0.061891813,0.0610466,-0.005526977,0.020656126,-0.043814562,0.03128619,0.017680876,0.055082954,0.06227053,-0.04902262,0.03808351,0.043783035,-0.010979611,-0.06238936,0.052500978,-0.04837481,0.062205505,0.057708595,0.01767476,0.022146495,0.059762068,-0.012807102,-0.036453754,-0.034626864,-0.03139939,0.031861007,-0.048698492,-0.0525557,0.03986358,0.053793292,0.05389955,0.056340374,0.060644787,0.062435288,-0.001519896,-0.060263872,0.03735017,0.048286837,0.05736931,0.060144093,-0.05199825,0.05277282,0.013886966,-0.034641676,-0.045837816,0.04793182,0.030285643,0.055637076,0.05129581,0.045438588,-0.021078754,-0.055703077,0.05711341,-0.029300539,0.010945085,-0.017951416,-0.030168505,-0.02865995,-0.03151311,0.054466575,0.05531031,0.059507426,0.047733262,0.018503338,0.021767791,0.009952215,0.06292324,0.060504675,-0.015474606,-0.021883857,-0.049383067,-0.013814441,0.033461135,-0.020476956,-0.00201926,-0.015046941,0.06292322,-0.05960569,0.008268865,-0.009786955,-0.026992876,-0.031820316,-0.062022403,0.05901435,0.021294454,0.052650884,-0.013127009,-0.060183983,-0.038281605,0.06288777,0.05663719,0.055495545,0.052048553,0.007894577,0.030367265,0.009737719,0.03837287,-0.041995764,0.045494825,-0.03534727,0.038641416,-0.053958293,0.013851891,-0.054107178,-0.03131043,0.000892972,-0.008711028,-0.027447173,-0.039179165,-0.048652835,0.01289612,0.036131527,-0.006359221,0.04352658,0.04009408,0.028910398,0.005438971,0.011230147,-0.001869113,0.060609728,0.00148245,-0.04796906,-0.025334015,-0.030619876,0.029158913,0.062909506,-0.061855823,-0.024525555,0.037737004,0.061553024,-0.055988267,0.01245155,-0.024853965,0.026321752,-0.058927935,-0.045191277,0.052437276,-0.023557412,0.06251348,0.03285232,-0.057675704,-0.009549534,0.054823346,0.02768875,0.06012394,-0.010600896,0.012281853,-0.039646212,0.0625865,-0.061978865,-0.007169632,0.049308702,0.025713319,0.010956598,-0.013596546,0.041152127,-0.013330733,-0.014262914,-0.054288357,-0.036975693,0.04765047,-0.06154501,-0.04095469,-0.038945533,0.030172102,0.06021927,0.06181826,0.054321498,-0.06292097,0.032843485,0.0514223,0.04838833,-0.0514506,0.000346726,0.03999556,0.04710196,0.05111923,-0.046176683,-0.06005421,0.061985306,0.034912247,0.008286532,-0.05276585,0.053535208,-0.058446802,-0.008057321,0.005471279,-0.026965845,0.046868216,0.024215253,0.036695555,-0.059694547,0.062923424,0.05621011,0.05385633,0.05480904,-0.004586754,-0.059067454,0.05941403,-0.010124893,-0.024825657,-0.04042744,0.05124239,-0.01367387,0.048977215,0.048223436,0.06235882,-0.03628293,0.013103269,-0.047364935,-0.060748644,-0.027051544,-0.047419548,0.062154233,0.04440668,-0.062564336,-0.050105628,-0.058525022,0.044083677,0.01703317,-0.056562174,-0.043646425,0.062212326,-0.061283417,0.05631448,0.06289641,-0.022935119,0.048469774,0.02371345,0.026793014,-0.055569492,-0.002948319,-0.003495217,-0.06172824,0.04874175,-0.023799827,0.061873008,0.059618425,0.000766927,-0.057987798,0.0396294,-0.00441054,-0.055690814,0.049942624,-0.036477644,0.044067044,0.036356207,0.05965103,-0.05993085,0.062362645,-0.036535874,-0.009203144,0.050766673,0.053355753,0.04333975,-0.05193018,0.06170942,0.05602396,-0.041422848,-0.04559454,0.035903588,-0.03488609,-0.048771333,-0.06265696,-0.0432773,0.060308035,-0.031469334,0.054464445,0.062844664,0.057300676,0.022498608,0.058876347,-0.043150876,0.036792297,-0.022010341,0.001033449,0.011427237,0.062453143,0.046641666,-0.06287097,-0.062831186,0.048415713,0.059068374,-0.041117392,-0.059888773,0.012109218,0.03826429,-0.026516214,0.045253888,0.058696553,-0.021487653,-0.06291397,-0.023858467,-0.020744983,-0.06270731,0.055301636,-0.052621406,-0.06178023,-0.04784473,0.036424987,-0.04038953,0.061677538,0.055603597,0.032018322,0.024247007,-0.03148749,-0.027709791,-0.002240494,-0.06286926,0.057731524,-0.029475052,-0.046593864,-0.031787768,-0.03772879,-0.055585507,-0.049756132,0.031844232,-0.033879943,-0.038807664,-0.061230473,-0.034969635,-0.055739786,-0.052156497,0.053012185,0.014719964,0.0132726,0.058340326,0.05513252,-0.002295154,0.010661134,0.01929668,0.0203207,-0.06279726,0.03210036,-0.05766695,-0.027052654,0.054653186,-0.036640473,0.014916381,-0.026664471,-0.045577243,-0.04869987,-0.019003127,0.05007277,0.038066294,-0.04

Bovine Coronavirus 5′-Proximal Genomic Acceptor Hotspot for Discontinuous Transcription Is 65 Nucleotides Wide,"Coronaviruses are positive-strand, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-utilizing viruses that require a polymerase template switch, characterized as discontinuous transcription, to place a 5′-terminal genomic leader onto subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs). The usually precise switch is thought to occur during the synthesis of negative-strand templates for sgmRNA production and to be directed by heptameric core donor sequences within the genome that match an acceptor core (UCUAAAC in the case of bovine coronavirus) near the 3′ end of the 5′-terminal genomic leader. Here it is shown that a 22-nucleotide (nt) donor sequence engineered into a packageable bovine coronavirus defective interfering (DI) RNA and made to match a sequence within the 65-nt virus genomic leader caused a template switch yielding an sgmRNA with only a 33-nt minileader. By changing the donor sequence, acceptor sites between genomic nt 33 and 97 (identical between the DI RNA and the viral genome) could be used to generate sgmRNAs detectable by Northern analysis (∼2 to 32 molecules per cell) by 24 h postinfection. Whether the switch was intramolecular only was not determined since a potentially distinguishing acceptor region in the DI RNA rapidly conformed to that in the helper virus genome through a previously described template switch known as leader switching. These results show that crossover acceptor sites for discontinuous transcription (i) need not include the UCUAAAC core and (ii) rest within a surprisingly wide 5′-proximal “hotspot.” Overlap of this hotspot with that for leader switching and with elements required for RNA replication suggests that it is part of a larger 5′-proximal multifunctional structure.",-0.004699934,-0.051389728,-0.059501737,-0.042437468,0.04469012,0.030334305,0.047268137,0.044679984,0.058866594,0.03972714,0.06198813,-0.040464874,-0.015641782,0.022956,0.054899666,-0.051139086,-0.05400947,-0.05381908,0.04086001,0.05085825,-0.060694054,0.056336142,-0.053100996,0.05495301,-0.0085277,0.015273787,0.061335236,0.022424404,-0.053405777,-0.050115224,0.05774803,0.047795825,-0.031367637,-0.04085549,0.04270651,0.044578653,-0.058055498,0.0588606,-0.06168425,0.054622553,0.052257262,-0.04860287,0.04228484,-0.060700953,0.039951988,-0.013834856,-0.014586243,-0.04517173,-0.018127056,-0.060368,-0.035945226,0.044634137,-0.0530063,-0.056476247,-0.003309103,-0.022637682,-0.058683567,-0.011401449,0.059370298,-0.060218096,0.06028388,-0.008039031,-0.02039225,-0.054709397,-0.051768336,-0.061018076,0.054945417,-0.047849722,0.06007229,-0.05987451,8.53E-05,0.055502675,0.028714878,0.061343275,-0.007132421,-0.03753058,0.061421677,0.029335855,-0.05054885,0.05248108,-0.055873863,0.061853044,-0.046295088,0.026829386,-0.057260323,0.05911342,0.01392028,0.032661792,-0.038119245,0.019243157,-0.006991104,-0.03759003,-0.052173518,0.02435045,-0.03276289,0.050601214,0.04717661,0.054737918,0.061877582,-0.03578653,0.005928227,0.039602336,-0.022319192,0.012025202,-0.042675707,0.05872444,0.057968892,-0.007535102,-0.001116131,-0.017323412,-0.046276715,0.004698676,0.042902652,0.056492988,0.059125073,0.028365871,-0.061664402,0.02384992,-0.001762944,0.050600044,-0.06075964,0.06040692,0.051106043,-0.048732873,0.058741465,0.034489732,-0.01838535,-0.040722415,-0.01387223,0.027368857,-0.000135919,0.06218942,0.060739554,0.013008133,-0.040710237,-0.052822474,-0.047098983,0.048516706,-0.06086475,0.007812029,-0.054185733,0.062237713,-0.062016673,-0.023941465,-0.027778499,-0.052754957,-0.01705722,-0.05985158,0.04324741,0.053399544,-0.028083839,-0.058431156,-0.05766665,-0.05235416,0.062235218,0.047658555,-0.04474746,0.059374772,0.053039413,0.020172445,-0.058687948,-0.044255488,-0.04836708,0.05885615,0.019684218,0.051992863,-0.059396338,0.040865954,-0.015841588,-0.047984827,0.032310978,0.04089145,-0.001547339,-0.031108364,0.055962827,0.008042412,-0.012788459,0.024687618,0.057891756,-0.047817927,0.024132317,-0.027219784,-0.009107957,0.05897629,0.0581368,-0.01344516,-0.06091126,0.058502655,-0.002837092,-0.02594704,0.057503596,-0.056651145,0.018430825,-0.022710318,0.060685642,-0.02143846,0.056482423,0.014817487,-0.027155574,-0.011387851,-0.030179882,0.04912274,-0.04679081,0.027306238,0.061274894,-0.005568716,0.015328909,0.054795444,-0.007969628,0.062206537,-0.017597353,0.061231237,0.060626887,0.05391922,-0.060486477,-0.05219439,0.039943814,0.04646827,-0.041592073,0.056645088,0.03710219,-0.017634029,-0.030522311,0.046435036,0.042405423,-0.044578806,-0.061386533,-0.049324855,0.038675137,0.037766144,-0.051959306,-0.04109455,0.020451078,-0.062237747,0.06020083,0.06060248,0.056991827,-0.061630998,-0.039561503,0.03429783,0.057581723,-0.049544595,-0.055200804,-0.041463897,0.060513724,-0.025154794,-0.022919072,0.055847127,0.030357799,-0.049460378,-0.06221912,0.02108614,0.03885557,0.011910446,0.060837444,-0.043666586,-0.045844387,0.06223787,-0.03872928,0.009956894,-0.002814513,0.053579815,0.05439872,0.027037315,0.00428245,0.011209067,0.000363335,-0.004204238,0.005969342,0.028617045,0.050736707,0.0616654,0.005086056,0.05784467,0.05230241,-0.02190398,-0.022640299,0.056163598,0.06211637,-0.012427431,-0.05337864,-0.05585138,-0.0599012,0.05896391,-0.023698792,-0.04733364,-0.060676873,0.05115537,-0.05731201,-0.053983543,0.06221483,-0.057050455,0.060533516,-0.004580862,0.005629376,-0.052956633,-0.046073195,0.03910889,-0.061584447,-0.030302264,-0.05877407,0.060706068,0.041428648,0.029928554,-0.040178202,0.03743838,-0.00208171,-0.060437378,0.038605604,-0.017605038,0.059197437,-0.043337528,0.043965362,-0.06018586,0.058753617,0.044040147,0.04210104,-0.020513793,0.047273993,-0.056357797,-0.049047727,0.008011571,0.001706253,-0.060692955,-0.020491147,-0.018033799,-0.052466124,-0.053307682,0.015520847,0.00060101,0.005832701,0.007437108,-0.017991066,0.059376597,0.038640544,-0.019446932,0.05732711,0.011329274,0.058343865,-0.014510857,-0.004944809,-0.048670914,0.059149023,-0.011998102,-0.06223593,-0.054584436,-0.022603363,0.03881685,0.001606229,-0.039131586,0.000533207,0.044615917,-0.057800565,0.045331445,0.032223366,-0.0498734,-0.062235594,-0.056128956,0.03775323,-0.054623775,0.040104635,-0.059393425,-0.055827748,0.029889109,0.020422013,0.012707948,0.062175784,0.061053697,0.06054171,-0.025253683,-0.0318794,-0.03151587,-0.04730705,-0.062235624,0.055962328,0.025230348,0.05394393,-0.01039332,-0.010033969,-0.06039237,-0.05862835,0.054439683,0.04514898,0.018128235,0.034436148,-0.04238279,-0.058828603,-0.05802493,0.047816165,0.01820757,-0.049383607,0.004443579,0.05736402,-0.025253624,-0.050329193,0.05662286,-0.021431733,-0.06048751,0.04695593,-0.0511352,0.019981856,-0.04474249,0.009341049,0.045922205,0.027364839,-0.04380359,-0.024505468,0.025718613,0.047126465,0.009484479

Surveillance of respiratory virus infections in adult hospital admissions using rapid methods,"Both influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cause epidemics of respiratory illness of variable severity during the winter season. Influenza in particular has been blamed for hospital winter bed pressures, although it is thought that RSV may also play a role. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a new respiratory virus reported to be important in children; only a limited number of studies are available for adult populations. We aimed to determine initially the burden of virologically confirmed infections, i.e. influenza, RSV and hMPV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology and, in addition, to assess the feasibility of this approach as a surveillance tool for these respiratory viruses. Adult patients admitted to hospital in the previous 24 hours with onset of acute respiratory symptoms in the last 14 days were asked to participate. Informed written consent was obtained and nose and throat swabs taken. Multiplex PCR for influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), influenza B and RSV A and B were carried out together with a separate PCR for hMPV. A total of 219 patients in 2001–2002 and 216 in 2002–2003 were tested and the combined results for both seasons were: 8 positive for influenza A/H1N1, 14 for influenza A/H3N2, 2 for influenza B, 14 for RSV A and 6 for RSV B. Most patients (261/435) were >65 years and most positives (30/44) were found within this age group. A number of patients aged >65 years who were positive for influenza (12/15) reported having had vaccine. In total, 373 samples were tested for hMPV and 20 were found positive across all age groups except the 45–54 years age group. As influenza activity was low during the study period the impact of infection on admissions could not be assessed. Nevertheless the viruses studied accounted for 15% of hospital admissions for respiratory infection. Most patients were aged >65 years, as expected. In the two years studied RSV and hMPV were each responsible for as many hospitalized cases of respiratory infection as influenza. Influenza infection must be considered even in those who give a history of vaccination. The molecular methods used in this study showed that surveillance of these respiratory viruses can be conducted and may help in the management of

Identification of 5′ and 3′ cis-Acting Elements of the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus: Acquisition of Novel 5′ AU-Rich Sequences Restored Replication of a 5′-Proximal 7-Nucleotide Deletion Mutant,"We here demonstrate the successful engineering of the RNA genome of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) by using an infectious cDNA as a bacterial artificial chromosome. Runoff transcription from this cDNA by SP6 polymerase resulted in capped synthetic RNAs bearing authentic 5′ and 3′ ends of the viral genome that had specific infectivities of >5 × 10(5) PFU/μg of RNA. The synthetic viruses recovered from the transfected cells were genotypically and phenotypically indistinguishable from the parental virus. Using our system, a series of genomic RNAs with nucleotide deletions in their 5′ ends produced viruses with decreased or no infectivity. Various pseudorevertants were isolated, and acquisition of novel 5′ sequences of various sizes, composed predominantly of A and U bases, restored their infectivities, providing a novel insight into functional elements of the 5′ end of the PRRSV genome. In addition, our system was further engineered to generate a panel of self-replicating, self-limiting, luciferase-expressing PRRSV viral replicons bearing various deletions. Analysis of these replicons revealed the presence and location of a 3′ cis-acting element in the genome that was required for replication. Moreover, we produced enhanced green fluorescent protein-expressing infectious viruses, which indicates that the PRRSV cDNA/viral replicon/recombinant virus can be developed as a vector for the expression of a variety of heterologous genes. Thus, our PRRSV reverse genetics system not only offers a means of directly investigating the molecular mechanisms of PRRSV replication and pathogenesis but also can be used to generate new heterologous gene expression vectors and genetically defined antiviral vaccines.",-0.046665464,-0.031115431,-0.018548535,-0.029601136,0.013979786,0.060292862,0.045803327,-0.03412296,-0.014174159,0.007143111,0.06116919,-0.045107182,-0.027228767,0.04124812,0.058194134,-0.061075646,-0.06114452,-0.060315743,0.056619037,0.014306473,-0.05561551,0.035315227,-0.05885413,0.061136935,-0.00905335,0.014974131,0.059625402,-0.04278727,0.056639064,-0.032119855,0.060861006,0.061171252,-0.054444104,-0.038163554,0.058783337,0.03619728,-0.05895326,0.036591534,-0.06030106,-0.003440926,0.043288182,-0.056520827,0.03612386,-0.03927965,0.016201044,-0.058000058,-0.04583544,-0.019583678,0.044906225,0.005063577,-0.015792642,0.04268933,-0.06090727,0.001962198,-0.059356045,-0.0350211,-0.054064643,0.010475545,0.052585665,-0.009893679,0.006904942,-0.003261132,0.013333348,0.025097918,0.022979861,-0.06065807,0.06039171,-0.049965117,0.042417325,-0.028365972,-0.011473887,0.057861272,0.039426,0.05956568,-0.059067648,0.011533606,0.060978606,-0.006249541,-0.060967457,0.052632555,-0.036573943,0.061038155,0.033892285,-0.032472454,-0.054393873,0.05951305,-0.040778752,-0.035338547,-0.046528395,-0.030890107,0.001498335,-0.037273623,-0.036735173,0.034198023,-0.00396166,0.058860987,0.05641231,0.061125055,0.061161708,-0.0254377,-0.044315007,-0.049910285,-0.054884218,0.004525569,-0.000893607,0.038206868,0.057503037,-0.02607697,0.04916076,0.015377808,-0.007963165,0.04174161,-0.023841929,0.036137827,0.06010459,-0.015063589,-0.060120784,-0.027466428,-0.021872167,0.007414354,-0.057848375,0.0610478,0.038906574,-0.056417998,0.025009226,0.051942654,0.000235995,-0.03826635,-0.024038022,0.017842708,-0.013224033,0.06117139,0.056959927,-0.022792945,-0.041947722,-0.021366354,-0.024455922,0.054478887,-0.037848443,-0.00088169,-0.023183621,0.06117094,-0.05962208,-0.044957925,-0.007016934,-0.06075345,0.034830935,-0.060863137,0.05718396,0.04001189,0.04177351,-0.06041858,-0.058608633,-0.043668054,0.06117099,-0.012801484,0.05527812,0.053666044,0.038501404,0.0409258,-0.00960707,-0.04794302,0.00649402,0.06006519,-0.04099511,-0.038045008,-0.060544614,-0.042416267,-0.05340633,-0.06086358,-0.048420995,-0.00602092,-0.05573741,0.05172911,0.02245951,0.03546985,0.010820734,0.048994794,0.06036033,-0.01570266,0.045427233,-0.017514564,0.022060445,0.054018915,0.043277405,-0.056099594,-0.057774197,0.010659554,0.059910435,-0.03094506,0.05740673,-0.017349156,-0.016233968,-0.038313363,0.06072901,-0.03305266,0.056133248,0.03085293,0.038406704,-0.05774179,-0.035655774,0.052721824,-0.020981202,-0.019490972,0.019134702,-0.055012356,-0.00768604,0.05984699,-0.027814412,0.061164986,0.0551381,0.056564365,0.05988416,0.048783205,-0.050833788,0.027298143,0.037365653,0.051978827,-0.030325355,0.051919576,0.022582112,-0.057498705,0.035729293,0.017516084,-0.049919967,-0.045520093,-0.06055365,-0.060554497,0.029438056,-0.05179628,-0.028545562,0.056160055,0.030795464,-0.061170567,0.054169413,0.028299792,0.034884226,-0.06034547,-0.011211888,0.02265358,0.05203693,0.005846462,-0.039990313,-0.027488573,0.05544506,-0.030332526,-0.057147015,0.055336703,0.04312112,-0.01191738,-0.060980506,0.016101694,0.012575974,0.03763717,0.06069637,-0.009635618,-0.05779338,0.061171412,0.020534335,-0.0198855,0.020786269,0.052570783,-0.033661433,0.05231462,0.053420372,-0.038748905,-0.045113966,0.03166354,-5.01E-05,0.043497715,0.016343176,0.060698964,-0.05514996,-0.016343968,-0.054661643,-0.057948697,0.05315647,0.05494776,0.06107299,-0.023740387,0.005196908,-0.056684066,-0.029644305,0.046089865,-0.050221197,-0.021102244,-0.057991832,0.044551507,-0.048602354,-0.030333439,0.061157726,-0.046836987,0.060314015,-0.057963315,-0.008758938,-0.053990997,-0.006892234,-0.02422925,-0.06099707,0.052787986,-0.046817657,0.059374463,0.05577714,0.058180533,-0.051342454,0.04119571,-0.06015466,-0.056831792,0.059996363,-0.037474696,0.045239475,-0.01554362,-0.02921806,-0.06095405,0.0606456,-0.029876143,-0.006644128,-0.01173468,0.0603065,0.03945002,-0.01548669,0.060095545,0.03461518,-0.06011398,-0.040145773,0.053195152,-0.058691107,-0.05785227,-0.052827198,-0.058340654,0.035312325,-0.04681885,0.0435074,0.060873292,-0.019139893,0.044990867,0.040577177,-0.005981892,0.003880686,-0.007455209,0.001346696,-0.058486205,0.06026535,0.004347597,-0.06116965,-0.06085464,-0.010226556,0.058148444,0.030154252,-0.06043146,-0.032600842,0.025699079,0.003586772,0.03593119,0.02107733,-0.005029951,-0.06117013,-0.05334177,-0.037209515,-0.059897467,0.043170106,-0.056522485,-0.059349723,0.05244455,0.034227733,-0.030421289,0.06116121,0.050251596,0.05967444,-0.041924555,0.027109109,0.01772334,-0.04940733,-0.061163865,0.05569358,0.040274426,0.0586407,0.05457887,0.022050101,-0.0608644,-0.05493472,0.036618423,0.027340166,-0.038358804,-0.057146594,-0.054360043,-0.060286105,-0.060638003,0.043216944,0.049036887,0.006410909,-0.042125884,0.060617466,-0.031787563,-0.045641623,0.0505777,0.04414263,-0.059540957,0.036569223,-0.057854082,-0.04204984,0.004865905,0.026677407,0.040570933,0.004189954,-0.043567933,-0.046948154,-0.050212607,0.023917558,0.043465484,0

"ADP-Ribose-1""-Monophosphatase: a Conserved Coronavirus Enzyme That Is Dispensable for Viral Replication in Tissue Culture","Replication of the ∼30-kb plus-strand RNA genome of coronaviruses and synthesis of an extensive set of subgenome-length RNAs are mediated by the replicase-transcriptase, a membrane-bound protein complex containing several cellular proteins and up to 16 viral nonstructural proteins (nsps) with multiple enzymatic activities, including protease, polymerase, helicase, methyltransferase, and RNase activities. To get further insight into the replicase gene-encoded functions, we characterized the coronavirus X domain, which is part of nsp3 and has been predicted to be an ADP-ribose-1""-monophosphate (Appr-1""-p) processing enzyme. Bacterially expressed forms of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus X domains were shown to dephosphorylate Appr-1""-p, a side product of cellular tRNA splicing, to ADP-ribose in a highly specific manner. The enzyme had no detectable activity on several other nucleoside phosphates. Guided by the crystal structure of AF1521, an X domain homolog from Archaeoglobus fulgidus, potential active-site residues of the HCoV-229E X domain were targeted by site-directed mutagenesis. The data suggest that the HCoV-229E replicase polyprotein residues, Asn 1302, Asn 1305, His 1310, Gly 1312, and Gly 1313, are part of the enzyme's active site. Characterization of an Appr-1""-pase-deficient HCoV-229E mutant revealed no significant effects on viral RNA synthesis and virus titer, and no reversion to the wild-type sequence was observed when the mutant virus was passaged in cell culture. The apparent dispensability of the conserved X domain activity in vitro indicates that coronavirus replicase polyproteins have evolved to include nonessential functions. The biological significance of the novel enzymatic activity in vivo remains to be

RNA Interference-Mediated Virus Clearance from Cells both Acutely and Chronically Infected with the Prototypic Arenavirus Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus,"Several arenaviruses, including Lassa fever virus, cause severe, often lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans. No licensed vaccines are available in the United States, and currently there is no efficacious therapy to treat this viral infection. Therefore the importance of developing effective antiviral approaches to combat pathogenic arenaviruses is clear. Moreover, the prototypic arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is an important model for the study of viral persistence and associated diseases, as well as for exploring therapies to treat viral chronic infections. The use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to downregulate gene expression via RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a powerful genetic tool for the study of gene function. In addition, the successful use of siRNAs to target a variety of animal viruses has led us to consider RNAi as a potential novel antiviral strategy. We have investigated the use of RNAi therapy against LCMV. Here, we show that siRNAs targeting sequences within the viral L polymerase and Z mRNAs inhibit LCMV multiplication in cultured cells. Unexpectedly, the antiviral efficacy of RNAi-based therapy against LCMV was highly dependent on the method used to deliver effector siRNA molecules. Thus, transfection of chemically synthesized siRNA pools to L and Z was ineffective in preventing virus multiplication. In contrast, targeting of the same viral L and Z gene products with siRNAs produced inside cells using a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus expression system inhibited LCMV multiplication very efficiently.

Human Metapneumovirus: An Important Cause of Respiratory Disease in Children and Adults,"Human metapneumovirus is a paramyxovirus that was discovered in 2001 in the Netherlands. Epidemiologic studies have shown it to be a major cause of acute respiratory tract disease in normal infants and children worldwide, with a seasonal occurrence and spectrum of clinical illness most similar to the closely related respiratory syncytial virus. The greatest prevalence of severe disease requiring hospitalization in otherwise healthy children appears to be in those aged between 6 and 12 months, older than the peak age of hospitalizations for respiratory syncytial virus. Human metapneumovirus is also a significant cause of acute respiratory disease in adults, particularly the elderly and those with comorbid conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and cancer. Because there is no rapid diagnostic assay, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction is most widely used. Animal models have been developed, and candidate live-attenuated vaccines are in preclinical trials, offering the potential for future interventions in high-risk

Exploiting cis-Acting Replication Elements To Direct Hepatitis C Virus-Dependent Transgene Expression,"We describe here a novel targeting gene therapy strategy to direct gene expression responsive to hepatitis C virus (HCV). The goal was approached by engineering a construct containing the antisense sequence of the transgene and internal ribosome entry site of encephalomyocarditis virus flanked by 5′- and 3′-end sequences of HCV cDNA that contain cis-acting replication elements. Thus, expression of the transgene is only promoted when the minus-strand RNA has been synthesized by the functional replication machinery present in infected cells. Reporter assay and strand-specific reverse transcription-PCR showed selective transgene expression in Huh-7 cells harboring an autonomously replicating HCV subgenome but remaining silent in uninfected cells. Furthermore, using the cytosine deaminase suicide gene as a transgene coupled with recombinant adenovirus delivery, we demonstrated that cytosine deaminase was specifically expressed in replicon cells, resulting in marked chemosensitization of replicon cells to the cytotoxic effects of flucytosine. This new targeting strategy could be extended to other single-stranded RNA viruses encoding the unique RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that has no parallel in mammalian cells.",-0.01825099,0.003316519,-0.03934454,-0.05901512,-0.025327725,0.045830064,0.02576726,0.022483166,0.04214626,0.045316115,0.06463642,-0.048644964,-0.011738416,0.03904428,0.041132163,-0.064391874,-0.06432218,-0.03134824,0.057538953,0.056592863,-0.057226628,0.017214786,-0.05980978,0.04814445,0.04739755,0.055018213,0.047373854,-0.02378989,-0.0091936,-0.011613047,0.061104763,0.06462948,-0.040363885,-0.06068828,0.025960747,0.056162503,-0.032584805,-0.009218698,-0.059831742,0.008551977,0.060957447,-0.028059212,-0.023122035,-0.050947458,0.015708419,-0.009938784,-0.031455234,-0.026678707,0.04072775,0.001409366,-0.058856588,0.04927334,-0.06314318,0.004959904,-0.058657695,0.02459008,-0.049738575,0.023465497,0.060110558,-0.036225263,0.004386009,0.057049006,0.033988733,0.029223125,0.012302544,-0.062440697,0.063316904,-0.047063358,0.03563145,0.034582358,0.019838171,0.035269897,0.032494016,0.055462122,-0.025249049,0.000103941,0.06459281,-0.03393356,-0.064483024,0.058865502,-0.059896756,0.064321905,-0.031820558,-0.012051803,-0.038327612,0.057717744,-0.03587478,0.034537703,-0.062322125,0.002258316,-0.025709623,-0.03237693,-0.051380664,0.06277246,-0.004347837,0.062352013,0.046131276,0.056056965,0.064609624,-0.056600437,0.015586524,0.04783398,-0.039609447,-0.0180357,0.045425266,0.05228246,0.033775598,-0.031613268,-0.046489846,0.002945398,-0.06003757,0.022125125,0.051798135,0.05895948,0.055112302,-0.03417234,-0.06310296,-0.038803287,-0.03820837,0.022635335,-0.061325956,0.064479105,0.02688221,-0.034780532,0.061765626,0.052405685,-0.024441108,-0.014040345,-0.013817747,0.046387978,-0.034474958,0.06463687,0.060758274,-0.009554027,0.003946312,-0.057850678,-0.048969362,0.020149287,-0.059007607,0.032944936,0.04130739,0.06462123,-0.064094044,-0.005145226,-0.03988469,-0.06248232,0.024902225,-0.06306552,0.041155025,0.043057963,-0.03804229,-0.061935704,-0.015827904,0.008043037,0.06463858,0.019848308,0.061222307,0.058805306,0.05550751,0.06293596,-0.000289665,-0.005313586,-0.05161668,0.055300213,-0.025053032,-0.009148311,-0.055438336,-0.014138081,-0.017143968,-0.05956889,-0.044458397,-0.028507428,-0.057164766,0.037601646,0.04908681,-0.031464275,-0.019356307,-0.014163648,0.062095992,-0.024644166,0.024992915,-0.052503586,0.002661808,0.025226427,0.060777243,-0.034579244,-0.05720247,0.06290151,0.062102534,-0.042471774,0.06341529,-0.028988913,-0.030582447,-0.005145723,0.064594,-0.010376714,0.04548245,0.060213685,0.043009534,-0.04315923,-0.047811996,0.055900916,0.02096054,-0.048706524,0.052119378,-0.018161388,-0.009268633,0.054279678,0.03808655,0.06462813,0.03778758,0.05819703,0.060852457,0.046540365,-0.06075968,0.043227036,0.04123214,0.03544511,-0.05120368,0.050835792,0.039397743,-0.06184449,0.023695387,0.052905396,0.004417703,0.006823727,-0.062698185,-0.0597955,0.036471475,-0.019425526,-0.008639317,0.052739013,0.0206722,-0.06463112,0.06417882,0.030954078,0.06024948,-0.057146914,0.001983196,0.037611116,0.032331176,0.057057198,-0.02228197,0.019869369,0.06144749,-0.031136317,-0.061244786,0.035278693,0.043834317,-0.06129182,-0.06461919,-0.003466976,-0.002290744,0.0169171,0.064347826,-0.040711228,-0.046433534,0.06463923,-0.03362072,0.012426041,0.001733475,0.039429333,-0.014020002,0.06038151,0.050131306,0.038985733,0.001891932,-0.04133781,-0.004673609,0.044263363,0.059674617,0.06423256,-0.022228885,-0.026091602,-0.04148103,-0.054301206,0.031736273,0.04132248,0.06443686,-0.036641933,-0.009569933,-0.0582391,-0.044413935,0.06249702,-0.0532884,-0.010863916,-0.058324203,0.032172125,-0.023203855,-0.040636428,0.06462799,-0.06177801,0.06346395,-0.045229487,-0.004754277,-0.056351688,-0.030784328,0.010320366,-0.06424162,0.022111082,-0.041492388,0.06445049,0.028462628,0.04100633,-0.052784864,0.03382691,-0.058247812,-0.030157087,0.038198188,-0.032305114,0.033723954,-0.022386724,0.00785941,-0.064023994,0.06156014,0.018128037,-0.013572979,0.020591926,0.04512772,0.05072092,-0.042545725,0.03612834,-0.001943118,-0.049953677,-0.013046573,0.041146155,-0.056464836,-0.056910317,-0.004017835,-0.03313077,0.056423783,-0.01424038,-0.025321163,0.06162317,0.00193415,0.013631475,0.04252522,0.043064028,0.006487972,-0.04212217,0.037700076,-0.045363493,0.06394109,0.033423167,-0.06463823,-0.06453467,-0.060828026,0.0381619,0.003096132,-0.05204449,-0.014251956,0.051401738,-0.062205713,0.056818955,0.046287935,-0.024337567,-0.06460524,-0.059142854,-0.021670412,-0.050275154,0.047013696,-0.058654834,-0.0640425,-0.019917753,0.049341585,-0.02159842,0.06459973,0.028409837,0.06028319,0.008228799,0.044562247,-0.05628587,-0.029094405,-0.0646281,0.061910152,0.024147274,0.060742393,-0.005845456,0.027314315,-0.061149504,-0.064421915,0.04731569,0.030046545,-0.000481029,-0.006453655,-0.059616156,-0.06080522,-0.062603444,0.054897502,0.038733557,0.017178895,0.044912927,0.062443554,-0.053179618,-0.05307474,0.054324206,0.059090644,-0.06327788,0.020115543,-0.05944164,0.05475246,0.055833533,-0.024499437,0.012676429,-0.01570413,-0.03444781,-0.056754425,-0.04256465,0.040750884,0.05349224,0.041346744

Role of Nucleotides Immediately Flanking the Transcription-Regulating Sequence Core in Coronavirus Subgenomic mRNA Synthesis,"The generation of subgenomic mRNAs in coronavirus involves a discontinuous mechanism of transcription by which the common leader sequence, derived from the genome 5′ terminus, is fused to the 5′ end of the mRNA coding sequence (body). Transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) precede each gene and include a conserved core sequence (CS) surrounded by relatively variable sequences (5′ TRS and 3′ TRS). Regulation of transcription in coronaviruses has been studied by reverse-genetics analysis of the sequences immediately flanking a unique CS in the Transmissible gastroenteritis virus genome (CS-S2), located inside the S gene, that does not lead to detectable amounts of the corresponding mRNA, in spite of its canonical sequence. The transcriptional inactivity of CS-S2 was genome position independent. The presence of a canonical CS was not sufficient to drive transcription, but subgenomic synthesis requires a minimum base pairing between the leader TRS (TRS-L) and the complement of the body TRS (cTRS-B) provided by the CS and its adjacent nucleotides. A good correlation was observed between the free energy of TRS-L and cTRS-B duplex formation and the levels of subgenomic mRNA S2, demonstrating that base pairing between the leader and body beyond the CS is a determinant regulation factor in coronavirus transcription. In TRS mutants with increasing complementarity between TRS-L and cTRS-B, a tendency to reach a plateau in ΔG values was observed, suggesting that a more precise definition of the TRS limits might be proposed, specifically that it consists of the central CS and around 4 nucleotides flanking 5′ and 3′ the CS. Sequences downstream of the CS exert a stronger influence on the template-switching decision according to a model of polymerase strand transfer and template switching during minus-strand synthesis.",-0.002732513,-0.054150637,-0.03551977,-0.057619262,0.055500403,0.046213534,-0.02520538,-0.011389944,0.040694658,0.058326628,0.05312597,-0.017962052,-0.058127664,0.053385142,0.057487294,-0.056523304,-0.021230627,-0.054913934,0.051376473,0.036033336,-0.058174573,0.021719016,-0.042341463,0.052813817,-0.038932975,0.015851272,0.058094736,-0.001938935,-0.054079846,-0.032017574,0.058057345,0.03795302,0.003794934,-0.05526975,0.039866704,0.050254412,-0.05581474,0.058962684,-0.056982044,-0.012152893,0.057297323,-0.016071051,0.011705595,-0.051444456,0.05263483,-0.03351181,0.040922523,-0.056110617,-0.005560672,0.0225446,-0.04169276,0.008501978,-0.058101427,-0.059089564,-0.040985994,-0.018925406,-0.058667853,0.051845483,0.059206568,-0.055421717,0.040935773,0.041256182,0.05598989,-0.027195944,-0.056717835,-0.058298834,0.058123603,-0.022539262,0.050266813,-0.025798557,0.046348922,0.04891972,0.011939433,0.05884148,0.03333699,0.024292389,0.05866631,0.049647495,-0.058903087,0.044708796,-0.05827957,0.059059426,-0.05041283,-0.043023523,0.00936388,0.058513153,0.054738965,0.02291112,-0.054209296,0.033517875,0.047303196,0.008037008,-0.0568515,-0.002562197,0.018284865,0.05740823,0.019744359,0.05467004,0.058894746,0.004108484,-0.038787656,0.02746894,-0.03630812,0.050615948,-0.041877203,0.025257409,0.05697525,-0.013794203,-0.009848816,0.008924242,0.027788863,0.055718586,-0.053671766,0.03928906,0.054956052,0.03108104,-0.059289977,-0.001071099,-0.055594403,0.015558055,-0.05625166,0.05428848,0.055218782,-0.058881324,0.026551308,0.028621187,0.023267956,0.006607187,-0.055299595,0.056048453,0.015826598,0.05934894,0.058098506,-0.00555619,0.006915079,-0.04696005,-0.008720934,0.059368458,-0.048289005,0.003475981,-0.006286515,0.0594084,-0.057706054,-0.048981532,-0.03513627,-0.059391923,0.011144047,-0.059027385,0.053187687,0.010287296,-0.055762954,-0.04106915,-0.047231767,-0.02272796,0.059407797,0.04681281,-0.035069115,0.0585797,0.052651785,0.04330547,-0.04908396,-0.03229039,-0.05188857,0.058322433,0.006198451,-0.007903023,-0.05535934,0.000406325,0.0151422,-0.044794563,-0.044776864,0.049833294,-0.015028318,0.046272174,0.04715785,-0.048125133,-0.025427181,-0.023501992,0.05888153,-0.0528872,0.038303208,-0.036494695,-0.028400198,0.04181486,0.04719368,-0.05566717,-0.05472236,0.058436345,0.053814664,-0.053512186,0.05911446,-0.038026992,0.042202093,0.04155133,0.059241913,-0.014580828,0.041077945,-0.02853677,0.053036995,-0.040075634,-0.00576581,0.038379453,0.017402677,0.008226813,0.035909403,-0.039406143,-0.049855623,0.059081763,-0.016499715,0.05933921,-0.03737915,0.028034527,0.05505156,0.04203481,-0.059066605,0.03723299,0.05086011,-0.02023155,-0.050223865,0.054405663,0.035444472,-0.05881611,-0.044236388,-0.033562433,0.000779083,-0.049984448,-0.05908364,-0.051934198,0.01437009,0.04781234,-0.051635012,0.053169385,0.032129485,-0.059408493,0.059344944,0.03324231,0.058495376,-0.056851428,-0.055955205,0.05209398,0.044491403,-0.03383934,-0.0512685,0.004121699,0.046704672,-0.05857227,-0.047436696,0.042329293,0.053387895,-0.034046356,-0.05934259,0.05353613,0.047427498,0.017229013,0.052894477,-0.048845667,-0.025089951,0.05940882,0.03825107,0.05779932,-0.017890552,0.03537946,-0.043281242,0.05655871,0.05014319,0.025162121,0.028451711,0.046839938,-0.055864643,-0.02575247,0.04262396,0.05731358,0.055956963,0.052945856,0.029611252,-0.03782307,0.023443026,0.051229175,0.05939204,-0.026866142,-0.03017103,-0.028564267,-0.056826912,0.046714492,-0.019365264,-0.04166196,-0.054402154,-0.005016846,0.01770029,-0.002384207,0.0593837,-0.038296714,0.057255626,-0.058477476,-0.0553054,-0.021603506,-0.041501462,0.02758121,-0.059270017,-0.025085324,-0.03419225,0.058433965,0.050248902,0.052230857,-0.017974889,0.050928254,-0.0458811,-0.03533209,0.052018657,0.04317953,0.05774344,-0.032001648,-0.011230247,-0.05913447,0.049675584,0.053930324,-0.053636923,-0.04427222,0.005285987,-0.04733405,-0.05645635,0.055270936,0.028360568,-0.05878454,-0.024370195,-0.055547494,-0.05246289,-0.05824137,-0.005165706,-0.028462691,-0.0137867,-0.05203021,0.042764217,0.059322506,0.02207242,-0.003178023,0.051196065,0.013673269,0.039796464,0.037624616,-0.0568196,-0.007995674,0.04731874,0.031796034,-0.05940881,0.011200574,0.001850771,0.039292708,0.05763569,-0.058031783,0.019556925,0.03751099,-0.055936962,0.055457573,0.043103322,-0.053235937,-0.059408624,-0.048806213,-0.030735614,-0.05702511,0.046837978,-0.051639624,-0.05812852,0.020857897,0.01916904,0.0583333,0.05940017,0.055826932,0.039782193,-0.039817136,-0.041276254,0.008685879,0.00602881,-0.059403934,0.044906,0.037340708,-0.024111152,0.05736264,-0.00705948,-0.059302684,-0.059263915,-0.056852303,0.055267774,-0.05131748,0.03501839,-0.04607903,-0.052656446,-0.055848435,0.058143947,0.05334258,0.008613297,0.001750592,0.05754749,-0.055786233,-0.034087993,0.040536635,0.05689176,-0.051744305,-0.039774776,-0.04320665,0.048266646,-0.05393713,0.013804024,-0.05144807,-0.052064054,-0.054845817,0.03720171,-0.041781303,0.02946144,0.051972948,0.015836103,-0.002

Short Internal Sequences Involved in Replication and Virion Accumulation in a Subviral RNA of Turnip Crinkle Virus,"cis-acting sequences and structural elements in untranslated regions of viral genomes allow viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases to correctly initiate and transcribe asymmetric levels of plus and minus strands during replication of plus-sense RNA viruses. Such elements include promoters, enhancers, and transcriptional repressors that may require interactions with distal RNA sequences for function. We previously determined that a non-sequence-specific hairpin (M1H) in the interior of a subviral RNA (satC) associated with Turnip crinkle virus is required for fitness and that its function might be to bridge flanking sequences (X. Sun and A. E. Simon, J. Virol. 77:7880-7889, 2003). To establish the importance of the flanking sequences in replication and satC-specific virion repression, segments on both sides of M1H were randomized and subjected to in vivo functional selection (in vivo SELEX). Analyses of winning (functional) sequences revealed three different conserved elements within the segments that could be specifically assigned roles in replication, virion repression, or both. One of these elements was also implicated in the molecular switch that releases the 3′ end from its interaction with the repressor hairpin H5, which is possibly involved in controlling the level of

Novel Nonnucleoside Inhibitor of Hepatitis C Virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase,"A novel nonnucleoside inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), [(1R)-5-cyano-8-methyl-1-propyl-1,3,4,9-tetrahydropyano[3,4-b]indol-1-yl] acetic acid (HCV-371), was discovered through high-throughput screening followed by chemical optimization. HCV-371 displayed broad inhibitory activities against the NS5B RdRp enzyme, with 50% inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 1.8 μM for 90% of the isolates derived from HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, and 3a. HCV-371 showed no inhibitory activity against a panel of human polymerases, including mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, and other unrelated viral polymerases, demonstrating its specificity for the HCV polymerase. A single administration of HCV-371 to cells containing the HCV subgenomic replicon for 3 days resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of the steady-state levels of viral RNA and protein. Multiple treatments with HCV-371 for 16 days led to a >3-log(10) reduction in the HCV RNA level. In comparison, multiple treatments with a similar inhibitory dose of alpha interferon resulted in a 2-log(10) reduction of the viral RNA level. In addition, treatment of cells with a combination of HCV-371 and pegylated alpha interferon resulted in an additive antiviral activity. Within the effective antiviral concentrations of HCV-371, there was no effect on cell viability and metabolism. The intracellular antiviral specificity of HCV-371 was demonstrated by its lack of activity in cells infected with several DNA or RNA viruses. Fluorescence binding studies show that HCV-371 binds the NS5B with an apparent dissociation constant of 150 nM, leading to high selectivity and lack of cytotoxicity in the antiviral

cis-Acting RNA Signals in the NS5B C-Terminal Coding Sequence of the Hepatitis C Virus Genome,"The cis-replicating RNA elements in the 5′ and 3′ nontranslated regions (NTRs) of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome have been thoroughly studied before. However, no cis-replicating elements have been identified in the coding sequences of the HCV polyprotein until very recently. The existence of highly conserved and stable stem-loop structures in the RNA polymerase NS5B coding sequence, however, has been previously predicted (A. Tuplin, J. Wood, D. J. Evans, A. H. Patel, and P. Simmonds, RNA 8:824-841, 2002). We have selected for our studies a 249-nt-long RNA segment in the C-terminal NS5B coding region (NS5BCR), which is predicted to form four stable stem-loop structures (SL-IV to SL-VII). By deletion and mutational analyses of the RNA structures, we have determined that two of the stem-loops (SL-V and SL-VI) are essential for replication of the HCV subgenomic replicon in Huh-7 cells. Mutations in the loop and the top of the stem of these RNA elements abolished replicon RNA synthesis but had no effect on translation. In vitro gel shift and filter-binding assays revealed that purified NS5B specifically binds to SL-V. The NS5B-RNA complexes were specifically competed away by unlabeled homologous RNA, to a small extent by 3′ NTR RNA, and only poorly by 5′ NTR RNA. The other two stem-loops (SL-IV and SL-VII) of the NS5BCR domain were found to be important but not essential for colony formation by the subgenomic replicon.

Identification and Characterization of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Replicase Proteins,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) encodes proteins required for RNA transcription and genome replication as large polyproteins that are proteolytically processed by virus-encoded proteinases to produce mature replicase proteins. In this report, we generated antibodies against SARS-CoV predicted replicase protein and used the antibodies to identify and characterize 12 of the 16 predicted mature replicase proteins (nsp1, nsp2, nsp3, nsp4, nsp5, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14, nsp15, and nsp16) in SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells. Immunoblot analysis of infected-cell lysates identified proteins of the predicted sizes. Immunofluorescence microscopy detected similar patterns of punctate perinuclear and distributed cytoplasmic foci with all replicase antibodies and as early as 6 h postinfection. Dual-labeling studies demonstrated colocalization of replicase protein nsp8 with nsp2 and nsp3 in cytoplasmic complexes and also with LC3, a protein marker for autophagic vacuoles. Antibodies directed against mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) virions and against the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol) detected SARS-CoV nucleocapsid and nsp12 (Pol), respectively, in SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells. These results confirm the predicted protein processing pattern for mature SARS-CoV replicase proteins, demonstrate localization of replicase proteins to cytoplasmic complexes containing markers for autophagosome membranes, and suggest conservation of protein epitopes in the replicase and nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV and the group II coronavirus, MHV. Further, the results demonstrate the ability of replicase antibodies to detect SARS-CoV-infected cells as early as 6 h postinfection and thus represent important tools for studies of SARS-CoV replication, inhibition, and

Pathogenesis of Malaria and Clinically Similar Conditions,"There is now wide acceptance of the concept that the similarity between many acute infectious diseases, be they viral, bacterial, or parasitic in origin, is caused by the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines initiated when the organism interacts with the innate immune system. This is also true of certain noninfectious states, such as the tissue injury syndromes. This review discusses the historical origins of these ideas, which began with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and spread from their origins in malaria research to other fields. As well the more established proinflammatory mediators, such as TNF, interleukin-1, and lymphotoxin, the roles of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, which are chiefly inhibitory, are discussed. The established and potential roles of two more recently recognized contributors, overactivity of the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and the escape of high-mobility-group box 1 (HMGB1) protein from its normal location into the circulation, are also put in context. The pathogenesis of the disease caused by falciparum malaria is then considered in the light of what has been learned about the roles of these mediators in these other diseases, as well as in malaria itself.",0.034161676,0.052419864,0.048996065,-0.058167275,0.052255463,0.049243733,0.001801775,-0.06335336,0.027410537,0.014932266,0.06895097,0.013772249,-0.004710717,-0.009013511,0.014472239,-0.06736845,-0.068919666,-0.050921507,-0.005342959,0.002301152,-0.00661452,-0.018190151,-0.046701454,0.03796551,0.061384995,0.05997006,0.04294102,-0.046705548,-0.030105194,-0.008389243,-0.026989534,0.068950824,0.017768746,-0.025852798,0.000966243,0.047557607,-0.003536271,-0.017758522,-0.062611915,0.007183755,0.043070935,-0.040922094,0.023802623,-0.03201058,-0.06359216,0.003034711,-0.055082187,-0.061099052,0.051482134,0.005384768,0.03932335,0.061903764,-0.05848699,-0.044898305,-0.051737495,-0.009802002,-0.06822457,0.022741286,0.051784668,0.0659367,0.024751386,0.025847962,-0.01349167,-0.00068651,0.027425107,-0.068391606,0.06334439,-0.039000206,0.022280417,0.001001402,-0.022468759,0.014793304,0.042310055,0.052508272,-0.051031917,0.019116439,0.05754922,0.034596197,-0.06727026,0.06413466,-0.038278174,0.06578539,0.050865866,0.023493858,-0.03375335,0.066692814,0.046127353,0.04371143,-0.028974999,-0.06014032,-0.04571471,-0.063118614,-0.041605853,0.009891349,0.033280905,0.062304508,0.062392395,0.0672657,0.06890188,-0.025551293,-0.011925271,0.06060008,0.041416764,-0.004507253,0.060169846,0.004146941,0.036858033,-0.03340941,-0.027979631,-0.009533754,-0.009427282,0.02127888,-0.030228198,0.039023463,0.057246394,-0.000353911,-0.06590016,0.05320937,0.018294135,0.04131083,-0.013329194,0.03819138,0.052936938,-0.048199914,0.001037782,-0.004067178,-0.011411021,0.0338349,-0.051707126,0.002641481,-0.056145024,0.06896121,0.06493958,0.005487801,0.04868812,-0.054547198,0.018434377,0.05772952,-0.06776078,0.039205387,-0.01816625,0.06892087,-0.05465157,-0.052076776,0.05682869,-0.059646055,0.026207374,-0.06515675,0.03698276,0.009051282,-0.014101599,-0.06795561,-0.056307927,-0.035254117,0.06887266,-0.041146424,0.0600459,0.054359775,0.053148504,-0.03149284,0.026397817,-0.006835457,0.052942272,0.05538207,-0.051664125,-0.015217825,-0.039935026,0.023381554,-0.0645885,-0.036900215,0.027299609,-0.06769575,0.006177659,-0.02669099,0.04334403,-0.037101127,-0.011356185,-0.06865785,0.052329287,-0.028003255,-0.002548468,0.01984493,-0.050464552,-0.050131723,0.05921717,-0.001187356,-0.06117981,-0.014983581,0.061603807,-0.05109863,0.020258805,0.003245007,-0.010425782,0.056172937,0.03788834,-0.047021538,0.041099057,-0.04115462,0.009210138,-0.015053661,-0.056419425,-0.009526591,-0.002340666,-0.04116801,-0.002757249,0.019193677,-0.04955947,0.06310443,0.040055837,0.06564626,0.020009188,0.06667468,0.064857654,0.0648312,0.00573065,-0.025066169,0.016293343,-0.02590365,-0.06418893,-0.035888635,-0.051585328,-0.022411786,-0.05922975,-0.059914943,0.020730404,-0.0656066,-0.06522596,-0.06374711,0.016371528,0.060194213,0.056199975,0.06632227,0.02850672,-0.06895909,0.038204275,0.002788896,0.0561077,-0.039277393,0.0570834,-0.04425153,-0.015146378,0.062285677,-0.052382648,-0.0260326,-0.046323344,-0.06408299,-0.009765652,0.02115696,0.05712069,-0.06319881,0.036785483,-0.043121878,-0.032663222,-0.024235971,0.06865354,0.021479035,0.001173902,0.06896122,-0.06361533,-0.059037212,-0.026164677,0.028243104,0.058417782,0.054120407,-0.027951308,-0.012627713,-0.017404523,-0.03895195,0.04542604,0.005896261,0.061464954,0.060002666,-0.030345049,-0.019621711,-0.06431718,-0.024122903,0.034854814,0.053683627,0.066524155,-0.037718367,0.023688043,0.024422115,-0.06592819,-0.013298586,0.050083887,0.013509743,-0.026798135,0.06391211,0.037641138,0.06597482,0.068703525,0.045958173,0.06859657,-0.000375795,-0.05402956,-0.03471382,-0.011478388,-0.001564713,-0.062441386,0.025207551,0.002803129,0.06619477,0.05496841,0.015114228,-0.000110913,0.034711245,0.005916314,0.032195546,0.058387626,-0.06408217,0.05982947,-0.019394923,0.016487611,-0.06522843,0.060709033,-0.040936932,0.05221817,0.05007314,0.06766954,-0.023536649,-0.06696041,0.062501855,0.058901154,-0.038116645,0.064591475,0.068053566,-0.024751713,-0.003802109,0.05623638,-0.01562028,-0.044494055,0.01711603,0.039283883,0.045714032,0.019664207,0.015481051,-0.006854127,0.04395386,0.042116158,-0.011407492,0.022727404,0.059802856,0.06805043,0.02192003,-0.06869362,-0.068890944,0.036027845,0.017352063,0.014641022,-0.04992356,0.03771663,-0.061221216,0.001932965,0.034767985,-0.040907625,0.002608147,-0.06895443,0.024198147,-0.061105277,-0.030941278,0.05123887,-0.041229405,-0.05880023,0.039210264,-0.051134374,-0.055013463,0.06860962,0.066175945,0.060233828,0.047642376,-0.005656431,0.054251794,-0.025476601,-0.066471845,0.055171676,0.0439161,0.05919377,0.05290866,0.020840358,-0.04116325,0.017381195,0.044899248,0.009280137,0.057852376,-0.02292231,-0.01913417,0.025708428,-0.066326156,0.021699011,-0.021080745,0.06568932,0.019508218,0.06688982,0.012993096,-0.04409223,0.01618616,-0.023038896,0.024435928,0.017583255,-0.049231842,-0.02493296,-0.017430246,-0.050717194,-0.012373657,0.008463334,0.03801967,-0.030054027,0.021979742,0.004289609,0.02630853,0.054669444,-0.02624578,-0

Inhibition of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus Replication by Small Interfering RNAs in Mammalian Cells,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute respiratory infectious disease that spread worldwide in early 2003. The cause was determined as a novel coronavirus (CoV), SARS-associated CoV (SARS-CoV), with a single-stranded, plus-sense RNA. To date, no effective specific treatment has been identified. To exploit the possibility of using RNA interference as a therapeutic approach to fight the disease, plasmid-mediated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were generated to target the SARS-CoV genome. The expression of siRNAs from two plasmids, which specifically target the viral RNA polymerase, effectively blocked the cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV on Vero cells. These two plasmids also inhibited viral replication as shown by titer assays and by an examination of viral RNA and protein levels. Thus, our results demonstrated the feasibility of developing siRNAs as effective anti-SARS

Multiple Enzymatic Activities Associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Helicase,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a newly identified group 2 coronavirus, is the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a life-threatening form of pneumonia in humans. Coronavirus replication and transcription are highly specialized processes of cytoplasmic RNA synthesis that localize to virus-induced membrane structures and were recently proposed to involve a complex enzymatic machinery that, besides RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, and protease activities, also involves a series of RNA-processing enzymes that are not found in most other RNA virus families. Here, we characterized the enzymatic activities of a recombinant form of the SARS-CoV helicase (nonstructural protein [nsp] 13), a superfamily 1 helicase with an N-terminal zinc-binding domain. We report that nsp13 has both RNA and DNA duplex-unwinding activities. SARS-CoV nsp13 unwinds its substrates in a 5′-to-3′ direction and features a remarkable processivity, allowing efficient strand separation of extended regions of double-stranded RNA and DNA. Characterization of the nsp13-associated (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphatase ([dNTPase) activities revealed that all natural nucleotides and deoxynucleotides are substrates of nsp13, with ATP, dATP, and GTP being hydrolyzed slightly more efficiently than other nucleotides. Furthermore, we established an RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity for the SARS-CoV nsp13 helicase which may be involved in the formation of the 5′ cap structure of viral RNAs. The data suggest that the (d)NTPase and RNA 5′-triphosphatase activities of nsp13 have a common active site. Finally, we established that, in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells, nsp13 localizes to membranes that appear to be derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and are the likely site of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis.",-0.024175718,0.040179722,-0.040540274,0.020707253,0.047123604,0.053720005,0.03545803,-0.053104684,0.03174672,0.010837071,0.059529185,0.024519512,-0.051784582,0.046657573,0.055779118,-0.059533,-0.059399594,0.029434605,0.04417636,0.036864523,-0.024162307,0.020114284,-0.050685093,0.05301056,-0.042329594,0.019354314,0.05816766,-0.027881369,-0.056388464,-0.034446362,0.05618575,0.058849636,-0.047321167,0.018213227,0.023864789,-0.053697485,-0.041924044,-0.019340746,-0.054556683,0.053306676,0.054452393,-0.05735963,0.0391131,-0.003664571,0.058311585,-0.056774266,-0.05313247,-0.057722103,0.055844937,-0.05563975,-0.007894183,0.05264762,-0.058449082,-0.039585285,-0.04506238,0.05106333,-0.05701093,0.013466669,0.05901801,-0.05033914,-0.035635788,-0.028429857,0.04961968,0.04235209,0.001456784,-0.05944719,0.05539052,-0.056841973,0.046495087,0.028736556,0.050496582,0.006784512,0.00670933,0.04236659,-0.057127044,-0.021756496,0.059371814,0.013578401,6.17E-05,0.050356653,-0.0453205,0.059532855,0.030926568,-0.02590906,-0.055965025,0.023110116,-0.03534805,-0.05451312,-0.046161126,0.03340861,-0.005265045,-0.048745543,-0.05333548,0.023403727,-0.020099303,0.053381328,0.051267847,0.058691636,0.05953216,-0.04257584,-0.036330134,0.046821643,-0.041512158,-0.030877616,-0.05682992,0.05095342,0.037853416,-0.027935978,-0.045413297,-0.04415824,-0.040569674,0.03287564,-0.016041582,0.04874602,0.056100823,-0.006020597,-0.059445202,0.049814604,-0.051900208,0.02800951,-0.050976638,0.059318144,0.04368213,-0.043988932,0.05462813,0.042750936,0.000525744,0.008138157,-0.011442451,-0.019939063,-0.050970875,0.05953382,0.058145173,0.036022406,0.04332816,-0.038633827,-0.017560113,-0.014756111,-0.058103763,0.03779223,-0.0204546,0.059533235,-0.056686763,-0.056986447,-0.051841937,-0.05351343,0.002242735,-0.058891844,-0.005006732,-0.004882236,-0.03867909,-0.059494913,0.009034344,-0.05270738,0.05953382,-0.03523843,-0.04014295,0.048051436,-0.031505756,0.030861797,-0.013908659,-0.027144158,-0.002367161,0.051593076,0.02243415,0.034837987,-0.05235269,-0.005199047,-0.05068697,-0.057625793,-0.010388078,0.0486581,-0.020696051,-0.012898828,0.05646328,-0.011748191,0.049660843,0.016047267,0.05935507,-0.044519715,-0.008308371,0.045042288,-0.04912477,0.046878614,0.05826534,-0.03643883,-0.059288587,0.055104468,0.055982813,-0.03920084,0.019905232,-0.0340624,0.038226705,0.028207047,0.059501465,-0.049507312,-0.025477156,-0.05854208,0.013091772,-0.05076293,-0.03672243,0.036314093,-0.055071995,-0.027062979,0.048959102,0.02990637,0.037595168,0.059443083,0.041985605,0.058733225,0.026746985,0.059131246,0.042052377,0.041415032,-0.05047486,-0.051852304,0.048151817,0.033212785,-0.056039844,0.0314849,0.013659277,-0.05637553,0.04970907,-0.05074208,-0.055392668,-0.039040793,-0.05831877,-0.05625703,-0.047757007,0.05436836,0.03298998,0.05520572,0.03461731,-0.059533276,0.0592731,0.04770799,0.04813632,-0.058112398,-0.041456487,0.055325244,-0.015097941,0.01814855,-0.03360148,-0.042633254,0.054307815,-0.044306133,-0.03813747,0.058808368,0.037212044,0.03616192,-0.05951334,0.048460018,0.002888883,-0.027347712,0.059158143,-0.03615132,0.045389462,0.059533816,-0.038636982,-0.00847216,0.05127539,0.054175194,0.041159756,0.05266106,0.047923077,0.028124712,-0.05344699,-0.024486648,0.0258461,0.033005353,0.028699065,0.05934113,0.045179382,0.05729353,0.02430739,-0.05135181,-0.018989857,0.058645945,0.059482217,-0.05079785,-0.041000832,0.015843906,-0.05486425,0.058924943,-0.038567767,-0.016204322,-0.025921516,-0.006224339,-0.058785375,-0.045222912,0.059309345,-0.032915425,0.059138916,-0.04441359,0.034276787,-0.05749106,-0.027850093,-0.022409493,-0.059523728,-0.030933902,-0.052723687,0.059296194,0.039916668,0.056765568,-0.041623347,0.013148463,0.023858007,0.001042291,0.059231073,-0.056364194,0.05401004,-0.04764246,0.04012926,-0.059107453,0.059454557,0.032417066,-0.04433848,0.034108974,0.056582257,0.048601165,-0.048412453,0.052131537,0.010078494,-0.058268152,0.043611407,0.003111334,-0.007670799,-0.05639906,0.05092249,0.001506875,0.0306857,0.04489983,-0.015465086,0.058385104,0.05015166,-0.034817535,0.046968248,0.050647397,0.04766953,0.003545654,0.004670518,-0.042669035,0.058941193,-0.034572724,-0.059533805,-0.059533786,0.025899306,0.050949756,0.013868088,-0.059109326,-0.01819372,0.039913688,-0.059491076,0.043519836,-0.007384734,-0.05491071,-0.059533633,-0.04681213,-0.052675694,0.04980332,0.054123107,-0.059458517,-0.059464958,0.032600682,-0.01978689,-0.035685822,0.059529424,0.02632791,0.057221316,-0.030620595,-0.021935795,-0.028227692,-0.050768323,-0.05953382,0.05214472,0.048602685,0.058669418,0.019169971,-0.02849809,-0.056406107,-0.059503388,0.05872252,0.04856966,0.018322054,0.031800542,-0.058321554,-0.03743073,-0.050698865,0.0453089,0.057804286,0.041792225,0.05571174,0.039082818,-0.04857566,0.007875189,0.040373404,0.035192832,-0.056889325,0.03550434,-0.008033171,-0.018423552,-0.023351103,0.023195904,-0.013548,0.02900943,-0.048483793,-0.052283548,0.03239076,0.041005373,0.05664157,0.047240198,-0.0

Presence of an Encephalomyocarditis Virus Internal Ribosome Entry Site Sequence in Avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus Defective RNAs Abolishes Rescue by Helper Virus,"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) defective RNAs (D-RNAs) have been used for the expression of heterologous genes in a helper-virus-dependent expression system. The heterologous genes were expressed under the control of an IBV transcription-associated sequence (TAS) derived from gene 5 of IBV Beaudette. However, coronavirus D-RNA expression vectors display an inherent instability following serial passage with helper virus, resulting in the eventual loss of the heterologous genes. The use of the picornavirus encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence to initiate gene translation was investigated as an alternative method to the coronavirus-mediated TAS-controlled heterologous gene expression system. IBV D-RNAs containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene, under EMCV IRES control, were assessed for IRES-mediated CAT protein translation. CAT protein was detected from T7-derived IBV D-RNA transcripts in a cell-free protein synthesis system and in situ in avian chick kidney (CK) cells following T7-derived D-RNA synthesis from a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing the bacteriophage T7 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. However, CAT protein was not detected in CK cells from IRES-containing IBV D-RNAs, in which the IRES-CAT construct was inserted at two different positions within the D-RNA, in the presence of helper IBV. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the IRES-containing D-RNAs were not rescued on serial passage with helper virus, indicating that the EMCV IRES sequence had a detrimental effect on IBV D-RNA rescue.",0.021974018,0.036752187,-0.030781979,-0.05353278,0.007669651,0.042983275,-0.040772606,0.028697625,0.048684206,0.059155587,0.062831394,-0.005479501,-0.05397613,0.039491277,0.032658484,-0.05878218,-0.062544756,-0.05140633,-0.036340524,0.040072225,-0.048802976,0.023713633,-0.05427502,0.05730828,-0.018529363,0.04964493,0.054174483,0.026856557,-0.023098027,0.03420806,0.05231114,0.06278872,-0.007044952,-0.026863372,-0.008687289,0.040266186,-0.050750352,0.0051729,-0.061697934,0.032396656,0.0559814,-0.037471604,-0.028216917,-0.05503683,-0.06037031,-0.021606278,-0.014005222,-0.01971937,0.04526198,-0.047384314,0.04224213,0.011730097,-0.06256018,-0.060347162,-0.045897666,0.024349535,-0.055981543,-0.003265311,0.06189103,-0.05673915,0.055844102,0.03329293,-0.04156357,0.026031427,0.046980415,-0.062685244,0.05198917,-0.03220218,0.05775334,-0.024512088,-0.019846903,0.058047976,0.04491803,0.05686163,-0.049493857,-0.017965563,0.060403027,0.034367718,-0.06241644,-0.030969799,-0.05743091,0.062539384,0.030236656,0.008370998,-0.05438875,0.062659584,0.04845376,0.057582248,-0.05609559,-0.022321036,0.03769837,-0.03534248,-0.057491243,0.039822105,-0.030110449,0.040060613,0.030093519,0.060263585,0.062805295,-0.057758022,-0.056516334,0.032487143,-0.06005044,0.006005166,0.018330084,0.050651785,0.02520693,-0.029827397,-0.05429057,-0.009016028,-0.057447974,-0.055930477,0.036544528,0.038741812,0.053332735,0.043446325,-0.06148311,-0.03572398,-0.003758967,0.008795712,-0.05677774,0.061303806,0.056109045,-0.040014975,0.058350716,0.03224921,0.0204112,-0.029004838,0.02210894,0.05932371,-0.023613183,0.06283003,0.062347896,0.02267387,0.02167833,-0.062573195,-0.03283098,0.032762993,-0.061769202,0.02481344,0.022813752,0.06283158,-0.06271285,-0.04822909,-0.058487453,-0.06259377,0.03736298,-0.06072184,0.056190383,0.044204127,0.02843776,-0.062091406,-0.03964898,0.003704329,0.062825024,0.030502118,0.05145815,0.0622589,-0.02461801,0.03692533,0.004562928,-0.023869457,-0.05740872,0.01846687,0.047339864,-0.001089148,-0.054763857,-0.055875342,-0.055832826,-0.06198235,-0.037616637,-0.0620493,-0.037444744,0.006853566,-0.013775134,-0.055883303,-0.03681482,-0.053466942,0.059572138,0.027275715,0.000631567,-0.059425596,-0.05173261,0.019747023,0.059165485,-0.04301549,-0.054895353,0.06079713,0.060522355,-0.03155252,0.057193007,-0.049345158,0.020881759,-0.042626947,0.06250024,0.001144607,0.061404303,0.05338415,0.050222307,0.037204742,-0.05755904,0.02322421,-0.013771302,0.022214415,0.037546877,0.005326768,-0.047108132,0.062302135,0.0159882,0.06270099,0.010098612,0.062420115,0.061788656,0.03693256,-0.06215948,-0.0021332,0.028881298,0.050731607,-0.004728376,-0.00446775,-0.040930852,0.012251467,-0.038082797,0.025341805,0.038988627,-0.010707668,-0.05936042,-0.056718655,-0.02268989,0.000468312,-0.053243656,0.002769148,-0.020808604,-0.062827736,0.058442805,0.03580259,0.05428628,-0.06226736,-0.062387183,0.04417188,0.04842019,-0.056806225,0.006983421,0.006682358,0.04737718,-0.01351011,-0.043340936,-0.007019009,0.05685265,-0.059032064,-0.062613875,0.024718344,-0.034039516,-0.016011253,0.062031157,-0.04368085,-0.05182797,0.06283226,-0.000228809,-0.008071219,0.031451706,0.043562375,-0.049555242,0.057846803,0.001951668,-0.026757043,-0.058647398,-0.058587823,-0.03994768,0.041821536,0.032362483,0.06266628,0.016352983,-0.056001537,0.033033367,-0.051053558,-0.014895452,0.05496682,0.061972182,-0.053693876,-0.056264244,-0.04457256,-0.01603957,0.049446452,-0.040318266,-0.01084125,-0.055474322,0.062407073,-0.05371423,-0.035557777,0.06275385,-0.03951748,0.06225179,-0.041235298,-0.044634145,-0.060770843,-0.06101801,0.04929433,-0.062773116,0.02050477,-0.023257395,0.058766395,-0.012454619,0.04614935,-0.061005343,0.047467567,0.04728005,-0.05252583,0.052176647,-0.04282157,0.03745667,-0.040970024,-0.01397832,-0.05961453,0.029732926,0.044182416,0.018630791,-0.020748895,-0.021357896,0.025532363,-0.055050176,-0.04353107,0.048934773,-0.051695455,-0.013445103,0.05553446,-0.062118176,-0.059860025,-0.026766872,-0.05475989,0.058415145,-0.021118673,0.049296696,0.062179897,0.05324965,0.018866733,0.028141595,0.041638885,0.052760135,0.002359162,-0.032436166,-0.052092224,0.047087077,0.013402939,-0.062801644,-0.062473748,-0.02255131,0.044162344,0.026180418,-0.022897055,0.015688729,0.005026558,-0.036154747,0.043069534,0.05170446,0.00483027,-0.0628247,-0.047374055,0.023476265,-0.060869124,0.034174036,-0.058417533,-0.061022997,0.012265538,0.05465525,0.020926295,0.06277261,-0.000342957,0.06256974,0.023701815,0.05500985,0.032033674,-0.042672228,-0.062776774,0.050161913,0.059159566,0.048115075,-0.017853798,-0.007071728,-0.059516996,-0.061215978,-0.019483775,0.010540898,-0.001128621,0.008082008,-0.06086108,-0.062110737,-0.061415326,0.006456853,0.001412583,0.01438792,-0.05175637,0.061968695,-0.002562306,0.018972518,0.05982132,0.014179646,-0.059190053,0.05983039,-0.06264304,0.057995964,0.04637977,0.05715246,0.015341011,0.029303614,-0.033314127,-0.043771505,-0.031561185,0.058173902,0.04836065,0.044072878,-0.

"Characterization of the Expression, Intracellular Localization, and Replication Complex Association of the Putative Mouse Hepatitis Virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase","Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) RNA synthesis is mediated by a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) on membrane-bound replication complexes in the host cell cytoplasm. However, it is not known how the putative MHV RdRp (Pol) is targeted to and retained on cellular membranes. In this report, we show that a 100-kDa protein was stably detected by an anti-Pol antiserum as a mature product throughout the virus life cycle. Gradient fractionation and biochemical extraction experiments demonstrated that Pol was not an integral membrane protein but was tightly associated with membranes and coimmunoprecipitated with the replicase proteins 3CLpro, p22, and p12. By immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, Pol colocalized with viral proteins at replication complexes, distinct from sites of virion assembly, over the entire course of infection. To determine if Pol associated with cellular membranes in the absence of other viral factors, the pol domain of gene 1 was cloned and expressed in cells as a fusion with green fluorescent protein, termed Gpol. In Gpol-expressing cells that were infected with MHV, but not in mock-infected cells, Gpol relocalized from a diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm to punctate foci that colocalized with markers for replication complexes. Expression of Gpol deletion mutants established that the conserved enzymatic domains of Pol were dispensable for replication complex association, but a 38-amino-acid domain in the RdRp unique region of Pol was required. This study demonstrates that viral or virus-induced factors are necessary for Pol to associate with membranes of replication complexes, and it identifies a defined region of Pol that may mediate its

Functional Analysis of Mosquito-Borne Flavivirus Conserved Sequence Elements within 3′ Untranslated Region of West Nile Virus by Use of a Reporting Replicon That Differentiates between Viral Translation and RNA Replication,"We have developed a reporting replicon of West Nile virus (WNV) that could be used to quantitatively distinguish viral translation and RNA replication. A Renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene was fused in-frame with the open reading frame of a subgenomic replicon in the position where the viral structural region was deleted, resulting in RlucRep. Transfection of BHK cells with RlucRep RNA yielded two distinctive Rluc signal peaks, one between 2 and 10 h and the other after 26 h posttransfection. By contrast, only the 2- to 10-h Rluc signal peak was observed in cells transfected with a mutant replicon containing an inactivated viral polymerase NS5 (RlucRep-NS5mt). Immunofluorescence and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assays showed that the levels of viral protein expression and RNA replication increased in cells transfected with the RlucRep but not in those transfected with the RlucRep-NS5mt. These results suggest that the Rluc signal that occurred at 2 to 10 h posttransfection reflects viral translation of the input replicon, while the Rluc activity after 26 h posttransfection represents RNA replication. Using this system, we showed that mutations of conserved sequence (CS) elements within the 3′ untranslated region of the mosquito-borne flaviviruses did not significantly affect WNV translation but severely diminished or completely abolished RNA replication. Mutations of CS1 that blocked the potential base pairing with a conserved sequence in the 5′ region of the capsid gene (5′CS) abolished RNA replication. Restoration of the 5′CS-CS1 interaction rescued viral replication. Replicons containing individual deletions of CS2, repeated CS2 (RCS2), CS3, or RCS3 were viable, but their RNA replication was dramatically compromised. These results demonstrate that genome cyclization through the 5′CS-CS1 interaction is essential for WNV RNA replication, whereas CS2, RCS2, CS3, and RCS3 facilitate, but are dispensable for, WNV

Reverse Transcription-PCR Assays for Detection of Bovine Enteric Caliciviruses (BEC) and Analysis of the Genetic Relationships among BEC and Human Caliciviruses,"Two genetically distinct bovine enteric caliciviruses (BECs) have been identified: the norovirus (NLV) Jena and Newbury Agent-2 (NA-2) BECs, which are genetically related to human noroviruses, and the Nebraska (NB) BECs, which is related to sapoviruses and lagoviruses but may also represent a new calicivirus genus. The prevalence of these two BEC genotypes in cattle is unknown. Although reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) primers for human NLV recognize NLV-BECs, the genetic relationships between NLV from humans and the NLV-BECs commonly circulating in cattle is undefined. In the present study, veal calf fecal samples were assayed for enteric caliciviruses by using six RT-PCR primer sets designed for the detection of human NLVs or BECs. Caliciviruses genetically related to the NLV-BEC Jena and NA-2 strains or to the recently characterized NB BEC strain were identified in three of four and four of four sampled veal herds, respectively. Extended 3′-terminal genome sequences of two NLV-BECs, designated CV95-OH and CV186-OH, encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; open reading frame 1 [ORF-1]), VP1 (ORF-2), and VP2 (ORF-3) genes were determined. Phylogenetic and sequence identity analyses of each genome region demonstrated these viruses to be most closely related to the NLV-BEC Jena and NA-2 strains. In initial testing, the human P289-P290 (P289/290) primer set was found to be the most sensitive for calicivirus detection. However, its failure to identify all positive fecal pools (as determined by other assays) led us to design two new primer sets, CBECU-F/R and NBU-F/R, for the sensitive and specific detection of NLV-BEC (NLV-BEC Jena and NA-2) and BEC-NB-like viruses, respectively. The RT-PCR assays with the new primers were compared against other primer sets, including P289/290. Composite results of the tests completed by using the new assays identified 72% (54 of 75) of veal calf fecal samples as positive, with 21 of 21 sequenced reaction products specific for the target RdRp gene. The same design strategy used for the new BEC assays may also be applicable to the design of similar assays for the detection of human caliciviruses (HuCVs). Our data support the genetic relationship between NLV-BECs and NLV-HuCVs but with the NLV-BECs comprising two clusters within a third NLV

An Alternate Pathway for Recruiting Template RNA to the Brome Mosaic Virus RNA Replication Complex,"The multidomain RNA replication protein 1a of brome mosaic virus (BMV), a positive-strand RNA virus in the alphavirus-like superfamily, plays key roles in assembly and function of the viral RNA replication complex. 1a, which encodes RNA capping and helicase-like domains, localizes to endoplasmic reticulum membranes, recruits BMV 2a polymerase and viral RNA templates, and forms membrane-bound, capsid-like spherules in which RNA replication occurs. cis-acting signals necessary and sufficient for RNA recruitment by 1a have been mapped in BMV genomic RNA2 and RNA3. Both signals comprise an extended stem-loop whose apex matches the conserved sequence and structure of the TΨC stem-loop in tRNAs (box B). Mutations show that this box B motif is crucial to 1a responsiveness of wild-type RNA2 and RNA3. We report here that, unexpectedly, some chimeric mRNAs expressing the 2a polymerase open reading frame from RNA2 were recruited by 1a to the replication complex and served as templates for negative-strand RNA synthesis, despite lacking the normally essential, box B-containing 5′ signal. Further studies showed that this template recruitment required high-efficiency translation of the RNA templates. Moreover, multiple small frameshifting insertion or deletion mutations throughout the N-terminal region of the open reading frame inhibited this template recruitment, while an in-frame insertion did not. Providing 2a in trans did not restore template recruitment of RNAs with frameshift mutations. Only those deletions in the N-terminal region of 2a that abolished 2a interaction with 1a abolished template recruitment of the RNA. These and other results indicate that this alternate pathway for 1a-dependent RNA recruitment involves 1a interaction with the translating mRNA via the 1a-interactive N-terminal region of the nascent 2a polypeptide. Interaction with nascent 2a also may be involved in 1a recruitment of 2a polymerase to

Coronaviruses Maintain Viability despite Dramatic Rearrangements of the Strictly Conserved Genome Organization,"Despite their high frequency of RNA recombination, the plus-strand coronaviruses have a characteristic, strictly conserved genome organization with the essential genes occurring in the order 5′-polymerase (pol)-S-E-M-N-3′. We have investigated the significance of this remarkable conservation by rearrangement of the murine coronavirus genome through targeted recombination. Thus, viruses were prepared with the following gene order: 5′-pol-S-M-E-N-3′, 5′-pol-S-N-E-M-3′, 5′-pol-M-S-E-N-3′, and 5′-pol-E-M-S-N-3′. All of these viruses were surprisingly viable, and most viruses replicated in cell culture with growth characteristics similar to those of the parental virus. The recombinant virus with the gene order 5′-pol-E-M-S-N-3′ was also tested for the ability to replicate in the natural host, the mouse. The results indicate that the canonical coronavirus genome organization is not essential for replication in vitro and in vivo. Deliberate rearrangement of the viral genes may be useful in the generation of attenuated coronaviruses, which due to their reduced risk of generating viable viruses by recombination with circulating field viruses, would make safer

Molecular Characterization Confirms the Presence of a Divergent Strain of Canine Coronavirus (UWSMN-1) in Australia,"Canine coronavirus (CCV) UWSMN-1 was originally identified from an outbreak of fatal gastroenteritis in breeding colonies. In this report, we examined whether UWSMN-1 represents a novel divergent strain or is the result of recombination events between canine and feline coronavirus strains. Sequencing of various regions of the spike and polymerase genes confirms that UWSMN-1 is widely divergent from other CCV and feline coronavirus strains. These data raise the possibility that this strain is the first member of a novel third subtype of

Molecular and Seroepidemiological Evidence of Canine Calicivirus Infections in Japan,"Calicivirus infection of dogs was epidemiologically investigated by using canine calicivirus (CaCV) strain 48 as a reference.

The Synthesis of Minus-Strand RNA of Bamboo Mosaic Potexvirus Initiates from Multiple Sites within the Poly(A) Tail,"The 3′ terminus of the bamboo mosaic potexvirus (BaMV) contains a poly(A) tail, the 5′ portion of which participates in the formation of an RNA pseudoknot required for BaMV RNA replication. Recombinant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of BaMV binds to the pseudoknot poly(A) tail in gel mobility shift assays (C.-Y. Huang, Y.-L. Huang, M. Meng, Y.-H. Hsu, and C.-H. Tsai, J. Virol. 75:2818-2824, 2001). Approximately 20 nucleotides of the poly(A) tail adjacent to the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) are protected from diethylpyrocarbonate modification, suggesting that this region may be used to initiate minus-strand RNA synthesis. The 5′ terminus of the minus-strand RNA synthesized by the RdRp in vitro was examined using 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and DNA sequencing. Minus-strand RNA synthesis was found to initiate from several positions within the poly(A) tail, with the highest frequency of initiation being from the 7th to the 10th adenylates counted from the 5′-most adenylate of the poly(A) tail. Sequence analyses of BaMV progeny RNAs recovered from Nicotiana benthamiana protoplasts which were inoculated with mutants containing a mutation at the 1st, 4th, 7th, or 16th position of the poly(A) tail suggested the existence of variable initiation sites, similar to those found in 5′ RACE experiments.

Reverse Genetics System for the Avian Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus,"Major advances in the study of the molecular biology of RNA viruses have resulted from the ability to generate and manipulate full-length genomic cDNAs of the viral genomes with the subsequent synthesis of infectious RNA for the generation of recombinant viruses. Coronaviruses have the largest RNA virus genomes and, together with genetic instability of some cDNA sequences in Escherichia coli, this has hampered the generation of a reverse-genetics system for this group of viruses. In this report, we describe the assembly of a full-length cDNA from the positive-sense genomic RNA of the avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an important poultry pathogen. The IBV genomic cDNA was assembled immediately downstream of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter by in vitro ligation and cloned directly into the vaccinia virus genome. Infectious IBV RNA was generated in situ after the transfection of restricted recombinant vaccinia virus DNA into primary chick kidney cells previously infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase. Recombinant IBV, containing two marker mutations, was recovered from the transfected cells. These results describe a reverse-genetics system for studying the molecular biology of IBV and establish a paradigm for generating genetically defined vaccines for

"Molecular Determinants of Virulence, Cell Tropism, and Pathogenic Phenotype of Infectious Bursal Disease Virus","Infectious bursal disease viruses (IBDVs), belonging to the family Birnaviridae, exhibit a wide range of immunosuppressive potential, pathogenicity, and virulence for chickens. The genomic segment A encodes all the structural (VP2, VP4, and VP3) and nonstructural proteins, whereas segment B encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (VP1). To identify the molecular determinants for the virulence, pathogenic phenotype, and cell tropism of IBDV, we prepared full-length cDNA clones of a virulent strain, Irwin Moulthrop (IM), and constructed several chimeric cDNA clones of segments A and B between the attenuated vaccine strain (D78) and the virulent IM or GLS variant strain. Using the cRNA-based reverse-genetics system developed for IBDV, we generated five chimeric viruses after transfection by electroporation procedures in Vero or chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells, one of which was recovered after propagation in embryonated eggs. To evaluate the characteristics of the recovered viruses in vivo, we inoculated 3-week-old chickens with D78, IM, GLS, or chimeric viruses and analyzed their bursae for pathological lesions 3 days postinfection. Viruses in which VP4, VP4-VP3, and VP1 coding sequences of the virulent strain IM were substituted for the corresponding region in the vaccine strain failed to induce hemorrhagic lesions in the bursa. In contrast, viruses in which the VP2 coding region of the vaccine strain was replaced with the variant GLS or virulent IM strain caused rapid bursal atrophy or hemorrhagic lesions in the bursa, as seen with the variant or classical virulent strain, respectively. These results show that the virulence and pathogenic-phenotype markers of IBDV reside in VP2. Moreover, one of the chimeric viruses containing VP2 sequences of the virulent strain could not be recovered in Vero or CEF cells but was recovered in embryonated eggs, suggesting that VP2 contains the determinants for cell tropism. Similarly, one of the chimeric viruses containing the VP1 segment of the virulent strain could not be recovered in Vero cells but was recovered in CEF cells, suggesting that VP1 contains the determinants for cell-specific replication in Vero cells. By comparing the deduced amino acid sequences of the D78 and IM strains and their reactivities with monoclonal antibody 21, which binds specifically to virulent IBDV, the putative amino acids involved in virulence and cell tropism were identified. Our results indicate that residues Gln at position 253 (Gln253), Asp279, and Ala284 of VP2 are involved in the virulence, cell tropism, and pathogenic phenotype of virulent

Structural Analysis of the −1 Ribosomal Frameshift Elements in Giardiavirus mRNA,"The RNA polymerase of giardiavirus (GLV) is synthesized as a fusion protein through a −1 ribosomal frameshift in a region where gag and pol open reading frames (ORFs) overlap. A heptamer, CCCUUUA, and a potential pseudoknot found in the overlap were predicted to be required for the frameshift. A 68-nucleotide (nt) cDNA fragment containing these elements was inserted between the GLV 5′ 631-nt cDNA and the out-of-frame luciferase gene that required a −1 frameshift within the 68-nt fragment for expression. Giardia lamblia trophozoites transfected with the transcript of this construct showed a frameshift frequency at 1.7%, coinciding with the polymerase-to-capsid protein ratio in GLV. The heptamer is required for the frameshift but can be replaced with other sequences of the same motif. Mutations placing stop codons in the 0 or −1 frame, located directly before or after the heptamer, implicated the latter as the site for the −1 frameshift. Shortening or destroying the putative stem decreased the frameshift efficiency threefold; the efficiency was fully recovered by mutations to restore the stem. Deleting 18 nt from the 3′ end of the 68-nt fragment, which formed the second stem in the putative pseudoknot, had no effect on the frequency of the frameshift. Chemical probing of the RNA secondary structure in the frameshift region showed that bases resistant to chemical modification were clustered in the putative stem structures, thus confirming the presence of the postulated stem-loop, while all the bases in the loop were chemically modified, thus ruling out their capability of forming a pseudoknot. These results confirmed the conclusion based on data from the mutation study that there is but a simple stem-loop downstream from the heptamer. Together, they constitute the structural elements for a −1 ribosomal frameshift in the GLV

Downstream Sequences Influence the Choice between a Naturally Occurring Noncanonical and Closely Positioned Upstream Canonical Heptameric Fusion Motif during Bovine Coronavirus Subgenomic mRNA Synthesis,"Mechanisms leading to subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) synthesis in coronaviruses are poorly understood but are known to involve a heptameric signaling motif, originally called the intergenic sequence. The intergenic sequence is the presumed crossover region (fusion site) for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) during discontinuous transcription, a process leading to sgmRNAs that are both 5′ and 3′ coterminal. In the bovine coronavirus, the major fusion site for synthesis of mRNA 5 (GGUAGAC) does not conform to the canonical motif (UC[U,C]AAAC) at three positions (underlined), yet it lies just 14 nucleotides downstream from such a sequence (UCCAAAC). The infrequently used canonical sequence, by computer prediction, is buried within the stem of a stable hairpin (−17.2 kcal/mol). Here we document the existence of this stem by enzyme probing and examine its influence and that of neighboring sequences on the unusual choice of fusion sites by analyzing transcripts made in vivo from mutated defective interfering RNA constructs. We learned that (i) mutations that were predicted to unfold the stem-loop in various ways did not switch RdRp crossover to the upstream canonical site, (ii) a totally nonconforming downstream motif resulted in no measurable transcription from either site, (iii) the canonical upstream site does not function ectopically to lend competence to the downstream noncanonical site, and (iv) altering flanking sequences downstream of the downstream noncanonical motif in ways that diminish sequence similarity with the virus genome 5′ end caused a dramatic switch to the upstream canonical site. These results show that sequence elements downstream of the noncanonical site can dramatically influence the choice of fusion sites for synthesis of mRNA 5 and are interpreted as being most consistent with a mechanism of similarity-assisted RdRp strand switching during minus-strand synthesis.",0.013418702,-0.035323743,-0.03347529,-0.05634024,0.052959908,-0.003034817,0.028716223,0.041596714,0.001236582,0.058473647,0.051657755,0.02124141,-0.05378466,0.050375316,0.058427576,-0.052579824,0.051102392,-0.049241547,0.003825503,0.041225363,-0.05595435,0.057379242,-0.051461276,0.05861158,-0.021778831,0.055752274,0.059718743,0.04869399,-0.044929717,-0.012494839,0.043758128,-0.03657059,-0.02534193,-0.044228334,0.022067985,0.0559165,-0.058875185,0.056382954,-0.059425138,0.024119712,0.05179743,-0.035556782,0.0185,-0.057593714,0.042865567,0.026601631,0.029448502,-0.034609098,-0.015448039,-0.038915884,-0.03591958,0.05591732,-0.058395196,-0.059586972,-0.018602226,-0.044428416,-0.04397938,0.027397608,0.058979955,-0.038752183,-0.001429163,0.018846001,0.056908034,-0.010847144,-0.05705833,-0.05966796,0.058403645,-0.04575869,0.0019182,-0.034680415,0.023586895,0.051323365,0.039950866,0.058975145,-0.010276457,0.024416827,0.05556941,0.05703646,-0.055614598,0.024888657,-0.05265883,0.058673076,-0.05219204,-0.031931765,-0.051874757,0.05474834,0.05737648,-0.001328278,-0.058888685,0.028603751,0.015523592,-0.010379466,-0.03209019,0.019751709,-0.05079523,0.05257265,0.056535937,0.05948472,0.059664197,-0.040045246,0.043384004,0.04625203,-0.01591785,-0.024818953,-0.050194103,0.046310537,0.029136617,-0.027091011,0.001672251,-0.058751855,-0.05868952,-0.056340218,-0.040085837,-0.019912073,0.058685694,0.042898003,-0.05929742,0.029072685,-0.048072204,0.045793097,-0.025765413,0.048351,0.048703894,-0.05383939,0.05680608,0.05211005,0.028576251,0.013526682,-0.021954807,0.05920932,0.029860184,0.05921274,0.059500027,-0.008059595,0.016419051,-0.059341628,-0.057278648,0.047340184,-0.059020493,-0.042299293,-0.05061943,0.059746273,-0.0596197,0.007729777,-0.04813488,-0.059427008,-0.04820951,-0.056394093,0.03482384,0.03690584,-0.058582272,-0.04738213,-0.039483175,-0.0509868,0.05974579,0.053111088,0.005996932,0.05945754,0.04323723,-0.022332191,-0.04503281,-0.05534087,0.002207503,0.059575867,-0.019803973,0.0436957,-0.058234632,0.045450885,-0.048574544,-0.056358524,0.057291403,0.034034625,-0.014485665,-0.042873986,0.050043005,-0.013597276,-0.030580642,0.010441607,0.05916061,-0.05347865,0.049893636,-0.058188807,-0.028185118,0.051022686,0.04459382,-0.057668276,-0.0594155,0.05477901,0.051969223,0.010980319,0.059316073,-0.051797435,0.031882998,-0.003204754,0.058765337,0.016944598,0.055637486,-0.01818151,0.05442322,-0.033829134,0.026626097,0.045826215,-0.014031842,-0.010136898,0.036396522,-0.029586472,-0.04655685,0.059104957,-0.008439215,0.05971516,-0.044880703,0.057467543,0.059108414,0.05665612,-0.058867246,0.014315737,0.010969233,0.04751362,-0.03601401,0.048921935,0.030232232,-0.058687393,-0.048861038,0.038993124,0.023178367,-0.05137038,-0.059654754,-0.05408551,-0.014447762,0.037264436,-0.058518443,0.027535042,0.043151792,-0.059746463,0.058986697,0.053610057,0.05793981,-0.058541503,-0.058822908,0.04903156,0.028524294,-0.033788014,-0.059282716,-0.021573383,0.055487815,0.00329072,-0.054785155,0.05483123,0.047721922,0.028785799,-0.05973658,0.051106673,-0.02575276,-0.014294013,0.056666102,-0.028582726,-0.053043257,0.05974649,-0.002798837,0.005544783,0.01100489,-0.035346933,-0.02609258,0.05817627,0.053663976,0.025059734,-0.005151886,-0.016157495,0.025178002,-0.04901619,0.044097774,0.05951445,0.032321148,0.05928676,0.022386927,0.024644775,-0.037283115,0.056582574,0.059567485,-0.010994038,-0.05118431,-0.053672396,-0.058061123,0.05668933,0.012363881,-0.05477733,-0.05693794,0.057574883,-0.012759622,0.006584249,0.059734136,-0.055414636,0.05723452,-0.057150297,-0.015843803,-0.05493464,-0.037273094,-0.006539085,-0.057387628,0.043495134,-0.044950824,0.058540784,0.05299257,0.051825896,0.005737575,0.059362292,-0.051948972,-0.057552453,0.05455173,0.05038128,0.05826395,-0.03691259,0.05580918,-0.058656514,0.054001488,0.043289296,-0.046965636,0.03562421,0.056260888,0.019591913,-0.05651911,0.005201347,0.02216965,-0.0584726,-0.028776668,-0.05942447,-0.057318226,-0.05644448,-0.02118368,-0.003036422,-0.006868156,-0.009855207,-0.004648133,0.059180755,0.015002541,0.025780996,0.011355327,0.04848826,0.01239721,0.022596734,-0.030232295,-0.056183785,0.030017544,-0.040116567,-0.059746105,-0.053526267,-0.025631147,-0.028500967,0.03739991,-0.04506723,-0.04037013,0.041271888,-0.059145138,-0.00340128,0.05049426,0.04317544,-0.059746187,-0.052039556,-0.035893507,-0.058942765,0.048154075,-0.059507743,-0.040999662,0.04074655,0.043333977,0.029474424,0.059643235,0.051304024,0.055910952,-0.035651356,-0.045769867,0.039491776,-0.044289745,-0.059744913,-0.005408279,0.015907591,-0.014514529,0.05371447,-0.05415936,-0.059105106,-0.055092953,0.007543121,0.034545574,-0.030445218,0.01355486,-0.058665104,-0.045194644,-0.058278453,0.04239127,-0.005125324,0.04117637,-0.02325438,0.05970498,-0.043664802,-0.029632157,0.053207487,0.042850763,-0.044618644,-0.01853475,-0.04678901,0.047505107,-0.05684167,0.05398802,0.016245808,0.002295367,-0.05532895,0.002242176,-0.018607777,-0.022624614,0.058463283

Induction of Caspase-Dependent Apoptosis in Cultured Cells by the Avian Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus,"Avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the causative agent of chicken infectious bronchitis, an acute, highly contagious viral respiratory disease. Replication of IBV in Vero cells causes extensive cytopathic effects (CPE), leading to destruction of the entire monolayer and the death of infected cells. In this study, we investigated the cell death processes during acute IBV infection and the underlying mechanisms. The results show that both necrosis and apoptosis may contribute to the death of infected cells in lytic IBV infection. Caspase-dependent apoptosis, as characterized by chromosomal condensation, DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase degradation, was detected in IBV-infected Vero cells. Addition of the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK to the culture media showed inhibition of the hallmarks of apoptosis and increase of the release of virus to the culture media at 16 h postinfection. However, neither the necrotic process nor the productive replication of IBV in Vero cells was severely affected by the inhibition of apoptosis. Screening of 11 IBV-encoded proteins suggested that a 58-kDa mature cleavage product could induce apoptotic changes in cells transiently expressing the protein. This study adds one more example to the growing list of animal viruses that induce apoptosis during their replication

Biogenesis of the Semliki Forest Virus RNA Replication Complex,"The nonstructural (ns) proteins nsP1 to -4, the components of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) RNA polymerase, were localized in infected cells by confocal microscopy using double labeling with specific antisera against the individual ns proteins. All ns proteins were associated with large cytoplasmic vacuoles (CPV), the inner surfaces of which were covered by small invaginations, or spherules, typical of alphavirus infection. All ns proteins were localized by immuno-electron microscopy (EM) to the limiting membranes of CPV and to the spherules, together with newly labeled viral RNA. Along with earlier observations by EM-autoradiography (P. M. Grimley, I. K. Berezesky, and R. M. Friedman, J. Virol. 2:326–338, 1968), these results suggest that individual spherules represent template-associated RNA polymerase complexes. Immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled ns proteins showed that each antiserum precipitated the other three ns proteins, implying that they functioned as a complex. Double labeling with organelle-specific and anti-ns-protein antisera showed that CPV were derivatives of late endosomes and lysosomes. Indeed, CPV frequently contained endocytosed bovine serum albumin-coated gold particles, introduced into the medium at different times after infection. With time, increasing numbers of spherules were also observed on the cell surfaces; they were occasionally released into the medium, probably by secretory lysosomes. We suggest that the spherules arise by primary assembly of the RNA replication complexes at the plasma membrane, guided there by nsP1, which has affinity to lipids specific for the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Endosomal recycling and fusion of CPV with the plasma membrane can circulate spherules between the plasma membrane and the endosomal-lysosomal compartment.",0.02859244,0.047732018,-0.030139748,-0.059812002,0.046966564,0.059294917,0.054985393,-0.040022332,-0.04113578,0.053667545,0.06163214,0.003586314,-0.06123831,0.04613126,0.037248053,-0.061584767,-0.060037505,0.038455393,-0.00943082,-0.033287663,-0.05541376,-0.036427166,-0.046515577,0.006955,0.03215866,0.032089517,0.05323507,-0.022276647,-0.060846698,-0.010978019,-0.016919179,0.05898608,0.048629675,-0.06149588,9.13E-05,0.005604689,0.008057552,0.058421437,-0.047211904,0.037329286,0.057344336,-0.021259263,-0.02658584,-0.059252426,0.05827546,-0.034579873,-0.02208585,-0.028233431,0.013934944,0.001936159,-0.031964768,-0.049414795,-0.05732073,-0.049837224,-0.030894356,0.048576985,-0.061295073,-0.013722007,0.05714835,-0.043552496,0.030916218,0.026678367,0.060327504,0.035419744,0.045939155,-0.060191736,0.058435638,-0.017216507,0.060784858,0.040837947,0.03704118,0.035899792,0.06072066,0.036831085,4.30E-05,0.034123763,0.06132792,-0.019207217,-0.05877869,0.052261055,-0.05848745,0.06070345,-0.041081835,-0.029562784,-0.056456823,0.05715873,0.031033529,0.041121747,-0.041233215,0.01372743,-0.005924358,-0.03103209,-0.048205066,-0.038849033,0.031273853,0.059193693,0.056630865,0.060909737,0.06162175,0.005575924,-0.05805536,0.043666296,0.015832989,0.04717256,0.059156913,0.041170843,0.02019551,0.040457956,-0.0259683,-0.026868034,-0.018094912,0.055094544,0.017552977,0.06026279,0.059486985,-0.025368264,0.02331436,-0.025921777,-0.047198787,-0.002487927,-0.058745444,0.06117574,0.030677892,-0.032259263,0.053143043,0.056251224,-0.024606496,0.028515212,-0.044153553,0.014690578,0.018428873,0.061643828,0.06076228,-0.002132071,0.0377782,-0.043882016,0.04458945,0.04101083,-0.020000266,0.005348953,-0.054627918,0.06164362,-0.05702063,-0.052894734,-0.015293695,-0.04972662,-0.025764633,-0.061405953,-0.047297273,0.0601832,-0.014519723,-0.061615665,-0.05181877,0.009623132,0.061643824,0.045231614,0.02060185,0.018443223,0.023660166,0.04270407,0.05071364,0.015150596,-0.055245776,0.052157827,-0.028928287,0.035540864,-0.008542228,-0.019665716,-0.05527868,-0.059750054,0.008930833,0.005672753,-0.03634806,0.05167333,0.015309983,0.022553038,0.024406869,-0.0460012,0.05869209,-0.03163555,-0.0468468,0.027743481,-0.056246646,-0.004564496,0.049395032,-0.022566237,-0.060379025,0.057218734,0.010025946,-0.0571772,0.05776113,-0.055358708,-0.03772742,0.057107937,0.06159701,-0.055215947,-0.000488453,-0.05843633,-0.029782366,-0.023018692,-0.041752063,0.05872491,-0.018629132,-0.03430925,0.02617605,-0.029328164,0.03896851,0.05856924,-0.001281673,0.03676137,-0.028281327,-0.012548188,-0.018597266,0.007178512,-0.06157825,-0.054873187,0.043484163,0.001415385,-0.055921204,0.05279279,-0.006874675,-0.034188993,0.017446114,0.040694106,-0.009611696,0.05377967,-0.058626518,-0.045567475,-0.000455828,0.016624454,0.03975872,0.035827804,0.041962788,-0.0616398,0.061461292,0.059186414,0.02250278,-0.06017502,-0.047118776,0.0509394,0.01714601,-0.020737331,-0.034962606,0.045567892,0.017953623,-0.059822246,0.019324739,0.05686031,0.041157067,-0.025408518,-0.06153432,0.046698835,-0.014194218,0.003485619,0.061561123,-0.055213157,-0.03208937,0.061643843,-0.061012164,-0.000229185,0.050965764,0.00921837,-0.039177686,0.0450845,-0.015856644,0.047940407,0.04579428,0.025309572,-0.03802562,0.04519401,0.054510083,0.061409514,0.021761004,0.05850874,0.043327108,-0.016076792,-0.04968543,0.006595054,0.061438322,0.038910706,-0.053240437,-0.0182545,-0.01502029,0.053353276,-0.02740777,-0.042708024,0.053585615,0.055941343,-0.05982729,0.026810436,0.06162263,-0.050214645,0.059996873,-0.0018529,-0.05105922,-0.060475897,-0.02737386,-0.054461982,-0.061245706,0.019594625,-0.018923981,0.06152704,0.03998564,0.04187264,-0.048665576,-0.013036061,-0.03495474,-0.03801663,0.04377171,-0.058907114,0.026330626,0.034441244,0.043246225,-0.055938102,0.057355005,0.039506003,-0.03600201,-0.025430826,0.06142428,-0.010704424,-0.050366167,0.005387156,0.0585695,-0.060662884,0.010814947,-0.00310414,0.010567895,-0.043105133,0.03932,-0.047272827,0.04732122,0.05343797,0.020320201,0.061319992,0.05597981,-0.021584602,0.04920338,-0.054864615,-0.002424876,-0.057920035,-0.014618199,-0.04233194,0.04850549,0.05638432,-0.0616435,-0.061643664,0.027947124,0.044150252,-0.038656067,-0.054895245,-0.033553366,0.059933964,-0.059577513,-0.000232888,0.014206734,-0.04492292,-0.0616429,-0.02364236,-0.055600062,-0.042963848,0.05643008,-0.060010795,-0.060049117,-0.046272,0.032183602,-0.025876151,0.06162628,0.03314706,0.059604485,0.048078734,0.050515518,-0.059107695,-0.03755569,-0.06164384,0.05376957,0.056079917,0.009225379,-0.01452616,-0.034586232,-0.060733467,-0.06164338,0.04118351,0.0183049,-0.046026476,0.024505872,-0.06074278,-0.03762587,-0.057570327,0.014672648,-0.020939823,0.05507029,-0.003428547,0.058077786,-0.057108525,-0.036020983,-0.050890945,0.039488025,-0.05307841,0.05017514,-0.057443075,0.05653252,0.03679234,0.040606026,-0.05168403,0.008570701,-0.038334265,-0.054118752,0.03237759,0.043749016,0.025489094,0.02238194,-0.054076873,-0.0

Sequences at the 3′ Untranslated Region of Bamboo Mosaic Potexvirus RNA Interact with the Viral RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase,"The 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of bamboo mosaic potexvirus (BaMV) genomic RNA was found to fold into a series of stem-loop structures including a pseudoknot structure. These structures were demonstrated to be important for viral RNA replication and were believed to be recognized by the replicase (C.-P. Cheng and C.-H. Tsai, J. Mol. Biol. 288:555–565, 1999). Electrophoretic mobility shift and competition assays have now been used to demonstrate that the Escherichia coli-expressed RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain (Δ893) derived from BaMV open reading frame 1 could specifically bind to the 3′ UTR of BaMV RNA. No competition was observed when bovine liver tRNAs or poly(I)(C) double-stranded homopolymers were used as competitors, and the cucumber mosaic virus 3′ UTR was a less efficient competitor. Competition analysis with different regions of the BaMV 3′ UTR showed that Δ893 binds to at least two independent RNA binding sites, stem-loop D and the poly(A) tail. Footprinting analysis revealed that Δ893 could protect the sequences at loop D containing the potexviral conserved hexamer motif and part of the stem of domain D from chemical

Mutation of Host Δ9 Fatty Acid Desaturase Inhibits Brome Mosaic Virus RNA Replication between Template Recognition and RNA Synthesis,"All positive-strand RNA viruses assemble their RNA replication complexes on intracellular membranes. Brome mosaic virus (BMV) replicates its RNA in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated complexes in plant cells and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. BMV encodes RNA replication factors 1a, with domains implicated in RNA capping and helicase functions, and 2a, with a central polymerase-like domain. Factor 1a interacts independently with the ER membrane, viral RNA templates, and factor 2a to form RNA replication complexes on the perinuclear ER. We show that BMV RNA replication is severely inhibited by a mutation in OLE1, an essential yeast chromosomal gene encoding Δ9 fatty acid desaturase, an integral ER membrane protein and the first enzyme in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. OLE1 deletion and medium supplementation show that BMV RNA replication requires unsaturated fatty acids, not the Ole1 protein, and that viral RNA replication is much more sensitive than yeast growth to reduced unsaturated fatty acid levels. In ole1 mutant yeast, 1a still becomes membrane associated, recruits 2a to the membrane, and recognizes and stabilizes viral RNA templates normally. However, RNA replication is blocked prior to initiation of negative-strand RNA synthesis. The results show that viral RNA synthesis is highly sensitive to lipid composition and suggest that proper membrane fluidity or plasticity is essential for an early step in RNA replication. The strong unsaturated fatty acid dependence also demonstrates that modulating fatty acid balance can be an effective antiviral

Structural requirements for efficient translational frameshifting in the synthesis of the putative viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of potato leafroll virus.,"The putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of potato leafroll luteovirus (PLRV) is expressed by -1 ribosomal frameshifting in the region where the open reading frames (ORF) of proteins 2a and 2b overlap. The signal responsible for efficient frameshift is composed of the slippery site UUUAAAU followed by a sequence that has the potential to adopt two alternative folding patterns, either a structure involving a pseudoknot, or a simple stem-loop structure. To investigate the structure requirements for efficient frameshifting, mutants in the stem-loop or in the potential pseudoknot regions of a Polish isolate of PLRV (PLRV-P) have been analyzed. Mutations that are located in the second stem (S2) of the potential pseudoknot structure, but are located in unpaired regions of the alternative stem-loop structure, reduce frameshift efficiency. Deletion of the 3' end sequence of the alternative stem-loop structure does not reduce frameshift efficiency. Our results confirm that -1 frameshift in the overlap region depends on the slippery site and on the downstream positioned sequence, and propose that in PLRV-P a pseudoknot is required for efficient frameshifting. These results are in agreement with those recently published for the closely related beet western yellows luteovirus (BWYV).",-0.01295007,-0.040178638,-0.05047421,-0.054672685,0.026372164,0.012984403,0.012948671,-0.04288999,-0.014269526,0.06233861,0.064177506,-0.000750247,-0.054866407,0.06656103,0.017919926,-0.060356338,-0.001028269,-0.03814871,-0.051711842,0.043320235,-0.0409041,0.0567207,-0.04714127,0.06256575,0.033074033,0.02348103,0.06284865,0.04053758,0.003839263,0.04734582,-0.016583879,-0.028658077,0.038977496,-0.01861148,-0.035780035,0.046066813,-0.042487998,0.06799025,-0.06779721,-0.019652141,0.033150498,-0.020846596,0.011067095,-0.060344968,-0.020593893,-0.02865016,0.027138356,-0.024508277,-0.04954144,-0.03453573,-0.04152755,0.054993495,-0.04114731,-0.06578112,-0.00220912,0.030188689,-0.06664981,-0.006689898,0.029935094,-0.052942455,-0.004808417,-0.048333764,0.06645078,-0.032134842,-0.002530089,-0.050212674,0.06516987,-0.028564746,0.021726573,-0.045934472,0.06011379,0.057999957,0.056058332,0.068370014,-0.018095696,0.047443654,0.06820181,0.062645294,-0.048209514,0.026092032,-0.03439222,0.06492743,-0.05077309,-0.038206656,-0.063855626,0.005207264,0.0314592,0.038434733,-0.03911841,0.05518123,0.011165016,-0.0025632,-0.06793644,0.028967267,-0.029421326,-0.021235595,0.048895594,0.056825504,0.067990445,-0.05379227,0.046686575,0.008394599,0.054874048,0.027704857,-0.001511855,0.007880079,0.016112182,0.061260864,0.015894357,-0.001835797,-0.006336205,0.052991904,-0.029728644,0.038469177,0.031025242,0.011945374,-0.056803968,0.058771063,0.025734374,-0.022651732,-0.04098431,0.065162756,0.056712482,-0.05762655,0.059759386,-0.03437198,0.034554206,0.040995304,-0.05034234,0.003152647,-0.002759238,0.0680297,0.05911728,0.045697108,0.050403345,-0.061005935,-0.06021516,0.016698703,-0.044044897,0.03212449,-0.02250164,0.069418445,-0.05840587,-0.037492417,-0.033192687,-0.066026464,-0.00264802,-0.041584104,0.010242256,0.03128719,-0.06718037,-0.04131303,-0.062028367,0.005569333,0.0694137,0.062155493,-0.042710975,0.068274185,0.007739331,0.052566294,-0.046658453,-0.043933284,-0.005237947,0.069252454,0.024681363,0.035117168,-0.033390608,-0.028612714,-0.046589658,-0.030336658,0.037156947,0.03116613,-0.057996888,0.026824676,0.022815911,0.042820375,-0.001448882,-0.00322093,0.058605596,-0.041473463,-0.037633643,0.02722054,-0.06036184,0.056321688,0.05530568,-0.06435562,-0.061421182,0.065072775,-0.010457967,-0.042216793,0.0652006,-0.057387855,-0.00579209,0.04456926,0.06786782,-0.050403927,-0.010229539,-0.04843123,0.05569065,0.013774443,-0.060006905,0.01639413,-0.000795098,0.039432306,0.03079921,-0.030010618,-0.006367257,0.06273542,-0.04006468,0.06334253,-0.059993837,0.069082975,0.053112566,0.061626524,-0.059893668,-0.022289434,0.007095134,0.026543831,-0.012722029,0.059009288,0.03909258,-0.010467768,-0.019197179,-0.002051188,0.032709096,-0.049953155,-0.06582733,-0.04777964,0.032457996,0.04276711,-0.0637797,0.04092747,-0.019666191,-0.06941807,0.06842927,0.024879284,0.061994556,-0.040678967,-0.051179193,0.05913936,0.026667072,0.031718038,-0.06856162,-0.053687267,0.043780267,-0.061896436,0.04618672,0.049514215,-0.025944317,-0.027359562,-0.06845465,-0.011492942,-0.010457873,-0.02257501,-0.032054655,-0.007278026,-0.031280972,0.06942342,-0.046322405,0.048557308,0.03517122,0.058025472,0.051107377,0.067468055,0.035253666,0.057453968,0.038316384,0.004458676,0.00970265,-0.024571452,0.05172308,0.066627696,0.061887123,0.066413775,0.035033375,-0.031754635,-0.026918098,-0.014231915,0.06805812,-0.055909317,-0.011674492,0.046302337,-0.053389348,0.046455808,0.055106755,-0.027088514,0.062236313,0.028576957,-0.047027368,-0.004837215,0.06889729,-0.018570533,0.05483471,-0.013264006,0.042395223,-0.042472057,-0.037794206,-0.023773272,-0.06802437,0.001207565,0.020208253,0.06333765,0.051104046,0.05590098,-0.01360007,0.015184327,-0.005097051,-0.043120697,0.044871494,0.012601669,0.05023386,-0.02817208,0.06269977,-0.057344034,0.020934235,0.056727197,0.039394293,-0.0357301,0.06572871,-0.06111457,-0.06264947,-0.01788793,0.014374343,-0.06719792,0.037897754,-0.057773054,-0.051303864,0.005154827,-0.005233395,0.050745934,0.040423293,-0.002508801,-0.037745908,0.06598821,0.04796445,0.013647074,0.038235925,0.004983594,0.017288657,-0.019678874,-0.036538865,0.051469825,-0.026955308,0.032004904,-0.06942173,-0.059975937,-0.02234115,0.020977437,-0.03994144,-0.008141869,-0.005756792,0.03653885,-0.01874147,-0.05942018,0.049197298,-0.001691888,-0.069402516,-0.034445062,0.015589266,-0.050561536,-0.008065231,-0.04686576,-0.06469187,0.004808982,-0.008468466,0.032922663,0.068953164,0.03362184,0.054094616,0.063162,-0.024033587,-0.04356183,0.04552797,-0.06938644,0.017339338,0.024891775,0.04085318,0.050702047,0.04490048,-0.06515513,-0.059395716,0.05964554,0.051909126,-0.048208266,0.031099645,-0.026928112,-0.048035152,0.013066403,0.03660481,-0.020050619,-0.026700964,-0.012555772,0.05778582,-0.017068287,-0.013729895,0.052369494,0.060885407,-0.06509655,0.008336224,0.040826645,0.04918397,-0.05900377,0.042326428,-0.00123524,-0.032616407,-0.019874046,-0.044287533,-0.003895696,0.010198074,0.034420718,0.0519

Translational frameshifting in the Escherichia coli dnaX gene in vitro.,"Production of the gamma subunit of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is dependent on a very efficient translational frameshif in the dnaX gene. I used an E. coli in vitro translation system to analyze the mechanism of this frameshifting event. In this system, gamma was produced almost to the same extent as the inframe translation product, tau, suggesting that efficient frameshifting was reproduced in vitro. Coupling with transcription was not necessary for frameshifting. Addition of purified tau or gamma had no effect on the frameshifting process suggesting the absence of direct feedback regulation. By use of mutant genes, a strong pausing site was identified at or very close to the frameshift site. This pausing was apparently caused by a potential stem-loop structure which was previously shown to enhance frameshifting. Thus, enhancement of frameshifting by this putative stem-loop seems to be mediated by the translation pausing at the frameshift site. Despite the apparent structural similarity of the dnaX frameshift site to that of the eukaryotic retroviral genes, dnaX mRNA synthesized in vitro failed to direct the production of gamma in eukaryotic translation systems. This suggests that frameshifting in the dnaX gene depends on components specific to the E. coli translation

Programmed ribosomal frameshifting generates the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III gamma subunit from within the tau subunit reading frame.,"The Escherichia coli dnaX gene encodes both the tau and gamma subunits of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme in one reading frame. The 71.1 kDa tau and the shorter gamma share N-terminal sequences. Mutagenesis of a potential ribosomal frameshift signal located at codons 428-430 without changing the amino acid sequence of the tau product, eliminated detectable synthesis of the gamma subunit, suggesting that the reading frame is shifted at that sequence and gamma is terminated by a nonsense codon located in the -1 frame 3 nucleotides downstream of the signal. This seems to be the first known case of a frameshift which is used, along with the termination codon in the -1 frame, to terminate a peptide within a reading frame.

Evidence for Internal Initiation of RNA Synthesis by the Hepatitis C Virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase NS5B In Cellulo,"Initiation of RNA synthesis by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) NS5B has been extensively studied in vitro and in cellulo. Intracellular replication is thought to rely exclusively on terminal de novo initiation, as it conserves all genetic information of the genome. In vitro, however, additional modes of initiation have been observed. In this study, we aimed to clarify whether the intracellular environment allows for internal initiation of RNA replication by the HCV replicase. We used a dual luciferase replicon harboring a terminal and an internal copy of the viral genomic 5′ untranslated region, which was anticipated to support noncanonical initiation. Indeed, a shorter RNA species was detected by Northern blotting with low frequency, depending on the length and sequence composition upstream of the internal initiation site. By introducing mutations at either site, we furthermore established that internal and terminal initiation shared identical sequence requirements. Importantly, lethal point mutations at the terminal site resulted exclusively in truncated replicons. In contrast, the same mutations at the internal site abrogated internal initiation, suggesting a competitive selection of initiation sites, rather than recombination or template-switching events. In conclusion, our data indicate that the HCV replicase is capable of internal initiation in its natural environment, although functional replication likely requires only terminal initiation. Since many other positive-strand RNA viruses generate subgenomic messenger RNAs during their replication cycle, we surmise that their capability for internal initiation is a common and conserved feature of viral RdRps. IMPORTANCE Many aspects of viral RNA replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) are still poorly understood. The process of RNA synthesis is driven by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) NS5B. Most mechanistic studies on NS5B so far were performed with in vitro systems using isolated recombinant polymerase. In this study, we present a replicon model, which allows the intracellular assessment of noncanonical modes of initiation by the full HCV replicase. Our results add to the understanding of the biochemical processes underlying initiation of RNA synthesis by NS5B by the discovery of internal initiation in cellulo. Moreover, they validate observations made in vitro, showing that the viral polymerase acts very similarly in isolation and in complex with other viral and host proteins. Finally, these observations provide clues about the evolution of RdRps of positive-strand RNA viruses, which might contain the intrinsic ability to initiate

MYCOPLASMA FAUCIUM AND BREAST CANCER,"Viruses and bacteria are the cause of a large number of different human diseases. It is believed that some of them may even contribute to the development of cancer. The present work is dedicated to the identification of mycoplasmas in patients with breast cancer. Mycoplasmas may participate in the development of several human diseases including chronic fatigue syndrome, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, atypical pneumonia, etc. Moreover, there is a reason to believe that mycoplasma can participate in the development of cancer, leukemia and lymphoma.\n\nDNA samples from blood, saliva and tumor tissues of the Oncology Institute of Moldova patients diagnosed with breast cancer were analyzed. Mycoplasma testing was performed using nested PCR method. For Mycoplasma spp. detection, we used primers from the region of the 16S-23S RNA genes. The identification of Mycoplasma faucium, Mycoplasma salivarium and Mycoplasma orale was performed by nested PCR with primers for RNA polymerase beta subunit gene corresponding to mycoplasma.\n\nM.faucium and M.salivarius was found in saliva at about 100%, and M.orale at a frequency of about 50%. Only M.faucium was found with the frequency of about 60% in the tissue of the patients. Moreover, a fairly high rate of detection of mycoplasma is observed both in the cases when primers for RNA polymerase gene and primers for 16S-23S RNA were used.\n\nWe found M.faucium in tumor tissues of patients diagnosed with breast cancer. It is known that mycoplasmas are able to stimulate the synthesis of certain cytokines, which act as mitogenes on the cell. We assume that M.faucium can stimulate the mitogenes synthesis in breast tissues (e.g., cytokines) which, in turn, stimulate cell division and thus participate in the initiation of breast

The translational landscape of Zika virus during infection of mammalian and insect cells,"Zika virus is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae, which has recently undergone a rapid expansion among humans in the Western Hemisphere. Here, we report a high-resolution map of ribosomal occupancy of the Zika virus genome during infection of mammalian and insect cells, obtained by ribosome profiling. In contrast to some other flaviviruses such as West Nile, we find no evidence for substantial frameshift-induced ribosomal drop-off during translation of the viral polyprotein, indicating that Zika virus must use alternative mechanisms to downregulate levels of catalytically active viral polymerase. We also show that high levels of ribosome-protected fragments map in-frame to two previously overlooked upstream open reading frames (uORFs) initiating at CUG and UUG codons, with likely consequences for the efficiency of polyprotein expression. Curiously, in African isolates of Zika virus, the two uORFs are fused in-frame into a single uORF. A parallel RNA-Seq analysis reveals the 5' end position of the subgenomic flavivirus RNA in mammalian and insect cells. Together, these provide the first analysis of flavivirus gene expression by ribosome profiling.\n\nAuthor SummaryRecent Zika virus outbreaks have been associated with congenital diseases and neurological complications. An enhanced understanding of the molecular biology of this pathogen may contribute towards the development of improved treatment and control methods. We present a single-codon resolution analysis of Zika virus translation in mammalian and mosquito cells using ribosome profiling. The analysis revealed two hitherto uncharacterized uORFs in the 5' leader of Zika virus Brazilian isolate PE243, both of which are occupied by ribosomes during infection. In contrast, these two uORFs are fused into a single uORF in African isolates. This observation provides a new avenue for further investigations into potential factors involved in the emergence of Zika virus from a rarely detected pathogen into a major

Proofreading-deficient coronaviruses adapt over long-term passage for increased fidelity and fitness without reversion of exoribonuclease-inactivating mutations,"The coronavirus (CoV) RNA genome is the largest among single-stranded positive sense RNA viruses. CoVs encode a proofreading 3'[-&gt;]5'exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV high-fidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold decreased fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogs. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in parallel with WT-MHV. Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated enhanced replication, reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and increased competitive fitness. However, passage did not select for complete or partial reversion at the ExoN-inactivating mutations. We identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12-RdRp) and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially account for the observed changes in replication, susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and competitive fitness observed in the passaged virus population, indicating that additional determinants can compensate for the activities of nsp14-ExoN. Our results suggest that while selection favors restoration of replication fidelity in ExoN(-) CoVs, there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) reversion. These results also support the hypothesis that high-fidelity replication is linked to CoV fitness and identify additional candidate proteins that may regulate CoV replication fidelity.\n\nIMPORTANCEUnique among RNA viruses, CoVs encode a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) in nsp14 that mediates high-fidelity RNA genome replication. Proofreading-deficient CoVs with disrupted ExoN activity [ExoN(-)] are either non-viable or have significant defects in replication, RNA synthesis, fidelity, fitness, and virulence. In this study, we show that ExoN(-) murine hepatitis virus can adapt over long-term passage for increased replication and fitness without reverting the ExoN-inactivating mutations. Passage-adapted ExoN(-) mutants also demonstrate increasing resistance to nucleoside analogs that is only partially explained by secondary mutations in nsp12 and nsp14. These data suggest that enhanced resistance to nucleoside analogs is mediated by the interplay of multiple replicase proteins and support the proposed link between CoV fidelity and

A speed-fidelity trade-off determines the mutation rate and virulence of an RNA virus,"Mutation rates can evolve through genetic drift, indirect selection due to genetic hitchhiking, or direct selection on the physicochemical cost of high fidelity. However, for many systems, it has been difficult to disentangle the relative impact of these forces empirically. In RNA viruses, an observed correlation between mutation rate and virulence has led many to argue that their extremely high mutation rates are advantageous, because they may allow for increased adaptability. This argument has profound implications, as it suggests that pathogenesis in many viral infections depends on rare or de novo mutations. Here we present data for an alternative model whereby RNA viruses evolve high mutation rates as a byproduct of selection for increased replicative speed. We find that a poliovirus antimutator, 3DG64S, has a significant replication defect and that wild type and 3DG64S populations have similar adaptability in two distinct cellular environments. Experimental evolution of 3DG64S under r-selection led to reversion and compensation of the fidelity phenotype. Mice infected with 3DG64S exhibited delayed morbidity at doses well above the LD50, consistent with attenuation by slower growth as opposed to reduced mutational supply. Furthermore, compensation of the 3DG64S growth defect restored virulence, while compensation of the fidelity phenotype did not. Our data are consistent with the kinetic proofreading model for biosynthetic reactions and suggest that speed is more important than accuracy. In contrast to what has been suggested for many RNA viruses, we find that within host spread is associated with viral replicative speed and not standing genetic diversity.\n\nAuthor SummaryMutation rate evolution has long been a fundamental problem in evolutionary biology. The polymerases of RNA viruses generally lack proofreading activity and exhibit extremely high mutation rates. Since most mutations are deleterious and mutation rates are tuned by natural selection, we asked why hasnt the virus evolved to have a lower mutation rate? We used experimental evolution and a murine infection model to show that RNA virus mutation rates may actually be too high and are not necessarily adaptive. Rather, our data indicate that viral mutation rates are driven higher as a result of selection for viruses with faster replication kinetics. We suggest that viruses have high mutation rates, not because they facilitate adaption, but because it is hard to be both fast and accurate.",-0.05508617,-0.049329024,-0.05532094,0.055308513,0.0346226,0.056499057,0.05035596,-0.038394168,0.03587079,0.044139072,0.056707498,0.03425888,-0.053718388,0.027601644,0.053856872,-0.05625472,-0.05670163,-0.044608615,0.056591947,-0.026736116,-0.05555565,0.013655253,-0.051159512,0.056701273,0.051555846,0.05025938,0.05457803,0.03752725,-0.056526974,0.012898203,0.052684836,0.056656796,0.015690789,-0.05612015,-0.05393178,0.03777653,-0.05670265,-0.016716013,-0.049037192,0.050895754,-0.04955724,-0.044036314,-0.037690923,-0.04744174,-0.030315213,-0.008503014,0.042215228,-0.025048826,0.055947304,-0.000410857,0.004408956,0.027064689,-0.056447003,-0.005044023,-0.05499928,-0.011072083,-0.04787621,-0.055877164,0.05665374,-0.055743523,-0.05169835,0.02994064,0.005147864,-0.015777351,-0.04606386,-0.056661945,0.04935441,0.056561433,-0.039938103,0.043574627,-0.050585404,0.05055774,0.054870132,0.05645829,-0.055736028,-0.016329154,0.05619566,0.054322883,-0.056082856,0.05504349,-0.013278506,0.05670739,0.038776126,-0.022115476,-0.053070277,0.04576801,0.05576307,0.05265323,-0.048104085,-0.041834608,-0.053272218,0.04011475,-0.05590215,0.048755415,0.021464678,0.04249429,0.049864374,0.05669233,0.05670759,-0.033629548,-0.016653312,0.009451754,-0.03554259,0.03152994,0.008444542,0.045257784,-0.006544229,0.001549098,-0.042353235,0.04509106,0.043835726,-0.000589755,0.004510471,0.055546734,0.05668004,0.046809442,-0.05208235,-0.05627209,-0.023471568,-0.043448944,-0.011490942,0.05368378,0.05418077,-0.011263032,-0.02011667,0.022879502,-0.009568071,-0.052971166,-0.014896029,0.01711717,-0.05304051,0.056707628,0.04044264,-0.046618097,-0.034409624,-0.041444916,0.03729119,0.056412876,-0.049031958,-0.022557262,0.055232104,0.05670586,-0.056632884,-0.01839686,0.05405199,-0.05363975,-0.022365047,-0.056631073,0.056615632,0.046289712,-0.024945023,-0.050191082,-0.048332054,0.002008789,0.056707505,-0.03636022,0.052137826,0.003271249,0.002117171,-0.054489415,-0.04704729,-0.05551508,-0.033515733,0.055148046,-0.005700672,-0.017206669,-0.056692734,0.05650868,-0.052151825,-0.055907078,-0.00964208,-0.0567017,-0.055194657,0.049071826,0.05059416,0.038943607,-0.018804668,-0.03072226,0.056587808,-0.02018805,-0.042853776,-0.010021945,-0.010201842,0.04627915,0.039716817,-0.056672532,-0.03964949,-0.052286968,0.054531846,0.026486358,0.031044114,-0.043665256,0.005925573,0.050673332,0.05667187,-0.048602194,0.007322513,0.044856697,0.022592165,-0.052208368,-0.045401335,0.0566846,0.02119938,-0.05639161,0.0561809,-0.052927557,-0.03770204,0.05647,0.003594343,0.05670114,0.042233665,0.056620363,0.049634926,0.041326556,-0.055111654,0.033833824,0.055365484,-0.03617181,0.018969271,0.028115265,-0.01101031,-0.034528792,-0.05598217,0.056384377,-0.034337778,-0.018535683,-0.056452554,-0.056620378,0.04396427,0.050333694,0.028134994,0.055077665,0.05644599,-0.056707624,0.04772467,0.05599143,-0.012176455,-0.020848235,-0.03169928,0.056429345,0.03625641,0.024787113,-0.05668709,-0.031782746,0.05559494,-0.05628908,0.04241257,0.0391449,0.02510347,0.006367419,-0.056217223,-0.041569695,0.035381712,0.05165602,0.056676786,0.009841023,-0.056540802,0.056707628,-0.043881673,-0.05454684,-0.056531187,0.046513118,0.004330211,0.0551377,-0.014330393,-0.022505717,-0.018901115,-0.026260274,0.038458403,-0.02495813,0.009249157,0.052290093,0.032265924,0.047047522,0.03746727,-0.008982507,-0.04833793,0.056096397,0.05653464,-0.05664121,0.042707045,-0.054928005,-0.04190137,0.052951273,-0.039848905,0.016241819,-0.050234396,0.053551007,-0.056381807,-0.004086075,0.05664393,0.05552976,0.056703854,-0.054671567,0.032667156,-0.023154115,0.03680346,-0.054786075,-0.05670703,0.052072883,-0.039337017,0.0560101,-0.04892636,0.05415734,-0.055029005,-0.048263244,-0.05286084,-0.050821625,0.05643028,-0.03901119,0.054087467,-0.02110679,-0.015372212,-0.056701556,0.03941198,-0.044926252,0.028231684,0.019143958,0.05665104,0.003828129,-0.052230448,0.05219384,0.04586463,-0.05388211,0.030121708,0.056292612,0.004357813,-0.056322865,-0.056602873,-0.045594975,-0.029748566,0.051278178,0.0559428,0.056702472,-0.02051659,-0.02022468,0.002643814,0.003521101,0.039186157,0.04733349,-0.047572136,-0.05462268,0.0379468,0.031417415,-0.05670638,-0.056455635,0.03576167,0.046214137,-0.05236138,-0.056250557,0.030563798,0.00352423,-0.046225827,-0.038045425,0.012868741,0.021360988,-0.056707602,-0.051622424,-0.032516446,-0.054392017,-0.03983884,-0.05547744,-0.04179061,0.05665158,0.027340546,-0.04977891,0.056702413,0.055858716,0.04866343,-0.035647158,-0.05459463,-0.047607012,-0.056591306,-0.05670739,0.056574676,-0.000962691,0.05521076,-0.020111136,-0.042184502,-0.0563739,-0.006937407,0.056653786,0.051617097,0.03848587,0.054408588,-0.009330413,0.056490753,-0.055793103,0.044141427,0.049524117,0.052436434,-0.026059072,0.03602383,-0.055473547,-0.055856723,0.056072544,-0.039440162,-0.048770394,-0.051798202,-0.03928837,-0.029362127,-0.020526303,-0.032939024,0.055030826,-0.055937275,-0.026727498,-0.05510637,-0.048403002,0.001358157,0.036906637,0.05647898,0

G-quadruplex stabilization in the ions and maltose transporters inhibit Salmonella enterica growth and virulence.,"The G-quadruplex structure forming motifs have recently emerged as a novel therapeutic drug target in various human pathogens. Herein, we report three highly conserved G-quadruplex motifs (SE-PGQ-1, 2, and3) in genome of all the 412 strains of Salmonella enterica. Bioinformatics analysis inferred the presence of SE-PGQ-1 in the regulatory region of mgtA, presence of SE-PGQ-2 in the open reading frame of entA and presence of SE-PGQ-3 in the promoter region of malE and malK genes. The products of mgtA and entA are involved in transport and homeostasis of Mg2+ and Fe3+ ion and thereby required for bacterial survival in the presence of reactive nitrogen/oxygen species produced by the host macrophages, whereas, malK and malE genes are involved in transport of maltose sugar, that is one of the major carbon source in the gastrointestinal tract of human. The formation of stable intramolecular G-quadruplex structures by SE-PGQs was confirmed by employing CD, EMSA and NMR spectroscopy. Cellular studies revealed the inhibitory effect of 9-amino acridine on Salmonella enterica growth. Next, CD melting analysis demonstrated the stabilizing effect of 9-amino acridine on SE-PGQs. Further, polymerase inhibition and RT-qPCR assays emphasize the biological relevance of predicted G-quadruplex in the expression of PGQ possessing genes and demonstrate the G-quadruplexes as a potential drug target for the devolping novel therapeutics for combating Salmonella enterica infection.\n\nAuthor SummarySince last several decades scientific community has witnessed a rapid increase in number of such human pathogenic bacterial species that acquired resistant to multiple antibacterial agents. Currently, emergence of multidrug-resistant strains remain a major public health concern for clinical investigators that rings a global alarm to search for novel and highly conserved drug targets. Recently, G-quadruplex structure forming nucleic acid sequences were endorsed as highly conserved Drug target for preventing infection of several human pathogens including viral and protozoan species. Therefore, here we explored the presence G-quadruplex forming motif in genome of Salmonella enterica bacteria that causes food poisoning, and enteric fever in human. The formation of intra molecular G-quadruplex structure in four genes (mgtA, entA, malE and malK) was confirmed by NMR, CD and EMSA. The 9-amino acridine, a known G-quadruplex binder has been shown to stabilize the predicted G-quadruplex motif and decreases the expressioin of G-quadruplex hourbouring genes using RT-PCR and cellular toxicity assay.

"Changes in mRNA abundance drive differential shuttling of RNA binding proteins, linking cytoplasmic RNA degradation to transcription","Alterations in global mRNA decay broadly impact multiple stages of gene expression, although signals that connect these processes are incompletely defined. Here, we used tandem mass tag labeling coupled with mass spectrometry to reveal that changing the mRNA decay landscape, as frequently occurs during viral infection, results in subcellular redistribution of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in human cells. Accelerating Xrn1-dependent mRNA decay through expression of a gammaherpesviral endonuclease drove nuclear translocation of many RBPs, including poly(A) tail-associated proteins. Conversely, cells lacking Xrn1 exhibited changes in the localization or abundance of numerous factors linked to mRNA turnover. Using these data, we uncovered a new role for relocalized cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein in repressing recruitment of TATA binding protein and RNA polymerase II to promoters. Collectively, our results show that changes in cytoplasmic mRNA decay can directly impact protein localization, providing a mechanism to connect seemingly distal stages of gene

Origins and Evolution of the Global RNA Virome,"Viruses with RNA genomes dominate the eukaryotic virome, reaching enormous diversity in animals and plants. The recent advances of metaviromics prompted us to perform a detailed phylogenomic reconstruction of the evolution of the dramatically expanded global RNA virome. The only universal gene among RNA viruses is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed an iterative computational procedure that alternates the RdRp phylogenetic tree construction with refinement of the underlying multiple sequence alignments. The resulting tree encompasses 4,617 RNA virus RdRps and consists of 5 major branches, 2 of which include positive-sense RNA viruses, 1 is a mix of positive-sense (+) RNA and double-stranded (ds) RNA viruses, and 2 consist of dsRNA and negative-sense (-) RNA viruses, respectively. This tree topology implies that dsRNA viruses evolved from +RNA viruses on at least two independent occasions, whereas -RNA viruses evolved from dsRNA viruses. Reconstruction of RNA virus evolution using the RdRp tree as the scaffold suggests that the last common ancestors of the major branches of +RNA viruses encoded only the RdRp and a single jelly-roll capsid protein. Subsequent evolution involved independent capture of additional genes, particularly, those encoding distinct RNA helicases, enabling replication of larger RNA genomes and facilitating virus genome expression and virus-host interactions. Phylogenomic analysis reveals extensive gene module exchange among diverse viruses and horizontal virus transfer between distantly related hosts. Although the network of evolutionary relationships within the RNA virome is bound to further expand, the present results call for a thorough reevaluation of the RNA virus taxonomy.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe majority of the diverse viruses infecting eukaryotes have RNA genomes, including numerous human, animal, and plant pathogens. Recent advances of metagenomics have led to the discovery of many new groups of RNA viruses in a wide range of hosts. These findings enable a far more complete reconstruction of the evolution of RNA viruses than what was attainable previously. This reconstruction reveals the relationships between different Baltimore Classes of viruses and indicates extensive transfer of viruses between distantly related hosts, such as plants and animals. These results call for a major revision of the existing taxonomy of RNA

FilmArray Respiratory Panel Integrated in a field Point Of Care dispositive for the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections in rural areas in Senegal,"The development of molecular syndrome-based kits for the diagnosis of respiratory infections offers rapid and sensitive detection of common respiratory pathogens and will have a significant impact on the care of patients. In this study, we present the results obtained after the introduction of the FilmArray respiratory panel in a field Point of care (POC) for the diagnosis of virus and bacteria responsible of respiratory tract infections in Senegal rural area. From February to August 2017, we collected nasal swabs from febrile patients that presented symptoms of respiratory tract infections in three health posts located in Niakhar. Specimens were tested on site by multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), using the FilmArray respiratory panel(R) that targets 20 pathogens, including 17 virus and 3 bacteria (bioMerieux). Nasal swabs were collected from 113 patients. The median age was 4 years (ranging from 4 months to 60 years) and 51 (45%) were males. The prevalence of respiratory pathogens was 37.5% (12/32) during the dry season and 54.3% (44/81) in the rainy season (p=0.16). The prevalence of respiratory pathogen carriage was higher in children under 5 years of age (38/55, 69.1%). The most prevalent micro-organisms detected were influenza B virus (16/113, 14%), human rhinovirus/enterovirus (10/113, 9%), parainfluenzae virus (9/113, 8%), respiratory syncytial virus (8/113, 7%), adenovirus (5/113, 4%), human metapneumovirus (3/113, 3%), Chlamydia pneumoniae (2/113, 2%) and Coronavirus (2/113, 2%). The study has demonstrated that the integration of the FilmArray respiratory panel into a field POC could significantly improve the management of respiratory tract infections in rural areas.\n\nAuthor summaryRespiratory tract infections are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Populations in underdeveloped countries are the most affected, especially children under 5 years of age. Among the pathogens responsible for these infections, bacteria and viruses are the most identified. In poor countries, laboratory diagnosis can only be done in urban areas. They are generally based on bacteriological, immunological or molecular biology techniques. The concept of POC is not developed in underdeveloped countries. Its existence would have made it possible to carry out RDTs to confirm the clinicians diagnosis and allow rapid management of the patient. In the current situation, the time required to achieve results is often very long for patients. In this study, we sought to demonstrate the significant contribution of the FilmArray respiratory panel in the management of respiratory tract infections in rural areas. We also wanted to reduce the time it takes to deliver results in order to improve patient care. This dispositif was integrated in a field POC which was implemented in Niakhar since 2015, in order to improve the management of emerging diseases. The FilmArray respiratory panel gave us the opportunity to investigate the causes of respiratory tract infections in this area. For each patient, we systematically target 20 pathogens, including 17 viruses and 3 bacteria, with a single multiplex PCR. One of the main results of this study is that children under 5 years of age are the most affected by respiratory tract infections. Then we noted a lack of consultation among adults that could be explained by the banalization of respiratory problems or a preference for traditional care. The fact that children under 5 years of age are the most affected could also serve as a basis for implementing vaccination programmes directly targeting the most vulnerable age groups. It should be noted that for 51% of patients, the result of the diagnosis was negative. It would appear that some pathogens responsible for respiratory tract infections are not targeted by the multiplex PCR. Thus, it would be necessary to screen these pathogens in order to integrate them into a panel that would cover the most pathogens in circulation in this

Biological Evaluation of Molecules of the azaBINOL Class as Antiviral Agents: Specific Inhibition of HIV-1 RNase H Activity by 7-Isopropoxy-8-(naphth-1-yl)quinoline,"Inspired by bioactive biaryl-containing natural products found in plants and the marine environment, a series of synthetic compounds belonging to the azaBINOL chiral ligand family was evaluated for antiviral activity against HIV-1. Testing of 39 unique azaBINOLs in a singleround infectivity assay resulted in the identification of three promising antiviral compounds, including 7-isopropoxy-8-(naphth-1-yl)quinoline (azaBINOL B#24), which exhibited low-micromolar activity. The active compounds and several close structural analogues were further tested against three different HIV-1 envelope pseudotyped viruses as well as in a full-virus replication system (EASY-HIT). Mode-of-action studies using a time-of-addition assay indicated that azaBINOL B#24 acts after viral entry but before viral assembly and budding. HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) assays that individually test for polymerase and RNase H activity were used to demonstrate that B#24 inhibits RNase H activity, most likely allosterically. Further binding analysis using bio-layer interferometry (BLI) showed that B#24 interacts with HIV-1 RT in a highly specific manner. These results indicate that azaBINOL B#24 is a potentially viable, novel lead for the development of new HIV-1 RNase H inhibitors. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the survey of libraries of synthetic compounds, designed purely with the goal of facilitating chemical synthesis in mind, may yield unexpected and selective drug leads for the development of new antiviral

A specific sequence in the genome of respiratory syncytial virus regulates the generation of copy-back defective viral genomes,"Defective viral genomes of the copy-back type (cbDVGs) are the primary initiators of the antiviral immune response during infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) both in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism governing cbDVG generation remains unknown, thereby limiting our ability to manipulate cbDVG content in order to modulate the host response to infection. Here we report a specific genomic signal that mediates the generation of RSV cbDVGs. Using a customized bioinformatics tool, we identified regions in the RSV genome frequently used to generate cbDVGs during infection. We then created a minigenome system to validate the function of one of these sequences and to determine if specific nucleotides were essential for cbDVG generation at that position. Further, we created a recombinant virus that selectively produced a specific cbDVG based on variations introduced in this sequence. The identified sequence was also found as a common site for cbDVG generation during natural RSV infections, and common cbDVGs generated at this sequence were found among samples from various infected patients. These data demonstrate that sequences encoded in the viral genome are critical determinants of the location of cbDVG generation and, therefore, this is not a stochastic process. Most importantly, these findings open the possibility of genetically manipulating cbDVG formation to modulate infection outcome. Author summaryCopy-back defective viral genomes (cbDVGs) regulate infection and pathogenesis of Mononegavirales. cbDVG are believed to arise from random errors that occur during virus replication and the predominant hypothesis is that the viral polymerase is the main driver of cbDVG generation. Here we describe a specific genomic sequence in the RSV genome that is necessary for the generation of a large proportion of the cbDVG population present during infection. We identified specific nucleotides that when modified altered cbDVG generation at this position, and we created a recombinant virus that selectively produced cbDVGs based on mutations in this sequence. These data demonstrate that the generation of RSV cbDVGs is regulated by specific viral sequences and that these sequences can be manipulated to alter the content and quality of cbDVG generated during infection.",-0.053479724,0.049957823,-0.04939427,-0.004580833,-0.03632186,0.057895087,-0.020728178,0.053130344,-0.035586707,0.04221719,0.05795226,0.031330746,0.020897372,-0.03490185,0.05755327,-0.05146648,-0.057903986,-0.055715315,0.042097263,0.028326817,-0.05170559,-0.012485442,-0.057602342,0.056533247,-0.010358655,0.05728958,-0.011268978,-0.019088011,0.05102407,-0.04293214,0.05773334,0.05794898,-0.050078552,-0.001121867,0.05418706,0.05114339,-0.057770696,-0.003293173,-0.05148113,-0.044464715,0.04206427,-0.053417325,0.009792124,-0.055280443,-0.04418111,0.01611863,-0.006371195,-0.053358965,0.046342377,0.016218517,-0.039676946,0.045646828,-0.05639572,-0.04417005,-0.057906236,-0.033116955,-0.05512318,-0.022319194,0.05715321,0.04402054,-0.04067589,-0.029171204,0.011203849,-0.02985847,-0.05510863,-0.057849616,0.057715204,0.04005643,0.053905815,-0.04561401,-0.017807694,0.050966352,-0.001813318,0.057235576,-0.024638453,0.010821199,0.05646704,0.055409327,-0.05792957,0.05711021,0.008632579,0.057431646,-0.04797039,-0.04074009,-0.026049918,0.054490633,0.038743883,0.036277268,-0.050282273,-0.013693882,-0.053951677,-0.052591473,-0.047974933,0.039093047,0.00860187,0.012845243,0.044500798,0.057733458,0.057950895,-0.033060607,-0.040096812,0.046147823,-0.057522416,0.05111313,0.049368206,0.045081623,0.05025531,-0.008629975,0.052607223,0.026523655,-0.009820432,0.054684278,0.025638761,0.0532324,0.05781705,0.0454317,-0.051975355,-0.023106314,0.027212363,0.036182187,-0.037314467,0.042392287,0.054726597,-0.05662304,-0.038064577,0.04982666,0.03738344,0.022846797,-0.023093218,0.056244653,0.021139953,0.057953637,0.055838134,0.019271864,0.015770761,-0.05759884,-0.051863216,0.05787218,-0.057884544,-0.005856225,-0.03618002,0.057952907,-0.05739312,-0.040659387,-0.01739837,-0.057590585,0.047936138,-0.057945788,0.057693735,0.028536016,-0.010170579,-0.05168776,-0.05443991,-0.043610696,0.0579432,0.03825588,0.054837316,0.053017404,0.05739991,0.007006546,-0.026727488,-0.054016024,0.03535429,0.040219244,-0.027158221,-0.05653657,-0.057100557,0.049047694,-0.050401285,-0.046318177,0.006677537,-0.05335719,-0.02761304,0.03362733,0.014697492,-0.03295652,-0.021314938,-0.05757775,0.05692757,-0.025632406,0.020780165,0.037491325,-0.007446756,-0.034519363,0.057262268,-0.04468534,-0.055976193,0.016773468,0.037198648,-0.052625824,0.051195137,0.018370587,0.030899376,-0.019193375,0.054163393,-0.038512044,0.031612176,0.051337194,0.011086454,-0.04978429,-0.054568402,0.057697445,0.038205385,0.029781276,0.056084845,-0.057689987,0.027999878,0.05701832,0.023170307,0.057952397,0.027804296,0.057698376,0.055442873,0.057783008,-0.05083559,0.009428655,0.05592965,0.022626603,-0.027611587,0.013748758,-0.006846547,-0.028702624,0.03168275,0.023836175,-0.02418365,-0.055151395,-0.05794571,-0.05623326,0.04738302,0.02585639,-0.036975566,0.052864682,0.048376683,-0.057948265,0.05654548,0.056856878,0.048333477,-0.056433655,0.02179841,-0.000378373,0.042342648,-0.0480094,0.047091577,-0.047874305,0.05520674,-0.037018932,-0.05601358,0.054264497,0.05030099,-0.05549318,-0.057630934,-0.056630928,-0.018517874,0.02192922,0.057931088,0.019413948,-0.055187233,0.05795366,-0.05189941,-0.03894961,-0.045385543,0.047279015,0.05380237,0.0570048,-0.012448416,-0.023400113,-0.00464077,-0.056425046,0.052280758,0.028449642,0.056974668,0.057786066,-0.055090077,0.012691225,-0.057325497,-0.054203022,0.0358547,0.03905345,0.0579211,0.04318831,-0.010042837,-0.057132233,-0.0531828,0.03285072,-0.043547563,0.044389844,-0.057907984,0.040437967,-0.054234736,0.015478035,0.057945322,-0.050248954,0.05785617,-0.053491447,-0.03196135,-0.03329091,0.020028148,0.036670912,-0.057788577,0.044495594,-0.04390436,0.057735708,0.04561609,-0.012863042,-0.048936203,0.049005676,-0.048784196,-0.044786207,0.054211393,-0.025807107,0.04809571,0.04804417,-0.04323306,-0.057764605,0.057606436,-0.016785203,0.048476547,-0.029397747,0.05768002,0.039693203,-0.046283163,0.05721202,0.050312404,-0.05180406,0.003031322,0.0571828,-0.024309702,-0.051306978,-0.051318403,-0.055600118,-0.012215306,0.055342622,0.033181757,0.057580866,-0.012486137,0.053867754,0.012643801,0.051890094,-0.022606842,0.010705556,0.031692993,-0.041405372,0.056337465,0.038834244,-0.05795326,-0.05791797,0.040231653,0.053127687,-0.05401674,-0.05677697,-0.007266274,-0.051813066,0.016367987,0.04128054,0.04981234,0.028720425,-0.05795321,-0.05084938,-0.05359149,-0.05582139,0.005124141,-0.053765163,-0.05641574,0.053829394,0.023530917,-0.012198174,0.057946168,0.057004828,0.056824133,-0.047264293,-0.022653006,0.026700152,-0.038985968,-0.05793861,0.057595085,0.045150507,0.057218794,0.048480645,0.003554361,-0.05422445,-0.055710685,0.0445536,0.012179052,0.057074625,-0.016166648,-0.011461378,-0.0497909,-0.057014935,0.039764438,-0.009156931,0.00050348,-0.026068995,0.0567396,-0.034005802,-0.05023231,0.048183773,0.031866428,-0.055002254,0.03692783,-0.04893796,0.030071728,0.011579596,0.023882635,0.052362315,-0.005055578,0.006842505,-0.046412066,-0.01867536,-0.012423025,-0.00351018,0.0539894

Structure of the SARS-CoV NSP12 polymerase bound to NSP7 and NSP8 co-factors,"Recent history is punctuated by the emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS- and MERS-CoV into human circulation. Upon infecting host cells, coronaviruses assemble a multi-subunit RNA-synthesis complex of viral non-structural proteins (NSP) responsible for the replication and transcription of the viral genome. Here, we present the 3.1 [A] resolution structure of the SARS-CoV NSP12 polymerase bound to its essential co-factors, NSP7 and NSP8, using single particle cryo-electron microscopy. NSP12 possesses an architecture common to all viral polymerases as well as a large N-terminal extension containing a kinase-like fold and is unexpectedly bound by two NSP8 co-factors.

Stress-Induced Transcriptional Memory Accelerates Promoter-Proximal Pause-Release and Decelerates Termination over Mitotic Divisions,"Heat shock triggers an instant reprogramming of gene and enhancer transcription, but whether cells encode a memory to stress, at the level of nascent transcription, has remained unknown. Here, we measured transcriptional response to acute heat stress in unconditioned cells and in daughters of cells that had been exposed to a single or multiple heat shocks. Tracking RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) genome-wide at nucleotide-resolution revealed that cells precisely remember their transcriptional identity throughout stress, restoring Pol II distribution at gene bodies and enhancers upon recovery. However, single heat shock primed faster gene-induction in the daughter cells by increasing promoter-proximal Pol II pausing, and accelerating the pause-release. In repeatedly stressed cells, both basal and inducible transcription was refined, and pre-mRNA processing decelerated, which retained transcripts on chromatin and reduced recycling of the transcription machinery. These results mechanistically uncovered how the steps of pause-release and termination maintain transcriptional memory over mitosis.\n\nHighlights-Cell type-specific transcription precisely recovers after heat-induced reprogramming\n-Single heat shock primes genes for accelerated induction over mitotic divisions via increased promoter-proximal Pol II pausing and faster pause-release\n-Multiple

Comparative analysis of gene expression in virulent and attenuated strains of infectious bronchitis virus at sub-codon resolution,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a member of the genus Gammacoronavirus and the causative agent of avian infectious bronchitis. IBV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome ~27 kb in length and, like all coronaviruses, produces a set of sub-genomic messenger RNAs (sgmRNAs) synthesised via the viral polymerase. Here, we used RNA sequencing (RNASeq) and ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) to delineate gene expression in the IBV M41-CK and Beau-CK strains at sub-codon resolution. Quantification of reads flanking the programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) signal at the genomic RNA ORF1a/ORF1b junction revealed that PRF in IBV is highly efficient (33-40%), consistent with in vitro measurements. Triplet phasing of the profiling data allowed precise determination of reading frames and revealed the translation of two intergenic genes (4b and 4c on sgmRNA4), which are widely conserved across IBV isolates. RNASeq revealed two novel transcription junction sites in the attenuated Beau-CK strain, one of which would generate a sgmRNA encoding a ribosomally occupied ORF in the viral 3 untranslated region (dORF). Within IBV transcripts, the nucleocapsid (N) protein was unexpectedly found to be inefficiently translated, despite being an abundant structural component of mature IBV virions. Finally, we demonstrate that the host cell response to IBV occurs primarily at the level of transcription, with a global up-regulation of immune-related mRNA transcripts following infection, and comparatively modest changes in the translation efficiencies of host genes.\n\nIMPORTANCEIBV is a major avian pathogen and presents a substantial economic burden to the poultry industry. Improved vaccination strategies are urgently needed to curb the global spread of this pathogen, and the development of suitable vaccine candidates will be aided by an improved understanding of IBV molecular biology. Our high-resolution data have enabled a precise study of transcription and translation in both pathogenic and attenuated forms of IBV, and expand our understanding of gammacoronaviral gene expression. We demonstrate that gene expression shows considerable intra-species variation, with single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with altered production of sgmRNA transcripts, and our RiboSeq data sets enabled us to uncover novel ribosomally occupied ORFs in both strains. We also identify numerous cellular genes and gene networks that are differentially expressed during virus infection, giving insights into the host cell reponse to IBV infection.",-0.035647202,0.01645333,-0.0529912,-0.026196236,-0.007973817,0.058819536,-0.038482327,-0.049405888,0.036783073,0.004468978,0.06004893,-0.001811635,-0.035055693,-0.041014098,0.044197783,-0.059895616,-0.05980777,-0.03270821,0.04754964,-0.009151518,-0.0456406,0.019509422,-0.058901172,0.05394152,-0.040542807,0.059114985,0.059419315,0.017788002,0.043441463,-0.031320404,0.05931721,0.06003136,-0.025813684,-0.034291185,0.051859215,0.042157345,-0.059381638,0.057529718,-0.059989776,-0.012973031,0.054051112,-0.050695766,0.014368066,-0.041832503,-0.001466379,-0.026927598,-0.043421634,-0.018399714,0.050238542,-0.054775182,-0.04219736,0.04538106,-0.06000826,-0.049544085,-0.054919858,0.031656813,-0.058603365,0.042105775,0.059674095,-0.04832362,0.038023166,-0.030664433,0.008860121,-0.027459107,-0.005523877,-0.05980352,0.059393045,-0.017325208,-0.005366811,-0.052143056,0.003867563,0.05902987,0.037656978,0.057296455,-0.05715324,0.005708968,0.058888543,0.009437203,-0.057241607,0.052429393,-0.003431976,0.059910074,0.054723196,-0.020989029,-0.053544182,0.053688113,-0.005694432,-0.024513546,-0.058718756,0.004887234,-0.057022497,-0.019134397,-0.050645046,0.046394665,-0.030177137,0.059889123,0.048579186,0.059808932,0.060051046,-0.008203526,-0.053797364,-0.05421115,-0.04312283,0.036602095,0.028504385,0.051312722,0.033970706,-0.02373479,0.006919053,0.017357662,0.027983414,0.055198304,0.00823947,0.040611513,0.058762312,0.027126402,-0.059974328,0.031709332,-0.025125682,0.05408864,-0.053138874,0.059551045,0.05970057,-0.056066398,0.059243497,0.052461453,0.056912605,0.015131332,-0.016647425,0.048968863,-0.009688634,0.060052738,0.05965841,0.03822628,0.010700905,-0.052055884,0.005714338,0.0527855,-0.05335997,0.012178628,-0.0575739,0.060052816,-0.05977993,-0.030769851,-0.055077095,-0.05999161,0.047780875,-0.060041785,0.043174032,0.014976869,-0.020185538,-0.059903968,-0.059261464,-0.051790435,0.060052313,-0.006532504,0.043429643,0.05826732,-0.003781845,0.029691469,-0.02845507,-0.036200054,-0.044334114,0.05946188,0.033448614,0.010752528,-0.057792448,0.019934881,-0.05562617,-0.049782738,-0.003916754,0.009498206,-0.05754504,0.048541013,0.05364332,-0.036216363,0.03814936,-0.005398511,0.058628734,0.023916123,-0.023819644,-0.05036805,-0.033357155,-0.011865413,0.059431598,0.01718415,-0.059710264,0.027213836,0.05405159,-0.031280342,0.059783045,-0.020706708,-0.0107569,-0.04545241,0.059701264,-0.054328483,0.056608126,0.04496165,0.04824594,-0.028081633,-0.05867785,0.05312446,0.048437662,0.056712817,0.05643933,-0.048519686,-0.03374656,0.05979392,0.010749179,0.060009595,0.04926484,0.05973238,0.055694595,0.058948155,-0.059964057,-0.030980472,0.059368882,0.049049895,-0.040276006,0.02455977,-0.02100261,-0.050007556,0.010431937,0.04339909,-0.039089825,-0.0419497,-0.059808254,-0.057910174,0.047962014,0.030576551,0.000935744,0.05355426,-0.015524067,-0.06005256,0.058395065,0.054732766,0.016388439,-0.059760977,-0.017143812,0.048915572,0.04442864,0.03621707,-0.041449904,-0.046623535,0.045474663,-0.021320852,-0.03738491,0.040450644,0.058932856,-0.029322198,-0.05992022,0.032922715,-0.0136188,0.028299136,0.058943313,-0.05487764,-0.0206061,0.060052816,0.02660952,-0.009154539,0.039786566,0.032123286,-0.019709397,0.058913525,0.038975295,0.001444815,-0.0454404,-0.002192534,0.000860965,0.012841944,0.04803826,0.06001291,-0.05568964,0.023852669,-0.002000788,-0.051034212,-0.016930731,0.052112114,0.059401292,-0.03828471,-0.059800442,-0.05009979,-0.056215446,0.058189828,-0.05762484,-0.01605461,-0.05971605,0.05316219,-0.05980302,-0.014187156,0.060031235,0.00941172,0.05607942,-0.058638178,0.027976079,-0.059429415,-0.05347562,0.05220399,-0.059966184,0.057040688,-0.05818089,0.05851739,0.057914276,0.051838573,-0.05717804,0.037058823,-0.004655921,-0.052834753,0.059828382,-0.003107032,0.056543812,0.001057503,-0.020139353,-0.059122518,0.059355173,0.006187148,0.03417006,-0.029325372,0.043334644,0.03595996,-0.056979656,0.042805765,0.050248183,-0.059939124,0.0083684,0.026144238,-0.049648624,-0.05991534,-0.013113587,-0.058750633,0.05761861,0.029023705,0.052769225,0.060008496,0.025154715,-0.026879005,0.055179965,0.053374484,0.04693168,0.0286824,0.008203159,-0.05476395,0.057749696,-0.006927254,-0.060051333,-0.0599634,0.007352765,0.018856118,-0.04350335,-0.059939474,-0.012755645,0.03802776,-0.058302008,0.049848422,0.028351713,0.007460103,-0.060052738,-0.043183662,-0.029404286,-0.059899524,0.04090925,-0.059141465,-0.05989723,0.014268803,0.01790591,-0.020641534,0.060044076,0.034244828,0.059654392,0.004487224,0.010034608,-0.035973467,0.024280798,-0.05999204,0.055780545,0.04840848,0.055788744,-0.004194754,-0.03827969,-0.05474621,-0.059521478,0.058264766,0.03347937,0.03408843,-0.035735484,-0.059483197,-0.059347287,-0.059577253,0.04077124,0.04112572,-0.004111388,-0.01651896,0.051105853,0.022158915,-0.036952812,0.05464342,0.05391293,-0.059033222,0.04907734,-0.05087032,-0.012984905,0.008722544,-0.03006044,0.053310864,0.025353089,-0.018817503,-0.039772313,-0.055039313,0.05697674,0.051073

A case for a reverse-frame coding sequence in a group of positive-sense RNA viruses,"Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses form the largest and most diverse group of eukaryote-infecting viruses. Their genomes comprise one or more segments of coding-sense RNA that function directly as messenger RNAs upon release into the cytoplasm of infected cells. Positive-sense RNA viruses are generally accepted to encode proteins solely on the positive strand. However, we previously identified a surprisingly long (~1000 codons) open reading frame (ORF) on the negative strand of some members of the family Narnaviridae which, together with RNA bacteriophages of the family Leviviridae, form a sister group to all other positive-sense RNA viruses. Here, we completed the genomes of three mosquito-associated narnaviruses, all of which have the long reverse-frame ORF. We systematically identified narnaviral sequences in public data sets from a wide range of sources, including arthropod, fungi and plant transcriptomic datasets. Long reverse-frame ORFs are widespread in one clade of narnaviruses, where they frequently occupy >95% of the genome. The reverse-frame ORFs correspond to a specific avoidance of CUA, UUA and UCA codons (i.e. stop codon reverse complements) in the forward-frame RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ORF. However, absence of these codons cannot be explained by other factors such as inability to decode these codons or GC3 bias. Together with other analyses, we provide the strongest evidence yet of coding capacity on the negative strand of a positive-sense RNA virus. As these ORFs comprise some of the longest known overlapping genes, their study may be of broad relevance to understanding overlapping gene evolution and de novo origin of

Mutation of Ebola virus VP35 Ser129 uncouples interferon antagonist and replication functions,"Ebolaviruses are non-segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses (NNSVs) within the order Mononegavirales that possess the multifunctional virion protein 35 (VP35), a major determinant of virulence and pathogenesis that is indispensable for viral replication and host innate immune evasion. VP35 is functionally equivalent to the phosphoprotein (P) of other mononegaviruses such as rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses. Phosphorylation of the P protein is universally regarded as functionally important however, a regulatory role(s) of phosphorylation on VP35 function remains unexplored. Here, we identified a highly conserved Ser129 residue near the homo-oligomerization coiled coil motif, which is essential for VP35 functions. Affinity-purification MS followed by post-translational modification (PTM) analysis predicted phosphorylation of Ser129. Co-immunoprecipitation, cross-linking, and biochemical characterization studies revealed a moderately decreased capacity of VP35-S129A to oligomerize. Functional analysis showed that Ser-to-Ala substitution of Ebola virus (EBOV) VP35 did not affect IFN inhibitory activity but nearly abolished EBOV minigenome activity. Further coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated a lost interaction between VP35-S129A and the amino terminus of the viral polymerase but not between viral nucleoprotein (NP) or VP35-WT. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that phosphorylation modulates VP35 function, supporting VP35 as a NNSV P protein and providing a potentially valuable therapeutic target.\n\nImportanceEbola virus (EBOV) can cause severe disease in humans. The 2013-2016 West African epidemic and the two recent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo underscore the urgent need for effective countermeasures, which remain lacking. A better understanding of EBOV biology and the modulation of multifunctional viral proteins is desperately needed to develop improved therapeutics. We provide evidence here that function of virion protein 35 (VP35) is modulated by phosphorylation of Ser129, a conserved residue among other ebolavirus species. These findings shed light on EBOV biology and present a potential target for broad acting anti-ebolavirus

Direct RNA nanopore sequencing of full-length coronavirus genomes provides novel insights into structural variants and enables modification analysis,"Sequence analyses of RNA virus genomes remain challenging due to the exceptional genetic plasticity of these viruses. Because of high mutation and recombination rates, genome replication by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases leads to populations of closely related viruses, so-called quasispecies. Standard (short-read) sequencing technologies are ill-suited to reconstruct large numbers of full-length haplotypes of (i) RNA virus genomes and (ii) subgenome-length (sg) RNAs comprised of noncontiguous genome regions. Here, we used a full-length, direct RNA sequencing (DRS) approach based on nanopores to characterize viral RNAs produced in cells infected with a human coronavirus.\n\nUsing DRS, we were able to map the longest ([~]26 kb) contiguous read to the viral reference genome. By combining Illumina and nanopore sequencing, we reconstructed a highly accurate consensus sequence of the human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E genome (27.3 kb). Furthermore, using long reads that did not require an assembly step, we were able to identify, in infected cells, diverse and novel HCoV-229E sg RNAs that remain to be characterized. Also, the DRS approach, which circumvents reverse transcription and amplification of RNA, allowed us to detect methylation sites in viral RNAs. Our work paves the way for haplotype-based analyses of viral quasispecies by demonstrating the feasibility of intra-sample haplotype separation.\n\nEven though several technical challenges remain to

Identification of a Novel Base J Binding Protein Complex Involved in RNA Polymerase II Transcription Termination in Trypanosomes,"Base J, {beta}-D-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil, is a modification of thymine DNA base involved in RNA Polymerase (Pol) II transcription termination in kinetoplastid protozoa. Little is understood regarding how specific thymine residues are targeted for J-modification or the mechanism of J regulated transcription termination. To identify proteins involved in J-synthesis, we expressed a tagged version of the J-glucosyltransferase (JGT) in Leishmania tarentolae, and identified four co-purified proteins by mass spectrometry: protein phosphatase (PP1), a homolog of Wdr82, a potential PP1 regulatory protein (PNUTS) and a protein containing a J-DNA binding domain (named JBP3). Gel shift studies indicate JBP3 is a J-DNA binding protein. Reciprocal tagging, co-IP and sucrose gradient analyses indicate PP1, JGT, JBP3, Wdr82 and PNUTS form a multimeric complex in kinetoplastids, similar to the mammalian PTW/PP1 complex involved in transcription termination via PP1 mediated dephosphorylation of Pol II. Using RNAi and analysis of Pol II termination by RNA-seq and RT-PCR, we demonstrate that ablation of PNUTS, JBP3 and Wdr82 lead to defects in Pol II termination at the 3-end of polycistronic gene arrays in Trypanosoma brucei. Mutants also contain increased antisense RNA levels upstream of promoters, suggesting an additional role of the complex in regulating termination of bi-directional transcription. In addition, PNUTS loss causes derepression of silent Variant Surface Glycoprotein genes important for host immune evasion. Our results provide the first direct mechanistic link between base J and regulation of Pol II termination and suggest a novel molecular model for the role of the CTD of Pol II in terminating polycistronic transcription in trypanosomatids.\n\nAuthor SummaryTrypanosoma brucei is an early-diverged parasitic protozoan that causes African sleeping sickness in humans. The genome of T. brucei is organized into polycistronic gene clusters that contain multiple genes that are co-transcribed from a single promoter. We have recently described the presence of a modified DNA base J and variant of histone H3 (H3.V) at transcription termination sites within gene clusters where the loss of base J and H3.V leads to read-through transcription and the expression of downstream genes. We now identify a novel stable multimeric complex containing a J binding protein (JBP3), base J glucosyltransferase (JGT), PP1 phosphatase, PP1 interactive-regulatory protein (PNUTS) and Wdr82, which we refer to as PJW/PP1. A similar complex (PTW/PP1) has been shown to be involved in Pol II termination in humans and yeast. We demonstrate that PNUTS, JBP3 and Wdr82 mutants lead to read-through transcription in T. brucei. Our data suggest the PJW/PP1 complex regulates termination by recruitment to termination sites via JBP3-base J interactions and dephosphorylation of specific proteins (including Pol II and termination factors) by PP1. These findings significantly expand our understanding of mechanisms underlying transcription termination in eukaryotes, including divergent organisms that utilize polycistronic transcription and novel epigenetic marks such as base J and H3.V. The studies also provide the first direct mechanistic link between J modification of DNA at termination sites and regulated Pol II termination and gene expression in kinetoplastids.",0.038770698,0.003425468,-0.035279054,0.016572917,0.042533595,-0.005171839,-0.028171979,-0.054668907,0.041199405,0.04273938,0.055922545,-0.008948032,-0.05509591,0.03474389,0.04381031,-0.055924986,-0.055738192,0.03235484,0.023593716,0.004643547,-0.052953962,0.054476365,-0.03998536,0.055853713,0.032614585,0.04885847,0.05582139,-0.023657905,-0.041887093,0.028801035,0.051023424,0.05076024,-0.018118963,-0.05362783,0.041161083,0.023526864,-0.055528425,0.019000243,-0.055040576,0.05412422,0.055410333,-0.045582965,-0.005312325,-0.029255282,0.05258905,-0.02454301,-0.049729936,-0.024774838,0.020922773,-0.04928989,-0.05344453,0.055472225,-0.055924173,-0.054625355,0.014102637,0.042425387,-0.055703394,0.03217258,0.030754654,-0.05585028,-0.001619964,-0.055092115,0.0489333,0.0313012,-0.05094675,-0.05591719,0.05575498,-0.017330565,0.049460046,0.02929342,0.04808531,0.054459546,0.055804424,0.05418478,-0.05481045,-0.03698302,0.05582808,-0.001493734,-0.055798534,0.011177975,-0.05591145,0.055832375,0.053163048,-0.054761063,-0.046855863,0.0534535,-0.042125322,-0.04029204,-0.055535536,0.049508926,0.004639396,-0.024109675,-0.050692294,0.046564568,-0.028730012,0.055791292,0.055009183,0.055923447,0.055926353,-0.020982547,-0.053116683,0.055636648,-0.041764326,0.038834535,0.033045582,0.05243474,-0.027105436,0.033765484,-0.053759906,-0.055400405,-0.051840775,-0.04739397,0.052439045,0.054498013,0.051711235,-0.024186984,-0.05592623,0.055121895,-0.045025565,0.052867863,-0.034767333,0.05592149,0.047525506,-0.055161167,0.055084083,0.05306707,0.042748358,-0.0402641,0.047884375,0.034209374,0.04799998,0.05592638,0.055287875,0.027464688,0.036905948,-0.05476211,-0.009653178,0.05504316,-0.05235511,-0.021596413,0.052114166,0.0559264,-0.055890527,-0.04057619,-0.05503653,-0.05592339,-0.014300276,-0.05344224,-0.011931426,0.05525191,-0.055029493,-0.055913232,-0.047871187,-9.70E-05,0.0559264,0.05074217,0.045822095,0.021044068,0.01383076,0.052763745,0.008363798,-0.030300876,0.032122683,0.05582247,-0.043341618,0.05430972,-0.05575481,-0.054224957,-0.055857535,-0.05450581,0.05083128,-0.003687285,0.028993083,0.054832354,0.03360665,-0.014818349,0.031081244,-0.032903686,0.051419396,-0.04541417,0.05323214,-0.041094217,-0.053615514,0.025474148,0.04012827,-0.044122584,-0.054517534,0.05147306,0.048141867,-0.003424499,0.055904254,-0.015033338,-0.01177431,-0.025144808,0.05592528,-0.055714697,0.030050801,0.045031473,0.03613399,-0.012179989,-0.014628574,0.025305567,0.021806873,-0.01054094,-0.008304473,-0.02904954,-0.02143165,0.055922966,-0.00383285,0.052010566,0.002909407,0.055706084,0.04954955,0.05358109,-0.055875152,-0.029661765,0.055022247,0.045483146,0.020390475,0.036219753,0.04763457,-0.055038527,-0.051756058,0.010389457,-0.006282708,-0.054219358,-0.05578224,-0.055666484,-0.022034643,0.033199653,0.055517808,0.048769794,-0.003661235,-0.0559264,0.05579776,0.054630384,0.053350855,-0.05591213,-0.026386254,-0.006960931,0.054853674,-0.010126296,-0.05519417,0.019560747,0.054452963,0.022608537,-0.05227124,0.05521215,0.052476756,0.027806383,-0.0559249,0.053677972,-0.03689811,0.002515088,0.04457739,-0.052668463,0.02197445,0.0559264,-0.053612996,0.046508785,0.044480562,0.017666887,-0.003995296,0.054478474,0.03288186,-0.028538052,0.008408748,-0.030407174,-0.051302176,0.028260179,0.030244017,0.0559151,-0.04256515,0.055608295,0.050220344,-0.028875396,-0.021597896,0.054830696,0.055918302,-0.04396384,-0.03428617,-0.0515944,-0.055204112,0.05431409,0.03677431,-0.050526284,0.005225785,0.050051387,-0.055497292,0.011894934,0.055926375,-0.052883364,0.055922326,-0.017557418,-0.008312123,-0.055837348,0.006974353,0.04620146,-0.0559198,0.035249773,-0.040646374,0.055607043,0.05493207,0.054222777,-0.05501864,0.053493474,0.011642343,0.00809167,0.04500617,-0.033589777,0.055804774,-0.046150193,0.055688966,-0.055655345,0.054007757,0.05024826,-0.025014667,0.002112267,0.04640675,-0.04647359,-0.054089554,0.029727127,0.054182943,-0.055812284,0.043615818,0.02146993,-0.055648696,-0.055007953,0.047853503,-0.04598349,0.010216637,-0.04489748,0.025659442,0.055844508,0.05443312,-0.031532235,0.055128247,-0.052508138,0.055697728,-0.006991056,-0.03299132,0.000262782,0.05573712,-0.03477153,-0.0559264,-0.05592458,-0.030789733,0.019502643,-0.009205659,-0.044423323,-0.05117431,0.044654507,-0.055719487,0.048366617,0.04679988,-0.05304005,-0.0559264,-0.035225224,0.03784323,-0.051491696,0.051174115,-0.055857863,-0.055832755,0.04685435,0.046936743,-0.031548977,0.055920046,0.04075848,0.051719435,0.052671775,0.045527063,-0.034046035,-0.03801158,-0.055926334,0.052611984,0.001053546,0.03278066,0.055729877,-0.007410246,-0.05592047,-0.05570174,0.036698256,-0.030670628,-0.05061451,-0.0546606,-0.055505898,-0.053646825,-0.055819105,0.055816304,0.050980065,0.032179743,-0.048776396,0.055853248,-0.055729605,-0.0172562,0.04250495,-0.03654665,-0.049992338,0.045940846,-0.00615778,-0.01451985,-0.04684174,0.011871751,-0.015471235,0.028703818,-0.040647507,-0.04258181,-0.028757574,0.022620115,0.045394547,0.037184153,-0.

Bat coronavirus phylogeography in the western Indian Ocean,"Bats are important reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens, including coronaviruses (CoVs). The Western Indian Ocean (WIO) islands are a biodiversity hotspot with more than 50 bat species. Here we tested 1,099 bats belonging to 39 species from Mozambique, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Reunion Island and Seychelles. Based on molecular screening and partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene, a total of 88 bats (8.0% {+/-} 1.6%) tested positive for bat-borne coronaviruses (CoVs), with higher prevalence in Mozambican bats (19.6% {+/-} 4.7%) as compared to those sampled on islands (4.2% {+/-} 1.2%). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that a large diversity of - and {beta}-CoVs are maintained in bat populations of the WIO, some being genetically related to human CoVs (e.g. NL63, MERS). Finally, we found a strong signal of co-evolution between CoVs and their bat host species with limited evidence for host-switching, except for bat species sharing day roost

RNA-dependent RNA polymerase speed and fidelity are not the only determinants of the mechanism or efficiency of recombination.,"Using the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from poliovirus (PV) as our model system, we have shown that Lys-359 in motif-D functions as a general acid in the mechanism of nucleotidyl transfer. A K359H (KH) RdRp derivative is slow and faithful relative to wild-type enzyme. In the context of the virus, RdRp-coding sequence evolves, selecting for the following substitutions: I331F (IF, motif-C) and P356S (PS, motif-D). We have evaluated IF-KH, PS-KH, and IF-PS-KH viruses and enzymes. The speed and fidelity of each double mutant are equivalent. Each exhibits a unique recombination phenotype, with IF-KH being competent for copy-choice recombination and PS-KH being competent for forced-copy-choice recombination. Although the IF-PS-KH RdRp exhibits biochemical properties within twofold of wild type, the virus is impaired substantially for recombination in cells. We conclude that there are biochemical properties of the RdRp in addition to speed and fidelity that determine the mechanism and efficiency of recombination. The interwoven nature of speed, fidelity, the undefined property suggested here, and recombination makes it impossible to attribute a single property of the RdRp to fitness. However, the derivatives described here may permit elucidation of the importance of recombination on the fitness of the viral population in a background of constant polymerase speed and fidelity.\n\nSignificanceThe availability of a \""universal\"" method to create attenuated viruses for use as vaccine strains would permit a rapid response to outbreaks of newly emerging viruses. Targeting RdRp fidelity has emerged as such a universal approach. However, because polymerase fidelity and speed are inextricably linked, the effort to attribute the attenuated phenotype to a single biochemical property of the RdRp may be futile. Here, we show that this circumstance is even more complex. We provide evidence for the existence of a biochemical parameter that combines with fidelity and speed to govern the mechanism and/or efficiency of recombination. We conclude that the field will be served best by continued emphasis on discovery of manipulatable functions of the RdRp instead of debating the importance of individual

Astrovirus in Reunion Free-tailed Bat (Mormopterus francoismoutoui),"Astroviruses (AstVs) are RNA viruses responsible for infection of a large diversity of avian and mammalian species, including bats, livestock, and humans. We investigated AstV infection in a free-tailed bat species, Mormopterus francoismoutoui, endemic to Reunion Island. A total of 190 guano samples were collected in a maternity colony during 19 different sampling sessions, between June 2016 and June 2017. Biological material was tested for the presence of the AstV RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) gene with a pan-AstV semi-nested polymerase chain reaction assay. In total, 15 guano samples (7.9%) tested positive, with high genetic diversity of the partial RdRp gene sequences among positive samples. A phylogenetic analysis further revealed that the detected viruses were genetically related to AstVs reported in reptiles, dogs, and pigs, but did not cluster with AstVs commonly found in bats. Although more investigation need to be conducted to assess the level of infected bats in the studied population, our findings suggest that Reunion free-tailed bats are exposed to AstV, and that cross-species transmission may occur with other hosts sharing the same

Herpesvirus infection reduces Pol II occupancy of host promoters but spares viral promoters,"In mammalian cells, widespread acceleration of cytoplasmic mRNA degradation is linked to impaired RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription. This mRNA decay-induced transcriptional repression occurs during infection with gammaherpesviruses including Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), which encode an mRNA endonuclease that initiates widespread RNA decay. Here, we show that MHV68-induced mRNA decay leads to a genome-wide reduction of Pol II occupancy at mammalian promoters. Viral genes, despite the fact that they require Pol II for transcription, escape this transcriptional repression. Protection is not governed by viral promoter sequences; instead, location on the viral genome is both necessary and sufficient to escape the transcriptional repression effects of mRNA decay. We hypothesize that the ability to escape from transcriptional repression is linked to the localization of viral DNA in replication compartments, providing a means for these viruses to counteract decay-induced viral transcript

First isolation and characterisation of Alongshan virus in Russia,"In recent decades, many new flavi-like viruses have been discovered predominantly in different invertebrates and, as was recently shown, some of them may cause disease in humans. The Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) group holds a special place among flavi-like viruses because, in contrast to the ""classic"" flaviviruses and other flavi-like viruses, they have a segmented ssRNA(+) genome. Two segments of the JMTV genome have homology with regions of the flavivirus genome encoding polymerase and helicase-protease proteins. JMTVs have several open reading frames (ORF) in segments encoding glycoprotein(s) and capsid protein and these ORF are specific only to them. JMTVs greatly differ in virion size. We isolated three strains of Alongshan virus (ALSV), which is a representative of the JMTV group, from adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks collected in two geographically-separated Russian regions in the tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Most virions purified from tick cells were spherical with a diameter of approximately 40.5 nm. In addition, we found smaller particles of approximately 13.1 nm in diameter. We obtained full genome sequences of all four segments of two of the isolated ALSV strains, and partial sequences of one segment from the third strain. Phylogenetic analysis on genome segment 2 of the JMTV group clustered our novel strains with other ALSV strains. We found evidence for the existence of a novel upstream ORF in the glycoprotein-coding segment of ALSV and other members of the JMTV group. Significance StatementWe isolated three strains of Alongshan virus (ALSV) from adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks from two geographically separate areas of Russia in the Ixodes ricinus tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Our study confirmed the value of tick cell lines in virus isolation and maintenance of persistent infection. The majority of virions of the ALSV strain Miass527 were enveloped spherical particles with a diameter of 40.5{+/-}3.7 nm. We found evidence for the existence of a novel upstream ORF in the glycoprotein-coding segment of ALSV and other members of the Jingmen tick virus

Nucleotide Analogues as Inhibitors of Viral Polymerases,"Coronaviruses such as the newly discovered virus from Wuhan, China, 2019-nCoV, and the viruses that cause SARS and MERS, have resulted in regional and global public health emergencies. Based on our molecular insight that the hepatitis C virus and the coronavirus use a similar viral genome replication mechanism, we reasoned that the FDA-approved drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) for the treatment of hepatitis C will also inhibit the above coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV. To develop broad spectrum anti-viral agents, we further describe a novel strategy to design and synthesize viral polymerase inhibitors, by combining the ProTide Prodrug approach used in the development of Sofosbuvir with the use of 3-blocking groups that we have previously built into nucleotide analogues that function as polymerase terminators.",-0.03689103,0.057108577,0.020057563,-0.066436015,-0.046054333,0.06584266,0.05667407,-0.052415743,-0.00715997,-0.020100608,0.06878692,-0.0628038,-0.015810208,-0.053338636,0.05281911,-0.06693333,-0.06843805,-0.06753478,0.060608998,-0.010793096,0.014267495,-0.038302,-0.060402468,0.059974156,0.043693587,0.05978602,0.018256899,-0.013901797,0.005797537,-0.06337928,0.052500352,0.06881419,-0.055597406,0.003289792,0.01734168,0.031208148,0.004811565,-0.03969355,-0.06153101,-0.02547828,0.0581117,-0.04873903,0.03998778,-0.05555086,0.003923048,-0.0124714,-0.043115202,-0.038101815,0.04173816,-0.001427059,-0.05879358,0.05847621,-0.05333364,0.007242485,-0.06641555,-0.063082434,-0.067838244,-0.03637172,-0.005147765,0.050471038,-0.03968362,0.04781852,0.030966394,-0.007240788,-0.022647126,-0.042522114,0.0678783,-0.0526643,-0.012246531,0.013882992,0.021751503,0.01872968,0.019596249,-0.00537994,0.00738405,0.028040191,0.054860666,-0.061094094,-0.0682264,0.034712102,-0.029084573,0.067089714,0.005873746,-0.001420861,-0.053765077,0.022974107,0.03912152,-0.011306776,-0.05270616,-0.027385648,-0.04241214,-0.054027352,-0.003888863,0.027431399,0.029491067,0.06340735,0.049882893,0.0595296,0.06834296,-0.06182036,0.016291007,0.049068928,0.014787641,0.05038494,0.059942346,0.0135995,0.046275605,0.027150182,0.04516905,-0.003531579,0.049176425,0.057616826,0.018108606,-0.01127827,0.057963226,-0.004476603,-0.049233858,-0.035538454,-0.028285304,0.009126168,-0.047448754,0.058643848,-0.018323753,-0.002494547,0.036916506,0.030184561,0.06586869,0.027799418,0.03636731,-0.04238055,-0.029715663,0.068812795,0.049627654,-0.0287993,0.04502434,-0.004107456,-0.002625538,-0.019000364,-0.0169424,-0.048968732,0.044356808,0.067989595,-0.05363136,-0.029912459,0.022448549,-0.061066568,0.003648916,-0.06777944,0.008056008,-0.008358457,0.03881661,-0.060935814,-0.06386123,-0.018560566,0.0687059,0.022693673,0.06734994,-0.027574964,0.06651837,0.012896855,-0.040431328,0.027804134,0.052870974,0.061486583,-0.022430997,-0.024990069,-0.012604849,-0.02361279,-0.060699876,-0.04527859,0.040746477,-0.057363465,0.006321844,0.021253578,0.052053437,0.036481876,-0.007911649,0.022657223,0.053037025,0.033544786,-0.015327198,0.024555713,-0.05221276,0.067756414,0.06723435,-0.03866037,-0.04662133,-0.04944869,0.01953752,-0.04823218,0.04496529,-0.024994815,-0.054177027,0.009667716,0.06829649,-0.064421326,0.02433647,0.03257606,0.02781875,-0.045398615,-0.06791684,0.06564736,0.030448306,0.011482525,0.002553409,-0.04944959,0.054321893,0.058727592,0.045516044,0.06824871,0.011328324,-0.025882822,0.05811085,0.05604536,-0.05601766,0.061942354,-0.05362949,0.055115223,-0.06021465,-0.053602025,0.018471828,-0.021783885,0.03064555,0.05689772,-0.001390725,-0.041620463,-0.06694958,-0.062839784,0.018175216,0.058871683,0.06127076,0.054583043,0.04236582,-0.06303587,0.060675558,-0.001450118,-0.038579103,-0.06777512,0.033555426,0.030015972,0.041648936,0.04165825,-0.027093945,-0.011578983,0.001053437,0.00149208,-0.06220504,0.06259073,0.029838251,-0.068167135,-0.05768297,-0.01171086,-0.00784711,0.04421004,0.06514907,-0.055868294,-0.017509269,0.06878385,-0.051305894,-0.04343471,0.037324667,0.031646516,0.015709868,0.047224876,0.027810538,0.018015418,-0.025274105,-0.058927257,0.002970277,0.044136163,0.044470906,0.064982645,-0.06358766,-0.06359426,-0.027822029,-0.06389037,0.05704635,0.025866332,0.06669922,-0.02260363,-0.018017817,-0.04586373,-0.039807215,0.021530941,-0.006438125,0.000499868,-0.04955345,-0.006215651,-0.05545208,-0.007539611,0.06831835,-0.013135816,0.06611925,-0.055783026,0.06582324,-0.05545584,-0.018619677,-0.021782115,-0.06194015,0.003523169,-0.03646191,0.062817894,0.056832887,0.007608321,-0.056466527,0.038577963,-0.062732294,-0.030543512,0.050610192,-0.055160888,-0.010269729,0.008816505,-0.042406816,-0.061180696,0.067928106,0.001133511,-0.002005023,0.025813341,0.05966328,0.016882056,-0.06724997,0.06760455,0.051389255,-0.04675128,-0.021293264,0.058079287,-0.032735873,-0.04822877,0.054251224,-0.009834565,0.029460553,0.051813647,-0.053930152,0.02938556,0.004272113,0.030816475,0.029624565,-0.041071653,0.017444365,-0.053246014,0.022060085,-0.058575004,0.065358415,-0.002733101,-0.06853648,-0.068780996,0.022881942,0.029859986,0.008885782,-0.05486025,-0.037408613,0.011996907,-0.022341862,0.03625224,0.02416687,0.0400479,-0.06839701,-0.03570673,-0.06431819,-0.05917953,0.022729477,-0.05353374,-0.064537,-0.022502065,0.009970626,-0.04478645,0.06790141,-0.023755996,0.010602828,-0.02416432,0.010292888,0.017178603,-0.006719424,-0.06787643,0.06731389,0.032906886,0.06567914,0.0505994,-0.026064727,-0.05519625,-0.061647493,0.057312362,0.06440326,0.038648494,-0.03824845,-0.044666488,-0.029222256,-0.060900494,-0.02097611,0.062358495,-0.051808275,-0.03770541,0.06073456,-0.010911712,-0.05693427,0.03645022,0.05952818,-0.046839528,0.046549466,-0.010940707,0.058367457,0.025473908,-0.026363624,0.031126328,0.04122175,-0.05911784,-0.009101569,0.017433465,0.026262853,-0.031160971,0.033927333,-0.055254247,-0.041692

Rapid reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 using a synthetic genomics platform,"Reverse genetics has been an indispensable tool revolutionising our insights into viral pathogenesis and vaccine development. Large RNA virus genomes, such as from Coronaviruses, are cumbersome to clone and to manipulate in E. coli hosts due to size and occasional instability1-3. Therefore, an alternative rapid and robust reverse genetics platform for RNA viruses would benefit the research community. Here we show the full functionality of a yeast-based synthetic genomics platform for the genetic reconstruction of diverse RNA viruses, including members of the Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae and Paramyxoviridae families. Viral subgenomic fragments were generated using viral isolates, cloned viral DNA, clinical samples, or synthetic DNA, and reassembled in one step in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using transformation associated recombination (TAR) cloning to maintain the genome as a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC). T7-RNA polymerase has been used to generate infectious RNA, which was then used to rescue viable virus. Based on this platform we have been able to engineer and resurrect chemically-synthetized clones of the recent epidemic SARS-CoV-24 in only a week after receipt of the synthetic DNA fragments.

Partial RdRp sequences offer a robust method for Coronavirus subgenus classification,"The recent reclassification of the Riboviria, and the introduction of multiple new taxonomic categories including both subfamilies and subgenera for coronaviruses (family Coronaviridae, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) represents a major shift in how official classifications are used to designate specific viral lineages. While the newly defined subgenera provide much-needed standardisation for commonly cited viruses of public health importance, no method has been proposed for the assignment of subgenus based on partial sequence data, or for sequences that are divergent from the designated holotype reference genomes. Here, we describe the genetic variation of a partial region of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is one of the most used partial sequence loci for both detection and classification of coronaviruses in molecular epidemiology. We infer Bayesian phylogenies from more than 7000 publicly available coronavirus sequences and examine clade groupings relative to all subgenus holotype sequences. Our phylogenetic analyses are largely coherent with genome-scale analyses based on designated holotype members for each subgenus. Distance measures between sequences form discrete clusters between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can attribute subgenus or indicate sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both accurately and robustly. We thus propose that partial RdRp sequence data of coronaviruses is sufficient for the attribution of subgenus-level taxonomic classifications and we supply the R package, ""MyCoV"", which provides a method for attributing subgenus and assessing the reliability of the attribution. Importance StatementThe analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplicons derived from biological samples is the most common modern method for detection and classification of infecting viral agents, such as Coronaviruses. Recent updates to the official standard for taxonomic classification of Coronaviruses, however, may leave researchers unsure as to whether the viral sequences they obtain by these methods can be classified into specific viral taxa due to variations in the sequences when compared to type strains. Here, we present a plausible method for defining genetic dissimilarity cut-offs that will allow researchers to state which taxon their virus belongs to and with what level of certainty. To assist in this, we also provide the R package MyCoV which classifies user generated

Aerodynamic Characteristics and RNA Concentration of SARS-CoV-2 Aerosol in Wuhan Hospitals during COVID-19 Outbreak,"Background: The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has spread rapidly and sparked global concern. While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear, the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been little studied. Methods: Thirty-five aerosol samples of three different types (total suspended particle, size segregated and deposition aerosol) were collected in Patient Areas (PAA) and Medical Staff Areas (MSA) of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Renmin) and Wuchang Fangcang Field Hospital (Fangcang), and Public Areas (PUA) in Wuhan, China during COVID-19 outbreak. A robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method was employed to quantitate the viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and determine aerosol RNA concentration. Results: The ICU, CCU and general patient rooms inside Renmin, patient hall inside Fangcang had undetectable or low airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but deposition samples inside ICU and air sample in Fangcang patient toilet tested positive. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 in Fangcang MSA had bimodal distribution with higher concentration than those in Renmin during the outbreak but turned negative after patients number reduced and rigorous sanitization implemented. PUA had undetectable airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but obviously increased with accumulating crowd flow. Conclusions: Room ventilation, open space, proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Gathering of crowds with asymptomatic carriers is a potential source of airborne SARS-CoV-2.

High sensitivity detection of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 using multiplex PCR and a multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method,"Many detection methods have been used or reported for the diagnosis and/or surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. Among them, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive, claiming detection of about 5 copies of viruses. However, it has been reported that only 47-59% of the positive cases were identified by RT-PCR, probably due to loss or degradation of virus RNA in the sampling process, or even mutation of the virus genome. Therefore, developing highly sensitive methods is imperative to ensure robust detection capabilities. With the goal of improving sensitivity and accommodate various application settings, we developed a multiplex-PCR-based method comprised of 172 pairs of specific primers, and demonstrate its efficiency to detect SARS-CoV-2 at low copy numbers. The assay produces clean characteristic target peaks of defined sizes, which allows for direct identification of positives by electrophoresis. In addition, optional sequencing can provide further confirmation as well as phylogenetic information of the identified virus(es) for specific strain discrimination, which will be of paramount importance for surveillance purposes that represent a global health imperative. Finally, we also developed in parallel and tested a multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method that is amenable to detect SARS-CoV-2, with the additional benefit of its potential for uncovering mutational diversity and novel pathogens at low sequencing

The R Protein of SARS-CoV: Analyses of Structure and Function Based on Four Complete Genome Sequences of Isolates BJ01-BJ04,"The R (replicase) protein is the uniquely defined non-structural protein (NSP) responsible for RNA replication, mutation rate or fidelity, regulation of transcription in coronaviruses and many other ssRNA viruses. Based on our complete genome sequences of four isolates (BJ01-BJ04) of SARS-CoV from Beijing, China, we analyzed the structure and predicted functions of the R protein in comparison with 13 other isolates of SARS-CoV and 6 other coronaviruses. The entire ORF (open-reading frame) encodes for two major enzyme activities, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and proteinase activities. The R polyprotein undergoes a complex proteolytic process to produce 15 function-related peptides. A hydrophobic domain (HOD) and a hydrophilic domain (HID) are newly identified within NSP1. The substitution rate of the R protein is close to the average of the SARS-CoV genome. The functional domains in all NSPs of the R protein give different phylogenetic results that suggest their different mutation rate under selective pressure. Eleven highly conserved regions in RdRp and twelve cleavage sites by 3CLP (chymotrypsin-like protein) have been identified as potential drug targets. Findings suggest that it is possible to obtain information about the phylogeny of SARS-CoV, as well as potential tools for drug design, genotyping and diagnostics of

Translesion polymerase kappa-dependent DNA synthesis underlies replication fork recovery,"DNA replication stress is often defined by the slowing or stalling of replication fork progression leading to local or global DNA synthesis inhibition. Failure to resolve replication stress in a timely manner contribute toward cell cycle defects, genome instability and human disease; however, the mechanism for fork recovery remains poorly defined. Here, we show that the translesion DNA polymerase (Pol) kappa, a DinB orthologue, has a unique role in both protecting and restarting stalled replication forks under conditions of nucleotide deprivation. Importantly, Pol kappa-mediated DNA synthesis during hydroxyurea (HU)-dependent fork restart is regulated by both the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway and PCNA polyubiquitination. Loss of Pol kappa prevents timely rescue of stalled replication forks, leading to replication-associated genomic instability, and a p53-dependent cell cycle defect. Taken together, our results identify a previously unanticipated role for Pol kappa in promoting DNA synthesis and replication stress recovery at sites of stalled forks.",0.02070828,-0.050809905,-0.041517776,0.023622373,0.058651607,-0.028851561,0.05223918,-0.036851197,0.059372734,0.038025808,0.059910238,-0.04560901,0.020017546,-0.024998365,0.04629145,-0.059738513,-0.059795786,0.010251272,0.04951588,0.016865851,-0.044592444,0.057775386,0.024107499,0.056370005,0.04883078,0.031784523,0.05835487,0.021055462,-0.059808493,0.009296163,0.05907349,0.059503864,-0.05545866,-0.04701824,-0.018044911,0.05753461,-0.05908339,-0.05376787,-0.05534504,-0.056120314,-0.01264305,-0.053120524,0.012522281,-0.056441884,0.044709157,-0.050151948,0.013885128,0.05224696,-0.058901906,-0.046988394,-0.053156666,0.04974619,-0.058189895,-0.024730524,-0.021178542,-0.030071866,-0.017583186,-0.028334636,0.048280675,-0.049190737,-0.045454998,-0.05922207,0.04993989,-0.014080858,-0.05007702,-0.0591506,0.05911626,0.006742641,0.035113636,-0.058164567,0.027187733,-0.05688593,0.053714845,0.02510149,0.018957652,0.03271861,0.059391454,0.058996215,-0.05317701,0.051366564,-0.059740808,0.059773214,0.020201385,-0.056535527,-0.047960825,0.026177537,-0.057183016,0.021701857,-0.020593937,0.0127054,-0.015659228,-0.05620546,-0.043449223,0.011467058,0.030943701,0.054113273,0.058517125,0.059787642,0.05979062,-0.049694408,-0.034771226,-0.004713043,-0.03792161,0.05575115,-0.057423208,0.049671266,-0.036068458,0.008998623,-0.03405049,-0.056544896,-0.057306044,-0.057462957,0.029912207,0.052299205,0.0595659,-0.016779993,-0.05856541,-0.02009399,-0.003409087,-0.042423442,-0.040454157,0.05798449,0.0492796,-0.025724204,0.05811655,0.006528962,-0.013803228,-0.0347362,0.017709,0.036045074,0.04642284,0.059930757,0.05530515,-0.052078318,0.02441091,-0.059195567,0.015186588,-0.042472318,-0.05431558,-0.05770746,0.05933009,0.05993015,-0.014051328,0.017595079,0.012343878,-0.04620037,-0.057831395,-0.01563235,0.04089617,0.013936115,0.006038116,-0.05707745,0.02206189,0.02914832,0.05993001,0.011070281,-0.000179267,0.005697935,0.006854025,0.05847749,-0.05639177,-0.040471513,0.014821824,0.05896977,-0.045742538,0.049722884,-0.059760418,0.05967636,0.012887576,-0.03473434,0.013125578,-0.05989743,0.02452058,-0.053933106,0.044840947,0.05747627,-0.047694795,0.054488715,0.05612966,-0.035724986,-0.00920995,0.057779253,0.028569588,0.049848136,0.026207527,-0.05487238,-0.050657585,-0.050896212,0.022604663,-0.03006163,0.05803099,-0.025846994,0.002607984,0.04700514,0.059919845,-0.057178993,-0.04964655,0.03585334,0.030881202,-0.021349244,0.012236405,0.043363616,-0.013146455,-0.030423867,0.05955601,0.005386271,0.006062673,0.04355887,-0.053083353,0.059872616,-0.027537508,0.055943064,0.047162477,0.020878676,-0.053868838,-0.033533577,0.055025987,-0.028171217,0.029625032,0.037682906,0.051271193,-0.057606522,-0.055261083,-0.049843177,-0.003163101,-0.037216622,-0.05843194,-0.03714506,-0.05872381,0.054488864,0.03274014,0.033213697,0.04773932,-0.059930712,0.05939942,0.043104045,-0.01313353,-0.04118371,-0.040246896,-0.024144098,0.014474332,-0.0498743,-0.048399772,-0.034887783,0.055865902,-0.007103809,-0.038346834,0.059886143,0.04760312,-0.03290655,-0.059824485,0.021464594,0.012083626,-0.019936591,0.05680912,-0.045455486,-0.048144747,0.05993289,9.23E-05,-0.057468377,0.01061998,0.006902465,0.053595517,0.05852668,0.022164237,0.035430744,-0.046502285,0.02174491,0.013007565,-0.03250128,0.019833805,0.035608135,0.015974049,0.05934219,-0.04899904,0.04106555,0.02058754,0.040528834,0.059763663,0.008034542,0.04312104,-0.042163365,-0.050458536,0.050390173,0.019120395,-0.049365222,0.004308937,0.04778534,0.022596035,-0.010830027,0.059930798,0.006422758,0.05669219,-0.051299606,0.05614705,-0.058828343,0.052559786,0.030045144,-0.059714865,-0.011330387,-0.05200286,0.05544803,0.020758362,0.05885735,-0.03685613,0.04901615,-0.025071373,0.014453587,0.046566345,0.056102823,0.059506074,-0.059283435,0.058062077,-0.05983368,0.046804465,0.04584913,0.017223753,0.042194508,-0.04620823,-0.04650701,-0.058868088,0.023144452,0.055554517,-0.058854286,0.017071337,0.056584578,-0.023971671,-0.05701295,0.05943998,0.051518273,-0.017851379,-0.029709643,-0.0205314,0.05982142,-0.007027573,0.022589084,0.043798227,-0.049222577,0.016214516,0.009720146,0.02879045,-0.029174156,0.002635964,0.003002062,-0.059924353,-0.056965336,-0.044884007,-0.045424055,-0.01675346,-0.05011068,0.001978759,0.046297334,-0.008915655,0.026430704,0.043719534,-0.043281723,-0.05992912,-0.055732947,0.016767895,0.049231846,0.036147904,-0.059917625,-0.055070624,0.024663975,0.04710326,0.005484018,0.059839208,0.043524228,0.055755258,0.028714588,-0.04029537,-0.058143094,0.048047364,-0.059932787,0.049613066,0.0498775,0.05448474,0.04159508,0.012010329,-0.059453405,0.038617715,0.048109315,0.056903064,-0.018311748,0.038998507,-0.039720964,-0.04965449,0.022210674,0.05618948,-0.022673713,0.0181992,-0.051150367,0.059382126,-0.059275206,-0.025075277,0.046084024,0.058162723,-0.05416778,-0.035779454,0.027722538,0.0363444,-0.05985389,-0.05663612,0.015145282,0.014481142,-0.059465226,0.016773265,0.05256402,0.028591646,0.05832158,0.011550798,-0.054984402,-0.00455

Origins and Evolution of the Global RNA Virome,"Viruses with RNA genomes dominate the eukaryotic virome, reaching enormous diversity in animals and plants. The recent advances of metaviromics prompted us to perform a detailed phylogenomic reconstruction of the evolution of the dramatically expanded global RNA virome. The only universal gene among RNA viruses is the gene encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed an iterative computational procedure that alternates the RdRp phylogenetic tree construction with refinement of the underlying multiple-sequence alignments. The resulting tree encompasses 4,617 RNA virus RdRps and consists of 5 major branches; 2 of the branches include positive-sense RNA viruses, 1 is a mix of positive-sense (+) RNA and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses, and 2 consist of dsRNA and negative-sense (−) RNA viruses, respectively. This tree topology implies that dsRNA viruses evolved from +RNA viruses on at least two independent occasions, whereas −RNA viruses evolved from dsRNA viruses. Reconstruction of RNA virus evolution using the RdRp tree as the scaffold suggests that the last common ancestors of the major branches of +RNA viruses encoded only the RdRp and a single jelly-roll capsid protein. Subsequent evolution involved independent capture of additional genes, in particular, those encoding distinct RNA helicases, enabling replication of larger RNA genomes and facilitating virus genome expression and virus-host interactions. Phylogenomic analysis reveals extensive gene module exchange among diverse viruses and horizontal virus transfer between distantly related hosts. Although the network of evolutionary relationships within the RNA virome is bound to further expand, the present results call for a thorough reevaluation of the RNA virus

Analysis of the Potential for N(4)-Hydroxycytidine To Inhibit Mitochondrial Replication and Function,"N(4)-Hydroxycytidine (NHC) is an antiviral ribonucleoside analog that acts as a competitive alternative substrate for virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. It exhibits measurable levels of cytotoxicity, with 50% cytotoxic concentration values ranging from 7.5 μM in CEM cells and up to >100 μM in other cell lines. The mitochondrial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (POLRMT) has been shown to incorporate some nucleotide analogs into mitochondrial RNAs, resulting in substantial mitochondrial toxicity. NHC was tested in multiple assays intended to determine its potential to cause mitochondrial toxicity. NHC showed similar cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells incubated in a glucose-free and glucose-containing media, suggesting that NHC does not impair mitochondrial function in this cell line based on the Crabtree effect. We demonstrate that the 5′-triphosphate of NHC can be used by POLRMT for incorporation into nascent RNA chain but does not cause immediate chain termination. In PC-3 cells treated with NHC, the 50% inhibitory concentrations of mitochondrial protein expression inhibition were 2.7-fold lower than those for nuclear-encoded protein expression, but this effect did not result in selective mitochondrial toxicity. A 14-day incubation of HepG2 cells with NHC had no effect on mitochondrial DNA copy number or extracellular lactate levels. In CEM cells treated with NHC at 10 μM, a slight decrease (by ∼20%) in mitochondrial DNA copy number and a corresponding slight increase in extracellular lactate levels were detected, but these effects were not enhanced by an increase in NHC treatment concentration. In summary, the results indicate that mitochondrial impairment by NHC is not the main contributor to the compound’s observed cytotoxicity in these cell

Preliminary Study on Detecting the SARS-CoV Specific Target cDNA Fragments by Multiplex PCR,"The multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was applied to detect the SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus) specific target cDNA fragments in the present study. The target cDNA fragments of SARS-CoV were synthesized artificially according to the genome sequence of SARS-CoV in GenBank submitted by The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and were used as simulated positive samples. Five primers recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) were used to amplify the fragments by single PCR and multiplex PCR. Three target cDNA fragments (121, 182 and 302 bp), as well as the three different combinations of any two of these fragments, were amplified by single PCR. The combination of these three fragments was amplified by multiplex PCR. The results indicated that the multiplex PCR technique could be applied to detect the SARS-CoV specific target cDNA fragments

Human herpesvirus 6A induces apoptosis of HSB-2 cells via a mitochondrion-related caspase pathway(),"Apoptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of viral infections. In this study, we investigated the cell death processes during productive HHV-6A infection and the underlying mechanisms. Annexin V-PI staining and electron microscopy indicated that HHV-6A is a strong inducer of apoptosis. HHV-6A infection decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential and led to morphological changes of mitochondria. The cell death was associated with activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of DNA repair enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, which is known to be an important substrate for activated caspase-3. Caspase-9 was activated significantly in HHV-6A-infected cells, whereas caspase-8 was not activated obviously. Moreover, HHV-6A infection upregulated Bax and downregulated Bcl-2. This is the first demonstration of mitochondrion-mediated, caspase-dependent apoptosis in HHV-6A-infected cells.",0.000114235,0.05847836,-0.00446908,-0.0638352,0.006030674,0.020010727,0.008401377,-0.06379794,0.057092946,-0.025550673,0.0670693,-0.012778352,-0.033179484,-0.001722895,0.02305757,-0.06693128,-0.06695278,0.04945619,0.06146004,-0.004326087,-0.06451642,0.007581927,-0.010831539,0.014475483,0.030959355,0.064288504,0.028735636,-0.055604544,-0.04651368,0.051338762,0.05538319,0.06599701,0.047836795,-0.066184215,-0.06501894,-0.025789576,-0.060330648,-0.056481782,-0.060855325,-0.024458092,0.063447654,-0.061069906,0.017888464,-0.030166987,0.030269373,0.023335367,-0.023029974,-0.045798533,0.038749777,-0.002835133,-0.037630983,0.019615198,-0.061599802,0.026309293,-0.027761579,0.03747683,-0.063017696,-0.011504184,0.06620217,-2.91E-06,-0.010080867,0.013444042,0.047952566,0.028704997,-0.000830804,-0.06674726,0.05644661,0.02966983,-0.006212997,0.029126309,0.048509076,-0.035403837,0.043484055,0.03505166,-0.051019922,-0.005931218,0.06574529,0.026229832,-0.065414965,0.06583668,-0.02694261,0.0666312,0.06119309,-0.01278477,-0.015440132,0.06159427,-0.002517095,-0.011391802,-0.020666383,0.06366701,-0.05142536,-0.037648346,-0.04652822,0.021703688,0.000238283,0.05822696,0.06518184,0.04218914,0.067044206,-0.040650208,0.05467044,0.057165485,-0.016115753,0.024026984,-0.000841351,0.04167433,-0.016803345,0.013242695,0.050358232,-0.022494748,-0.06626244,0.03941741,0.02443725,0.06503063,0.044456135,-0.008114984,-0.05390952,0.05083451,-0.020690385,-0.022791168,-0.061845813,0.06480771,0.033531893,-0.055765152,0.035906196,0.010979373,-0.06302925,-0.041294456,0.034767557,0.017986463,-0.041006867,0.06707029,0.05847855,0.038355052,0.031156277,-0.05946041,0.040256705,-0.000793815,-0.04494677,-0.029013965,0.057544358,0.06699872,-0.055876184,-0.06143724,-0.01782574,-0.003118719,0.019007165,-0.06680166,-0.04395642,-0.050868154,-0.048464358,-0.06679132,-0.022947622,0.002878886,0.06706373,-0.006805285,0.056098457,-2.14E-05,0.004120157,0.04967912,0.061333183,0.03808387,-0.021547165,0.030604938,-0.016477797,-0.053095605,-0.06080541,0.03583554,-0.051697157,-0.06132791,-0.04954397,-0.06296116,0.003091262,0.036301672,0.029571917,-0.042958878,-0.02096349,-0.040124394,0.06451079,0.06315476,0.016898831,0.048347067,-0.046729468,0.03416575,0.06546961,0.031767227,-0.059796013,0.05082115,0.056957,-0.021062763,0.003293807,0.035128355,-0.048358813,0.041005533,0.063152686,-0.0564608,-0.012256264,-0.03922436,0.038198117,-0.054640498,-0.050322156,0.006401075,-0.003840988,0.03524208,0.012291794,0.022257844,0.037870597,0.0430102,0.035423975,0.066031665,0.031981654,0.057198122,-0.0434663,0.019453585,-0.05114382,-0.054897808,-0.009476636,-0.040266305,-0.052412815,-0.043186564,0.04898628,-0.01384993,-0.0590183,0.005966074,-0.05518831,-0.010146954,-0.065987825,-0.055648506,0.018706549,0.06445814,0.038823355,0.05768255,0.020415839,-0.06673072,0.05560083,0.061531495,0.031032804,-0.06409846,-0.02000794,0.049552165,-0.000480181,0.057499595,-0.003469388,0.018834107,0.060661428,-0.042660702,-0.022834068,0.032589365,0.0539009,-0.061838698,-0.06700017,0.03479061,-0.04547399,0.015561407,0.066835135,0.026162183,-0.004326397,0.0670658,-0.066263594,-0.013887573,-0.03470985,0.006761775,-0.063836604,0.008305724,-0.024609905,0.0281613,0.019738385,0.030894382,0.044377346,0.031344097,0.050353117,0.057876464,-0.058768358,0.056665108,0.008260332,-0.03011216,0.054436926,0.015511915,0.066240646,-0.06496833,-0.062093794,-0.0589577,-0.04977656,0.043748617,-0.05848807,-0.024753263,-0.011657483,0.022611309,-0.030876148,0.05455802,0.06697137,-0.017640399,0.06452732,-0.026912129,0.026371337,-0.06578024,-0.048326306,-0.004482449,-0.06552315,0.022178423,-0.05234957,0.06692482,0.015241719,0.040170066,-0.017437816,0.037156917,-0.030069394,-0.003337525,0.051612493,-0.06256625,-0.034735072,-0.0516303,0.038756534,0.022557277,0.06500044,0.049566183,0.040017784,0.019256616,0.009220877,-0.06254231,-0.016894216,-0.01388633,-0.010069814,-0.021387598,0.018054245,0.06656933,0.055924192,-0.058867212,0.012660938,0.03522569,-0.05917349,0.064084396,-0.021803215,0.0635045,0.020349348,0.046795327,-0.028339742,-0.026580496,0.040342543,-0.05323875,0.007354537,0.041713096,0.046608627,0.029100044,-0.06705667,-0.067050636,-0.043905683,0.061492935,-0.06018873,-0.06316241,-0.035287086,0.044640366,-0.06200491,0.003537746,-0.020698212,-0.004001003,-0.067049354,0.013463205,0.021274108,0.000265699,0.028936319,-0.048281897,-0.06642086,-0.049816664,0.01299892,-0.001756274,0.06573235,0.062426925,0.050643977,0.058200195,0.049548972,-0.02533663,0.05942083,-0.0670702,0.054955035,0.017615294,0.05808597,0.028547596,0.004329599,-0.011975355,-0.066669494,0.012341945,0.061248906,0.053545713,0.018718952,-0.048349977,0.007182093,-0.061327763,0.065432206,-0.044764165,0.047172446,0.04939143,0.03524043,-0.041162204,0.029183023,-0.029952353,0.04529081,-0.058943108,0.017273026,-0.06534531,0.04717108,0.007701004,0.05785004,-0.02055758,0.040592495,-0.037600752,-0.047342733,-0.042921916,0.039880164,0.03919973,0.029684447,-0.047043446,0.0118205

Proofreading-Deficient Coronaviruses Adapt for Increased Fitness over Long-Term Passage without Reversion of Exoribonuclease-Inactivating Mutations,"The coronavirus (CoV) RNA genome is the largest among the single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses. CoVs encode a proofreading 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV high-fidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold-decreased fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogues. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in parallel with wild-type MHV (WT-MHV). Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated enhanced replication and increased competitive fitness without reversion at the ExoN(-) active site. Furthermore, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 was less susceptible than MHV-ExoN(-) P3 to multiple nucleoside analogues, suggesting that MHV-ExoN(-) was under selection for increased replication fidelity. We subsequently identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially accounted for the reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogues. Our results suggest that increased replication fidelity is selected in ExoN(-) CoVs and that there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) reversion. These results also support the hypothesis that high-fidelity replication is linked to CoV fitness and indicate that multiple replicase proteins could compensate for ExoN functions during replication.",-0.04844188,-0.03522412,-0.057539657,-0.035870142,0.056764014,0.05827071,0.055361845,-0.055080954,0.0454296,0.043651093,0.061721224,-0.03542197,0.000864367,0.042794377,0.06006127,-0.06141907,-0.06119454,-0.027129274,0.06168537,0.044869546,-0.058707792,0.04510134,-0.035139784,0.060035463,0.061203912,0.05083208,0.04660029,0.034160424,-0.051654812,-0.032418974,0.05466702,0.061290037,-0.028142516,-0.036663637,-0.013245814,0.000874901,-0.05843255,-0.023971746,-0.05999022,0.04056942,-0.03241883,-0.053304505,-0.007205447,-0.05534868,0.038084302,-0.035334464,-0.03390442,0.05417685,0.005629614,0.053284284,-0.026333125,0.006541333,-0.061204705,-0.044774868,-0.053942163,0.014876427,-0.050100062,-0.050558228,0.050880082,-0.048988458,-0.04525286,0.004106534,0.05927524,-0.035077903,-0.014638418,-0.06061898,0.059483655,0.032198757,0.052238993,-0.0365464,0.023864267,0.04163821,0.056984473,0.06043399,-0.04745423,0.017791927,0.06136073,0.020494139,-0.061040506,0.053235773,-0.04262223,0.061725423,-0.040808864,0.005315325,-0.054798506,0.058090866,0.02975421,0.031212384,-0.019679844,0.007439293,-0.029070137,-0.015837237,-0.061194107,0.01622009,0.019212766,0.05239718,0.049441427,0.058979876,0.061600886,-0.022191545,-0.03363639,-0.04371925,-0.009820817,0.00739081,0.040441766,0.016893493,0.029616687,0.044713296,-0.02960095,-0.031490915,-0.028107597,0.04267463,0.032821953,0.007123495,0.061203245,-0.007425856,-0.031208424,-0.032480694,-0.011070688,-0.05612088,-0.05760038,0.058455475,0.010835347,-0.040261865,0.04912625,0.053953044,-0.04390416,-0.006813276,-0.016962115,-0.018283552,-0.052241016,0.0617375,0.059914634,-0.04417015,-0.04937914,0.03490619,0.03895409,0.05961593,-0.029239556,0.002516946,0.037959304,0.061737463,-0.05936894,-0.05181764,-0.008559573,-0.041447137,-0.031947255,-0.061627503,0.01743834,0.059621118,0.018334353,-0.055717073,-0.058860425,-0.050453987,0.061737314,0.025349122,0.010979504,0.033685405,0.04789277,-0.014046103,-0.060811248,-0.03367762,-0.03586797,0.061531883,-0.048671786,-0.0001761,-0.06116365,0.0536221,-0.047948766,-0.05799284,-0.012650822,-0.053958677,-0.04885353,0.04264616,0.03502474,-0.037154473,0.027734257,-0.0161373,0.061179794,0.015998445,-0.056733973,-0.021466812,0.00853085,0.04224756,0.056077465,-0.025763217,-0.022598404,0.022842357,0.050663695,0.000774791,0.060887896,-0.013245621,-0.03962561,0.041903656,0.06161799,-0.0504731,-0.03916937,-0.016881827,0.012372784,-0.027470144,-0.0515099,0.05451331,-0.039913774,0.016009843,0.059184417,-0.029966068,-0.05138015,0.05611975,0.03554365,0.060310587,0.021659497,0.058544096,0.05948198,0.05493332,-0.061038576,-0.043826904,0.014180114,0.052614145,-0.04216389,-0.034065988,0.03856868,-0.020982275,-0.028270705,0.03286331,-0.02019858,-0.013402795,-0.061142877,-0.058584634,0.031005891,-0.009768003,0.024409108,0.05762704,0.051070433,-0.061733365,0.06147517,-0.001958323,0.046078086,-0.005663736,-0.043844037,0.04426205,0.03610425,0.030041115,-0.061432835,0.048465423,0.05071744,-0.04049026,-0.05445145,0.05272048,-0.03486261,-0.059322618,-0.06166656,0.046146113,-0.006952016,0.043528695,0.05624706,-0.04918728,-0.060765434,0.061737996,-0.056306623,0.029473359,-0.023036052,0.047859963,0.048483737,0.059536874,0.021378914,0.05889951,-0.04680736,0.006834995,-0.005387988,-0.004912488,0.038706414,0.061633844,0.022730188,0.060259443,-0.013195992,-0.059755195,0.030453488,0.04705408,0.061555542,-0.055934254,0.018271426,0.03788885,-0.058334038,0.057128582,-0.032903593,-0.016102917,-0.05629232,0.05640944,-0.051496927,0.010759949,0.061717197,-0.010877756,0.056622505,-0.031532347,0.019825164,-0.046993133,-0.010435928,-0.006802029,-0.06153734,-0.03923067,-0.052313898,0.05477822,0.05790564,0.054714065,-0.046904765,0.0451746,-0.059586477,0.014452571,0.060560167,-0.03502618,0.02881718,-0.023784995,0.035316445,-0.061400544,0.058018826,0.031601015,-0.040201228,0.00507141,0.04539767,-0.031181075,-0.06099659,0.032934055,0.036315717,-0.056774013,0.01282546,0.03733121,0.002316245,-0.05912424,-0.049041934,0.002511219,-0.049050692,-0.028114514,0.027525393,0.061446752,-0.035956193,0.030082883,0.058609717,-0.011267717,0.027619073,-0.03311671,-0.000713289,-0.030554999,0.055451673,-0.026553255,-0.06173654,-0.061616078,-0.042587303,0.055712026,0.018310228,-0.061167732,0.030179882,0.013375891,-0.041098986,-0.044030163,-0.002939632,-0.045613784,-0.061731618,-0.0589355,-0.047411144,-0.060236555,-0.008331537,-0.06046252,-0.06049892,0.007243767,0.041883167,-0.039228827,0.06158056,0.052679487,0.05870957,0.00357275,-0.02784843,-0.058769584,-0.020851023,-0.061737835,0.060022365,0.02167203,0.05588175,-0.017555311,0.04817161,-0.061458677,-0.061155453,0.06047379,0.050460756,-0.042669218,0.014813663,-0.02180265,-0.052037083,-0.0514364,0.058024798,0.055445366,-0.011180782,-0.02183923,0.023124259,-0.058005843,-0.009312133,0.05781063,0.058578946,-0.061259206,-0.031187713,-0.059521664,0.06038916,-0.039387602,-0.021434614,0.025155757,-0.047524333,-0.058107745,-0.05712932,0.030868638,0.05119157,0.05258748

siRNAs Derived from Cymbidium Mosaic Virus and Odontoglossum Ringspot Virus Down-modulated the Expression Levels of Endogenous Genes in Phalaenopsis equestris,"Interplay between Cymbidium mosaic virus (CymMV)/Odontoglossum ringspot virus (ORSV) and its host plant Phalaenopsis equestris remain largely unknown, which led to deficiency of effective measures to control disease of P. equestris caused by infecting viruses. In this study, for the first time, we characterized viral small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) profiles in P. equestris co-infected with CymMV and ORSV through small RNA sequencing technology. CymMV and ORSV small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) demonstrated several general and specific/new characteristics. vsiRNAs, with A/U bias at the first nucleotide, were predominantly 21-nt long and they were derived predominantly (90%) from viral positive-strand RNA. 21-nt siRNA duplexes with 0-nt overhangs were the most abundant 21-nt duplexes, followed by 2-nt overhangs and then 1-nt overhangs 21-nt duplexes in infected P. equestris. Continuous but heterogeneous distribution and secondary structures prediction implied that vsiRNAs originate predominantly by direct Dicer-like enzymes cleavage of imperfect duplexes in the most folded regions of the positive strand of both viruses RNA molecular. Furthermore, we totally predicted 54 target genes by vsiRNAs with psRNATarget server, including disease/stress response–related genes, RNA interference core components, cytoskeleton-related genes, photosynthesis or energy supply related genes. Gene Ontology classification showed that a majority of the predicted targets were related to cellular components and cellular processes and performed a certain function. All target genes were down-regulated with different degree by vsiRNAs as shown by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.

A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster,"Summary Background An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date. Methods In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done. Findings From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged >60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats. Interpretation Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.

Viral Respiratory Tract Infection During the First Postoperative Year Is a Risk Factor for Chronic Rejection After Lung Transplantation,"BACKGROUND: Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is the major limiting factor for long-term survival in lung transplant recipients. Viral respiratory tract infection (VRTI) has been previously associated with CLAD development. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of VRTI during the first year after lung transplantation in relation to CLAD development. METHOD: Ninety-eight patients undergoing lung transplantation were prospectively enrolled between 2009 and 2012. They were monitored for infections with predefined intervals and on extra visits during the first year, the total follow-up period ranged between 5 and 8 years. Nasopharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were analyzed using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction panel for respiratory pathogens. Data regarding clinical characteristics and infectious events were recorded. RESULTS: Viral respiratory tract infection during the first year was identified as a risk factor for long-term CLAD development (P = 0.041, hazard ratio 1.94 [1.03-3.66]) in a time-dependent multivariate Cox regression analysis. We also found that coronavirus in particular was associated with increased risk for CLAD development. Other identified risk factors were acute rejection and cyclosporine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that VRTI during the first year after lung transplantation is associated with long-term CLAD development and that coronavirus infections in particular might be a risk factor.",-0.013488539,0.04927893,-0.059443746,-0.058115263,-0.05975154,-0.03537959,0.05856321,-0.05431328,0.05723628,-0.007523211,0.06226122,0.06008065,0.015193168,-0.007667086,0.057357285,-0.040167153,-0.06226306,-0.04194023,0.032158498,0.04901773,-0.05817055,0.049144145,0.014093419,0.011037841,0.030594205,0.059026204,-0.054362226,-0.003601805,-0.05491081,-0.040088076,0.019321667,0.062268782,-0.027004968,0.03947082,-0.057968426,-0.048423633,-0.062162403,-0.03330195,-0.048846997,-0.028907983,0.016731579,0.0575462,0.045613214,0.009111464,-0.057507012,0.024925435,-0.016479183,-0.04706084,0.006612169,-0.030735116,-0.058368634,-0.019725261,-0.060918014,-0.05468249,-0.05919536,0.038461734,-0.06202056,0.007235223,0.062035266,0.05428614,-0.019359235,0.003370681,0.023687936,-0.054164886,-0.011167484,-0.060134325,0.060886092,-0.059108548,0.061584435,0.052907664,-0.014803512,-0.052210417,0.036499742,0.05567343,-0.01352302,0.03852787,-0.026948323,0.02614413,-0.061230067,-0.03248153,0.061611332,0.058078814,0.04410705,0.024148539,-0.044883512,0.060354337,0.013458793,-0.00671663,-0.009645549,-0.058521535,-0.056262083,0.012271209,-0.0595088,0.04139813,0.002881436,0.04671478,-0.032115832,0.058178045,0.060940012,-0.046669662,-0.057191294,0.03292184,0.032108914,0.061367553,0.03907802,-0.001303689,0.02117047,-0.020103173,0.010114829,0.047417294,-0.044972945,0.05183337,0.04812292,0.057920188,0.05743603,0.051462695,-0.006758922,0.013813691,0.0612989,0.046522852,-0.0331803,0.011637672,-0.015294239,-0.04422331,0.035604153,0.02446988,-0.03856343,0.007070535,0.012964039,0.05623139,-0.043564323,0.062268745,0.05984995,0.011040282,0.055905838,-0.06069582,0.02029456,0.048339278,-0.009504837,-0.026949992,-0.05320291,0.06226528,-0.062077977,-0.032470178,0.006058517,-0.026203185,0.033055615,-0.05712273,0.055058338,-0.022169482,-0.007064011,0.023009961,-0.062052194,-0.061292663,0.036490604,-0.025385492,0.050948057,0.051981486,0.054915354,-0.050926622,-0.050032925,0.003538139,-0.008227377,0.025242718,-0.007606198,-0.05529743,-0.039469074,0.047378954,-0.049457263,-0.058205158,0.026457967,-0.062246908,-0.003179405,-0.01568681,0.052771725,-0.027915291,0.027401228,-0.046754245,0.05879413,0.027238106,0.027017534,0.040044468,-0.028225714,0.000372093,0.06207407,0.05952995,-0.049598686,-0.053166658,0.03958064,-0.010643928,0.043301657,-0.04796026,0.011466196,0.034123152,-0.004101916,-0.027843611,-0.058263607,0.045626927,-0.02644189,-0.005712433,-0.039663203,0.049479514,-0.049217064,0.013345151,0.041937746,0.016019033,0.00971997,0.037645392,0.031930055,0.06122675,0.04822388,0.05627767,0.058397118,0.0603308,-0.054990638,0.049821805,0.009951355,0.05751763,-0.00301974,-0.019785453,0.024927901,-0.022678923,0.003427247,-0.002966375,0.055104975,0.006273263,-0.06200567,-0.06160682,0.010768883,0.06186136,0.045160804,0.0601526,0.053817347,-0.06222581,0.056768455,-0.050754733,0.047087375,0.024051853,-0.03097087,0.002088838,-0.037194267,0.040110387,0.001700904,-0.059150394,0.05680803,-0.0620548,-0.06001966,0.035055794,0.049054667,-0.062228546,0.06121426,-0.058673996,-0.04649433,0.02415262,0.059400313,0.022536686,-0.04982269,0.062268764,-0.049282484,-0.009569332,-0.0374214,0.052476395,-0.050997075,0.046828736,-0.044666078,0.01858182,-0.008806513,-0.050467264,-0.048921596,0.035703592,0.055401403,0.0601956,-0.054001372,-0.043175615,-0.049498126,-0.058667812,0.056009788,-0.03963091,0.05915986,-0.016371718,-0.05982954,-0.03806741,-0.044140395,0.010936794,-0.002420262,-0.007088309,-0.061642736,0.041570805,0.029335296,-0.01103779,0.061449602,0.052709814,0.05405244,-0.054095555,-0.024934405,-0.058746554,-0.031082753,0.018240642,-0.059250332,0.04537776,-0.038674,0.018230071,0.04521943,-0.055333585,-0.061357453,0.045789495,-0.048747074,-0.05833645,0.000231427,-0.015239774,-0.054120176,-0.001829201,-0.05871396,-0.059898917,0.061171755,-0.061349776,0.004068621,0.006318568,0.052193783,0.055538412,-0.035086393,0.031685185,0.024406938,-0.038385577,-0.06028966,0.062253468,-0.036566306,-0.058697756,-0.061736424,-0.05840138,-0.029681837,0.060810585,-0.04052001,0.061399624,0.054340582,0.05455535,-0.038873903,0.057344493,0.007304512,-0.010661982,0.019893091,0.025991509,0.060871143,0.05983841,-0.0603262,-0.06222429,-0.010212943,0.037937086,-0.06177034,-0.06050512,0.05080871,0.020053018,0.000483763,0.054527905,0.021369556,0.03592833,-0.06226446,-0.045564447,-0.032757185,-0.05762277,0.029162407,-0.031121075,-0.057224855,0.06139081,-0.022083052,0.020525247,0.062016476,0.060615893,-0.044211004,-0.052887946,-0.039974194,-0.00852685,0.006203705,0.016143706,0.026271125,0.053998888,0.02052193,0.012648385,0.034548905,-0.060837813,0.043326806,0.05341741,0.05654723,0.061126128,-0.008537337,0.04470946,0.018740324,-0.05775571,0.011585647,0.040746216,0.040246047,0.05870977,-0.02456897,-0.023794752,-0.055276852,0.056587264,-0.024002701,-0.06094259,0.058986157,-0.062107053,0.001564043,0.06038733,-0.011535957,0.0555952,0.010716021,-0.02602349,0.032077298,0.043183368,0.05836704,0.025451824,0.0594165
