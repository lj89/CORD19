# CORD19

CORD19 project is about Text Mining, Knowledge Discovery & Question Answer.
Our goal: efficiently extract information from 45,000 + papers to find cures for COVID-19.

By Keyword Window search, I found the following Potential drug candidates:
therapeutic peptides , antiviral nucleosides target rna polyermase; protease inhibitor; monoclonal antibody can be a target; macrocyclic peptides; gs5734; quercetin; pb2 subunit; xinjiaxiangruyin; iav usurps zbtb25; m2 inhibitors; nitazoxanide ntz; active small molecular inhibitors; NHC;… (Based on past researches on sars/mers,flu, hcv,herp, ebov – other diseases caused by rna viruses)

My method of identify similar papers based cosine similarity is tested to be effective.

Question Answering system based on the same method also seem to work, but need further validation.

More research can be done use the top words identified in text mining in combination with domain knowledge. I plan to come back after my final projects to dig deeper.

Also got pretty good document dlustering results. Worth trying to label the clusters. May find useful information.
