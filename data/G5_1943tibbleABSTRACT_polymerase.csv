33,Polymerase chain reaction for probe synthesis and for direct amplification in detection of bovine coronavirus,"Abstract The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to synthesize ds and ss probes for the detection of bovine coronavirus (BCV) using recombinant plasmids as template molecules. The ds probes detected a minimum of about 2 × 105 viral genomes after exposure for 1 h, a detection limit similar to nick-translated probes after exposure of the films for 60 h. More than 8 h exposure to blots probed with these ds probes resulted in complete darkening of the film. The ss probes, synthesized by asymmetric PCR on linearized plasmids, permitted the detection of 5 × 104 genomes, which equalled the capacity of random-primed probes. Prolonged exposure did not increase the background as in case of ds PCR-probed blots. Probes, synthesized by asymmetric PCR and random-priming were labeled to similar specific activities and were better in terms of sensitivity and detectability as opposed to nick-translated probes. However, the specificity of detection with ss probes as to random primed probes was increased further. About 10 viral genomes, after fragment-specific amplification by PCR, were detected by agarose-gel analysis. PCR-probe synthesis was simple, highly reproducible, and allowed the synthesis of probes for specific fragments.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.022909019,0.019712593,0.11464431900000001,5.88e-05,-0.018149931,-0.017701876000000002,-0.002983118,0.00829222,-0.016390206,0.000300973,-0.013691419,-0.010598321,0.015125703,-0.011912016999999999,0.013779263,0.016656308,0.001644204,-0.021010197,-0.016445575,-0.078007357,-0.003639232,0.011550066000000001,0.034137816,-0.019691071,-0.009230611,-0.023967693999999998,-0.017239481,-0.016031335,-0.009978223,0.044608311
35,An appraisal of different methods for the detection of the walnut strain of cherry leafroll virus,"Abstract Three methods were evaluated for the detection of cherry leafroll virus: ELISA, dot-blot and reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Dot-blot and RT-PCR were carried out in crude plant extracts without any further RNA purification. Dot-blot hybridization using a 32P-labelled DNA probe was as sensitive as previously reported ELISA results for cherry leafroll virus detection. The most sensitive method was RT-PCR, which amplified a specific fragment of 448 bp from the 3' untranslated region of both viral genomic RNAs. RT-PCR was used to detect cherry leafroll virus in infected walnut buds and twigs.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.004789098,0.086856585,0.275329566,0.11298901300000001,0.00027371299999999997,-0.08915081400000001,-0.054803907,-0.023766305,-0.010028383,-0.005050345,0.020797293,-0.047392879000000006,0.000900874,0.132255979,0.013616263,0.010985074,0.055344593,0.006083096,-0.056826582,-0.081018965,-0.025820008999999998,0.045221677,0.020882479,0.043282924,0.025407066000000002,0.017817951999999998,0.066154879,-0.050793483,0.02791343,0.050360024
36,Optimization of extraction and PCR amplification of RNA extracts from paraffin-embedded tissue in different fixatives,"Abstract A method was developed for fast and efficient isolation of RNA from paraffin-embedded tissue sections for subsequent PCR analysis. This method is based on the binding of RNA to acid-treated glass beads in the presence of a high molarity of guanidinium salt. It can be completed within an hour, and obviates the need for dewaxing and phenol/chloroform extractions. The effect of various fixatives and fixation times was tested and the amplification of actin mRNA fragments ranging in length from 82 to 507 bp was used to demonstrate the presence of RNA in the extracts. The method was compared to existing extraction techniques by studying the quality of the templates for reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction amplification (RT-PCR), using virus-infected and mock-infected paraffin-embedded cell pellets as a model. PCR amplification of cellular and viral RNA was successful for RNA isolated by use of all extraction techniques, although the glass bead method was preferred for its simplicity and rapidity. Specimens fixed with formalin were found to be suitable for PCR, but the best results were obtained with acetone-fixed paraffin-embedded material. Dewaxing of tissue sections had no effect on the yield and quality of RNA extractions, and further purification of the extracts using gel filtration did not improve the results. After the protocols were optimized, rotavirus-infected cell pellets were used to demonstrate that extraction and amplification of dsRNA was possible. The information obtained from the studies with the model system was used for extraction of toroviral and rotaviral RNA from archival intestinal material. These data indicate that paraffin-embedded archival tissue can be used for RT-PCR analysis, adding an important technique to diagnostic pathology and retrospective studies.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.074814998,0.04502060099999999,0.14957316,0.068398565,-0.048134739,-0.064651309,-0.007222254,0.0040994,-0.034028098,0.024154158,0.028751967000000003,-0.023614961,0.017698849,0.047115117000000005,0.027025632999999997,0.031142074,-0.012306938,0.002470659,-0.043770023,-0.059433993,-0.057788264000000006,0.005186535,0.027274415,-0.067383208,-0.025169833,-0.029562207000000004,-0.027958212000000003,-0.005287266999999999,-0.037305725,0.05476754
50,Detection of feline immunodeficiency proviral DNA in peripheral blood lymphocytes by the polymerase chain reaction,"Abstract Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) proviral DNA was detected by the polymerase chain reaction method (PCR). PCR products were detected by gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The P-10, P-15 and P-24 regions of the gag gene of FIV were chosen as the target sequences for amplification, and three primer pairs were prepared. The PCR products subjected to amplification with each primer pair were found to possess sites of digestion by a restriction enzyme, as hypothesized. They did not react with feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-infected or feline syncytium-forming virus (FeSFV)-infected cell-derived DNA, and specifically amplified FIV-infected cell-derived DNA. FIV proviral DNA was detected by the PCR method with either primer pair (one-step amplification: single PCR) in DNA derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 7 of 12 FIV antibody-positive cats. When PCR products in each of the 12 cats were subjected to a second amplification using the same primer pair (two-step amplification: double PCR), FIV proviral DNA was detected in all of the cats. When PBL samples collected from three cats that were negative and three that were positive in the single PCR were cultured for a few weeks in the presence of interleukin 2, FIV proviral DNA was detected in all six cats by the single PCR method. The results suggest that either the use of cultured PBL as the sample or the performance of the double PCR method enables simple and specific detection of FIV proviral DNA in PBL.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.017769612,0.024182362000000002,0.185319237,-0.067828084,-0.007222627,-0.019757153,0.018093632,-0.017782977,-0.029869492,-0.073055568,0.184599492,-0.096888824,0.137785626,-0.016687597,-0.059273463,0.006031929,0.019137892,-0.02468123,0.005361313,-0.016835248,-0.03697874,0.009692947,0.06771578,0.0007106230000000001,-0.036481526,-0.012958433,-0.068528245,0.057105657000000004,-0.037375485,0.060906909
55,Advances in the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections,"Abstract Background: Advances have been made in selecting sensitive cell lines for isolation, in early detection of respiratory virus growth in cells by rapid culture assays, in production of monoclonal antibodies to improve many tests such as immunofluorescence detection of virus antigens in nasopharyngeal aspirates, in highly sensitive antigen detections by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassays (TR-FIAs) and biotin-enzyme immunoassays (BIOTH-E), and, finally, in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of respiratory virus DNA or RNA in clinical specimens. All of these advances have contributed to new or improved possibilities for the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections. Objectives and study design: This review summarizes our experiences during the last 15 years in the development of diagnostic tests for respiratory virus infections, and in use of these tests in daily diagnostic work and in epidemiological studies. Results: Immunofluorescence tests based on monoclonal antibodies, all-monoclonal TR-FIAs, and biotin-enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) have about the same sensitivities and specificities. They compare well with the sensitivity of virus culture. PCR followed by liquid-phase hybridization is a sensitive method for detecting adenovirus DNA and enterovirus and rhinovirus RNA in clinical specimens. IgG EIA on paired acute and convalescent phase sera is the most sensitive serological test for respiratory virus infections and is a valuable reference method when evaluating the sensitivity of new diagnostic tests. The IgG avidity test can distinguish primary infections from re-infections at least in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. IgM antibody assays, on the other hand, had low sensitivities in our studies. Conclusions: The choice of diagnostic methods for respiratory virus infections depends on the type and location of the laboratory, the number of specimens tested, and the previous experience of the laboratory. Virus culture, whenever possible, should be the basic diagnostic method; the results, including identification of the virus, should be available no more than 24 h later than the results of rapid diagnostic tests. In small laboratories, especially in hospitals where specimen transportation is well organized, immunofluorescence may be the best choice for antigen detection with the provision that an experienced microscopist and a good UV microscope are available. If the laboratory receives a large number of specimens and has previous experience with EIAs, then biotin-EIAs or TR-FIAs may be the most practical techniques. Their advantages include the stability of the antigens in clinical samples since intact, exfoliated epithelial cells are not required, treatment of specimens is practical, testing of large numbers of specimens is possible, and reading the printed test result is less subjective than reading fluorescence microscopy. The larger role of PCR in the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections depends on future developments such as practical methods to extract DNA or RNA and to purify the extracts from nonspecific inhibitors, plus further improvements to minimize cross-contamination. Group-specific detection of enteroviruses and rhinoviruses is an example of the potential for PCR technology. In experienced laboratories. EIA IgG antibody tests should be available. Recombinant antigens may be a useful part of such assays.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.128936826,0.01838817,0.12354907,0.128475735,-0.076741853,-0.059654778,0.045973012,-0.027048557,0.047125306,0.112268866,-0.027967544,-0.08430007099999999,0.12997019699999998,-0.043457535,0.06984127799999999,-0.044877303,-0.000222529,0.005551014,-0.003898364,-0.059373065,-0.004073088,-0.098520139,0.079328565,-0.11164406699999999,0.031848343,0.010406619,-0.012182232,-0.031604518,-0.08016257,-0.011875146999999999
58,Diagnostic Techniques: Serological and Molecular Approaches,"Virus laboratory diagnostics has an increasingly important role in modern patient care. Virological methods are needed to investigate the etiology of acute viral infection or the reactivation of a latent infection, as well as to follow virus load in antiviral treatments. Serological assays are also used for screening of blood products for the risk of certain chronic infections, evaluation of the immune status, and need for prophylatic treatments in connection with organ transplantations. For diagnostic purposes the following approaches can be used: demonstration of presence of infectious virus or its structural components directly from a patient's specimens or investigation of specific antibody response in serum specimes. Virus isolation is used to demonstrate infectious virus in a patient's specimens, whereas nucleic acid amplification techniques, like polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are widely used to detect virus nucleic acids. Virus antigens are investigated by antigen detection assays. Serological diagnosis is based on either the demonstration of the presence of virus-specific IgM antibodies or a significant increase in the levels of specific IgG antibodies. Immunoassays are the most commonly used serological assays. Point-of-care tests (POC tests), both for antigens and antibodies, are also becoming more and more common in diagnostic use.

80,Chapter 13 Biotechnological innovations in farm and pet animal disease diagnosis,"Abstract The application of innovative diagnostic technologies for the detection of animal pathogens at an early stage is essential in restricting the economic loss incurred due to emerging infectious animal diseases. The desirable characteristics of such diagnostic methods are easy to use, cost-effective, highly sensitive, and specific, coupled with the high-throughput detection capabilities. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are still the most common assays used for the detection of animal pathogens across the globe. However, utilizing the principles of ELISA and PCR, several serological and molecular technologies have been developed to achieve higher sensitivity, rapid, and point-of-care (POC) detection such as lateral flow assays, biosensors, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, recombinase polymerase amplification, and molecular platforms for field-level detection of animal pathogens. Furthermore, animal disease diagnostics need to be updated regularly to capture new, emerging and divergent infectious pathogens, and biotechnological innovations are helpful in fulfilling the rising demand for such diagnostics for the welfare of the society. Therefore, this chapter primarily describes and discusses in detail the serological, molecular, novel high-throughput, and POC assays to detect pathogens affecting farm and companion animals.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.030267071,0.068249936,0.23342493600000003,0.039555793,-0.084368641,-0.0073972809999999995,0.10323499300000001,0.012631354,-0.011238048,0.095733098,-0.072343274,-0.015615506000000001,0.099262437,-0.127604836,-0.0006672830000000001,0.011567681000000002,-0.06162490599999999,-0.002826082,-0.044327899000000004,-0.004713801,-0.024268658,-0.0673811,0.053296138,-0.073169359,0.014010969,-0.030934565,-0.038524476,-0.013772123999999998,-0.028723200000000004,0.0033830109999999996
84,Chapter 5 Laboratory diagnosis of viral infection,"Abstract Since the last Handbook of Clinical Neurology volume on this topic, viral diagnosis has made tremendous strides, moving from the margin to the mainstream of clinical care. For many years, conventional virus isolation was the mainstay of viral diagnosis since it was sensitive and “open-minded.” However, growth in conventional cell culture entails an inherent delay that limits its clinical impact. Although rapid culture and viral antigen methods detect fewer pathogens and are less sensitive than conventional culture, both require less expertise and have greatly reduced time to result. Polymerase chain reaction has ushered in a new era in virology, especially in the diagnosis of neurologic diseases. Molecular amplification methods are rapid, highly sensitive, can be automated, quantitative, and detect viruses not amenable to routine culture.

89,Combination of multiplex reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification with an immunochromatographic strip for subtyping influenza A virus,"Abstract Considering the fatal human victims and economic loss by the annual epidemic influenza virus, the development of a rapid and convenient genetic analysis methodology is demanding for timely on-site pathogen detection. In this study, we utilized reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) for multiplex target gene amplification, and the resultant amplicons were analyzed on the immunochromatographic strip (ICS) for subtyping influenza A virus. Through the optimized primer design, reaction temperature and time, and concentration of enzymes (Bst DNA polymerase and AMV reverse transcriptase) and dNTP, the HA (H1, H3, and H5 gene) and conserved M gene were amplified. The ICS contains two test lines in addition to a control line in order to detect the presence of the HA and M gene, thereby informing us of influenza virus A type as well as its subtype (H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1). The combination of the multiplex RT-LAMP with the ICS could be complete in 40min and the pathotyping and subtyping of influenza A virus were performed even with 10 copies of viral RNA templates. Moreover, the subtyping of clinical samples, which were obtained from patients infected by influenza A virus was successfully confirmed using the multiplex RT-LAMP and ICS techniques, showing great feasibility of our methodology for real sample analysis with high speed, simplicity and sensitivity.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.046489598,0.003866933,0.19513260699999999,0.18254489100000001,-0.025108355,0.130364295,-0.124373914,-0.002788111,-0.042721244000000005,-0.088940987,-0.055771664000000006,0.00886472,-0.0006845730000000001,0.042265182000000005,-0.06377632700000001,0.033462795,0.044384585,0.02772103,-0.09602402199999999,0.028168202000000003,-0.045274572,-0.039321476,-0.026817757,0.146386134,0.034243041,-0.00064792,-0.07881654,0.083694059,-0.05899167599999999,0.032269871
90,Development of multisample detection system using a tag insertion primer and an electrochemical DNA chip,"Abstract We have developed a novel multisample detection system by employing a technology combining a tag insertion primer and an electrochemical DNA chip. In the first application, Helicobacter species-infected mouse samples were detected. The primers that insert a different tag sequence in each sample were prepared, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction was carried out. Then amplification products in which a part of the sequence was different in each sample could be obtained. The target sample in which these amplification products were mixed was injected into a cassette that included the DNA chip with immobilized probes. After the cassette was set in the DNA detection system, Genelyzer, the processes of hybridization, washing, and detection were performed by the system automatically. The positive and negative concordance rates of the existing nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and this method were 100% (40/40 samples) and 97.3% (117/120 samples), respectively. This is a simple high-throughput method. Moreover, the cost per sample can be drastically lowered.

138,Health service impact of testing for respiratory pathogens using cartridge-based multiplex array versus molecular batch testing,"Summary There is increasing demand for access to rapid microbiological testing, with a view to improving clinical outcomes. The possibility of rapid testing has been facilitated by development of cartridge-based random access molecular technologies that are now widely available. Whether the expense of cartridge-based assays is justified in terms of clinical or laboratory cost savings is controversial. This prospective study evaluated the impact of the Biofire FilmArray Respiratory Panel (‘FilmArray’), a cartridge-based random access molecular test, compared with standard batched molecular testing using an ‘in-house’ respiratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on laboratory and health service outcomes for adult patients at a tertiary-level adult hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Laboratory result turnaround time was significantly reduced with the FilmArray (median 4.4 h) compared to a standard validated in-house respiratory PCR assay (median 21.6 h, p < 0.0001) and there was a significant increase in diagnostic yield with the Filmarray (71/124, 57.3%) compared to in-house PCR (79/200; 39.5%; p = 0.002). Despite improved result turnaround time and increased diagnostic yield from testing, there was no corresponding reduction in hospital length of stay or use of isolation beds. Although cartridge-based molecular testing reduced turnaround time to result for respiratory pathogen testing, it did not impact on health service outcomes such as hospital length of stay. Further work is warranted to determine whether cartridge-based tests at the point of care can improve clinical and health service impacts.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.106740425,0.027859122000000004,0.069696439,-0.010555952,-0.07471019,-0.013384287,0.005484369,0.061982370999999994,-0.022813077999999997,0.049150242000000004,-0.034576859,0.004986841,0.051306617,-0.061461942,-0.0019013110000000001,0.001612989,-0.010063077,0.015854373999999997,-0.015923841,-0.075940832,0.038452784,-0.081237028,0.028720434,-0.12549031300000002,-0.016193454,-0.020902517,0.000674774,-0.071760268,0.004381665999999999,0.002278594
140,Simultaneous and visual detection of infectious bronchitis virus and Newcastle disease virus by multiple LAMP and lateral flow dipstick,"ABSTRACT Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are both important viruses seriously affecting poultry industry worldwide. In this study, reverse-transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) was combined with lateral flow dipstick (LFD) forming a novel detection tool which could simultaneously detect IBV and NDV visually. Primers targeted the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of IBV genome and the conserved region of NDV large polymerase gene (LP). The specificity and sensitivity of this multiple reverse transcription-LAMP-LFD (mRT-LAMP-LFD) assay were compared with those of conventional RT-PCR, nested RT-PCR (nRT-PCR), quantification RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and RT-LAMP monitored by electrophoresis. No non-specific amplifications were observed when the assays were tested with unrelated viruses. According to the sensitivity study, when detecting IBV or NDV alone, the lowest detection limits of mRT-LAMP-LFD were 100.8 IBV RNA copies/reaction and 100.7 NDV RNA copies/reaction. Furthermore, when detecting IBV and NDV simultaneously, the lowest detection limit was the same as that of the single detection assays. In the clinical sample study, mRT-LAMP-LFD performed the best among these assays. When tested with IBV or NDV single infected samples, the mean detection rates were 98.65% and 97.25%, respectively. In the IBV and NDV co-infected sample study, the mean detection rates of IBV and NDV were both 95%. This study showed that mRT-LAMP-LFD was a promising qualitative detection tool suitable for field single or multiple IBV and NDV detection.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.000459512,0.060030777,0.278703492,0.039498038,0.078653923,-0.026247998999999998,-0.11424600800000001,-0.068603062,0.059348603,0.187944005,0.035609205,0.027404241,-0.097728358,0.08848967699999999,-0.16973594600000003,0.153561583,0.05546792,0.017007623,-0.032036858,0.036765351,-0.11924814,-0.034066757,-0.049686015,0.099342259,0.071882095,0.039857887,-0.053785343,0.052518683,0.020319147,-0.047967653
143,"Development of an optimized protocol for the detection of classical swine fever virus in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues by seminested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and comparison with in situ hybridization","Abstract An optimized protocol was developed for the detection of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues obtained from experimentally and naturally infected pigs by seminested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results for seminested RT-PCR were compared with those determined by in situ hybridization. The results obtained show that the use of deparaffinization with xylene, digestion with proteinase K, extraction with Trizol LS, followed by seminested RT-PCR is a reliable detection method. An increase in sensitivity was observed as amplicon size decreased. The highest sensitivity for RT-PCR on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues RNA was obtained with amplicon sizes less than approximately 200 base pairs. An hybridization signal for CSFV was detected in lymph nodes from 12 experimentally and 12 naturally infected pigs. The sensitivity of seminested RT-PCR compared with in situ hybridization was 100% for CSFV.

198,Detection and monitoring of virus infections by real-time PCR,"Abstract The employment of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques for virus detection and quantification offers the advantages of high sensitivity and reproducibility, combined with an extremely broad dynamic range. A number of qualitative and quantitative PCR virus assays have been described, but commercial PCR kits are available for quantitative analysis of a limited number of clinically important viruses only. In addition to permitting the assessment of viral load at a given time point, quantitative PCR tests offer the possibility of determining the dynamics of virus proliferation, monitoring of the response to treatment and, in viruses displaying persistence in defined cell types, distinction between latent and active infection. Moreover, from a technical point of view, the employment of sequential quantitative PCR assays in virus monitoring helps identifying false positive results caused by inadvertent contamination of samples with traces of viral nucleic acids or PCR products.

219,LAMP-on-a-chip: Revising microfluidic platforms for loop-mediated DNA amplification,"Abstract Nucleic acid amplification for the detection of infectious diseases, food pathogens, or assessment of genetic disorders require a laboratory setting with specialized equipment and technical expertise. Isothermal deoxyribonucleic acid amplification methods, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), exhibit characteristics ideal for point-of-care (POC) applications, since their instrumentation is simpler in comparison with the standard method of polymerase chain reaction. Other key advantages of LAMP are robustness and the production of pyrophosphate in the presence of the target gene, enabling to detect the reaction products using the naked eye.

221,A rapid RT-PCR method to differentiate six established genotypes of rabies and rabies-related viruses using TaqMan™ technology,"Abstract A rapid and sensitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay incorporating TaqMan™ probes has been developed that can distinguish among the six established rabies and rabies-related virus genotypes. TaqMan™ probes were designed and validated against 106 rabies and rabies-related virus isolates, one isolate of the Australian bat Lyssaviruses (genotype 7), and 18 other non-rabies viruses important in the veterinary field. The N gene was used as the target for the probes as it is well conserved and has been intensively used to genotype rabies isolates. Additionally, it was found to contain regions specific to each genotype conducive to probe design. The RT-PCR assay described amplifies a portion of the nucleoprotein gene of all 107 rabies and rabies-related viruses, but none of the other viruses tested. Inclusion of TaqMan™-genotype-specific probes in the RT-PCR assay permits rapid identification of the virus present. By combining RT-PCR with TaqMan™ genotyping probes suspect rabies virus isolates can be identified in a single closed tube system that prevents potential PCR-product carry over contamination.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.008676286,0.046065050999999996,0.155073823,0.012908291,0.046576902,0.014350266,0.006303865,-0.01815052,-0.005934399999999999,-0.010044311,-0.018749465,0.014107628,-0.012009791,0.037711457999999996,-0.001451055,-0.011604133,0.031857513999999997,0.017721932,-0.022954581,-0.058127106,0.028441782000000002,0.025760149,0.026155122000000003,0.043347465,-0.02560926,0.011107755,0.050625124,-0.039234859,0.019038618,0.010583688999999999
222,Evaluation of the NucliSens® Basic Kit assay for detection of Norwalk virus RNA in stool specimens,"Abstract Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) are a genetically diverse group of human caliciviruses that are the most common cause of epidemic gastroenteritis and are detected typically in stool by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR or electron microscopy (EM). The application of a rapid nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) assay for the detection of NLV RNA in stool is described using the NucliSens® Basic Kit. Primers and probes for the NLV Basic Kit assay were based on the RNA polymerase region of the prototype NLV, Norwalk virus (NV) genome and could consistently detect 104 RT-PCR detectable units of NV RNA in a stool filtrate. When compared directly with RT-PCR on a dilution series of NV stool filtrate, the NucliSens® Basic Kit assay was equally sensitive. Cross-reactivity studies with a representative panel of other enteric pathogens were negative. When applied to 15 stool specimens from NV-challenged volunteers, the NASBA Basic Kit application for NV detection yielded 100% sensitivity, 50% specificity, and 67% concordance, using RT-PCR as the ‘gold standard’. Despite the specificity of the NASBA primer/probe sequences for NV, other representatives from both NLV genogroups I and II could be detected by the Basic Kit assay in outbreak stool specimens, although the results were inconsistent. Our results suggest that the NucliSens® Basic Kit assay provides a rapid and sensitive alternative to RT-PCR for detecting NV RNA in stool specimens. However, improvements in test specificity and primer design will be needed before the assay can be used routinely in the clinical setting.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.0026813270000000003,0.06958998799999999,0.185494192,0.072629797,0.0051561870000000004,-0.07193806,-0.010450094,0.008109228000000001,-0.04106622,-0.03220962,0.006977879,0.022637464,-0.02015462,0.028147332,0.006729886,-0.02243783,0.036575957,0.013818835,0.001435334,-0.059011825999999996,0.008755091,0.010381617,-0.004865657,0.004128469,0.0027297709999999998,-0.009967331999999999,0.016900084,-0.01147567,-0.004839921,-0.013749935
225,Quantitation of canine coronavirus RNA in the faeces of dogs by TaqMan RT-PCR,"Abstract A TaqMan® fluorogenic reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed for the detection and quantitation of canine coronavirus (CCoV) RNA in the faeces of naturally or experimentally infected dogs. The CCoV fluorogenic RT-PCR assay, which targeted the ORF5 (M gene), was more sensitive than a conventional RT-PCR assay targeting the same gene, showing a detection limit of 10 copies of CCoV standard RNA, and was linear from 10 to 108 copies, allowing quantitation of samples with a wide range of CCoV RNA loads. A total of 78 faecal samples of diarrhoeic dogs were tested simultaneously by conventional and fluorogenic RT-PCR: 29 were negative by both techniques, whereas 27 tested positive by conventional RT-PCR and 48 by the established CCoV fluorogenic assay. One sample, which was positive by conventional RT-PCR, gave no signal in the fluorogenic assay. In addition, by the fluorogenic assay CCoV shedding in the faecal samples of an experimentally infected dog was monitored for 28 days. The high sensitivity, simplicity and reproducibility of the CCoV fluorogenic RT-PCR assay, combined with its wide dynamic range and high throughput, make this method especially suitable for efficacy trials on CCoV vaccines.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.009865484,0.090527414,0.23469049600000003,0.039643776,0.006257148000000001,-0.057871452000000004,-0.014182436000000001,-0.003373514,-0.027077643999999998,-0.071082548,0.058819292,0.019552937,-0.059143919,0.093588725,0.012950458,-0.014616364,0.047718038,-0.000464461,0.030724972000000003,-0.05673624099999999,0.065455351,0.081189859,-0.027654617000000003,0.015464753000000001,0.047525322,-0.025922035,0.021342226000000002,-0.037284335,0.022546929,0.034860401
226,Detection of economically important viruses in boar semen by quantitative RealTime PCR™ technology,"Abstract The objective of this study was to develop quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (ReTi-PCR) tests for the detection of five economically important viruses in swine semen namely, pseudorabies virus (PRV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Each ReTi-PCR test was validated for specificity, analytical sensitivity (detection limits), and experimental infection studies were performed to compare the conventional virus isolation methods with the newly developed ReTi-PCR tests. All five developed ReTi-PCR tests are very rapid compared to virus isolation, highly specific, and even more sensitive (lower detection limits) than conventional virus isolation methods for the detection of mentioned viruses in semen. In semen of experimentally infected boars, viruses were detected much earlier after infection and more frequently by ReTi-PCR tests than by virus isolations. The high throughput of these rapid ReTi-PCR tests makes it possible to screen large number of semen samples for the presence of viruses prior to insemination. This is a substantial advantage, in particular for boar semen the quality of which deteriorates quickly after storage. In general, the newly developed ReTi-PCR tests are valuable tools for the early, reliable and rapid detection of five economically important viruses, namely PRV, CSFV, FMDV, SVDV, and PRRSV in boar semen. These ReTi-PCR tests will improve the control of viral diseases transmitted via semen.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.059321737,0.031233979,0.161796689,0.065132587,-0.024918231000000002,0.004180304,0.0163815,-0.004823659,0.001611971,0.067674088,0.001460502,-0.046432290999999994,0.037976952,0.017923668,0.093367354,-0.051780846,0.027276776000000003,-0.029058308999999997,-0.02262766,-0.032208514,-0.0076638240000000005,-0.015072861000000002,0.049717597999999995,-0.047774391,-0.01042828,0.033711358,0.026956061,-0.068346991,-0.064070956,0.002523028
229,Two RT-PCR based assays to detect human metapneumovirus in nasopharyngeal aspirates,"Abstract Two sensitive and specific RT-PCR assays were standardised for testing the presence of human metapneumovirus. A total of 300 nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from infants suffering from bronchiolitis since October 2000 to June 2003 and shown previously as negative to common respiratory viruses were examined. Matrix and polymerase viral genes, which show a low rate of variation, were chosen to design amplification assays to ensure that any genotype of the human metapneumovirus could be detected. A RT-PCR followed by a reverse line blotting hybridisation was developed for viral polymerase gene. For the matrix gene, after the RT-PCR assay, a subsequent nested PCR was carried out. Both assays had similar sensitivity, equivalent to 0.1 TCID50 of human metapneumovirus strain NL/1/99 which was used as the positive control. The human metapneumovirus was present in 16.6% of the specimens studied. The approaches described below are not only a robust method for rapid diagnosis of the human metapneumovirus, but also to establish an etiological surveillance tool for epidemiological studies. Based on the results obtained, human metapneumovirus infections in Madrid followed a seasonal pattern, with most of the infections occurring between February and April.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.108254715,0.035786594,0.151927074,0.10213542699999999,0.045553965999999994,-0.054637564000000007,0.02285664,-0.047862166,0.067387316,-0.0051279690000000005,-0.017258037,-0.00722024,0.03994515,0.061373948,0.008894038,-0.047280794,0.051416197999999996,0.033314057,-0.040161372,-0.048181126,0.060277557999999995,0.028221738,-0.003904784,0.056211562,-0.014486322,0.0077693580000000005,0.017780912,-0.021760464,0.027014235,-0.048864832000000004
230,"Differential detection of turkey coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus, and bovine coronavirus by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction","Abstract The objective of the present study was to develop a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for differential detection of turkey coronavirus (TCoV), infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV), and bovine coronavirus (BCoV). Primers were designed from conserved or variable regions of nucleocapsid (N) or spike (S) protein gene among TCoV, IBV, and BCoV and used in the same PCR reaction. Reverse transcription followed by the PCR reaction was used to amplify a portion of N or S gene of the corresponding coronaviruses. The PCR products were detected on agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Two PCR products, a 356-bp band corresponding to N gene and a 727-bp band corresponding to S gene, were obtained for TCoV isolates. In contrast, one PCR product of 356bp corresponding to a fragment of N gene was obtained for IBV strains and one PCR product of 568bp corresponding to a fragment of S gene was obtained for BCoV. There were no PCR products with the same primers for Newcastle disease virus, Marek's disease virus, turkey pox virus, pigeon pox virus, fowl pox virus, reovirus, infectious bursal disease virus, enterovirus, astrovirus, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Mycoplasma gallisepticum. Performance of the assay with serially diluted RNA demonstrated that the multiplex PCR could detect 4.8×10−3 μg of TCoV RNA, 4.6×10−4 μg of IBV RNA, and 8.0×10−2 μg of BCoV RNA. These results indicated that the multiplex PCR as established in the present study is a rapid, sensitive, and specific method for differential detection of TCoV, IBV, and BCoV in a single PCR reaction.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.044788904000000004,0.040545,0.197395492,-4.5600000000000004e-05,0.147393939,-0.025503772999999997,-0.168580299,-0.069257025,0.058183362,0.19805043,0.041310779,-0.047286147,-0.0024707460000000002,0.060830582,-0.06764845,0.035613671,0.069517131,0.0019469189999999999,0.044762105,-0.076503737,-0.016762519,0.029339032,0.060899790999999995,-0.05546844,0.0015999060000000001,0.018380686,0.034199978,-0.06702387,0.041420764,0.043104477999999995
231,A long distance RT-PCR able to amplify the Pestivirus genome,"Abstract A method to amplify long genomic regions (up to ∼12.3kb) from pestiviruses in one RT-PCR is described. The difficulty in designing conserved Pestivirus primers for the amplification of genomes from highly divergent isolates simply by means of overlapping segments is demonstrated using new bioinformatic tools. An alternative procedure consisting of optimizing the length of the genomic cDNA fragments and their subsequent amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a limited set of specific primers is described. The amplification of long DNA fragments from a variety of sources, including genomic, mitochondrial, and viral DNAs as well as cDNA produced by reverse transcription (RT) has been achieved using this methodology, known as long distance PCR. In the case of viruses, it is necessary to obtain viral particles from infected cells prior to RT procedures. This work provides improvements in four steps of long distance RT-PCR (L-RT-PCR): (i) preparation of a viral stock, (ii) preparation of template RNA, (iii) reverse transcription and (iv) amplification of the cDNA by LD-PCR. The usefulness of L-RT-PCR is discussed in the light of current knowledge on pestivirus diversity.

236,Detection of bovine coronavirus using a TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR assay,"Abstract A real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) RNA in clinical samples is described. The assay is based on TaqMan technology, consisting of two primers and one probe labeled with the reporter dye 6-carboxyfluorescein that binds selectively to the transmembrane-protein gene of BCoV. The BCoV real-time RT-PCR assay was able to detect the tested BCoV and BCoV-like viruses (canine respiratory coronavirus and bubaline coronavirus), whereas other common viral pathogens of cattle were not recognised by the established oligonucleotide set, thus showing that the test was specific for bovine-like CoVs. The detection limit of the assay was 20 BCoV RNA copies (1-log higher with respect to traditional gel-based RT-PCR) and the reproducibility was satisfactory, thus allowing for a sensitive and accurate measurement of the viral RNA load in clinical samples. Two hundred and twenty clinical specimens (92 rectal, 82 nasal and 46 ocular swabs) were subjected to gel-based and real-time RT-PCR. By conventional amplification, 43 rectal, 54 nasal and 34 ocular samples tested positive, whereas the TaqMan assay was able to detect the BCoV nucleic acid in 49 rectal, 60 nasal and 37 ocular swabs.

240,Absolute quantitation of infectious salmon anaemia virus using different real-time reverse transcription PCR chemistries,"Abstract Routine laboratory diagnosis of infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) infection is primarily by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) because of the high sensitivity and rapid turnaround time of the test. This paper describes methods for highly reproducible absolute viral load measurements using external standard curves generated with either ISAV recombinant plasmid DNA (pDNA) standards or transcribed RNA standards prepared by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase, and using a two tube real-time or quantitative (q)RT-PCR with SYBR® Green I chemistry and a single tube qRT-PCR with TaqMan® probe chemistry. When applied to virus samples of known virus titer for the highly pathogenic ISAV strain NBISA01 and the low pathogenic ISAV strain RPC/NB-04-085-1, both methods showed a 100-fold lower detectable titer for RPC/NB-04-085-1 but with a higher number of viral RNA molecules compared to NBISA01. Overall, the SYBR® Green I method overestimated copy numbers in samples having equivalent Ct values with the TaqMan® probe method. Taken together, the findings suggest that the TaqMan® probe method with the in vitro transcribed RNA standard curve is the preferred method for reliable and rapid quantitation of ISAV in samples.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.025049303999999998,0.062094625,0.180406651,0.084100842,-0.021134547000000004,-0.068435488,-0.024614264,-0.001342633,-0.021576454,0.016964913,0.040452852000000004,-0.027398937,0.0029471840000000003,0.06881499099999999,0.018275647,0.004745135,0.006916809,-0.014901983999999998,-0.005406168,-0.075770879,-0.021448487000000002,0.035566526,0.007039758,-0.012374488000000001,-0.027683535,-0.025022673999999998,0.029565959,-0.0332184,-0.032903113,0.068158705

Fifteen air samples were collected with All Glass Impinger-30 (AGI-30) air samplers in each house. Airborne ND viruses were also isolated and virulence identified by in vivo tests. Avirulent viruses were detected both in air samples and swab samples in four houses by degenerate primers based RT-PCR. Virulent viruses were detected only in the air samples by degenerate primers based RT-PCR in two houses. Seven strains viruses were isolated from the RT-PCR positive air samples. Of the seven strains, three strains were virulent viruses and four strains were avirulent viruses identified by in vivo tests. The results showed that it was feasible to detect and differentiate NDV in the air samples using degenerate primers based RT-PCR. This technique could decrease the time it required identify NDV infected flocks while distinguishing between virulent and avirulent viruses.

244,"Development of SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR for rapid detection, quantitation and diagnosis of unclassified bovine enteric calicivirus","Abstract Unclassified bovine enteric calicivirus (BECV) is a newly recognized bovine enteric calicivirus that differs from bovine norovirus, and which causes diarrhea in the small intestines of calves. To date, methods such as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have not been developed for the rapid detection, quantitation and diagnosis of BECV. Presently, a BECV-specific SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR assay was evaluated and optimized. Diarrheic specimens (n =118) collected from 2004 to 2005 were subjected to RT-PCR, nested PCR and SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR. By conventional RT-PCR and nested PCR, 9 (7.6%) and 59 (50%) samples tested positive, respectively, whereas the SYBR Green assay detected BECV in 91 (77.1%) samples. Using BECV RNA standards generated by in vitro transcription, the SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR assay sensitively detected BECV RNA to 1.1×100 copies/μl (correlation coefficiency=0.98). The detection limits of the RT-PCR and nested PCR were 1.1×105 and 1.1×102 copies/μl, respectively.

246,A low density oligonucleotide microarray for the detection of viral and atypical bacterial respiratory pathogens,"Abstract Acute respiratory tract infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and exert a considerable economic burden on healthcare systems. Acute respiratory tract infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract are caused by a wide variety of viral and bacterial pathogens, which require comprehensive laboratory investigations. Conventional serological and immunofluorescence-based diagnostic methods for acute respiratory tract infections lack sensitivity when compared to polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approaches and the development of new diagnostic methodologies is required, to provide accurate, sensitive and rapid diagnoses. In the present study, a PCR-based low density oligonucleotide microarray was developed for the detection of 16 viral and two atypical bacterial pathogens. The performance of this DNA microarray-based analysis exhibited comparable sensitivities and specificities to multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (rtPCRs) confirming the potential diagnostic utility of the method. In contrast to routine multiplex PCR, the microarray incorporates an intrinsic redundancy as multiple and non-identical probes per target on the array allow direct intra-assay confirmation of positives. This study demonstrates that microarray technology provides a viable alternative to conventional serological-based approaches and multiplex PCR for pathogen identification in acute respiratory tract infections.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.150803398,0.023769797000000002,0.114940523,0.079860419,-0.0472608,-0.066703336,0.07121923599999999,-0.028936681000000002,0.032017821,0.132289964,-0.04878392,-0.044177309000000005,0.12959297,-0.046551407999999996,0.058901629000000004,-0.054954521,0.005689448000000001,-0.034300897000000004,-0.01092718,-0.068085961,0.01516129,-0.06910558,0.049092343,-0.062815252,0.026826696,-0.034540157,-0.050738337,-0.04997375,0.078219679,-0.030868396
247,Specific real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for detection and quantitation of turkey coronavirus RNA in tissues and feces from turkeys infected with turkey coronavirus,"Abstract Turkey coronavirus (TCoV) infection causes acute atrophic enteritis in the turkey poults, leading to significant economic loss in the U.S. turkey industry. Rapid detection, differentiation, and quantitation of TCoV are critical to the diagnosis and control of the disease. A specific one-step real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) assay for detection and quantitation of TCoV in the turkey tissues was developed using a dual-labeled fluorescent probe. The fluorogenic probe labeled with a reporter dye (FAM, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamin) and a quencher dye (AbsoluteQuencher™) was designed to bind to a 186 base-pair fragment flanked by the two PCR primers targeting the 3′ end of spike gene of TCoV. The assay was performed on different avian viruses and bacteria to determine the specificity as well as serial dilutions of TCoV for the sensitivity. Three animal trials were conducted to further validate the assay. Ten-day-old turkey poults were inoculated orally with 100 EID50 of TCoV. Intestinal tissues (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum), feces from the cloacal swabs, or feces from the floor were collected at 12h, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and/or 14 days post-inoculation (DPI). RNA was extracted from each sample and subjected to the RRT-PCR. The designed primers and probe were specific for TCoV. Other non-TCoV avian viruses and bacteria were not amplified by RRT-PCR. The assay was highly sensitive and could quantitate between 102 and 1010 copies/μl of viral genome. The viral RNA in the intestine segments reached the highest level, 6×1015 copies/μl, in the jejunum at 5 DPI. Eighty-four intestine segments assayed by the developed RRT-PCR and immunofluorescence antibody assay (IFA) revealed that there were 6 segments negative for TCoV by both assays, 45 positive for TCoV by IFA, and 77 positive for TCoV by RRT-PCR. Turkey coronavirus was detected in the feces from the cloacal swabs or floor 1–14 DPI; however, the viral RNA load varied among different turkey poults at different intervals from different trials. The highest amount of viral RNA, 2.8×1010 copies/μl, in the feces was the one from the cloacal swab collected at 1 DPI. The average amount of TCoV RNA in the cloacal fecal samples was 10 times higher than that in the fecal droppings on the floor. Taken together, the results indicated that the developed RRT-PCR assay is rapid, sensitive, and specific for detection, differentiation, and quantitation of TCoV in the turkey tissues and should be helpful in monitoring the progression of TCoV induced acute enteritis in the turkey flocks.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.015095708999999999,0.040249625,0.12461598199999999,0.000902415,0.022341713,-0.023741052999999998,-0.025186182,0.00021448299999999999,-0.000652661,0.010743309,0.02959403,-0.014893827,-0.033028579,0.041749058,0.022846579,-0.015881816,0.016763545,-0.030794535,0.019204572,-0.050373778,-0.017297912,0.027051462000000002,0.013358588999999999,-0.021344613,-0.017927753,-0.00494084,0.006346626,-0.03821193,0.00374576,0.035447057000000004
248,One-step real-time RT-PCR for pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1) 2009 matrix gene detection in swine samples,"Abstract In the spring of 2009, a novel (H1N1) influenza A virus began to spread among humans worldwide. Although the 2009 H1N1 is related genetically to swine influenza viruses, human infection has not been connected to pig exposure. Because the virus is now circulating widely in the human population, swine herds are at increased risk of becoming infected. In order to investigate potential outbreaks of the 2009 pandemic virus in pigs, a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for the detection of the (H1N1) 2009 RNA in clinical specimens was developed. To evaluate the applicability of the test as a diagnostic tool in the screening of field specimens from swine, 64 field isolates of North American swine, 5 equine and 48 avian influenza viruses collected during diagnostic investigations were analyzed retrospectively as well as samples collected during an experimental in vivo infection with two novel H1N1 isolates, A/California/04/2009 (H1N1)v virus and A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1)v. The sensitivity of the qRT-PCR was shown to be higher with respect to standard techniques such as virus isolation and the reproducibility was satisfactory. The present unique and highly sensitive assay is able to detect as little as 1×101 copies of RNA per μl of template and it represents a rapid and useful approach for the screening and quantitation of (H1N1) 2009 RNA in porcine specimens.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.057364038,-0.010833825,0.106851745,0.15315062699999998,0.007779081,0.19303559399999998,-0.092740476,0.021134561,-0.04737341,-0.042752077,0.037978261,0.043717680999999994,0.0024818320000000002,0.02308186,0.091018739,-0.021473227,-0.014056531,0.008659267,-0.051012031,-0.055216241,-0.000766675,0.0010656069999999999,-0.016478148999999997,-0.071657713,-0.113107498,0.047422127,-0.036102233,0.02231564,-0.007860865,0.068830162
249,Multiplex nested RT-PCR for the detection of porcine enteric viruses,"Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine group A rotavirus (PRV-A) are major viruses causing enteric diseases of piglets. A multiplex nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (multiplex nested RT-PCR) was developed for the detection of these viruses in field samples from piglets with diarrhea. A mixture of (1) three external pairs of primers, yielding in the amplification step two different amplicons with sizes of 950bp and 317bp and (2) three pairs of internal primers in a second round of PCR (nested PCR), yielding two different amplicons with sizes of 792bp and 208bp for TGEV and porcine PRV-A, respectively. The genome of PEDV was not detected after the amplification step but it was detected in the second round of PCR, yielding amplicon with size of 291bp. Multiplex nested RT-PCR can detect TGEV, PRV-A, and PEDV up to concentration 102 TCID50/mL, 101 TCID50/mL, and 27.2μg/μl of RNA, respectively. A total of 175 field samples were collected from swine with diarrhea from January 2005 until July 2007. The samples were tested for the presence of three viruses by a multiplex nested RT-PCR. Dual infections with PEDV and PRV-A were identified in seven specimens (4%) (n =6). Twenty-one (25%) infections were caused by PEDV and thirty-four infections (41%) were caused by PRV-A. The genome of TGEV was not detected in any of these field samples, however TGEV was detected in piglets infected experimentally.

Time, temperature and quantity of each reagent were optimised for the detection of the two viruses. This method was more sensitive than the conventional reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detecting the two viruses. The RT-LAMP reaction is highly suited for disease diagnosis in developing countries.

Currently, methods such as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) have not yet been developed for the rapid detection and quantitation of bovine (BToV) and porcine (PToV) toroviruses. Using BToV and PToV RNA standards generated by in vitro transcription, the detection limit of the SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR assay was 2.54×102 BToV and 2.17×103 PToV copies/reaction (correlation coefficiency=0.99 and 0.97, respectively), whereas those of RT-PCR and nested PCR were 2.54×105 and 2.54×104 (BToV) and 2.17×107 and 2.17×105 (PToV) cRNA viral copies/reaction, respectively. Archived diarrhea specimens of calves (n =121) and piglets (n =86) were subjected to RT-PCR, nested PCR and SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR. By conventional RT-PCR, 1 (0.8%) bovine and 7 (8.1%) porcine samples tested positive to BToV and PToV, respectively. With nested PCR, 13 (10.7%) bovine and 17 (19.8%) porcine samples tested positive. SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR assay detected BToV and PToV in 22 of 121 (18.2%) bovine and 31 of 86 (36.0%) porcine samples. These results indicate that SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR (P <0.05) is a more sensitive assay, which can be reproduced as a reliable, sensitive, and rapid tool for the detection and quantitation of toroviruses.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.08952190300000001,0.138456372,0.331959919,0.083902231,0.035781461,-0.09628769400000001,-0.039747282,-0.006338049,-0.040715911,-0.061834535,0.040080212999999996,0.016845861,-0.07914874200000001,0.159200739,0.053858324000000006,-0.07972326,0.10182570099999999,-0.007387409,0.032708585,-0.094278725,0.012922933999999999,0.091031637,-0.011559200000000002,-0.004659007,-0.004402172,0.020645981,0.095100625,-0.105307565,0.097720612,-0.028848149
253,Development of a SYBR Green based real-time PCR assay for detection and quantitation of canine parvovirus in faecal samples,"Abstract The present study describes the development of SYBR Green based real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) for detection and quantitation of canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV 2) in faecal samples of dogs. In this assay, the primers were designed and custom-synthesized based on nucleotide sequence of VP2 gene of CPV 2. A standard curve was plotted using 10-fold serial dilution of standard plasmid DNA and Ct value. The standard curve was found to be linear over a 10−7 dilution. The real-time PCR results were expressed as the number of DNA copies of CPV 2 per mg of faecal samples and showed range of 1.0×103 to 7.0×109 copies of viral DNA per mg of stool samples. The analytical sensitivity of the SYBR Green based real-time PCR was shown to be equivalent to 10 copies. Faecal samples (47) from dogs suspected of CPV 2 infection were analyzed by real-time PCR, haemagglutination (HA) assay and by a conventional PCR and 24, 20 and 22 samples were found positive for CPV 2, respectively. Comparison between the results of three different assays revealed that real-time PCR is more sensitive than HA and conventional PCR and allow the detection of low titers of CPV 2 in infected dogs.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.041680167000000004,0.08883531800000001,0.267772228,-0.000240316,0.000585219,-0.048288449000000004,0.004068097,-0.004064509,-0.02906053,-0.042313461,0.036355797999999995,-0.004062055,-0.028361387000000002,0.021820276,0.030693879,-0.035732698,-0.003472264,-0.092055854,0.146291015,-0.09412697,0.168400656,0.141254102,-0.015876282,-0.088201525,0.021673456,-0.10459498099999999,-0.034124603999999996,-0.033561644,-0.031017097,0.111515953
255,Design and validation of consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primers for broad and sensitive detection of corona- and toroviruses,"Abstract The ssRNA+ family Coronaviridae includes two subfamilies prototyped by coronaviruses and toroviruses that cause respiratory and enteric infections. To facilitate the identification of new distantly related members of the family Coronaviridae, we have developed a molecular assay with broad specificity. The consensus-degenerated hybrid oligonucleotide primer (CODEHOP) strategy was modified to design primers targeting the most conserved motifs in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase locus. They were evaluated initially on RNA templates from virus-infected cells using a two-step RT-PCR protocol that was further advanced to a one-step assay. The sensitivity of the assay ranged from 102 to 106 and from 105 to 109 RNA copy numbers for individual corona-/torovirus templates when tested, respectively, with and without an excess of RNA from human cells. This primer set compared to that designed according to the original CODEHOP rules showed 10–103 folds greater sensitivity for 5 of the 6 evaluated corona-/torovirus templates. It detected 57% (32 of 56) of the respiratory specimens positive for 4 human coronaviruses, as well as stool specimens positive for a bovine torovirus. The high sensitivity and broad virus range of this assay makes it suitable for screening biological specimens in search for new viruses of the family Coronaviridae.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.04719156099999999,0.033424134,0.0915525,0.13260830199999998,0.039467523,-0.08153313200000001,0.024595352999999997,0.008023848,-0.025021428,-0.02038081,0.024805027,0.017076542,-0.007244185,0.063194703,0.014581407,-0.032782942999999995,0.041162647999999996,0.005795992,0.055295120999999996,-0.019303911,0.018027727,0.003060191,-0.008830319,0.01397562,-0.026244239,-0.010754565,0.00048262800000000003,0.010620053999999999,0.000601449,-0.04707489
258,Reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification for the detection of rodent coronaviruses,"Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is one of the most prevalent viruses detected in laboratory mouse colonies. Enterotropic strains predominate in natural infections, and molecular techniques for the detection of MHV shedding in feces are powerful enough to diagnose active infections. A reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) technique was developed for the detection of rodent coronaviruses within 90min. The specificity of this technique was confirmed by its ability to detect all 17 different strains of MHV and 6 strains of rat coronaviruses as well as its failure to detect human, bovine, and porcine coronaviruses nonspecifically. The sensitivity of RT-LAMP was 3.2-fold higher than that of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 31.6-fold lower than that of nested RT-PCR. An evaluation of the diagnostic performance of RT-LAMP performed in duplicate using mouse fecal specimens showed that the sensitivity and specificity with respect to nested RT-PCR were 85.7% and 100%, respectively.

The detection of PoRV-LPMV, represents a diagnostic challenge due to the viral RNA being present in very small amounts in tissue samples. In this study, a TaqMan® real-time PCR assay was designed based on the phosphoprotein gene of PoRV-LPMV, to allow specific amplification and detection of viral RNA in clinical samples. Assay conditions for the primers and probe were optimized using infected PK15 cells and ten-fold serial dilutions of a plasmid containing the whole P-gene. The sensitivity of the developed TaqMan® assay was approximately 10 plasmid copies per reaction, and was shown to be 1000 fold better than a conventional nested RT-PCR.

260,Development of a multiplex one step RT-PCR that detects eighteen respiratory viruses in clinical specimens and comparison with real time RT-PCR,"Abstract Rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral respiratory infections is crucial for patient management. Multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) is used increasingly to diagnose respiratory infections and has shown to be more sensitive than viral culture and antigen detection. Objective of the present study was to develop a one-step mRT-PCR that could detect 18 respiratory viruses in three sets. The method was compared with real time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) for its sensitivity and specificity. Clinical specimens from 843 pediatric patients with respiratory symptoms were used in the study. 503 (59.7%) samples were detected positive by mRT-PCR. Of these 462 (54.8%) exhibited presence of a single pathogen and 41 (4.9%) had multiple pathogens. rRT-PCR detected 439 (52.1%) positive samples, where 419 (49.7%) exhibited one virus and 20 (2.4%) showed co-infections. Concordance between mRT-PCR and rRT-PCR was 91.9% and kappa correlation 0.837. Sensitivity and specificity of mRT-PCR were 99.5% and 83.7% while that of rRT-PCR was 86.9% and 99.4% respectively. Rhinovirus (17.2%) was the most frequently detected virus followed by respiratory syncytial virus B (15.4%), H1N1pdm09 (8.54%), parainfluenza virus-3 (5.8%) and metapneumovirus (5.2%).

261,A new approach for diagnosis of bovine coronavirus using a reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay,"Abstract Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is an economically significant cause of calf scours and winter dysentery of adult cattle, and may induce respiratory tract infections in cattle of all ages. Early diagnosis of BCoV helps to diminish its burden on the dairy and beef industry. Real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of BCoV has been described, but it is relatively expensive, requires well-equipped laboratories and is not suitable for on-site screening. A novel assay, using reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA), for the detection of BCoV is developed. The BCoV RT-RPA was rapid (10–20min) and has an analytical sensitivity of 19 molecules. No cross-reactivity with other viruses causing bovine gastrointestinal and/or respiratory infections was observed. The assay performance on clinical samples was validated by testing 16 fecal and 14 nasal swab specimens and compared to real-time RT-PCR. Both assays provided comparable results. The RT-RPA assay was significantly more rapid than the real-time RT-PCR assay. The BCoV RT-RPA constitutes a suitable accurate, sensitive and rapid alternative to the common measures used for BCoV diagnosis.

Studies to trace the spread of the virus and determine its host range are hampered by the absence of reliable diagnostic assays. In this study, a one-step, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed that targets a region in the FHMNV spike protein gene. The assay was optimized, and the best results were obtained at 8mM of Mg2+ with an incubation time of 40min at 63°C in the presence of calcein.

The novel assay failed to cross-react with the other pathogens tested, suggesting it is highly specific for ECoV. Using artificially synthesized ECoV RNA, the 50% detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was 101.8 copies/reaction. This is a 50-fold greater sensitivity than conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, but a 4-fold lower sensitivity than quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays. Eighty-two fecal samples collected during ECoV outbreaks were analyzed. ECoV was detected in 59 samples using the RT-LAMP assay, and in 30 and 65 samples using RT-PCR or qRT-PCR assays, respectively. Although the RT-LAMP assay is less sensitive than qRT-PCR techniques, it can be performed without the need for expensive equipment. Thus, the RT-LAMP assay might be suitable for large-scale surveillance and diagnosis of ECoV infection in laboratories with limited resources.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.060661597000000005,0.147940974,0.36407644899999997,0.124534185,-0.026797078,-0.102068776,-0.005206812,-0.0048792670000000005,-0.018095514,-0.10137943,-0.006425617,0.050696323,-0.08038075,0.137112992,-0.063245743,0.015793374,0.106825906,0.061757044000000004,-0.097773574,-0.029872994,-0.076829286,-0.010851319,-0.077885704,0.19017075600000002,0.12713851699999998,0.044085285,-0.02947962,0.065155251,0.006262565,-0.055102591
267,Development of a nanoparticle-assisted PCR assay for detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus,"Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an important pig pathogen that can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration, leading to serious damage to the swine industry worldwide. In this study, a nanoparticle-assisted polymerase chain reaction (nanoPCR) assay targeting the N gene of PEDV was developed and the sensitivity and specificity were investigated. Under the optimized conditions for detection of PEDV RNA, the nanoPCR assay was 100-fold more sensitive than a conventional RT-PCR assay. The lower detection limit of the nanoPCR assay was 2.7×10−6 ng/μL of PEDV RNA and no cross-reaction was observed with other viruses. This is the first report to demonstrate the application of a nanoPCR assay for the detection of PEDV. The sensitive and specific nanoPCR assay developed in this study can be applied widely in clinical diagnosis and field surveillance of PEDV-infection.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.008191725,0.08005244,0.260819803,0.019780924,0.013005316999999999,-0.023711054,-0.009188276,-0.025949481,-0.0033051659999999996,-0.055893062,0.038501169,0.10429904400000001,-0.216271408,0.08285206099999999,0.297114039,-0.24203543100000002,-0.040788853,0.05106429,-0.033324362999999996,0.248389085,-0.20806694399999998,-0.11460942199999999,0.15937399300000002,-0.038620269,-0.08281983400000001,-0.035576893,-0.0052913330000000005,0.043910705999999994,0.07484353,-0.032350572
268,Development of a duplex real-time RT-PCR for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus and rat theilovirus,"Abstract Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and rat theilovirus (RTV), the member of the genus Cardiovirus, are widespread in laboratory mice and rats, and are potential contaminants of biological materials. Cardioviruses infection may cause serious complications in biomedical research. To improve the efficiency of routine screening for Cardioviruses infection, a duplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed for simultaneous detection and differentiation of TMEV and RTV. The duplex assay was specific for reference strains of TMEV and RTV, and no cross-reaction was found with seven other rodent viruses. The limits of detection of both TMEV and RTV were 4×101 copies RNA/reaction. Reproducibility was estimated using standard dilutions, with coefficients of variation <3.1%. 439 clinical samples were evaluated by both duplex real-time RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR. For 439 clinical samples，95 samples were positive for TMEV and 72 samples were positive for RTV using duplex real-time RT-PCR approach, whereas only 77 samples were positive for TMEV and 66 samples were positive for RTV when conventional RT-PCR was applied. Mixed infections were found in 20 samples when analyzed by conventional RT-PCR whereas 30 samples were found to be mixed infection when duplex real-time RT-PCR was applied. This duplex assay provides a useful tool for routine health monitoring and screening of contaminated biological materials of these two viruses.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.09899856900000001,0.12174571699999999,0.293411366,0.089452559,0.031084308999999997,-0.063911828,-0.015885937,0.005160269,-0.033243466,-0.035887864,0.051803665,0.01777215,-0.049177095,0.138297692,0.024051588,-0.044498734000000005,0.07885532599999999,-0.010111675,0.013486491000000001,-0.103438318,0.035033509,0.09456152400000001,-0.027685777,0.017549314,-0.001378844,0.019359453999999998,0.067486258,-0.059350077,0.066146254,-0.017711658
269,Real-time isothermal detection of Abalone herpes-like virus and red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus using recombinase polymerase amplification,"Abstract Abalone herpes-like virus (AbHV) and Red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) are two serious viruses that infect animal populations in aquaculture. Both viruses cause diseases associated with high mortality rates, resulting in dramatic economic losses in the aquaculture industry. There are currently no effective treatments for either of these two viral diseases. Thus, early, rapid, and accurate diagnosis plays a fundamental role in disease prevention and control in aquaculture. Traditional methods of diagnosis, such as virus culture, enzyme-linked immunoassay, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are either time consuming or require sophisticated temperature control devices. In this study, one sets of specific primers and probes were designed for the real-time quantitative recombinase polymerase amplification (qRPA) detection of AbHV and RGNNV separately. The sensitivity and specificity of detection were evaluated by comparison with detection by conventional PCR and quantitative PCR. The optimal reaction temperature and time for virus detection is 37°C for 20min. The detection limit is 100 copies per reaction, making this approach faster and more sensitive than qPCR in this study. In a field application, the detection percentage of qRPA was higher than that of qPCR for both AbHV and NNV. Additionally, good correlation was found between qRPA and qPCR detection (R2 >0.8). The methods presented here can be used as alternatives to qPCR for quick and quantitative detection of pathogens infecting aquaculture species.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.070508743,0.059958554000000004,0.260251263,0.081238148,-0.056275695,-0.014455358,0.069638623,-0.001274773,-0.021621479,0.067068858,-0.049241898,-0.048024185,0.049514565,-0.03584964,0.028597757999999997,-0.005603472,-0.036780373,-0.054929039000000006,-0.011363893,-0.033163593,-0.024836136,-0.024335057,0.051765525,-0.011299425,-0.038492698,-0.019609144,0.011012137,-0.023812637,-0.043675905999999994,0.001301581
270,"Development of a one-step RT-PCR assay for detection of pancoronaviruses (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-coronaviruses) using newly designed degenerate primers for porcine and avian `fecal samples","Abstract Coronaviruses (CoVs) are critical human and animal pathogens because of their potential to cause severe epidemics of respiratory or enteric diseases. In pigs, the newly emerged porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) and re-emerged porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) reported in the US and Asia, as well as the discovery of novel CoVs in wild bats or birds, has necessitated development of improved detection and control measures for these CoVs. Because the previous pancoronavirus (panCoV) RT-PCR established in our laboratory in 2007–2011 did not detect deltacoronaviruses (δ-CoVs) in swine fecal and serum samples, our goal was to develop a new panCoV RT-PCR assay to detect known human and animal CoVs, including δ-CoVs. In this study, we designed a new primer set to amplify a 668 bp-region within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene that encodes the most conserved protein domain of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-CoVs. We established a one-step panCoV RT-PCR assay and standardized the assay conditions. The newly established panCoV RT-PCR assay was demonstrated to have a high sensitivity and specificity. Using a panel of 60 swine biological samples (feces, intestinal contents, and sera) characterized by PEDV, PDCoV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus-specific RT-PCR assays, we demonstrated that sensitivity and specificity of the newly established panCoV RT-PCR assay were 100%. 400 avian fecal (RNA) samples were further tested simultaneously for CoV by the new panCoV RT-PCR and a one-step RT-PCR assay with the δ-CoV nucleocapsid-specific universal primers. Four of 400 avian samples were positive for CoV, three of which were positive for δ-CoV by the conventional RT-PCR. PanCoV RT-PCR fragments for 3 of the 4 CoVs were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of one γ-CoV and two δ-CoV in the sequenced samples. The newly designed panCoV RT-PCR assay should be useful for the detection of currently known CoVs in animal biological samples.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0070286,0.29284345,0.210424975,0.137523529,0.18437088399999998,-0.003430795,0.091409615,0.036860906,-0.02557333,-0.073083961,0.022852027,-0.00232624,-0.140908673,0.160883379,0.040042935,-0.093057555,0.10212294,0.060645410999999996,-0.029625513,0.00037328,-0.053621213,0.027242222000000003,0.09086473199999999,0.038764423,0.058919955,0.049136787,0.022250331,-0.066799715,0.11953289800000001,-0.013250643000000001
271,Rapid detection of transmissible gastroenteritis virus in swine small intestine samples using real-time reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification,"Abstract A rapid and specific real-time reverse-transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay (RT-RPA) was developed to detect the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in this study. The primers and exo probe were designed to be specific for a portion of spike (S) gene conserved in TGEV, but absent in the closely related porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). The amplification was performed at 40 °C for 20 min. The assay could only detect the TGEV, and there was no cross-reaction with other pathogens tested. Using the in vitro transcribed TGEV RNA as template, the limit of detection of the developed RT-RPA was 100 copies per reaction. The assay performance was evaluated by testing 76 clinical samples by RT-RPA and a real-time RT-PCR. Fourteen samples were TGEV RNA positive in RT-RPA (18.4%, 14/76), which were also positive in the real-time RT-PCR. The diagnostic agreement between the two assays was 100% (76/76). The R2 value of RT-RPA and real-time RT-PCR was 0.959 by linear regression analysis.

272,Evaluation of an incubation instrument-free reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay for rapid and point-of-need detection of canine distemper virus,"Abstract Canine distemper, caused by Canine distemper virus (CDV), is a highly contagious and fatal systemic disease in free-living and captive carnivores worldwide. Accurate, rapid and simple detection of CDV is critical to improve disease management and prevent outbreaks. In this study, a visible and incubation instrument-free reverse-transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay combined with lateral flow strip (LFS RT-RPA) was developed to detect CDV using primers and lateral flow (LF) probe specific for the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene. The CDV LFS RT-RPA assay was performed in a closed fist using body heat for 15 min, and the products were visible to the naked eyes on the LFS within 5 min. The assay could detect CDV, and there was no cross-reaction with the other viruses tested. Using the in vitro transcribed CDV RNA as template, the analytical sensitivity was 9.4 × 101 copies per reaction, which was the same result as that of a real-time RT-PCR. The assay performance was further evaluated by testing 32 nasal/oropharyngeal swab samples, and CDV RNA positive rate was 62.0% (20/32) by LFS RT-RPA, which was the same result as that of the real-time RT-PCR assay. The performance of the LFS RT-RPA was comparable to real-time RT-PCR, while the LFS RT-RPA assay was much faster and easier to perform. The novel CDV LFS RT-RPA assay provides an attractive and promising tool for rapid and reliable detection of CDV in the underequipped laboratory and point-of-need facility, which is of great significance in CD control in low resource settings.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.01724888,0.109273824,0.306454893,0.078524792,-0.037259223,-0.070481461,0.00689641,0.023271677,-0.019905921,-0.10570156,-0.015438195,0.068646473,-0.088055177,0.013573227,-0.052743622999999996,0.058590038,-0.014804702,-0.083172146,0.17850143899999998,0.181753978,0.207593405,0.093543805,-0.081194009,-0.023372452000000002,0.058443774000000004,0.006131882,0.047325562,-0.014988376000000001,0.07085156599999999,0.00659766
273,A novel multiplex PCR-electronic microarray assay for rapid and simultaneous detection of bovine respiratory and enteric pathogens,"Abstract Respiratory and enteric diseases continue to be two major causes of economic losses to the cattle industry worldwide. Despite their multifactorial etiology, the currently available diagnostic tests for bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) and bovine enteric disease (BED) are single-pathogen-tests. DNA microarray when combined with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a powerful tool in detection and differentiation of multiple pathogens in a single sample. This study reports development and initial validation of two independent highly sensitive and specific multiplex PCR-electronic microarray assays, one for the detection and differentiation of pathogens of the BRDC and the other for detection and differentiation of pathogens of the BED. The BRDC multiplex PCR-microarray assay was able to detect and differentiate four bacteria (Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Pasteurella multocida, and Mycoplasma bovis) and five viruses [bovine parainfluenza virus-3, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine herpesvirus-1, bovine coronavirus (BCoV), and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV)] associated with BRDC. The BED multiplex PCR- microarray- assay was able to detect and differentiate four bacteria (Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica Dublin, and Salmonella enterica Typhimurium), three protozoa (Eimeria zuernii, Eimeria bovis, and Cryptosporidium parvum), and four viruses (bovine torovirus, bovine rotavirus, BCoV, and BVDV) associated with the BED. Both assays detected their respective targets individually or in combination when present. The limit-of-detection of each assay at the PCR amplification and DNA microarray levels was determined using previously titrated laboratory amplified target pathogens or using quantified synthetic nucleotides. Both assays showed very high analytical sensitivity and specificity, and were validated using a limited number of clinical samples. The BRDC and BED multiplex PCR- microarray-assays developed in this study, with further clinical validation, could be used in veterinary diagnostic laboratories for the rapid and simultaneous identification of pathogens to facilitate quick and accurate decision making for the control and treatment of these two economically important disease complexes. Furthermore, these assays could be very effective tools in epidemiological studies as well as for screening of healthy animals to identify carriers that may potentially develop BRDC or BED.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.065570504,0.033067439,0.186738393,0.038495879,-0.024857728,-0.034190543,0.047030992,-0.013048591000000002,-0.009742099,0.064084187,-0.035324835,-0.021321457000000002,0.065969514,-0.039461783,0.058498262,-0.056768167,-0.0037982520000000002,-0.030573046,0.041462356,-0.059208202,0.042797779,0.005761036999999999,0.039721948,-0.02525963,0.038831727999999996,-0.037821667,0.008500780999999999,-0.094355661,0.05348237,-0.055893873
274,Development of a SYBR green-based real-time RT-PCR assay for rapid detection of the emerging swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus,"Abstract Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus which was associated with severe diarrhea disease in pigs. SADS-CoV was first detected and identified as the causative agent of a devastating swine disease outbreak in southern China in 2017. Routine monitoring and early detection of the source of infection is therefore integral to the prevention and control of SADS-CoV infection. In this study, a SYBR green-based real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) technique was established for rapid detection and monitoring of this emerging virus. Specific primers were designed based on the conserved region within the M gene of the viral genome. The lowest detection limit of the RT-qPCR assay was 10 copies/μL. This assay was specific and had no cross-reaction with other 11 swine viruses. The positive rate of 84 clinical samples for the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR and the conventional RT-PCR was 73.81% (62/84) and 53.57% (45/84), respectively. These results demonstrated that the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR technique was an effectively diagnostic method with higher sensitivity than probe-based RT-qPCR and gel-based RT-PCR for detection and epidemiological investigations of SADS-CoV.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.071326408,0.24489888399999998,0.22792894,0.08124646099999999,0.012956631000000001,-0.040855769,-0.0212614,0.013656258000000001,0.029810497000000002,-0.032456773,0.00849152,0.005999324,-0.046988717,0.06978969900000001,0.041274185,-0.060751879,0.040122313,-0.011993235,-0.044215275,-0.017192221,-0.040041587000000003,0.042716925999999995,0.0009765469999999999,0.067703668,0.014876799,0.017708272,0.05308724099999999,-0.011213435,0.04739132,0.019338883
275,A multiplex real-time PCR assay for the detection and differentiation of the newly emerged porcine circovirus type 3 and continuously evolving type 2 strains in the United States,"Abstract A multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (mqPCR) assay was developed and validated for the detection and differentiation of porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) and type 2 (PCV2) strains. The assay coverage was 97.9% (184/188) for PCV3 and 99.1% (1889/1907) for PCV2 sequences that were available from the current GenBank database. The PCR amplification efficiencies were 98–99% for plasmids, and 92–96% for diagnostic samples, with correlation coefficients all greater than 0.99. The limit of detection (LOD) determined as plasmid copies per reaction was 17 for PCV3 and 14 for PCV2. The assay specifically detected the targeted viruses without cross reacting to each other or to other common porcine viruses. Among 336 swine clinical samples collected in 2018, 101 (30.1%) were PCV3 positive, 56 (16.7%) were PCV2 positive and 18 (5.4%) were co-positives.

276,A multiplex RT-PCR assay for rapid and simultaneous detection of four RNA viruses in swine,"Abstract A multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain rection (mRT-PCR) was developed for simultaneous detection of four RNA viruses in swine. The conserved target sequences directed to classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) were selected based on alignments of genomic sequences and then specific primers were designed. The mRT-PCR assay was developed and evaluated for its specificity and sensitivity. The expected product from the single viral template was amplified by mRT-PCR and no spurious PCR amplification occurred from the genomic RNA or DNA of other pathogens. For single virus or different combinations of two viruses the detection limit of mRT-PCR was consistent with a single RT-PCR wtith 1 × 103 copies. For different combinations of the three viruses or four viruses, sensitivity of PEDV detection partially decreased. All of positive clinical specimens by the mRT-PCR were identically confirmed using Taqman RT-qPCR. Therefore, the mRT-PCR is a useful tool for epidemiological studies and laboratory diagnosis of single virus and/or mixed infections in swine.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.03001069,0.055638843,0.229737135,0.134843909,0.04499543,-0.053582633,-0.035915397,-0.009170743,-0.025593739,0.024725045,0.030334097999999997,-0.015093862,-0.02883998,0.08082865,0.16752293199999999,-0.154874851,0.049023477,-0.00076848,-0.036884809,0.006238508,-0.083756803,0.002523464,0.06974867400000001,-0.016384373,-0.041158433,-0.005477696999999999,0.017862813999999998,-0.05453271,0.018325793,0.005724838
277,Development of a recombinase polymerase amplification assay with lateral flow dipstick for rapid detection of feline parvovirus,"Abstract Feline panleukopenia caused by feline parvovirus (FPV), a single-stranded DNA virus, is typically highly contagious and often presents with lethal syndrome. The broad spectrum of possible hosts suggests its potential for transmission from animal to person through close contact with pets. FPV thus serves as an example of the importance of new rapid point-of-care field diagnostic tools for the control and prevention of transmission, especially among rare wild animals and pet cats. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), as a real-time and isothermal method, could be a more affordable alternative to PCR when combined with a lateral flow dipstick (LFD) indicator. In this study, we report a novel FPV lateral flow dipstick RPA (LFD-RPA) instant detection method capable of detecting a range of different FPV strains. The LFD-RPA assay consists of specific primers, probe, and nucleic acid strip. It is capable of detecting 102 copies of target nucleic acid per reaction, which is one order of magnitude higher than the sensitivity of traditional PCR. The most suitable reaction conditions for this assay are at 38 ℃ for 15 min. This paper develops an efficient visual detection system that can eliminate the need for professional staff and expensive and sophisticated equipment for field detection.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.002599927,0.08741126800000001,0.259775424,0.019513626000000003,-0.059536733,-0.007966136,0.07297289900000001,0.033049212,-0.017622162,-0.068263381,0.01126706,0.02195317,0.032458354,-0.14271382300000002,-0.083482705,0.083400447,-0.077635437,-0.07210182400000001,0.143872369,0.25367500800000004,0.071866308,-0.037575721,0.00750134,-0.073557571,-0.09432261199999999,0.05277422,0.015200203999999998,0.043511824000000004,0.035588643999999996,-0.001598674

280,One-tube fluorogenic reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for the quantitation of feline coronaviruses,"Abstract A one-tube reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for absolute feline coronavirus (FCoV) quantitation was developed. The assay is based on the 5′ nuclease activity of the Thermus flavus (Tfl) polymerase and a fluorogenic probe which generates fluorescence when it is cleaved. The fluorogenic probe, also called TaqMan™ probe (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, USA), is an oligonucleotide designed to bind between the two PCR primers to the target cDNA and is labeled with a reporter and a quencher dye. In the intact probe, the quencher dye suppresses the fluorescence of the reporter dye by Förster-type energy transfer. During the polymerase extension steps the Tfl exonuclease activity cleaves the hybridised probe resulting in the generation of fluorescent emission of the reporter dye. The threshold cycle (C T value) indicates the increase of reporter fluorescence and is directly related to the initial amount of target cDNA or RNA, respectively. Fluorescence is monitored in real time after each cycle by a Perkin-Elmer ABI Prism® 7700 Sequence Detector. After completion of amplification, the C T values of the samples are calculated back to a standard curve, generated by amplification of diluted standard molecules. The one-tube RT-PCR described below allows precise quantitation, is highly sensitive, rapid (no separate reverse transcription step and no post-amplification steps), easy to handle, allows for a high sample throughput, shows a very good reproducibility, and can be executed with a low risk of contamination. The design of the primers–probe combination enables the detection of all known FCoV strains and is also useful for the detection of canine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine respiratory coronavirus.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.032438132,0.061764442999999995,0.181477477,0.028251744,-0.02233519,-0.031859795,-0.004292563,-0.007307798000000001,-0.00702601,-0.043358142,0.04382272,-0.005626253,0.042498311,-0.0016393070000000002,-0.007489648000000001,0.0047882179999999995,0.005007676,0.002952643,0.002345419,-0.01975986,-0.005259292,0.004480175,0.017536773000000002,0.009922445,0.02366032,-0.023067108,-0.005418673000000001,-0.001078073,-0.02136591,0.054236899000000005
281,Quantitative sense-specific determination of murine coronavirus RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction,"Abstract In many applications, it is useful to know the sense and amount of viral RNAs present in a sample. In theory, sense-specific measurement of viral RNAs may be achieved by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays which utilize primers of defined polarity during the RT step. However, in practice, it has been shown that such assays are prone to artifacts, such as non-specific priming, which drastically diminish their reliability. Using murine coronavirus MHV-4 as a model, we describe and validate several modifications of the RT-PCR procedure which eliminate these artifacts. Key RT-PCR parameters which were optimized include the design of tagged primers, DNase treatment of in vitro transcribed RNA standards, specification of temperature differences between RT and PCR annealing steps, and use of competitive RNA templates for quantitative assays. The assays described may be used to determine the sense and abundance of any viral or host RNA of interest in complex biological specimens.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.068045017,0.075935469,0.17492318,0.151306141,-0.03148101,-0.109916795,-0.034706377999999996,0.013284521,-0.031284973,-0.012442006,0.045711974,-0.026492112,0.014443415,0.14867487599999998,0.020188131,0.030392547000000002,0.02505366,0.042113977999999996,-0.078392923,-0.085019886,-0.025365901,0.06576631,-0.04385425,0.035428778,0.022560746,0.003986544,0.10454403300000001,-0.08804659199999999,0.059544614,0.011765272

In this study, we detected the viromes of RNA viruses of one mock sample, one pooled duck feces sample and one pooled mink feces sample on the Personal Genome Machine platform using the sequencing libraries prepared by three methods. The sequencing primers were added through random hybridization and ligation to fragmented viral RNA using a RNA-Seq kit in method 1, through random reverse transcription (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in method 2 which was developed in our laboratory, and through hybridization and ligation to fragmented amplicons of random RT-PCR using a single primer in method 3. Although the results of these three samples (nine libraries) all showed that more classified viral families and genera were identified using methods 2 and 3 than using method 1, and more classified viral families and genera were identified using method 2 than using method 3, most of the differences were of no statistical significance.

407,Chapter 5 Clinical Applications of Quantitative Real-Time PCR in Virology,"Abstract Since the invention of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and discovery of Taq polymerase, PCR has become a staple in both research and clinical molecular laboratories. As clinical and diagnostic needs have evolved over the last few decades, demanding greater levels of sensitivity and accuracy, so too has PCR performance. Through optimisation, the present-day uses of real-time PCR and quantitative real-time PCR are enumerable. The technique, combined with adoption of automated processes and reduced sample volume requirements, makes it an ideal method in a broad range of clinical applications, especially in virology. Complementing serologic testing by detecting infections within the pre-seroconversion window period and infections with immunovariant viruses, real-time PCR provides a highly valuable tool for screening, diagnosing, or monitoring diseases, as well as evaluating medical and therapeutic decision points that allows for more timely predictions of therapeutic failures than traditional methods and, lastly, assessing cure rates following targeted therapies. All of these serve vital roles in the continuum of care to enhance patient management. Beyond this, quantitative real-time PCR facilitates advancements in the quality of diagnostics by driving consensus management guidelines following standardisation to improve patient outcomes, pushing for disease eradication with assays offering progressively lower limits of detection, and rapidly meeting medical needs in cases of emerging epidemic crises involving new pathogens that may result in significant health threats.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.091819443,0.085554909,0.171689779,0.040321099,-0.08255533400000001,-0.002340703,0.046527772,0.034600115,0.003269155,0.070310175,-0.022646534,-0.030451032000000003,0.083495444,-0.037944596000000004,0.039672126,-0.017796038,-0.016814095,0.017766636000000002,-0.030952762,-0.138268568,0.025883922,0.0060127390000000005,0.019824918,-0.119989632,-0.056454974000000005,-0.015044896,0.060410989000000005,-0.06204069999999999,0.04171623,0.008301679000000001
410,Simple and rapid detection of human enterovirus 71 by reverse-transcription and loop-mediated isothermal amplification: cryopreservation affected the detection ability,"Abstract Human enterovirus 71 (EV71) is the primary pathogen of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). EV71 infection may lead to neurologic damage, with higher incidence of fatality compared with other HFMD pathogens. An effective drug or vaccine against EV71 infection is currently unavailable. It is desirable to determine the pathogen of HFMD accurately and quickly for early treatment. In the current study, reverse-transcription and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) technology were developed to detect EV71. The efficacy of detecting EV71 was compared with regular nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). After detecting 108 clinical specimens, results showed that RT-LAMP can specifically detect EV71, but not Coxsackie virus A16, and exhibited a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 97.1%, which was higher than regular RT-PCR. The findings indicate that RT-LAMP is a practical method for EV71 diagnostic applications, particularly in small county institutes of medical service.

We describe the use of a combined reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/pyrosequencing approach to identify the H275 residue. A total of 223 specimens were tested with this method: 216 randomly selected clinical specimens positive for 2009 H1N1 and 7 cell-culture supernatants from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; 4 resistant, 3 susceptible 2009 H1N1 strains). The assay detected H275Y in 1 clinical respiratory sample (0.5%) and all 4 oseltamivir-resistant strains from the CDC; the remaining 215 clinical and 3 susceptible CDC specimens were wild-type. Sanger sequencing confirmed the results for 50 of 50 selected isolates. The RT-PCR/pyrosequencing method was highly specific, producing no amplicons or valid sequences from samples containing non-H1N1 viruses or bacteria.

412,Evaluation of the PrimerDesign™ genesig real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction assay and the INFINITI® Respiratory Viral Panel Plus assay for the detection of human metapneumovirus in Kuwait,"Abstract Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a respiratory pathogen that was discovered in 2001 and is considered a major cause of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections. A sensitive, fast, and high-throughput diagnostic test is needed for the detection of hMPV that may assist in the clinical management as well as in the reduction of inappropriate therapy. Therefore, a comparison assessment was performed in this study between the PrimerDesign™ genesig real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Assay and the INFINITI® Respiratory Viral Panel Plus Assay (RVP-Plus) for the detection of hMPV infection in patients with respiratory tract infections. A total of 200 respiratory samples were collected from 185 hospitalized patients, during the winter season in Kuwait. Of 185 patients, 10 (5.4%) were positive for hMPV RNA by the in-house RT-PCR assay, while 7 (4%) were positive for hMPV RNA by the real-time RT-PCR assay and 9 (5%) were positive for hMPV RNA by the INFINITI® RVP-Plus assay. The high incidence rate (60%) of hMPV infection was in January 2011. The sensitivity of the real-time RT-PCR and INFINITI® RVP-Plus assays was 70% and 90%, respectively, with specificity of 100% for both assays. hMPV types A and B could be identified in this study; however, discordant genotyping results were found between the direct sequencing method and the INFINITI® RVP-Plus assay in 33% of hMPV-positive patients.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.200067548,0.02126205,0.111232919,0.139884746,-0.00080336,-0.21129112,0.007094362,-0.046979850999999996,0.0857679,-0.066204786,0.028945731000000002,-0.023549616000000002,-0.111201917,0.137285662,-0.126277231,-0.077552857,0.054720795,0.259796328,-0.128913898,0.06165969599999999,0.211281898,0.032767934,0.011476166999999999,-0.157176696,-0.11824483400000001,0.021363426,-0.207306795,-0.187788576,0.030535668,-0.068176685
413,Comparison of FilmArray Respiratory Panel and laboratory-developed real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction assays for respiratory virus detection,"Abstract The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (Idaho Technology) is a highly multiplexed respiratory virus real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Eighty-four respiratory viruses identified by laboratory-developed real-time reverse transcription–PCR assays (LDA) or by viral cultures were mixed and tested by FilmArray to assess its performance. FilmArray identified 72 (90%) of 80 viruses also detected by LDA. Six of the 8 viruses not detected by FilmArray had PCR cycle threshold values >35. Compared to LDA, FilmArray showed comparable sensitivity when used to test serial dilutions of virus mixtures and good agreement with negative samples. With the use of 1 FilmArray instrument, 7 clinical samples could be analyzed and reported in an 8-h shift compared to 20 using LDA and 1 real-time detection instrument.

419,Development of a pan-serotype reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for the detection of dengue virus,"Abstract During dengue outbreaks, acute diagnosis at the patient's point of need followed by appropriate supportive therapy reduces morbidity and mortality. To facilitate needed diagnosis, we developed and optimized a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay that detects all 4 serotypes of dengue virus (DENV). We used a quencher to reduce nonspecific amplification. The assay does not require expensive thermocyclers, utilizing a simple water bath to maintain the reaction at 63°C. Results can be visualized using UV fluorescence, handheld readers, or lateral flow immunochromatographic tests. We report a sensitivity of 86.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 72.7–94.8%) and specificity of 93.0% (95% CI, 83.0–98.1%) using a panel of clinical specimens characterized by DENV quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction.

422,Partial comparison of the NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel Assay with the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Panel Fast Assay V2 and singleplex real-time polymerase chain reaction for detection of respiratory pathogens,"Abstract In this study, 185 nasopharyngeal swabs were tested to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the Luminex NxTAG (NxTAG) Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP) Assay with those of the Luminex Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) Fast Assay v2 and singleplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The NxTAG Assay identified at least one infectious agent in 164 (88.7%) of the swabs. In 91 (6.2%) tests with negative results with the RVP Fast Assay v2, a virus was identified by the NxTAG (P < 0.001). With the NxTAG Assay, the detection rates were significantly higher for respiratory syncytial virus (P = 0.003), human metapneumovirus (P < 0.001), human rhinovirus/human enterovirus (P = 0.009) and human adenovirus (P < 0.001). Finally, the NxTAG Assay identified M. pneumoniae in 32 of 44 (72.7%) PCR-positive samples. However, the concordance with real-time PCR results was low for both assays. In conclusion, the results indicate that the NxTAG Assay overcomes some of the limitations of previous Luminex assays, although further studies are needed for a more complete evaluation of the new assay.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.137394163,0.039788013,0.153493347,0.080259512,-0.00359258,-0.069484345,0.024822027000000003,-0.015274107,0.012104536,-0.007319959,-0.022140687000000003,-0.016801966,-0.01614766,0.046288193,0.014618531,-0.057715799000000005,0.049661657000000005,-0.034970077,0.086689147,-0.041236833,0.076820195,-0.005324537,0.082932243,-0.027092982999999998,-0.043367777,0.066837463,0.0064125119999999996,-0.0028776,0.0062042619999999995,-0.089814785

434,Development of a recombinase polymerase amplification combined with lateral-flow dipstick assay for detection of bovine ephemeral fever virus,"Abstract Bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV), identified as the causative pathogen of bovine ephemeral fever (BEF), is responsible for increasing numbers of epidemics/outbreaks and has a significant harmful effect on the livestock industry. Therefore, a rapid detection assay is imperative for BEFV diagnosis. In this study, we described the development of lateral-flow dipstick isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (LFD-RPA) assays for detection of BEFV. RPA primers and LF probes were designed by targeting the specific G gene, and the amplification product can be visualized on a simple lateral flow dipstick with the naked eyes. The amplification reaction was performed at 38 °C for 20 min and LFD incubation time within 5 min. The detection limit of this assay was 8 copies per reaction, and there was no cross-reactivity with other bovine infectious viruses such as bovine viral diarrhea virus, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine coronavirus, bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, bovine vesicular stomatitis virus. In addition, the assay was performed with total 128 clinical specimens and the diagnostic results were compared with conventional RT-PCR, real-time quantative(q) PCR. The result showed that the coincidence rate of BEFV LFD-RPA and real-time qPCR was 96.09% (123/128), which was higher than conventional RT-PCR.

435,Equipment-free recombinase polymerase amplification assay using body heat for visual and rapid point-of-need detection of canine parvovirus 2,"Abstract A visible and equipment-free recombinase polymerase amplification assay combined with a lateral flow strip (LFS RPA) was developed to detect canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), which is the etiological agent of canine parvovirus disease. The CPV-2 LFS RPA assay was developed based on the VP2 gene and is performed in a closed fist using body heat for 15 min; the products are visible to the naked eye on the LFS within 5 min. The assay could detect CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c, and there was no cross-reaction with the other viruses tested. Using the standard CPV-2 DNA as a template, the analytical sensitivity was 1.0 × 102 copies per reaction, which was the same result as that of a real-time PCR. The assay performance was further evaluated by testing 60 canine fecal samples, and CPV-2 DNA was detected in 46 samples (76.7%, 46/60) by LFS RPA, which was the same result as that of the real-time PCR assay and higher than that of the SNAP method (48.3%, 29/60). The novel CPV-2 LFS RPA assay is an attractive and promising tool for rapid and convenient diagnosis of CPV disease, especially cage side and in underequipped laboratories.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.012075727,0.065012659,0.239779938,-0.00044609699999999995,-0.043364691,-0.038339053,0.047222284,0.019046574,-0.018902835,-0.093583037,-0.019806505,0.052285383,-0.06264217400000001,-0.06422084900000001,-0.030390905,0.057132932000000004,-0.061819025,-0.11983239300000001,0.21943202399999998,0.15330320000000003,0.220696151,0.08565904,-0.051538561,-0.082805511,0.019547123,-0.06328745200000001,-0.044364203,0.023456884,0.00517566,0.053262785
436,A lateral flow dipstick combined with reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification for rapid and visual detection of the bovine respirovirus 3,"Abstract Bovine respirovirus 3 also known as Bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV3) is one of the most important viral respiratory agents of both young and adult cattle. Rapid diagnosis could contribute greatly in containing epidemics and thus avoid economic losses. However, the lack of robust isothermal visual method poses difficulty. In this study, a novel isothermal assay for detecting BPIV3 was established. The method includes a lateral flow dipstick (LFD) assay combined with reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA). First, the analytical sensitivity and specificity of BPIV3 LFD RT-RPA were tested. The LFD RT-RPA assay has a detection limit of up to 100 copies per reaction in 30 min at 38 °C. Then the performance of LFD RT-RPA was evaluated using 95 clinical samples. Compared to qPCR, the LFD RT-RPA assay showed a clinical sensitivity of 94.74%, a clinical specificity of 96.05% and 0.8734 kappa coefficient.

437,Reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification with lateral flow dipsticks for detection of influenza A virus and subtyping of H1 and H3,"Abstract Three reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assays with lateral flow dipsticks (RT-RPA-LFD) were developed for identification of the matrix and hemagglutinin (HA) genes to detect influenza A virus and distinguish subtypes H1 and H3. Assessment of the assays’ specificity showed that there was no cross-reactivity with other targets. Their limits of detection were 123.6 copies per reaction for the matrix gene, 677.1 copies per reaction for the H1 HA gene, and 112.2 copies/reaction for the H3 HA gene. Of 111 samples tested by RT-RPA-LFD assays, 27 were positive for influenza A virus, 14 were positive for H1, and 10 were positive for H3. Compared to the results obtained from real-time RT-PCR assays, the sensitivity of RT-RPA-LFD assays was 75%, 93.33% and 71.43% for the matrix, H1, and H3, with 100% specificity. The sensitivity of RT-RPA-LFD assays is lower than that of real-time RT-PCR, comparable or better than that of conventional RT-PCR, and much better than that of RIDTs.

440,A multiplex PCR for Massachusetts and Arkansas serotypes of infectious bronchitis virus,"Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the prototype of the coronavirus family, is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus with a genome size of approximately 27·6 kilobase. Infectious bronchitis virus causes an acute, highly contagious respiratory and urogenital disease of chickens which results in significant economic losses in commercial broilers, layers and breeders. A rapid, highly sensitive and specific method is needed in the differential diagnosis of infections of different serotypes. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was developed and optimized to simultaneously detect Massachusetts (Mass) and Arkansas (Ark) serotypes of IBV. One common primer and two serotype specific primers were chosen from the S1 gene sequences of IBV and used in one PCR reaction. Under optimized PCR conditions, two serotype specific PCR products, 1026 bp for Mass and 896 bp for Ark, respectively, were amplified and detected by agarose gel electrophoreses. The specificity of the technique was verified by using 20 different strains and isolates of IBV, and other avian bacterial and viral pathogens. Using a serial 10-fold dilution of the artificial mixture of both Mass and Ark samples, the detection limit was found to be 5 pg RNA after 35 cycles of PCR. The multiplex PCR was able to detect and differentiate both serotypes in embryonated eggs that were co-infected with different EID50virus titers of Mass 41 and Ark 99.

447,Evaluation of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) for the detection of rota viruses: applications of the assay,"Summary Our aim was to evaluate the reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) technique for the detection of rotavirus shedding by infected children as a routine diagnostic procedure, in comparison to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), electron microscopy (EM) and polyacrylamide gel etectrophoresis (PAGE) of rotavirus double stranded RNA. Two-hundred and twenty stool specimens were collected from infants and young children with diarrhoea, and 10–20% faecal suspensions were made. Several methods of rotavirus dsRNA extraction were assayed. Electrophoretic analysis of viral RNA was carried out on 10% polyacrylamide gols followed by silver staining. RT/PCR was performed using oligonucleotide primers specific for both 3′ and 5′ ends of the rotavirus gene encoding VP7 which ere highly conserved among group A rotaviruses. Following RNA extraction with phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitation, RT/PCR could detect rotaviral RNA in only 11 of 25 samples known to contain rotaviruses by conventional methods. The purification of RNA extracts by CF11 cellulose and the application of the RNAID method were equally effective in extracting RNA and/or removing inhibitory substances from the faecal samples. RT/PCR led to the detection of 66 positive samples from 220 specimens tested (30%). whilst 64 specimens were positive by EUSA (29%), 59 (26.3%) by PAGE and 56 (25.4%) by EM. In our study, RT/PCR was 100 times more sensitive than the ELISA test in detecting rotaviruses serially diluted in a faecal suspension. Although RT/PCR is theoretically much more sensitive than ELISA, PAGE and EM for detection of rotaviruses, great care must be taken to remove inhibitory substances from the enzymatic reactions. We do not consider that RT/PCR should replace immunoassays with high sensitivity and specificity for rotavirus testing in faecal samples, although this technique has other applications, like the search for rotavirus in different clinical specimens (sera, cerebrospinal fluid, respiratory secretions, etc.) and in environmental samples, as well as the typing of viral strains using serotype-specific primers.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.035375405,0.07344183,0.220306222,0.085705226,0.037004262999999996,-0.124252424,-0.013276253,-0.019378215,-0.044393014,-0.025892653999999998,0.093502885,-0.001620289,-0.049511081,0.10901776,0.025918247999999998,-0.026135732000000002,0.062894854,-0.010693352,0.006438758,-0.11450462199999999,-0.046041302,0.08276302599999999,-0.02728456,0.001155615,0.036928916,-0.022110018,0.028940808,-0.073044014,-0.000694517,0.027243682
450,A real-time convective PCR machine in a capillary tube instrumented with a CCD-based fluorometer,"Abstract This research reports the design, analysis, integration, and test of a prototype of a real-time convective polymerase chain reaction (RT-cPCR) machine that uses a color charged coupled device (CCD) for detecting the emission of fluorescence intensity from an RT-cPCR mix in a microliter volume glass capillary. Because of its simple mechanism, DNA amplification involves employing the cPCR technique with no need for thermocycling control. The flow pattern and temperature distribution can greatly affect the cPCR process in the capillary tube, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation was conducted in this study for the first time to estimate the required period of an RT-cPCR cycle. This study also tested the PCR mix containing hepatitis B virus (HBV) plasmid samples by using SYBR Green I fluorescence labeling dye to assess the prototype performance. The measured results from the image-processing scheme indicate that the RT-cPCR prototype with a CCD-based fluorometer can achieve similar DNA quantification reproducibility compared to commercial machines, even when the initial DNA concentration in the test PCR mix is reduced to 10copies/μL",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.000671516,0.056286170999999996,0.192439159,0.0075094540000000005,-0.0518368,-0.017648961,0.004186627,-0.0048216479999999996,-0.00854755,-0.033825972999999995,-0.009093373,0.01326574,-0.013797871000000001,0.026658748,-0.025177032000000002,0.046616932,0.013301035,-0.001045559,-0.019850684,-0.051243671,-0.024842586,0.01528082,-0.016625413999999998,-0.008042013,-0.008689947,0.016879528,-1.1599999999999999e-05,0.006962716999999999,0.023137425,-0.004142476
459,Virologie : l’apport de la biologie moléculaire dans le diagnostic microbiologique en pneumopédiatrie,"Résumé Les outils traditionnels du diagnostic virologique comprennent la recherche antigénique directe par immunofluorescence (IF) ou test immunoenzymatique (EIA), et l’isolement en culture. Les techniques d’IF ou EIA ont une sensibilité en général légèrement inférieure à celle de la culture, mais elles permettent de détecter également une fraction d’échantillons faussement négatifs en culture. Les résultats de plusieurs équipes, utilisant des techniques de reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), montrent que les méthodes moléculaires détectent plus d’échantillons positifs que les méthodes traditionnelles. Le travail est en cours pour élargir le nombre de virus identifiés par des RT-PCR multiplex et découvrir de nouveaux virus, tels le métapneumovirus humain, en cause dans les atteintes respiratoires de l’enfant. En conclusion, afin de concilier rapidité, contrôle des coûts et un fort taux de détection des virus respiratoires, l’utilisation combinée de l’IF et de la RT-PCR multiplex semble ce jour la meilleure façon de progresser dans le diagnostic des maladies respiratoires de l’enfant. Summary The conventionnal tools used for virological diagnosis include direct antigen detection by immunofluorescence (IFA) or an immunoenzymatic test (EIA), and viral isolation technique (VIT). In most cases, IFA and EIA have a slightly lower sensitivity than VIT but are also able to detect some VIT-negative samples. Results of several teams using RT-PCR technologies show that the molecular methods detect more positive cases than the conventional tools. Work is under way to expand the number of viruses detected by multiplex RT-PCR and to determine wether newly discovered viruses, such as human metapneumovirus, contribute to burden of paediatric lower respiratory infections. In conclusion, according to requirements of speed, low cost of the methods, and to achieve the highest rate of detection of respiratory viruses, the combined use of IFA and multiplex RT-PCR is today likely to be the best way to improve diagnosis of respiratory illnesses in children.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.092356887,0.000582246,0.121810377,0.02695589,-0.018463663999999998,-0.038247966,0.038862176,-0.021886591,0.028506556000000002,0.009907157,0.00245834,0.011268021000000001,0.047400235,-0.082095366,0.251379619,0.24723513100000002,0.444551005,0.073339807,-0.08419625300000001,-0.015064556000000002,0.037293143,0.092909862,0.088078003,0.022597186000000002,-0.044049338,0.023847017,0.015854352,-0.06918798599999999,-0.009208346,-0.009216599

An RT-PCR cocktail, which included Texas Red-labeled primers, dNTP including biotin-labeled dUTP, and RNA templates of influenza A H1N1 virus, was filled in the PCR chamber through the micropump, and the RT-PCR was performed to amplify the target H1 gene (102bp). The resultant amplicons bearing biotin moieties and Texas Red haptens were subsequently eluted to the immunochromatographic strip, in which they were first conjugated with the gold nanoparticle labeled anti-hapten antibody in the conjugation pad, and then captured on the streptavidin coated test line through the biotin–streptavidin interaction. By observing a violet color in the test line which was derived from the gold nanoparticle, we confirmed the H1N1 target virus. The entire process on the integrated microdevice consisting of a micropump, a 2μL PCR chamber, and an immunochromatographic strip was carried out on the portable genetic analyzer within 2.5h, enabling on-site colorimetric pathogen identification with detection sensitivity of 14.1pg RNA templates.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.000440876,0.02119137,0.151981736,0.10542949800000001,-0.025242675,0.072264546,-0.09672592699999999,0.006096045,-0.037375231,-0.063634328,0.001963276,-0.005383959000000001,-0.006325786,0.052009760999999995,-0.008680235,0.018507045,0.048954645,0.012981306000000001,-0.046961754,-0.09456467699999999,0.007072525,0.023716492000000002,0.014844619,-0.025244955,-0.016192493,0.025607176000000002,0.021130261,-0.013030518,0.032073854,0.046940006
468,Thermally stable and uniform DNA amplification with picosecond laser ablated graphene rapid thermal cycling device,"Abstract Rapid thermal cycling (RTC) in an on-chip device can perform DNA amplification in vitro through precise thermal control at each step of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This study reports a straightforward fabrication technique for patterning an on-chip graphene-based device with hole arrays, in which the mechanism of surface structures can achieve stable and uniform thermal control for the amplification of DNA fragments. A thin-film based PCR device was fabricated using picosecond laser (PS-laser) ablation of the multilayer graphene (MLG). Under the optimal fluence of 4.72 J/cm2 with a pulse overlap of 66%, the MLG can be patterned with arrays of 250 μm2 hole surface structures. A 354-bp DNA fragment of VP1, an effective marker for diagnosing the BK virus, was amplified on an on-chip device in less than 60 min. A thin-film electrode with the aforementioned MLG as the heater was demonstrated to significantly enhance temperature stability for each stage of the thermal cycle. The temperature control of the heater was performed by means of a developed programmable PCR apparatus. Our results demonstrated that the proposed integration of a graphene-based device and a laser-pulse ablation process to form a thin-film PCR device has cost benefits in a small-volume reagent and holds great promise for practical medical use of DNA amplification.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.032551736,0.02306439,0.14236510300000002,-0.02213631,-0.068228766,0.001662052,0.029389212999999997,0.004034307,-0.011242241000000002,-0.007931913,-0.047613634,0.011179238000000001,0.016092428,-0.080662069,-0.020466544,0.069760547,-0.043458254,-0.01606999,-0.029954467999999998,-0.030330462000000002,-0.03222195,-0.034125671,0.017348616,-0.044891398,-0.026018569,-0.03035096,-0.063393276,0.036189727000000005,-0.025259899,0.05143336
473,CRISPR-Cas13a mediated nanosystem for attomolar detection of canine parvovirus type 2,"Abstract Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) infection is the most lethal disease of dogs with higher mortality in puppies worldwide. In today’s world, dogs are an integral part of our communities as well as dogs breeding and rearing has become a lucrative business. Therefore, a fast, accurate, portable, and cost-effective CPV-2 detection method with the ability for on-site detection is highly desired. In this study, we for the first time proposed a nanosystem for CPV-2 DNA detection with RNA-guided RNA endonuclease Cas13a, which upon activation results in collateral RNA degradation. We expressed LwCas13a in prokaryotic expression system and purified it through nickel column. Activity of Cas13a was verified by RNA-bound fluorescent group while using a quenched fluorescent probe as signals. Further Cas13a was combined with Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and T7 transcription to establish molecular detection system termed specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter un-locking (SHERLOCK) for sensitive detection of CPV-2 DNA. This nanosystem can detect 100 amol/L CPV-2 DNA within 30 min. The proposed nanosystem exhibited high specificity when tested for CPV-2 and other dog viruses. This CRISPR-Cas13a mediated sensitive detection approach can be of formidable advantage during CPV-2 outbreaks because it is time-efficient, less laborious and does not involve the use of sophisticated instruments.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.055553487,0.028024526,0.18300750600000001,0.033763478,-0.061665122,-0.051606879,0.055931729000000006,0.017663165,-0.032995534,-0.030714905,-0.000562575,0.026219125,-0.018041274,-0.071688972,-0.000969569,0.043576066,-0.08140404400000001,-0.119753513,0.136906017,0.062152597000000004,0.155469794,0.066278532,-0.051048757,-0.07862208799999999,0.08461375900000001,-0.150815067,-0.12855503199999999,0.046335719000000004,-0.07909406599999999,0.09792576199999999

511,A new multiplex RT-qPCR method for the simultaneous detection and discrimination of Zika and chikungunya viruses,"Abstract Objective The re-emergence and spread of tropical viruses to new areas has raised a wave of concern worldwide. In order to treat patients at an early stage and prevent the diffusion of an outbreak, early diagnosis, and therefore fast and adequate detection, is needed. To this end, a multiplex reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction TaqMan method was designed to detect Zika (ZIKV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses simultaneously. Methods Two methods targeting different genome segments were selected from the literature for each virus. These were adapted for high genome coverage and combined in a four-plex assay that was thoroughly validated in-house. The SCREENED tool was used to evaluate the sequence coverage of the method. Results The full validation approach showed that the new four-plex method allows the specific and sensitive identification and discrimination of ZIKV and CHIKV in routine samples. The combination of two targets per virus allowing almost 100% coverage of about 500 genomes is shown for the first time. Conclusions PCR is a reliable user-friendly technique that can be applied in remote areas. Such multiplex methods enable early and efficient diagnosis, leading to rapid treatment and effective confinement in outbreak cases. They may also serve as an aid for surveillance, and the full validation permits easy method-transfer allowing worldwide harmonization.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.026949227000000003,0.050794108,0.140026484,0.046828855999999995,-0.045156985,0.008245687,0.011849266,0.016313842,-0.021168032000000003,0.046351604000000005,-0.040757572,-0.012016793000000001,0.05275437,-0.038572882999999995,0.03560183,-0.0105104,-0.025961181,0.016035264,-0.001708822,-0.013243884,0.009643191,-0.004340579000000001,-0.014775908999999999,-0.002463095,-0.023590309,-0.0064359890000000005,0.023515315,0.020784106,-0.039801436,0.003385284
515,Molecular diagnostic techniques,"Abstract Molecular diagnostic techniques will continue to transform clinical microbiology. They provide more rapid and sensitive testing that impacts directly on clinical management of infected patients. Molecular diagnostic tests arose from the need to detect micro-organisms that are slow or difficult to grow, or that are present in only small numbers. Nucleic acid amplification techniques (e.g. polymerase chain reaction, PCR) can detect DNA or RNA specific to certain micro-organisms and do not rely on either the recovery of the pathogen or an immune response in the infected patient. Alternative nucleic acid amplification methods have emerged recently because of increasing commercial interest in infectious disease diagnostics and the comprehensive patient protection of PCR technology. Such techniques are gaining widespread acceptance, and have displaced more conventional gold-standard testing in some areas of infectious disease (e.g. viral load testing in HIV-1 infected patients, diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infection). Genetic characterization techniques are increasingly used to determine the relatedness of micro-organisms in the clinical setting. These methods are useful in establishing routes or sources of infection in outbreaks of disease, and are powerful epidemiological tools in large-scale clinical investigations. Recently, there has been a move towards pathogen characterization techniques based on direct nucleotide sequencing (e.g. single nucleotide polymorphism analysis, multi-locus sequence typing). These techniques offer unambiguous, portable data that can be exchanged via the Internet, strengthening collaborative efforts in the field of infectious disease research.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.034686824,0.039762287,0.131819271,-0.018890868999999998,-0.082849504,0.001843435,0.034299205,0.041582614,-0.031512126,0.151347804,-0.042615238,-0.023023812,0.140455061,-0.13695269300000001,0.010198691999999999,0.016217053999999998,-0.060764355,0.077349247,-0.106722322,-0.039399591,-0.016261865,-0.062453750999999995,0.03036381,-0.139799395,-0.036677311000000004,-0.044642293,-0.020619463,-0.037958834,-0.09721845,0.09582505
516,Molecular diagnostic techniques,"Abstract Clinical microbiology laboratories increasingly rely on molecular diagnostic techniques. The various formats of nucleic acid amplification are the most frequently used molecular tests in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. In many clinical settings, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is clearly the method of choice due to its exquisite sensitivity and specificity. Today, many conventional PCR methods are being replaced by real-time PCR, which allows more rapid detection and quantification of the PCR product, as well as detection of different strains of the pathogen by melting curve analysis. The ability to measure the quantity of microbe by quantitative PCR has become increasingly important, providing information on the progression and prognosis of disease, and effectiveness of treatment. Other widely used molecular diagnostic techniques are isothermal amplification methods and nucleic acid hybridization techniques. Microarray is a technique which holds promise and has an exceptional sensitivity and the capacity to detect several pathogens simultaneously. However, microarrays are currently too expensive to be adapted for routine diagnostics, and their diagnostic use requires broad-based nucleic acid amplification prior to analysis which is not well established. Several molecular methods can be used for genotyping, which allows the identification of different subtypes of the pathogen; genotyping plays a role in the risk assessment and management of infections. Clinicians need to recognize the enhanced accuracy and speed of the molecular diagnostic techniques for the diagnosis of infections, but also to understand their limitations. Laboratory results should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical presentation of the patient, and appropriate site, quality, and timing of specimen collection are required for reliable test results.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.071519724,0.076921908,0.25831864,0.050702379000000006,-0.101105637,-0.009431245999999999,0.064346078,0.028260011,-0.015907701,0.136936593,-0.080492896,-0.031029256,0.165451906,-0.176527778,0.013624607,0.0036215870000000003,-0.047530101,0.050229135,-0.09769939300000001,-0.10772558900000001,-0.037742528,-0.080858055,0.076869303,-0.17255032899999997,-0.0007261910000000001,-0.041521645,-0.022900199,-0.050724542000000004,-0.074409831,0.080682916
520,Molecular analysis of cerebrospinal fluid in viral diseases of the central nervous system,"Abstract The use of nucleic acid (NA) amplification techniques has transformed the diagnosis of viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS). Because of their enhanced sensitivity, these methods enable detection of even low amounts of viral genomes in cerebrospinal fluid. Following more than 10 years of experience, the polymerase chain reaction or other NA-based amplification techniques are nowadays performed in most diagnostic laboratories and have become the test of choice for the diagnosis of several viral CNS infections, such as herpes encephalitis, enterovirus meningitis and other viral infections occurring in human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons. Furthermore, they have been useful to establish a viral etiology in neurological syndromes of dubious origin and to recognise unusual or poorly characterised CNS diseases. Quantitative methods have provided a valuable additional tool for clinical management of these diseases, whereas post-amplification techniques have enabled precise genome characterisation. Current efforts are aiming at further improvement of the diagnostic efficiency of molecular techniques, their speed and standardisation, and to reduce the costs. The most relevant NA amplification strategies and clinical applications of to date will be the object of this review.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.024957837000000004,-0.005587756,0.116436087,0.036747659,-0.10583623800000001,0.000341637,0.09450683,0.012478382,-0.002192349,0.102363491,-0.049317589,-0.040860295,0.140028402,-0.13583363099999998,0.026378733999999997,0.024862453,-0.059277748,0.039486377,-0.07435339099999999,0.014897903,-0.056430970999999996,-0.049964423,0.006560614,-0.064176258,-0.015411406,-0.042059565,-0.036128472,-0.017744112,-0.073889682,0.082230409
521,Clinical virology in real time,"Abstract The ability to detect nucleic acids has had and still has a major impact on diagnostics in clinical virology. Both quantitative and qualitative techniques, whether signal or target amplification based systems, are currently used routinely in most if not all virology laboratories. Technological improvements, from automated sample isolation to real time amplification technology, have given the ability to develop and introduce systems for most viruses of clinical interest, and to obtain clinical relevant information needed for optimal antiviral treatment options. Both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) can currently be used together with real time detection to generate results in a short turn-around time and to determine whether variants relevant for antiviral resistance are present. These new technologies enable the introduction of an individual patient disease management concept. Within our clinical setting, we have introduced this e.g. for quantitative detection of Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV) in T-dell depleted allogeneic stem cell transplant patients. This enabled us to develop models for pre-emptive anti B-cell immunotherapy for EBV reactivation, thereby effectively reducing not the incidence of EBV-lymphoproliferative disease but the virus related mortality. Furthermore, additional clinically relevant viruses can now easily be detected simultaneously. It also becomes more feasible to introduce molecular testing for those viruses that can easily be detected using classical virological methods, like culture techniques or antigen detection. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the clinical importance of the additional positive samples detected. It should however be made clear that a complete exchange of technologies is unlikely to occur, and that some complementary technologies should stay operational enabling the discovery of new viruses. The implementation of these molecular diagnostic technologies furthermore warrants the use and introduction of standardized materials as well as participation in international quality control programs. Finally, the use of an internal control throughout the whole procedure not only ensures the accuracy of the results generated, but also is necessary to enable precise quantification of these results and to determine detection thresholds more accurately. Since so many targets do have clinical implications, laboratories might prefer to use universal internal controls before the in-house developed assays should be introduced in clinical virology.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.050554815,0.027949792,0.140965863,0.051824563,-0.08670598800000001,0.021445397,0.07254668,0.034562632,-0.019862544,0.113400106,-0.072680993,-0.021155282,0.125030977,-0.11656895699999999,0.02436776,-0.010714953000000001,-0.06735616700000001,0.035679232000000005,-0.024208482000000003,-0.041616251,-0.002647304,-0.054852643,0.022906477,-0.070652521,-0.048815292999999996,-0.035290801000000004,0.0032787709999999998,-0.041245254,-0.044964181,0.021943304
525,Evaluation of quantitative and type-specific real-time RT-PCR assays for detection of respiratory syncytial virus in respiratory specimens from children,"Abstract Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract morbidity in young children and immunosuppressed patients. Objectives: To rapidly and accurately quantify and subtype RSV in respiratory samples, we developed and evaluated two real-time RT-PCR assays. Study design: A quantitative assay was designed using primers for a consensus region of the matrix protein gene and a subtype-specific assay for RSV-A and RSV-B detection was designed using primers for the polymerase gene. Quantitative RSV RT-PCR results of pediatric nasal wash samples submitted to the University of Washington Virology Laboratory from December 2002, through May 2003, were compared to those of an indirect fluorescent antibody RSV antigen detection assay (FA). Results: Specificity of the RT-PCR assay was high, with no amplification of eleven common respiratory viruses and eight herpes viruses. Among 751 samples, RSV was detected in 267 (35.6%) by FA and in 286 (38.1%) by RT-PCR. Median RSV copy number in nasal wash samples that were positive by both FA and RT-PCR was 2.5×107 copies/mL versus a median of 3.0×104 copies/mL for samples positive by RT-PCR only (P<0.001). The detection and quantity of RSV in respiratory specimens was associated with younger age, but not with gender or hospitalization. Among positive samples from this Seattle cohort, 52% were subtype A and 48% were subtype B. Both subtypes were detected with similar viral loads among all patient groups (stratified by age, gender, and hospitalization), and throughout the specimen collection period. Conclusions: These real-time RT-PCR assays provide a rapid, specific, and highly sensitive alternative for detecting, quantifying, and subtyping RSV in clinical specimens.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.243454593,0.026355574,0.196358237,0.17346760100000003,0.045387947000000005,-0.173544173,-0.0062567740000000005,-0.11146535199999999,0.102052881,-0.10872718099999999,0.039682237999999995,-0.082352702,-0.15819286800000001,0.073160284,-0.078103727,-0.078539338,0.057736672999999995,0.053524469000000005,0.010583917,-0.076734272,0.046522531,-0.077371009,0.014297424,-0.040255993,0.081126799,-0.11969594800000001,0.291605752,0.05005332,-0.027496946,0.044244615999999994
530,Development and evaluation of real-time PCR assays for the detection of the newly identified KI and WU polyomaviruses,"Abstract Background Recently, novel human polyomaviruses, KI (KIV) and WU (WUV) were described. Their role in human disease has not yet been determined. Objectives The aim of this study was to develop sensitive and specific assays for the detection of KIV and WUV. Study Two KIV (KI-A and KI-B) and three WUV (WU-A, WU-B and WU-C) real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) assays were developed and evaluated. Clinical sensitivities and specificities were determined by testing 200 respiratory specimens and the results compared to those for previously described conventional PCR assays. Limits of detection were determined, and the analytical specificities of the assays were investigated. Results No cross-reactivity was observed between the rtPCR methods and unrelated organisms. All five rtPCR assays could reliably detect 10 copies of genomic DNA equivalents per reaction, which was more sensitive than conventional methods. Compared to the conventional PCR assays, the sensitivity of the KI-A, KI-B, WU-A, WU-B and WU-C assays was 100%, 86.7% 95.5%, 100% and 100%, respectively. Specificity was 94.6%, 97.3%, 96.6%, 97.7% and 97.2%, respectively. Conclusions The KI-A, WU-B and WU-C assays provide the most sensitive detection of KIV and WUV in clinical specimens and may be used for further research into these viruses.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.034576033,0.023713252,0.10437052699999999,-0.002847513,-0.020824811000000002,-0.022047027,0.030505879,-0.012994516999999999,0.013348561,-0.013151821000000001,-0.029048217,0.035531306,0.021704815,-0.0077207740000000006,-0.00234078,0.002815948,-0.013750633,-0.014358223,0.012875302,-0.057254695999999994,0.018748872,-0.010042239,0.038200608999999996,-0.014999978,-0.012545538,-0.004128885,-0.024505198,-0.034561724,-0.016498701,-0.032368158
533,In situ reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (in situ RT-LAMP) for detection of Japanese encephalitis viral RNA in host cells,"Abstract Background Clinical diagnosis of Japanese encephalitis is usually difficult due to non-specific signs at the early and acute stages of the infection. Virus isolation from peripheral blood is also not possible because of the short period and low level of transient viremia even in the acute stage of the disease. It is thus urgent to develop a feasible and convenient method for laboratory diagnosis of the infection. Objectives To establish a newly designed molecular approach that can be used to detect intracellular Japanese encephalitis viral RNA in host cells. Study design The method was firstly established and then was carried out to test its efficacy in cultured BHK-21 cells, subsequently in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from mice that have been inoculated with JE virus suspension. Results In this study, in situ reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (in situ RT-LAMP) was established; which combines merits of recently developed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and in situ reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (in situ RT-PCR).

536,Evaluation of a rapid molecular algorithm for detection of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus and screening for a key oseltamivir resistance (H275Y) substitution in neuraminidase,"Abstract Background Rapid and specific molecular tests for identification of the recently identified pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus as well as rapid molecular tests to identify antiviral resistant strains are urgently needed. Objectives We have evaluated the performance of two novel reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) targeting specifically hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus in combination with a conserved matrix PCR. In addition, we investigated the performance of a novel discrimination RT-PCR for detection of the H275Y resistance mutation in the neuraminidase gene. Study design Clinical performance of both subtype specific RT-PCR assays was evaluated through analysis of 684 throat swaps collected from individuals meeting the WHO case definition for the novel pandemic influenza virus. Analytical performance was analyzed through testing of 10-fold serial dilutions of RNA derived from the first Dutch sequenced and cultured confirmed case of novel pandemic influenza infection. Specificity and discriminative capacities of the H275Y discrimination assay were performed by testing wild type and recombinant H275Y pandemic influenza. Results 121 throat swaps collected from April 2009 to July 2009 were positive by at least two out of three RT-PCRs, and negative for the seasonal H3/H1 subtype specific RT-PCR assays. 117 of these were tested positive for all three (Ct-values from 15.1 to 36.8). No oseltamivir resistance was detected.

549,Diagnostics-in-a-Suitcase: Development of a portable and rapid assay for the detection of the emerging avian influenza A (H7N9) virus,"Abstract Background In developing countries, equipment necessary for diagnosis is only available in few central laboratories, which are less accessible and of limited capacity to test large numbers of incoming samples. Moreover, the transport conditions of samples are inadequate, therefore leading to unreliable results. Objectives The development of a rapid, inexpensive, and simple test would allow mobile detection of viruses. Study design A suitcase laboratory “Diagnostics-in-a-Suitcase” (56cm×45.5cm×26.5cm) containing all reagents and devices necessary for performing a reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay was developed. As an example, two RT-RPA assays were established for the detection of hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) genes of the novel avian influenza (H7N9) virus. Results The sensitivities of the H7 and the N9 RT-RPA assays were 10 and 100 RNA molecules, respectively. The assays were performed at a single temperature (42°C). The results were obtained within 2–7min. The H7N9 RT-RPA assays did not show a cross-detection either of any other respiratory viruses affecting humans and/or birds or of the human or chicken genomes. All reagents were used, stored, and transported at ambient temperature, that is, cold chain independent. In addition, the Diagnostics-in-a-Suitcase was operated by a solar-powered battery. Conclusions The developed assay protocol and mobile setup performed well. Moreover, it can be easily implemented to perform diagnoses at airports, quarantine stations, or farms for rapid on-site viral nucleic acid detection.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.053765466,0.08702198400000001,0.282132638,0.16531937300000002,-0.050880882,-0.011839421999999999,0.024055953999999997,0.036501939,-0.015493203999999998,-0.039491052,-0.06704274,0.042299681,-0.027011123999999997,-0.031814275,-0.069982792,0.07842464,-0.05173719400000001,-0.067570706,0.118786045,0.210647843,0.062818115,-0.015468131000000001,-0.034877397000000004,-0.017518056,-0.091837875,0.053369447,0.062713575,0.016963905,0.050581777,-0.067925192
562,Methods to detect infectious human enteric viruses in environmental water samples,"Abstract Currently, a wide range of analytical methods is available for virus detection in environmental water samples. Molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) have the highest sensitivity and specificity to investigate virus contamination in water, so they are the most commonly used in environmental virology. Despite great sensitivity of PCR, the main limitation is the lack of the correlation between the detected viral genome and viral infectivity, which limits conclusions regarding the significance for public health. To provide information about the infectivity of the detected viruses, cultivation on animal cell culture is the gold standard. However, cell culture infectivity assays are laborious, time consuming and costly. Also, not all viruses are able to produce cytopathic effect and viruses such as human noroviruses have no available cell line for propagation. In this brief review, we present a summary and critical evaluation of different approaches that have been recently proposed to overcome limitations of the traditional cell culture assay and PCR assay such as integrated cell culture-PCR, detection of genome integrity, detection of capsid integrity, and measurement of oxidative damages on viral capsid protein. Techniques for rapid detection of infectious viruses such as fluorescence microscopy and automated flow cytometry have also been suggested to assess virus infectivity in water samples.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.026718968,0.029538044,0.182367346,0.073752922,-0.046083547999999995,0.005981323,0.067734255,-0.019277343,-0.008598473,0.084555061,-0.045833617,-0.07449632,0.07333838,0.016519685,0.069389198,-0.068907943,0.002343974,-0.038696199,0.00168208,-0.081589096,0.021967816,0.049898469,0.056796810999999996,-0.022361354,-0.065661097,0.021028494,0.050057627,-0.044756772,-0.07559555400000001,-0.010664903

Specific primers for each of the 3 RNA viruses, North American genotype porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and swine influenza virus, were used in the testing procedure. The assay was shown to be highly sensitive because it could detect as little as 10−5 ng of each of the respective amplicons in a single sample containing a composite of all 3 viruses. The assay was also effective in detecting one or more of the same viruses in various combinations in specimens, including lymph nodes, lungs, spleens, and tonsils, collected from clinically ill pigs and in spleen specimens collected from aborted pig fetuses. The results from the multiplex RT-PCR were confirmed by virus isolation.

640,Correlation of Chest CT and RT-PCR Testing in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China: A Report of 1014 Cases,"Background Chest CT is used for diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), as an important complement to the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. Purpose To investigate the diagnostic value and consistency of chest CT as compared with comparison to RT-PCR assay in COVID-19. Methods From January 6 to February 6, 2020, 1014 patients in Wuhan, China who underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR tests were included. With RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed. Besides, for patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the dynamic conversion of RT-PCR results (negative to positive, positive to negative, respectively) was analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans for those with time-interval of 4 days or more. Results Of 1014 patients, 59% (601/1014) had positive RT-PCR results, and 88% (888/1014) had positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97% (95%CI, 95-98%, 580/601 patients) based on positive RT-PCR results. In patients with negative RT-PCR results, 75% (308/413) had positive chest CT findings; of 308, 48% were considered as highly likely cases, with 33% as probable cases. By analysis of serial RT-PCR assays and CT scans, the mean interval time between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR results was 5.1 ± 1.5 days; the initial positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR result was 6.9 ± 2.3 days). 60% to 93% of cases had initial positive CT consistent with COVID-19 prior (or parallel) to the initial positive RT-PCR results. 42% (24/57) cases showed improvement in follow-up chest CT scans before the RT-PCR results turning negative.

In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of automating the serum RNA extraction procedure in order to increase the throughput of the assay. METHODS: An automated nucleic acid extraction platform using the MagNA Pure LC instrument (Roche Diagnostics) was evaluated. We developed a modified protocol in compliance with the recommended biosafety guidelines from the World Health Organization based on the use of the MagNA Pure total nucleic acid large volume isolation kit for the extraction of SARS-coronavirus RNA. The modified protocol was compared with a column-based extraction kit (QIAamp viral RNA mini kit, Qiagen) for quantitative performance, analytical sensitivity and precision. RESULTS: The newly developed automated protocol was shown to be free from carry-over contamination and have comparable performance with other standard protocols and kits designed for the MagNA Pure LC instrument. However, the automated method was found to be less sensitive, less precise and led to consistently lower serum SARS-coronavirus concentrations when compared with the column-based extraction method. CONCLUSION: As the diagnostic efficiency and prognostic value of the serum SARS-CoV RNA RT-PCR test is critically associated with the analytical sensitivity and quantitative performance contributed both by the RNA extraction and RT-PCR components of the test, we recommend the use of the column-based manual RNA extraction method.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.013750614,0.243963298,0.07432675,0.101395234,-0.067130782,-0.084521128,-0.024564836,-0.092342663,-0.071120418,0.002516261,0.025581855,-0.018609900000000002,0.032004861,-0.017952371,0.006930856,0.023738955,-0.012587311,-0.004919243,-0.010548898000000001,-0.077764607,-0.039593956,-0.014890595,0.020214725,-0.064487899,-0.025922962999999997,-0.032251615,0.009707001,-0.036542978999999996,-0.00660638,0.025527892000000003
666,Loop-mediated isothermal amplification as an emerging technology for detection of Yersinia ruckeri the causative agent of enteric red mouth disease in fish,"BACKGROUND: Enteric Redmouth (ERM) disease also known as Yersiniosis is a contagious disease affecting salmonids, mainly rainbow trout. The causative agent is the gram-negative bacterium Yersinia ruckeri. The disease can be diagnosed by isolation and identification of the causative agent, or detection of the Pathogen using fluorescent antibody tests, ELISA and PCR assays. These diagnostic methods are laborious, time consuming and need well trained personnel. RESULTS: A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed and evaluated for detection of Y. ruckeri the etiological agent of enteric red mouth (ERM) disease in salmonids. The assay was optimised to amplify the yruI/yruR gene, which encodes Y. ruckeri quorum sensing system, in the presence of a specific primer set and Bst DNA polymerase at an isothermal temperature of 63°C for one hour. Amplification products were detected by visual inspection, agarose gel electrophoresis and by real-time monitoring of turbidity resulted by formation of LAMP amplicons. Digestion with HphI restriction enzyme demonstrated that the amplified product was unique. The specificity of the assay was verified by the absence of amplification products when tested against related bacteria. The assay had 10-fold higher sensitivity compared with conventional PCR and successfully detected Y. ruckeri not only in pure bacterial culture but also in tissue homogenates of infected fish. CONCLUSION: The ERM-LAMP assay represents a practical alternative to the microbiological approach for rapid, sensitive and specific detection of Y. ruckeri in fish farms. The assay is carried out in one hour and needs only a heating block or water bath as laboratory furniture. The advantages of the ERM-LAMP assay make it a promising tool for molecular detection of enteric red mouth disease in fish farms.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.033453734,0.099470015,0.324310683,0.057014798,-0.071244617,-0.066731755,0.029699886,-0.010851137,-0.012249848999999998,-0.009831666999999999,-0.0746169,0.004629645,-0.008104945,-0.0042067879999999995,-0.07300914,0.032855776,0.009705861,0.034939183,-0.069839012,0.019796567,-0.072879038,-0.054789912999999996,0.004809451,0.113472454,0.056182311,0.015871022,-0.095902109,0.100175741,-0.08670400800000001,0.008863217
667,Phi29 polymerase based random amplification of viral RNA as an alternative to random RT-PCR,"BACKGROUND: Phi29 polymerase based amplification methods provides amplified DNA with minimal changes in sequence and relative abundance for many biomedical applications. RNA virus detection using microarrays, however, can present a challenge because phi29 DNA polymerase cannot amplify RNA nor small cDNA fragments (<2000 bases) obtained by reverse transcription of certain viral RNA genomes. Therefore, ligation of cDNA fragments is necessary prior phi29 polymerase based amplification. We adapted the QuantiTect Whole Transcriptome Kit (Qiagen) to our purposes and designated the method as Whole Transcriptome Amplification (WTA). RESULTS: WTA successfully amplified cDNA from a panel of RNA viruses representing the diversity of ribovirus genome sizes. We amplified a range of genome copy numbers from 15 to 4 × 10(7 )using WTA, which yielded quantities of amplified DNA as high as 1.2 μg/μl or 10(10 )target copies. The amplification factor varied between 10(9 )and 10(6). We also demonstrated that co-amplification occurred when viral RNA was mixed with bacterial DNA. CONCLUSION: This is the first report in the scientific literature showing that a modified WGA (WTA) approach can be successfully applied to viral genomic RNA of all sizes.

672,Detection of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) using isothermal amplification of target DNA sequences,"BACKGROUND: The most common method of GMO detection is based upon the amplification of GMO-specific DNA amplicons using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Here we have applied the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method to amplify GMO-related DNA sequences, 'internal' commonly-used motifs for controlling transgene expression and event-specific (plant-transgene) junctions. RESULTS: We have tested the specificity and sensitivity of the technique for use in GMO studies. Results show that detection of 0.01% GMO in equivalent background DNA was possible and dilutions of template suggest that detection from single copies of the template may be possible using LAMP. CONCLUSION: This work shows that GMO detection can be carried out using LAMP for routine screening as well as for specific events detection. Moreover, the sensitivity and ability to amplify targets, even with a high background of DNA, here demonstrated, highlights the advantages of this isothermal amplification when applied for GMO detection.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.006903595,0.075444115,0.307096755,0.083706135,-0.09078371,-0.070123348,0.058615032000000004,0.007659438,-0.024052663999999998,-0.021120222,-0.107166825,0.010562048000000001,0.027878548,-0.072744435,-0.099876138,0.102296842,-0.040933921,-0.005584493,-0.106757251,-0.009717053,-0.140550772,-0.08603969300000001,-0.024899054,0.132723208,0.05590264599999999,-0.058213836,-0.16923323199999998,0.159962635,-0.103095249,0.035613655
674,Rapid and High-Throughput pan-Orthopoxvirus Detection and Identification using PCR and Mass Spectrometry,"The genus Orthopoxvirus contains several species of related viruses, including the causative agent of smallpox (Variola virus). In addition to smallpox, several other members of the genus are capable of causing human infection, including monkeypox, cowpox, and other zoonotic rodent-borne poxviruses. Therefore, a single assay that can accurately identify all orthopoxviruses could provide a valuable tool for rapid broad orthopovirus identification. We have developed a pan-Orthopoxvirus assay for identification of all members of the genus based on four PCR reactions targeting Orthopoxvirus DNA and RNA helicase and polymerase genes. The amplicons are detected using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) on the Ibis T5000 system. We demonstrate that the assay can detect and identify a diverse collection of orthopoxviruses, provide sub-species information and characterize viruses from the blood of rabbitpox infected rabbits.

678,Development of a fluorescent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection of Goose parvovirus in vivo,"BACKGROUND: Goose parvovirus (GPV) is a Dependovirus associated with latent infection and mortality in geese. Currently, it severely affects geese production worldwide. The objective of this study was to develop a fluorescent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (FQ-PCR) assay for fast and accurate quantification of GPV DNA in infected goslings, which can aid in the understanding of the regular distribution pattern and the nosogenesis of GPV in vivo. RESULTS: The detection limit of the assay was 2.8 × 10(1 )standard DNA copies, with a sensitivity of 3 logs higher than that of the conventional gel-based PCR assay targeting the same gene. The real-time PCR was reproducible, as shown by satisfactory low intraassay and interassay coefficients of variation.

704,Real-world comparison of two molecular methods for detection of respiratory viruses,"BACKGROUND: Molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assays are increasingly used to diagnose viral respiratory infections and conduct epidemiology studies. Molecular assays have generally been evaluated by comparing them to conventional direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) or viral culture techniques, with few published direct comparisons between molecular methods or between institutions. We sought to perform a real-world comparison of two molecular respiratory viral diagnostic methods between two experienced respiratory virus research laboratories. METHODS: We tested nasal and throat swab specimens obtained from 225 infants with respiratory illness for 11 common respiratory viruses using both a multiplex assay (Respiratory MultiCode-PLx Assay [RMA]) and individual real-time RT-PCR (RT-rtPCR). RESULTS: Both assays detected viruses in more than 70% of specimens, but there was discordance. The RMA assay detected significantly more human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), while RT-rtPCR detected significantly more influenza A. We speculated that primer differences accounted for these discrepancies and redesigned the primers and probes for influenza A in the RMA assay, and for HMPV and RSV in the RT-rtPCR assay. The tests were then repeated and again compared. The new primers led to improved detection of HMPV and RSV by RT-rtPCR assay, but the RMA assay remained similar in terms of influenza detection. CONCLUSIONS: Given the absence of a gold standard, clinical and research laboratories should regularly correlate the results of molecular assays with other PCR based assays, other laboratories, and with standard virologic methods to ensure consistency and accuracy.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.23016805899999998,0.018368427,0.178597266,0.24806934,-0.006491312,-0.070728376,0.011898200000000001,-0.084744943,0.10841390699999999,-0.041260936,-0.006572963,-0.062410626,-0.037421215,0.051339157,-0.062254558,-0.078219855,0.047404540999999994,0.086039524,-0.036399189,-0.032395412,0.10657814,-0.055775135999999996,0.04705708,-0.074010075,0.00030898,-0.021511189,0.049056379000000004,-0.064960762,0.010743896000000001,-0.047414427

We have established such a diagnostic platform for random amplification and subsequent microarray identification of viral pathogens in clinical samples. We show that Phi29 polymerase-amplification of a diverse set of clinical samples generates enough viral material for successful identification by the Microbial Detection Array, demonstrating the potential of the microarray technique for broad-spectrum pathogen detection.

707,"FilmArray, an Automated Nested Multiplex PCR System for Multi-Pathogen Detection: Development and Application to Respiratory Tract Infection","The ideal clinical diagnostic system should deliver rapid, sensitive, specific and reproducible results while minimizing the requirements for specialized laboratory facilities and skilled technicians. We describe an integrated diagnostic platform, the “FilmArray”, which fully automates the detection and identification of multiple organisms from a single sample in about one hour. An unprocessed biologic/clinical sample is subjected to nucleic acid purification, reverse transcription, a high-order nested multiplex polymerase chain reaction and amplicon melt curve analysis. Biochemical reactions are enclosed in a disposable pouch, minimizing the PCR contamination risk. FilmArray has the potential to detect greater than 100 different nucleic acid targets at one time. These features make the system well-suited for molecular detection of infectious agents. Validation of the FilmArray technology was achieved through development of a panel of assays capable of identifying 21 common viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. Initial testing of the system using both cultured organisms and clinical nasal aspirates obtained from children demonstrated an analytical and clinical sensitivity and specificity comparable to existing diagnostic platforms.

712,Rapid detection of wheat yellow mosaic virus by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification,"For the detection of wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV), we established a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method. Using Primer Explorer software, four sets of primers were designed and RT-LAMP assay reaction conditions were optimized. The RT-LAMP was performed at different times by four primer sets. Agarose gel analysis showed that WYMV could be detected after 30 min with the primer set III and after 45 min with the other three primer sets, both under the 80-min reaction time. RT-LAMP had the same results with the four primer sets, thus primer set III and 65°C for 80 min reaction were selected for virus detection. There was no significant different when avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) and moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) RT-LAMP with the four primer sets and M-MLV was chosen due to its relatively cheap price. The result on specificity showed that the assay could amplify WYMV specifically, and the sensitivity comparison showed that the RT-LAMP was 100 times more sensitive than conventional reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

716,A Family-Wide RT-PCR Assay for Detection of Paramyxoviruses and Application to a Large-Scale Surveillance Study,"Family-wide molecular diagnostic assays are valuable tools for initial identification of viruses during outbreaks and to limit costs of surveillance studies. Recent discoveries of paramyxoviruses have called for such assay that is able to detect all known and unknown paramyxoviruses in one round of PCR amplification. We have developed a RT-PCR assay consisting of a single degenerate primer set, able to detect all members of the Paramyxoviridae family including all virus genera within the subfamilies Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae. Primers anneal to domain III of the polymerase gene, with the 3′ end of the reverse primer annealing to the conserved motif GDNQ, which is proposed to be the active site for nucleotide polymerization. The assay was fully optimized and was shown to indeed detect all available paramyxoviruses tested. Clinical specimens from hospitalized patients that tested positive for known paramyxoviruses in conventional assays were also detected with the novel family-wide test. A high-throughput fluorescence-based RT-PCR version of the assay was developed for screening large numbers of specimens. A large number of samples collected from wild birds was tested, resulting in the detection of avian paramyxoviruses type 1 in both barnacle and white-fronted geese, and type 8 in barnacle geese. Avian metapneumovirus type C was found for the first time in Europe in mallards, greylag geese and common gulls.

728,Visual detection of the human metapneumovirus using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification with hydroxynaphthol blue dye,"BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a major cause of acute respiratory infections ranging from wheezing to bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children worldwide. The objective of this study is to develop a visual reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the detection of hMPV and applied to the clinical samples. RESULTS: In this study, visual RT-LAMP assay for hMPV was performed in one step with the addition of hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB), and were used to detect respiratory samples. Six primers, including two outer primers (F3 and B3), two inner primers (FIP, BIP) and two loop primers (LF and LB), were designed for hMPV N gene by the online software. Moreover, the RT-LAMP assay showed good specificity and no cross-reactivity was observed with human rhinovirus (HRV), human respiratory syncytial Virus (RSV), or influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). The detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was approximately ten viral RNA copies, lower than that of traditional reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 100 RNA copies. In the 176 nasopharyngeal samples, 23 (13.1%) were conformed as hMPV positive by RT-LAMP, but 18 (10.2%) positive by RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional RT-PCR, the visual hMPV RT-LAMP assay performed well in the aspect of detect time, sensitivity, specificity and visibility.

746,Real-Time Fluorescence Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification for the Detection of Acinetobacter baumannii,"BACKGROUND: Detection of Acinetobacter baumannii has been relying primarily on bacterial culture that often fails to return useful results in time. Although DNA-based assays are more sensitive than bacterial culture in detecting the pathogen, the molecular results are often inconsistent and challenged by doubts on false positives, such as those due to system- and environment-derived contaminations. In addition, these molecular tools require expensive laboratory instruments. Therefore, establishing molecular tools for field use require simpler molecular platforms. The loop-mediated isothermal amplification method is relatively simple and can be improved for better use in a routine clinical bacteriology laboratory. A simple and portable device capable of performing both the amplification and detection (by fluorescence) of LAMP in the same platform has been developed in recent years. This method is referred to as real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification. In this study, we attempted to utilize this method for rapid detection of A. baumannii. METHODOLOGY AND SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS: Species-specific primers were designed to test the utility of this method. Clinical samples of A. baumannii were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of this system compared to bacterial culture and a polymerase chain reaction method. All positive samples isolated from sputum were confirmed to be the species of Acinetobacter by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The RealAmp method was found to be simpler and allowed real-time detection of DNA amplification, and could distinguish A. baumannii from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Acinetobacter genomic species 3. DNA was extracted by simple boiling method. Compared to bacterial culture, the sensitivity and specificity of RealAmp in detecting A. baumannii was 98.9% and 75.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The RealAmp assay only requires a single unit, and the assay positivity can be verified by visual inspection. Therefore, this assay has great potential of field use as a molecular tool for detection of A. baumannii.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.034237848,0.073105389,0.249621591,0.038590634,-0.06608423599999999,-0.043173866,0.054530113,0.018275418999999998,-0.043785422000000004,0.014855162,-0.09294388,-0.010523923999999999,0.039581134,-0.082444215,-0.046719432000000005,0.045279167,-0.046322089000000004,-0.00155237,-0.04080659,0.00443201,-0.059711235,-0.049577240999999994,0.053320455999999995,0.0047022,-0.0045298859999999995,-0.017810165,-0.08296589,0.069060621,-0.05329194,0.04106166
789,Rapid Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by Recombinase Polymerase Amplification,"Improved access to effective tests for diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) has been designated a public health priority by the World Health Organisation. In high burden TB countries nucleic acid based TB tests have been restricted to centralised laboratories and specialised research settings. Requirements such as a constant electrical supply, air conditioning and skilled, computer literate operators prevent implementation of such tests in many settings. Isothermal DNA amplification technologies permit the use of simpler, less energy intensive detection platforms more suited to low resource settings that allow the accurate diagnosis of a disease within a short timeframe. Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) is a rapid, low temperature isothermal DNA amplification reaction. We report here RPA-based detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) DNA in <20 minutes at 39°C. Assays for two MTC specific targets were investigated, IS6110 and IS1081. When testing purified MTC genomic DNA, limits of detection of 6.25 fg (IS6110) and 20 fg (IS1081)were consistently achieved. When testing a convenience sample of pulmonary specimens from suspected TB patients, RPA demonstrated superior accuracy to indirect fluorescence microscopy. Compared to culture, sensitivities for the IS1081 RPA and microscopy were 91.4% (95%CI: 85, 97.9) and 86.1% (95%CI: 78.1, 94.1) respectively (n = 71). Specificities were 100% and 88.6% (95% CI: 80.8, 96.1) respectively. For the IS6110 RPA and microscopy sensitivities of 87.5% (95%CI: 81.7, 93.2) and 70.8% (95%CI: 62.9, 78.7) were obtained (n = 90). Specificities were 95.4 (95% CI: 92.3,98.1) and 88% (95% CI: 83.6, 92.4) respectively. The superior specificity of RPA for detecting tuberculosis was due to the reduced ability of fluorescence microscopy to distinguish Mtb complex from other acid fast bacteria. The rapid nature of the RPA assay and its low energy requirement compared to other amplification technologies suggest RPA-based TB assays could be of use for integration into a point-of-care test for use in resource constrained settings.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.045209267000000004,0.035692144,0.18091507399999998,-0.0024767689999999998,-0.10419266,-0.027185489,0.039448555,0.034680132,-0.051290608,-0.1023582,-0.088454718,0.10131350300000001,-0.038099372,-0.18594148800000002,-0.147693957,0.18878213,-0.15893686099999998,-0.130613314,0.16017007800000002,0.177276618,-0.080048765,0.011549249,0.053146288,-0.046529299,-0.074485056,-0.010562159,-0.00833553,-0.162604848,-0.06647034,-0.032593309
792,Rapid and sensitive detection of canine distemper virus by one-tube reverse transcription-insulated isothermal polymerase chain reaction,"BACKGROUND: Canine distemper virus (CDV) has been associated with outbreaks of canine infectious respiratory disease in shelters and boarding kennel environments. POCKIT(TM) Nucleic Acid Analyzer is a field-deployable device capable of generating automatically interpreted insulated isothermal polymerase chain reaction (iiPCR) results from extracted nucleic acid within one hour. In this study, reverse transcription iiPCR (RT-iiPCR) was developed to facilitate point-of-need diagnosis of CDV infection. RESULTS: Analytical sensitivity (limit of detection 95%) of the established CDV RT-iiPCR was about 11 copies of in vitro transcribed RNA per reaction. CDV RT-iiPCR generated positive signals from CDV, but not Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine parvovirus, canine herpesvirus, canine adenovirus 2, canine influenza virus (subtype H3N8), canine parainfluenza virus, and canine respiratory coronavirus. To evaluate accuracy of the established reaction in canine distemper clinical diagnosis, 110 specimens from dogs, raccoons, and foxes suspected with CDV infection were tested simultaneously by CDV RT-iiPCR and real-time RT-PCR. CDV RT-iiPCR demonstrated excellent sensitivity (100%) and specificity (100%), compared to real-time RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated an excellent correlation between RT-iiPCR and a reference real time RT-PCR method.

800,Isothermal Amplification Methods for the Detection of Nucleic Acids in Microfluidic Devices,"Diagnostic tools for biomolecular detection need to fulfill specific requirements in terms of sensitivity, selectivity and high-throughput in order to widen their applicability and to minimize the cost of the assay. The nucleic acid amplification is a key step in DNA detection assays. It contributes to improving the assay sensitivity by enabling the detection of a limited number of target molecules. The use of microfluidic devices to miniaturize amplification protocols reduces the required sample volume and the analysis times and offers new possibilities for the process automation and integration in one single device. The vast majority of miniaturized systems for nucleic acid analysis exploit the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification method, which requires repeated cycles of three or two temperature-dependent steps during the amplification of the nucleic acid target sequence. In contrast, low temperature isothermal amplification methods have no need for thermal cycling thus requiring simplified microfluidic device features.

820,Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Assay for Rapid Diagnostics of Dengue Infection,"BACKGROUND: Over 2.5 billion people are exposed to the risk of contracting dengue fever (DF). Early diagnosis of DF helps to diminish its burden on public health. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase amplification assays (RT-PCR) are the standard method for molecular detection of the dengue virus (DENV). Real-time RT-PCR analysis is not suitable for on-site screening since mobile devices are large, expensive, and complex. In this study, two RT-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assays were developed to detect DENV1-4. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using two quantitative RNA molecular standards, the analytical sensitivity of a RT-RPA targeting the 3´non-translated region of DENV1-4 was found to range from 14 (DENV4) to 241 (DENV1-3) RNA molecules detected. The assay was specific and did not cross detect other Flaviviruses. The RT-RPA assay was tested in a mobile laboratory combining magnetic-bead based total nucleic acid extraction and a portable detection device in Kedougou (Senegal) and in Bangkok (Thailand). In Kedougou, the RT-RPA was operated at an ambient temperature of 38°C with auxiliary electricity tapped from a motor vehicle and yielded a clinical sensitivity and specificity of 98% (n=31) and 100% (n=23), respectively. While in the field trial in Bangkok, the clinical sensitivity and specificity were 72% (n=90) and 100%(n=41), respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: During the first 5 days of infection, the developed DENV1-4 RT-RPA assays constitute a suitable accurate and rapid assay for DENV diagnosis. Moreover, the use of a portable fluorescence-reading device broadens its application potential to the point-of-care for outbreak investigations.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.051419455,0.163647207,0.386926472,0.160980395,-0.086843893,-0.106116476,0.021458752999999997,0.04677550900000001,-0.037089952,-0.108257929,-0.063667994,0.062190608,-0.061831275,-0.021961618,-0.117294984,0.097714164,-0.019121201,-0.031145186000000002,0.12769340699999998,0.202283815,0.047234904,-0.001625752,-0.051318917,-0.048327745,-0.049196755,0.09216594800000001,0.117056555,0.000816213,0.076662657,-0.037865468
825,Development of Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Assays for Detection of Orientia tsutsugamushi or Rickettsia typhi,"Sensitive, specific and rapid diagnostic tests for the detection of Orientia tsutsugamushi (O. tsutsugamushi) and Rickettsia typhi (R. typhi), the causative agents of scrub typhus and murine typhus, respectively, are necessary to accurately and promptly diagnose patients and ensure that they receive proper treatment. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assays using a lateral flow test (RPA-nfo) and real-time fluorescent detection (RPA-exo) were developed targeting the 47-kDa gene of O. tsutsugamushi or 17 kDa gene of R. typhi. The RPA assay was capable of detecting O. tsutsugamushi or R. typhi at levels comparable to that of the quantitative PCR method. Both the RPA-nfo and RPA-exo methods performed similarly with regards to sensitivity when detecting the 17 kDa gene of R. typhi. On the contrary, RPA-exo performed better than RPA-nfo in detecting the 47 kDa gene of O. tsutsugamushi. The clinical performance of the O. tsutsugamushi RPA assay was evaluated using either human patient samples or infected mouse samples. Eight out of ten PCR confirmed positives were determined positive by RPA, and all PCR confirmed negative samples were negative by RPA. Similar results were obtained for R. typhi spiked patient sera. The assays were able to differentiate O. tsutsugamushi and R. typhi from other phylogenetically related bacteria as well as mouse and human DNA. Furthermore, the RPA-nfo reaction was completed in 20 minutes at 37(o)C followed by a 10 minute incubation at room temperature for development of an immunochromatographic strip. The RPA-exo reaction was completed in 20 minutes at 39(o)C. The implementation of a cross contamination proof cassette to detect the RPA-nfo fluorescent amplicons provided an alternative to regular lateral flow detection strips, which are more prone to cross contamination. The RPA assays provide a highly time-efficient, sensitive and specific alternative to other methods for diagnosing scrub typhus or murine typhus.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.014190831000000001,0.076026152,0.241499758,0.021187717000000002,-0.075121294,-0.052052580999999994,0.025575679,0.045954975,-0.01745787,-0.10488506800000001,-0.10888546699999999,0.052387859,-0.038588322,-0.085826561,-0.10122386900000001,0.118679431,-0.07841954599999999,-0.118944934,0.24970710100000001,0.295173118,0.144627007,-0.005868098,0.021798021,-0.111790006,-0.130221132,0.09400198400000001,0.07413803299999999,0.00892099,0.09827491199999999,-0.056053769
853,A Rapid and Low-Cost PCR Thermal Cycler for Infectious Disease Diagnostics,"The ability to make rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases broadly available in a portable, low-cost format would mark a great step forward in global health. Many molecular diagnostic assays are developed based on using thermal cyclers to carry out polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse-transcription PCR for DNA and RNA amplification and detection, respectively. Unfortunately, most commercial thermal cyclers are expensive and need continuous electrical power supply, so they are not suitable for uses in low-resource settings. We have previously reported a low-cost and simple approach to amplify DNA using vacuum insulated stainless steel thermoses food cans, which we have named it thermos thermal cycler or TTC. Here, we describe the use of an improved set up to enable the detection of viral RNA targets by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), thus expanding the TTC’s ability to identify highly infectious, RNA virus-based diseases in low resource settings. The TTC was successful in demonstrating high-speed and sensitive detection of DNA or RNA targets of sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, and dengue fever. Our innovative TTC costs less than $200 to build and has a capacity of at least eight tubes. In terms of speed, the TTC’s performance exceeded that of commercial thermal cyclers tested. When coupled with low-cost endpoint detection technologies such as nucleic acid lateral-flow assay or a cell-phone-based fluorescence detector, the TTC will increase the availability of on-site molecular diagnostics in low-resource settings.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.030098167999999998,0.059400789,0.202927845,0.087263828,-0.079807208,-0.02713597,0.059551433,0.024520296,-0.01373485,0.066111995,-0.011290882,-0.002725296,0.058975501,-0.080150413,-0.018615742,0.052524512,-0.06092795,0.0066024709999999995,-0.045647117,-0.03572971,-0.044755860999999994,-0.025620005,0.016763521,-0.072757242,-0.037386816,-0.038452797999999996,-0.017555219,-0.00671512,-0.03635781,0.041638842999999995
865,Detection of Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin gene in lambs by loop mediated isothermal amplification,"AIM: The loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was standardized for rapid detection of Clostridium perfringens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 120 fecal samples were collected from enterotoxemia suspected lambs were used for screening of C. perfringens cpa gene by LAMP. The specificity of the LAMP amplified products was tested by digesting with restriction enzyme XmnI for alpha toxin gene. RESULTS: Out of 120 samples screened 112 (93.3%) samples were positive by both LAMP and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of cpa gene which indicated the equal sensitivity of both the tests. The enzyme produced single cut in 162 base pair amplified product of alpha toxin gene at 81 base pair resulting in a single band in gel electrophoresis. CONCLUSION: Both LAMP and PCR for detection of cpa gene indicated the equal sensitivity of both the tests. Standardization of LAMP reaction for amplification of epsilon and beta toxin genes will help to identify the C. perfringens toxin types from the clinical samples. The test could be a suitable alternative to the PCR in detection of toxin types without the help of sophisticated machinery like thermal cycler.

METHODS: In this study, an easy-to-perform SYBR green I real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the nucleocapsid gene of IBV was developed and compared with conventional agarose gel-based RT-PCR for the detection of IBV infection. RESULTS: We found that the SYBR green I real-time RT-PCR was at least 10 times more sensitive than the agarose gel electrophoresis detection method. The assay exhibited high specificity for IBV infection. All negative controls, such as Newcastle disease virus, infectious bursal disease virus, and avian influenza virus, were not detected. CONCLUSION: The SYBR green I real-time RT-PCR test described herein can be used to rapidly distinguish IBV from other respiratory pathogens, which is important for diagnosis and control of infectious bronchitis outbreaks in Morocco.

873,Development of a Rapid Point-of-Use DNA Test for the Screening of Genuity® Roundup Ready 2 Yield® Soybean in Seed Samples,"Testing for the presence of genetically modified material in seed samples is of critical importance for all stakeholders in the agricultural industry, including growers, seed manufacturers, and regulatory bodies. While rapid antibody-based testing for the transgenic protein has fulfilled this need in the past, the introduction of new variants of a given transgene demands new diagnostic regimen that allows distinguishing different traits at the nucleic acid level. Although such molecular tests can be performed by PCR in the laboratory, their requirement for expensive equipment and sophisticated operation have prevented its uptake in point-of-use applications. A recently developed isothermal DNA amplification technique, recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), combines simple sample preparation and amplification work-flow procedures with the use of minimal detection equipment in real time.

883,"Integrated Microfluidic Nucleic Acid Isolation, Isothermal Amplification, and Amplicon Quantification","Microfluidic components and systems for rapid (<60 min), low-cost, convenient, field-deployable sequence-specific nucleic acid-based amplification tests (NAATs) are described. A microfluidic point-of-care (POC) diagnostics test to quantify HIV viral load from blood samples serves as a representative and instructive example to discuss the technical issues and capabilities of “lab on a chip” NAAT devices. A portable, miniaturized POC NAAT with performance comparable to conventional PCR (polymerase-chain reaction)-based tests in clinical laboratories can be realized with a disposable, palm-sized, plastic microfluidic chip in which: (1) nucleic acids (NAs) are extracted from relatively large (~mL) volume sample lysates using an embedded porous silica glass fiber or cellulose binding phase (“membrane”) to capture sample NAs in a flow-through, filtration mode; (2) NAs captured on the membrane are isothermally (~65 °C) amplified; (3) amplicon production is monitored by real-time fluorescence detection, such as with a smartphone CCD camera serving as a low-cost detector; and (4) paraffin-encapsulated, lyophilized reagents for temperature-activated release are pre-stored in the chip. Limits of Detection (LOD) better than 10(3) virons/sample can be achieved. A modified chip with conduits hosting a diffusion-mode amplification process provides a simple visual indicator to readily quantify sample NA template. In addition, a companion microfluidic device for extracting plasma from whole blood without a centrifuge, generating cell-free plasma for chip-based molecular diagnostics, is described.

895,Recombinase polymerase amplification assay for rapid detection of lumpy skin disease virus,"BACKGROUND: Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) is a Capripoxvirus infecting cattle and Buffalos. Lumpy skin disease (LSD) leads to significant economic losses due to hide damage, reduction of milk production, mastitis, infertility and mortalities (10 %). Early detection of the virus is crucial to start appropriate outbreak control measures. Veterinarians rely on the presence of the characteristic clinical signs of LSD. Laboratory diagnostics including virus isolation, sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are performed at well-equipped laboratories. In this study, a portable, simple, and rapid recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay for the detection of LSDV-genome for the use on farms was developed. RESULTS: The LSDV RPA assay was performed at 42 °C and detected down to 179 DNA copies/reaction in a maximum of 15 min. Unspecific amplification was observed with neither LSDV-negative samples (n = 12) nor nucleic acid preparations from orf virus, bovine papular stomatitis virus, cowpoxvirus, Peste des petits ruminants and Blue tongue virus (serotypes 1, 6 and 8). The clinical sensitivity of the LSDV RPA assay matched 100 % (n = 22) to real-time PCR results. In addition, the LSDV RPA assay detected sheep and goat poxviruses. CONCLUSION: The LSDV RPA assay is a rapid and sensitive test that could be implemented in field or at quarantine stations for the identification of LSDV infected case.

901,Assay optimization for molecular detection of Zika virus,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the diagnostic performance of real-time reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for Zika virus detection. METHODS: We compared seven published real-time RT–PCR assays and two new assays that we have developed. To determine the analytical sensitivity of each assay, we constructed a synthetic universal control ribonucleic acid (uncRNA) containing all of the assays’ target regions on one RNA strand and spiked human blood or urine with known quantities of African or Asian Zika virus strains. Viral loads in 33 samples from Zika virus-infected patients were determined by using one of the new assays. FINDINGS: Oligonucleotides of the published real-time RT–PCR assays, showed up to 10 potential mismatches with the Asian lineage causing the current outbreak, compared with 0 to 4 mismatches for the new assays. The 95% lower detection limit of the seven most sensitive assays ranged from 2.1 to 12.1 uncRNA copies/reaction. Two assays had lower sensitivities of 17.0 and 1373.3 uncRNA copies/reaction and showed a similar sensitivity when using spiked samples. The mean viral loads in samples from Zika virus-infected patients were 5 × 10(4) RNA copies/mL of blood and 2 × 10(4) RNA copies/mL of urine. CONCLUSION: We provide reagents and updated protocols for Zika virus detection suitable for the current outbreak strains. Some published assays might be unsuitable for Zika virus detection, due to the limited sensitivity and potential incompatibility with some strains. Viral concentrations in the clinical samples were close to the technical detection limit, suggesting that the use of insensitive assays will cause false-negative results.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.043963607,0.084749092,0.19708393300000002,0.086995492,-0.026924952000000002,-0.059583047,0.003446419,0.00965949,-0.039760131000000004,0.012075515,-0.001713174,0.00065273,-0.005723672,0.06560061,0.011668648,-0.042185427000000005,-0.005702252,0.000756991,0.045303625,-0.026898063,0.012748352,0.031721429,0.022496107999999997,0.002602287,-0.051787498,-0.014768238000000001,0.061272467000000004,-0.046272619,-0.039264556,0.0479695
902,Single Fluorescence Channel-based Multiplex Detection of Avian Influenza Virus by Quantitative PCR with Intercalating Dye,"Since its invention in 1985 the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become a well-established method for amplification and detection of segments of double-stranded DNA. Incorporation of fluorogenic probe or DNA intercalating dyes (such as SYBR Green) into the PCR mixture allowed real-time reaction monitoring and extraction of quantitative information (qPCR). Probes with different excitation spectra enable multiplex qPCR of several DNA segments using multi-channel optical detection systems. Here we show multiplex qPCR using an economical EvaGreen-based system with single optical channel detection. Previously reported non quantitative multiplex real-time PCR techniques based on intercalating dyes were conducted once the PCR is completed by performing melting curve analysis (MCA). The technique presented in this paper is both qualitative and quantitative as it provides information about the presence of multiple DNA strands as well as the number of starting copies in the tested sample. Besides important internal control, multiplex qPCR also allows detecting concentrations of more than one DNA strand within the same sample. Detection of the avian influenza virus H7N9 by PCR is a well established method. Multiplex qPCR greatly enhances its specificity as it is capable of distinguishing both haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes as well as their ratio.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.032769836000000004,0.042472157,0.232443963,0.080213226,-0.050252777,0.018578698,0.017374996,-0.000500606,-0.030918335,0.019312849,-0.041207495,-0.02841023,0.054483443,-0.028184099,0.023221511,0.01168638,-0.016628239,-0.074610472,-0.016812392,-0.120380932,-0.031701353,0.004747404,0.053475775999999996,-0.052700185,-0.074035262,-0.06603328900000001,-0.047864674,0.01840746,-0.00010105200000000001,0.030483582999999998

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a recently developed approach to identify herbal medicine species. This novel molecular biology technique enables timely and accurate testing, especially in settings where infrastructures to support polymerase chain reaction facilities are lacking. Studies that used this method have altered our view on the extent and complexity of herbal medicine identification. In this review, we give an introduction into LAMP analysis, covers the basic principles and important aspects in the development of LAMP analysis method. Then we presented a critical review of the application of LAMP-based methods in detecting and identifying raw medicinal plant materials and their processed products.

907,"Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Assay—A Simple, Fast and Cost-Effective Alternative to Real Time PCR for Specific Detection of Feline Herpesvirus-1","Feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), an enveloped dsDNA virus, is one of the major pathogens of feline upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) and ocular disease. Currently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) remains the gold standard diagnostic tool for FHV-1 infection but is relatively expensive, requires well-equipped laboratories and is not suitable for field tests. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), an isothermal gene amplification technology, has been explored for the molecular diagnosis of infectious diseases. In this study, an exo-RPA assay for FHV-1 detection was developed and validated. Primers targeting specifically the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of FHV-1 were designed. The RPA reaction was performed successfully at 39°C and the results were obtained within 20 min. Using different copy numbers of recombinant plasmid DNA that contains the TK gene as template, we showed the detection limit of exo-RPA was 10(2) copies DNA/reaction, the same as that of real time PCR. The exo-RPA assay did not cross-detect feline panleukopenia virus, feline calicivirus, bovine herpesvirus-1, pseudorabies virus or chlamydia psittaci, a panel of pathogens important in feline URTD or other viruses in Alphaherpesvirinae, demonstrating high specificity. The assay was validated by testing 120 nasal and ocular conjunctival swabs of cats, and the results were compared with those obtained with real-time PCR. Both assays provided the same testing results in the clinical samples. Compared with real time PCR, the exo-RPA assay uses less-complex equipment that is portable and the reaction is completed much faster. Additionally, commercial RPA reagents in vacuum-sealed pouches can tolerate temperatures up to room temperature for days without loss of activity, suitable for shipment and storage for field tests. Taken together, the exo-RPA assay is a simple, fast and cost-effective alternative to real time PCR, suitable for use in less advanced laboratories and for field detection of FHV-1 infection.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.045026745,0.09078032400000001,0.299336919,0.031347989,-0.069716241,-0.055585447999999996,0.046816129000000005,0.029950834,-0.01114322,-0.084184081,0.020849052,-0.012779796000000001,0.049436294000000006,-0.080591395,-0.106476573,0.074930284,-0.056418397,-0.10111820199999999,0.213603197,0.250577524,0.11850141300000001,-0.01849219,0.044361897000000004,-0.112296964,-0.125044541,0.07195212200000001,0.04811501,0.015301094,0.080233843,-0.03787627
909,One-Pot Reverse Transcriptional Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) for Detecting MERS-CoV,"Due to the limitation of rapid development of specific antiviral drug or vaccine for novel emerging viruses, an accurate and rapid diagnosis is a key to manage the virus spread. We developed an efficient and rapid method with high specificity for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), based on one-pot reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (one-pot RT-LAMP). A set of six LAMP primers [F3, B3, FIP, BIP, LF (Loop-F), and LB (Loop-B)] were designed using the sequence of nucleocapsid (N) gene with optimized RT-LAMP enzyme conditions: 100 U M-MLV RTase and 4 U Bst polymerase, implying that the reaction was able to detect four infectious viral genome copies of MERS-CoV within a 60 min reaction time period. Significantly, EvaGreen dye has better signal read-out properties in one-pot RT-LAMP reaction and is more compatible with DNA polymerase than SYBR green I. Isothermally amplified specific N genes were further evaluated using field-deployable microchamber devices, leading to the specific identification of as few as 0.4 infectious viral genome copies, with no cross-reaction to the other acute respiratory disease viruses, including influenza type A (H1N1 and H3N2), type B, human coronavirus 229E, and human metapneumovirus.

914,"Prevalence of avian infectious bronchitis virus in broiler chicken farms in south of Iraq, 2014 – 2015","Avian infectious bronchitis (IB), caused by a gammacoronavirus, is an OIE-listed (List B) disease and characterized by respiratory and renal involvements, causing high mortality, and economic loss in both layers and broilers. In comparison with other diagnostic methods, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and conventional RT-PCR are potent, more sensitive and faster techniques for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) detection. This research was conducted to detect IBV using specific primers of IB in three governorates (Basra, Thi-Qar and Muthana) in the south of Iraq. Tracheal specimens were collected from 46 IB suspected commercial broiler flocks. XCE2+ and XCE2- Primers, which amplify all IBV serotypes, were used. Primers MCE1+, BCE1+ and DCE1+ were used to amplify the specific nucleotide sequences of Massachusetts, 793/B and D274 genotypes, respectively. The results of real-time RT-PCR of this study showed that 34 (74.00%) out of 46 infected flocks were positive to IBV. The results of nested PCR showed that 50.00% and 5.89% of positive samples were belonged to genotypes 793/B and Massachusetts, respectively, and the remaining positive (44.11%) were unknown.

918,Rapid and sensitive real-time assay for the detection of respiratory syncytial virus using RT-SIBA®,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most common causes of respiratory tract infections among young children and the elderly. Timely and accurate diagnosis of respiratory tract infections improves patient care and minimizes unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics. We sought to develop a rapid nucleic acid tests for the detection of RSV within minutes, while retaining the high sensitivity achieved with RT-PCR. METHODS: We developed and evaluated a reverse transcription isothermal nucleic acid amplification method, reverse transcription strand invasion based amplification (RT-SIBA), for the rapid detection of RSV. RESULTS: The developed RT-SIBA assay showed good sensitivity by detecting as few as 10 copies of RSV RNA within 20 min compared with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, which took approximately 2 h. The performance of the RT-SIBA RSV assay was further investigated using nasopharyngeal swab specimens. The RT-SIBA assay had a sensitivity of 100% (25/25) and a specificity of 100% (15/15). CONCLUSION: RT-SIBA did not require highly purified RNA for the rapid detection of RSV and was therefore compatible with rapid specimen processing methods. This reduces the complexity of specimen preparation and further shortens the total amount of time needed to detect RSV in clinical specimens. The developed RT-SIBA assay for RSV could be a useful tool for prompt management of this infection",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.144204897,0.037272133,0.206961002,0.178643923,-0.03660961,-0.15296390699999998,0.024254942,-0.065083688,0.09658197,-0.095208639,0.005326626,-0.048001006,-0.116634414,-0.013165052,-0.093522774,0.011371046000000001,0.005984847,0.089549023,-0.036973119,0.016991435,-0.021926572999999998,-0.135380317,0.0033059070000000003,-0.045363699,0.096812379,-0.11642141,0.199633738,0.100712908,-0.049685836,0.043941429000000004
919,Polymerase cross-linking spiral reaction (PCLSR) for detection of African swine fever virus (ASFV) in pigs and wild boars,"The study reports the development of a polymerase cross-linking spiral reaction (PCLSR) for the detection of African swine fever virus (ASFV) DNA in blood collected from infected pigs and wild boars. The method uses 3 specifically designed primers. Two outer-spiral primers comprising of 3′ sequences complementary to ASFV p72 gene sequence and 5′end sequences complementary to exogenous gene of black widow alpha-latrotoxin as well as additional ASFV specific cross-linking primer. The method is specific exclusively to ASFV DNA without cross-reactions with cDNA of classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome (PRRSV) or porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The sensitivity of this technique reached 7.2 × 10(2) copies per μl(−1) of plasmid containing p72 gene. The PCLSR was conducted at 65 °C creating cross-linked complex structures. The results of PCLSR were visualized using SYBR Green I dye, gel electrophoresis while the reaction progress was traced using real-time PCR system that resulted in registration of fluorescent curves and melting peaks at 85.3 °C. The developed PCLSR was examined using blood or tissue samples collected from selected 17 ASF cases from infected wild boars and 3 outbreaks in pigs.

937,Rapid and sensitive detection of canine distemper virus by real-time reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification,"BACKGROUND: Canine distemper, caused by Canine distemper virus (CDV), is a highly contagious and fatal systemic disease in free-living and captive carnivores worldwide. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), as an isothermal gene amplification technique, has been explored for the molecular detection of diverse pathogens. METHODS: A real-time reverse transcription RPA (RT-RPA) assay for the detection of canine distemper virus (CDV) using primers and exo probe targeting the CDV nucleocapsid protein gene was developed. A series of other viruses were tested by the RT-RPA.Thirty-two field samples were further tested by RT-RPA, and the resuts were compared with those obtained by the real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: The RT-RPA assay was performed successfully at 40 °C, and the results were obtained within 3 min–12 min. The assay could detect CDV, but did not show cross-detection of canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2), canine coronavirus (CCoV), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), pseudorabies virus (PRV) or Newcastle disease virus (NDV), demonstrating high specificity. The analytical sensitivity of RT-RPA was 31.8 copies in vitro transcribed CDV RNA, which is 10 times lower than the real-time RT-PCR. The assay performance was validated by testing 32 field samples and compared to real-time RT-PCR. The results indicated an excellent correlation between RT-RPA and a reference real-time RT-PCR method. Both assays provided the same results, and R(2) value of the positive results was 0.947. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that the RT-RPA assay offers an alternative tool for simple, rapid, and reliable detection of CDV both in the laboratory and point-of-care facility, especially in the resource-limited settings.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.058455137000000004,0.15124115,0.4168585999999999,0.118892209,-0.034275573999999996,-0.097553109,0.001041829,0.023623786,-0.026506636,-0.12452593699999999,-0.034719199,0.074477737,-0.10020087400000001,0.017443406,-0.075436429,0.070226827,-0.020000538999999998,-0.127473753,0.259986576,0.27254604,0.26538196,0.12401777,-0.09005972,-0.025410988,0.056666117,0.01108725,0.074310477,-0.016603859,0.07696384,0.007919831
942,A simple and rapid identification method for newly emerged porcine Deltacoronavirus with loop-mediated isothermal amplification,"BACKGROUND: Porcine Deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly emerged enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes diarrhea and mortality in neonatal piglets. PDCoV has spread to many countries around the world, leading to significant economic losses in the pork industry. Therefore, a rapid and sensitive method for detection of PDCoV in clinical samples is urgently needed. RESULTS: In this study, we developed a single-tube one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay specific for nucleocapsid gene to diagnose and monitor PDCoV infections. The detection limit of RT-LAMP assay was 1 × 10(1) copies of PDCoV, which was approximately 100-fold more sensitive than gel-based one-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This assay could specifically amplify PDCoV and had no cross amplification with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine kobuvirus (PKoV), porcine astrovirus (PAstV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), classic swine fever virus (CSFV), and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). By screening a panel of clinical specimens (N = 192), this method presented a similar sensitivity with nested RT-PCR and was 1–2 log more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR in detection of PDCoV. CONCLUSIONS: The RT-LAMP assay established in this study is a potentially valuable tool, especially in low-resource laboratories and filed settings, for a rapid diagnosis, surveillance, and molecular epidemiology investigation of PDCoV infections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work for detection of newly emerged PDCoV with LAMP technology.

950,Development of real-time recombinase polymerase amplification assay for rapid and sensitive detection of canine parvovirus 2,"BACKGROUND: Canine parvovirus 2, a linear single-stranded DNA virus belonging to the genus Parvovirus within the family Parvoviridae, is a highly contagious pathogen of domestic dogs and several wild canidae species. Early detection of canine parvovirus (CPV-2) is crucial to initiating appropriate outbreak control strategies. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), a novel isothermal gene amplification technique, has been developed for the molecular detection of diverse pathogens. In this study, a real-time RPA assay was developed for the detection of CPV-2 using primers and an exo probe targeting the CPV-2 nucleocapsid protein gene. RESULTS: The real-time RPA assay was performed successfully at 38 °C, and the results were obtained within 4–12 min for 10(5)–10(1) molecules of template DNA. The assay only detected CPV-2, and did not show cross-detection of other viral pathogens, demonstrating a high level of specificity. The analytical sensitivity of the real-time RPA was 10(1) copies/reaction of a standard DNA template, which was 10 times more sensitive than the common RPA method. The clinical sensitivity of the real-time RPA assay matched 100% (n = 91) to the real-time PCR results. CONCLUSION: The real-time RPA assay is a simple, rapid, reliable and affordable method that can potentially be applied for the detection of CPV-2 in the research laboratory and point-of-care diagnosis.

958,Rapid detection of infectious bovine Rhinotracheitis virus using recombinase polymerase amplification assays,"BACKGROUND: Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV) is a major pathogen in cattle and has led to significant economic losses to the dairy industry worldwide, and therefore a more optimal method for the rapid diagnosis of IBRV infection is highly needed. In this study, we described the development of a lateral flow dipstrip (LFD) of isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) method for rapid detection of IBRV. METHODS: Distinct regions were selected as a candidate target for designing the LFD-RPA primers and probes. The analytical sensitivity of the RPA assay was determined using ten-fold serially diluted IBRV DNA. The specificity of the assay was assessed with other viral pathogens of cattle with similar clinic and other herpesviruses. The clinical performance was evaluated by testing 106 acute-phase high fever clinical specimens. RESULTS: RPA primers and probe were designed to target the specific conserved UL52 region fragment of IBRV. The detection could be completed at a constant temperature of 38 °C for 25 min, and the amplification products were easily visualized on a simple LFD. The detection limit of this assay was 5 copies per reaction of IBRV DNA and there was no cross-reactivity with other viruses causing bovine gastrointestinal and respiratory infections or other herpesviruses. The assay performance on acute-phase high fever clinical samples collected from cattle with no vaccine against IBRV, which were suspected to be infected with IBRV, was validated by detecting 24 fecal, 36 blood, 38 nasal swab and 8 tissue specimens, and compared with SYBR Green I based real-time PCR. The coincidence between IBRV LFD-RPA and real-time PCR was 100%. CONCLUSION: IBRV LFD-RPA was fast and much easier to serve as an alternative to the common measures used for IBRV diagnosis, as there is reduction in the use of instruments for identification of the infected animals. In addition, this assay may be the potential candidate to be used as point-of-care diagnostics in the field.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.032001496000000004,0.059460233,0.21464492699999999,0.026414695,-0.061580289,-0.039328076000000003,0.04224886,0.008635943,-0.004462756,-0.038257614,-0.060399409,0.036609826,-0.019833021,-0.07398252400000001,-0.049171332000000005,0.07197397900000001,-0.05839495,-0.06605306799999999,0.143411452,0.17409970800000002,0.081826385,-0.024732603,-0.002436198,-0.054496757,-0.059528502000000004,0.045521192,0.020493586,0.004296455,0.061019888,-0.038039074
965,Real-time fluorescence loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for direct detection of egg drop syndrome virus,"BACKGROUND: Egg drop syndrome (EDS), caused by the adenovirus “egg drop syndrome virus” (EDSV) causes severe economic losses through reduced egg production in breeder and layer flocks. The diagnosis of EDSV has been done by molecular tools since its complete genome sequence was identified. In order to enhance the capabilities of the real-time fluorescence loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RealAmp) assay, we aimed to apply the method for direct detection of the EDSV without viral DNA extraction. In order to detect the presence of the EDSV DNA, three pairs of primers were designed, from the conserved region of fiber gene of the EDSV. RESULTS: For our assay, test and control samples were directly used in the reaction mixture in 10-fold serial dilution. The target DNA was amplified at 65 °C, which yield positive results in a relatively short period of 40–45 min. The method reported in this study is highly sensitive as compared to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and showed no sign of cross-reactivity or false positive results. The RealAmp accomplished specific identification of EDSV among a variety of poultry disease viruses. CONCLUSIONS: The direct RealAmp can be used to detect the presence of EDSV. As our result showed, the RealAmp method could be suitable for the direct detection of other DNA viruses.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.012859937,0.067961674,0.217690877,0.04518964599999999,0.002850495,-0.038551853999999997,-0.0014086620000000002,-0.013988328999999999,0.0037608159999999997,0.066335882,-0.039327008,-0.023712572,0.019347935,-0.03187803,-0.044450514,0.018762996,-0.028864135,-0.035270813,0.008020276,0.006898353,-0.034914227,0.008067142,0.012677529,0.017806273,-0.059130663,-0.028835881,-0.074042373,0.063636913,-0.04727726,0.00770156
976,Rapid detection of potyviruses from crude plant extracts,"Potyviruses (genus Potyvirus; family Potyviridae) are widely distributed and represent one of the most economically important genera of plant viruses. Therefore, their accurate detection is a key factor in developing efficient control strategies. However, this can sometimes be problematic particularly in plant species containing high amounts of polysaccharides and polyphenols such as yam (Dioscorea spp.). Here, we report the development of a reliable, rapid and cost-effective detection method for the two most important potyviruses infecting yam based on reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA). The developed method, named ‘Direct RT-RPA’, detects each target virus directly from plant leaf extracts prepared with a simple and inexpensive extraction method avoiding laborious extraction of high-quality RNA. Direct RT-RPA enables the detection of virus-positive samples in under 30 min at a single low operation temperature (37 °C) without the need for any expensive instrumentation. The Direct RT-RPA tests constitute robust, accurate, sensitive and quick methods for detection of potyviruses from recalcitrant plant species. The minimal sample preparation requirements and the possibility of storing RPA reagents without cold chain storage, allow Direct RT-RPA to be adopted in minimally equipped laboratories and with potential use in plant clinic laboratories and seed certification facilities worldwide.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.007377671999999999,0.085556336,0.27906248699999997,0.11060411,-0.06377264,-0.057854819,0.08137724,0.046472438,-0.028865035,-0.057762151,-0.07442109400000001,0.042258357999999996,-0.030946752,-0.061010089,-0.081446995,0.11910133699999999,-0.06019261,-0.067365732,0.12331441,0.24277513899999997,0.053400123,-0.00656918,-0.048507012,-0.034832924,-0.08562719199999999,0.044531627000000004,0.06084607,0.013158503,0.09086207800000001,-0.043825280999999994
978,"Ebolavirus diagnosis made simple, comparable and faster than molecular detection methods: preparing for the future","BACKGROUND: The 2014/2015 Ebolavirus outbreak resulted in more than 28,000 cases and 11,323 reported deaths, as of March 2016. Domestic transmission of the Guinea strain associated with the outbreak occurred mainly in six African countries, and international transmission was reported in four countries. Outbreak management was limited by the inability to rapidly diagnose infected cases. A further fifteen countries in Africa are predicted to be at risk of Ebolavirus outbreaks in the future as a consequence of climate change and urbanization. Early detection of cases and reduction of transmission rates is critical to prevent and manage future severe outbreaks. We designed a rapid assay for detection of Ebolavirus using recombinase polymerase amplification, a rapid isothermal amplification technology that can be combined with portable lateral flow detection technology. The developed rapid assay operates in 30 min and was comparable with real-time TaqMan™ PCR. METHODS: Designed, screened, selected and optimized oligonucleotides using the NP coding region from Ebola Zaire virus (Guinea strain). We determined the analytical sensitivity of our Ebola rapid molecular test by testing selected primers and probe with tenfold serial dilutions (1.34 × 10(10−) 1.34 × 10(1) copies/μL) of cloned NP gene from Mayinga strain of Zaire ebolavirus in pCAGGS vector, and serially diluted cultured Ebolavirus as established by real-time TaqMan™ PCR that was performed using ABI7500 in Fast Mode. We tested extracted and reverse transcribed RNA from cultured Zaire ebolavirus strains – Mayinga, Gueckedou C05, Gueckedou C07, Makona, Kissidougou and Kiwit. We determined the analytical specificity of our assay with related viruses: Marburg, Ebola Reston and Ebola Sudan. We further tested for Dengue virus 1–4, Plasmodium falciparum and West Nile Virus (Kunjin strain). RESULTS: The assay had a detection limit of 134 copies per μL of plasmid containing the NP gene of Ebolavirus Mayinga, and cultured Ebolavirus and was highly specific for the Zaire ebolavirus species, including the Guinea strain responsible for the 2014/2015 outbreak. The assay did not detect related viruses like Marburg, Reston, or Sudan viruses, and other pathogens likely to be isolated from clinical samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our assay could be suitable for implementation in district and primary health laboratories, as only a heating block and centrifuge is required for operation.

1001,Development and evaluation of a broadly reactive reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay for rapid detection of murine norovirus,"BACKGROUND: Murine norovirus (MNV) is recognized as the most prevalent viral pathogen in captive mouse colonies. The rapid detection assay for MNV would be a useful tool for monitoring and preventing MNV infection. A recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay was established in this study to provide a solution for rapid and sensitive detection of MNV. RESULTS: The detection limit of the RT-RPA assay for the detection of MNV was 1 × 10(2) copies of RNA molecules per reaction. The assay was specific since there was no cross-reaction with other common murine viruses. In addition, the broad reactivity of the RT-RPA assay was validated using the synthesized template carrying seven point mutations among several MNV strains. The MNV RT-RPA assay could detect as few as 1 × 10(2) copies of the mutant per reaction, suggesting the assay could be broadly reactive against a large diversity of MNV strains. Forty eight clinical samples including 16 gastric tissue specimens, 16 cecal tissue specimens and 16 fecal specimens were tested for the validation of the new developed RT-RPA assay. The detection results of RT-RPA and RT-qPCR for clinical samples were very similar, except that a gastric tissue sample which was positive by RT-qPCR, with a RNA titer of 27 copies, was negative by RT-RPA.

1005,Polymerase chain reaction combined with fluorescent lateral flow immunoassay based on magnetic purification for rapid detection of canine parvovirus 2,"BACKGROUND: Canine parvovirus 2 (CPV-2) is one of the most common etiological agents that cause severe gastroenteritis in puppies. Early accurate diagnosis is important for infected dogs. In recent years, magnetic separation has become an efficient and useful tool for bioassays. In this study, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with fluorescent lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) based on magnetic purification assay was developed for the quantitative detection of CPV-2. RESULTS: The optimum working reaction volume and reaction time for LFIA was 100 μL and 2 min, respectively. The PCR-LFIA assay only detected CPV-2, and did not show cross-detection of non-CPV strains. Experiments showed analytical sensitivity of 3 × 10(1) copies/μL and demonstrated the PCR-LFIA has a diagnostic agreement of 100% with conventional PCR on detection of clinical samples (22.6% positive, 14/62).

1009,Rapid molecular detection of macrolide resistance,"BACKGROUND: Emerging antimicrobial resistance is a significant threat to human health. However, methods for rapidly diagnosing antimicrobial resistance generally require multi-day culture-based assays. Macrolide efflux gene A, mef(A), provides resistance against erythromycin and azithromycin and is known to be laterally transferred among a wide range of bacterial species. METHODS: We use Recombinase Polymerase Assay (RPA) to detect the antimicrobial resistance gene mef(A) from raw lysates without nucleic acid purification. To validate these results we performed broth dilution assays to assess antimicrobial resistance to erythromycin and ampicillin (a negative control). RESULTS: We validate the detection of mef(A) in raw lysates of Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. salivarius, and Enterococcus faecium bacterial lysates within 7–10 min of assay time. We show that detection of mef(A) accurately predicts real antimicrobial resistance assessed by traditional culture methods, and that the assay is robust to high levels of spiked-in non-specific nucleic acid contaminant. The assay was unaffected by single-nucleotide polymorphisms within divergent mef(A) gene sequences, strengthening its utility as a robust diagnostic tool. CONCLUSIONS: This finding opens the door to implementation of rapid genomic diagnostics in a clinical setting, while providing researchers a rapid, cost-effective tool to track antibiotic resistance in both pathogens and commensal strains.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.008506752,0.025389555,0.133254064,-0.010765793000000001,-0.055472984,0.017457048,0.049754158,0.022043285,-0.024088392,0.024404303,-0.07774553599999999,0.0053713680000000005,0.019610627,-0.097021356,-0.020618446999999998,-0.0023944820000000003,-0.055082972,0.000791707,0.022562077000000003,0.008512584,0.029916538,0.005492821,0.09275451300000001,-0.028060585,-0.051364927000000005,0.021657411,0.041441742999999996,-0.025413532000000003,0.053589093,0.006868702
1019,Visual detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus using a novel reverse transcription polymerase spiral reaction method,"BACKGROUND: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a major etiological agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea around the world. Point-of-care testing in the field is lacking owing to the requirement for a simple, robust field applicable test that does not require professional laboratory equipment. The aim of this study was to establish a novel reverse transcription polymerase spiral reaction (RT-PSR) assay for the rapid detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). For the assay, a specific RT-PSR primer pair was designed against a conserved region in PEDV ORF3. RESULTS: The RT-PSR was optimized, and PEDV could be detected after a 50 min incubation at 62 °C, in addition to the 15 min required for reverse transcription. No cross-reaction with other porcine infectious viruses was observed. This new method for PEDV detection was 10 times more sensitive than the conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The positive rates for 65 clinical samples using the new RT-PSR assay and the conventional RT-PCR assay were 58.46% (38/65) and 53.84% (35/65), respectively. In the RT-PSR assay, the addition of a mixture of dyes allowed a positive reaction to be directly observed by the naked eye. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that this RT-PSR assay is capable of accurately detecting PEDV, and has the advantages of high specificity and sensitivity for the detection of PEDV.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.05214665,0.11823201400000001,0.328306345,0.036273191,0.025346938,-0.038806412,-0.04344959,-0.027934300000000002,-0.024855493,-0.085412781,0.046112568,0.12155636800000001,-0.225507152,0.135453558,0.238181377,-0.215266548,0.011568513,0.068629305,-0.069110495,0.225550377,-0.20670612100000002,-0.073281225,0.081107624,0.033429762,-0.038511266,0.00393286,0.040422939,0.032590452,0.096352446,-0.036035815
1020,Performance and workflow assessment of six nucleic acid extraction technologies for use in resource limited settings,"Infectious disease nucleic acid amplification technologies (NAAT) have superior sensitivity, specificity, and rapid time to result compared to traditional microbiological methods. Recovery of concentrated, high quality pathogen nucleic acid (NA) from complex specimen matrices is required for optimal performance of several NA amplification/detection technologies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fully integrated NAAT platforms that enable rapid sample-to-result workflows with minimal user input are generally restricted to larger reference lab settings, and their complexity and cost are prohibitive to widespread implementation in resource limited settings (RLS). Identification of component technologies for incorporation of reliable and affordable sample preparation with pathogen NA amplification/detection into an integrated platform suitable for RLS, is a necessary first step toward achieving the overarching goal of reducing infectious disease-associated morbidity and mortality globally. In the current study, we evaluate the performance of six novel NA extraction technologies from different developers using blinded panels of stool, sputum and blood spiked with variable amounts of quality-controlled DNA- and/or RNA-based microbes. The extraction efficiencies were semi-quantitatively assessed using validated real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays specific for each microbe and comparing target-specific RT-PCR results to those obtained with reference NA extraction methods. The technologies were ranked based on overall diagnostic accuracy (analytical sensitivity and specificity). Sample input and output volumes, total processing time, user-required manual steps and cost estimates were also examined for suitability in RLS. Together with the performance analysis, these metrics were used to select the more suitable candidate technologies for further optimization of integrated NA amplification and detection technologies for RLS.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.012622761000000001,0.06142635900000001,0.220865723,0.044010851,-0.077637427,-0.012868329,0.050710389,0.024049865,-0.026970511000000003,0.038026831000000004,-0.053443847,-0.00035588300000000003,0.064870481,-0.098838966,-0.023774017,0.045775962999999996,-0.052197527,-0.012054182,-0.058098208,-0.067840684,-0.043135315,-0.038820613,0.040737958,-0.086384215,-0.025554933,-0.033041364,-0.014318115,-0.0052325720000000004,-0.035213443,0.042906809000000004
1022,Development and evaluation of a one-step multiplex real-time TaqMan(®) RT-qPCR assay for the detection and genotyping of equine G3 and G14 rotaviruses in fecal samples,"BACKGROUND: Equine rotavirus A (ERVA) is the leading cause of diarrhea in neonatal foals and has a negative impact on equine breeding enterprises worldwide. Among ERVA strains infecting foals, the genotypes G3P[12] and G14P[12] are the most prevalent, while infections by strains with other genomic arrangements are infrequent. The identification of circulating strains of ERVA is critical for diagnostic and surveillance purposes, as well as to understand their molecular epidemiology. Current genotyping methods available for ERVA and rotaviruses affecting other animal species rely on Sanger sequencing and are significantly time-consuming, costly and labor intensive. Here, we developed the first one-step multiplex TaqMan(®) real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay targeting the NSP3 and VP7 genes of ERVA G3 and G14 genotypes for the rapid detection and G-typing directly from fecal specimens. METHODS: A one-step multiplex TaqMan(®) RT-qPCR assay targeting the NSP3 and VP7 genes of ERVA G3 and G14 genotypes was designed. The analytical sensitivity was assessed using serial dilutions of in vitro transcribed RNA containing the target sequences while the analytical specificity was determined using RNA and DNA derived from a panel of group A rotaviruses along with other equine viruses and bacteria. The clinical performance of this multiplex assay was evaluated using a panel of 177 fecal samples and compared to a VP7-specific standard RT-PCR assay and Sanger sequencing. Limits of detection (LOD), sensitivity, specificity, and agreement were determined. RESULTS: The multiplex G3 and G14 VP7 assays demonstrated high specificity and efficiency, with perfect linearity. A 100-fold difference in their analytical sensitivity was observed when compared to the singleplex assays; however, this difference did not have an impact on the clinical performance. Clinical performance of the multiplex RT-qPCR assay demonstrated that this assay had a high sensitivity/specificity for every target (100% for NSP3, > 90% for G3 VP7 and > 99% for G14 VP7, respectively) and high overall agreement (> 98%) compared to conventional RT-PCR and sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: This new multiplex RT-qPCR assay constitutes a useful, very reliable tool that could significantly aid in the rapid detection and G-typing of ERVA strains circulating in the field.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.049927958,0.09764391800000001,0.293382099,0.09195187,0.009921797,-0.054998135999999996,0.008483874,-0.011061921,-0.026492086,-0.021655411,-0.013458518000000001,0.04161140000000001,-0.044757462000000005,0.060926195999999995,0.0032907490000000004,-0.047466681,0.020426095,-0.0006906589999999999,0.022987182000000002,-0.044024954000000005,0.021936341,0.005104754,0.028967212000000003,0.048453968,-0.001841535,-0.025437592999999998,0.053789797,-0.031910414,0.014862253,0.001083189
1026,Rapid and Sensitive Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Combined With Lateral Flow Strip for Detecting African Swine Fever Virus,"African swine fever virus (ASFV), the etiological agent of African swine fever (ASF), a hemorrhagic fever of domestic pigs, has devastating consequences for the pig farming industry. More than 1,000,000 pigs have been slaughtered since 3 August 2018 in China. However, vaccines or drugs for ASF have yet to be developed. As such, a rapid test that can accurately detect ASFV on-site is important to the timely implementation of control measures. In this study, we developed a rapid test that combines recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) of the ASFV p72 gene with lateral flow detection (LFD). Results showed that the sensitivity of recombinase polymerase amplification with lateral flow dipstick (RPA-LFD) for ASFV was 150 copies per reaction within 10 min at 38°C. The assay was highly specific to ASFV and had no cross-reactions with other porcine viruses, including classical swine fever virus (CSFV). A total of 145 field samples were examined using our method, and the agreement of the positive rate between RPA-LFD (10/145) and real-time PCR (10/145) was 100%. Overall, RPA-LFD provides a novel alternative for the simple, sensitive, and specific identification of ASFV and showed potential for on-site ASFV detection.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.005863454000000001,0.045602112,0.199027402,0.009554144,-0.043581367,-0.0006304430000000001,0.02646531,0.0211532,-0.009476489,-0.060358293,-0.055883767,0.051980367,-0.06400019900000001,-0.073465373,-0.000245814,0.04717002,-0.071144553,-0.058987520999999994,0.12376415699999999,0.21709118100000002,0.036676518,-0.015981618,0.015534503,-0.077166231,-0.09320027800000001,0.067107294,0.02524438,0.038188973,0.048999247999999995,-0.025890142
1043,Evaluation of Diagnostic Performance of Three Indirect Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays for the Detection of IgG Antibodies to Ebola Virus in Human Sera,"Filovirus serological diagnosis and epidemiological investigations are hampered due to the unavailability of validated immunoassays. Diagnostic performance of three indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (I-ELISA) was evaluated for the detection of IgG antibody to Ebola virus (EBOV) in human sera. One I-ELISA was based on a whole EBOV antigen (WAg) and two utilized recombinant nucleocapsid (NP) and glycoproteins (GP), respectively. Validation data sets derived from individual sera collected in South Africa (SA), representing an EBOV non-endemic country, and from sera collected during an Ebola disease (EBOD) outbreak in Sierra Leone (SL), were categorized according to the compounded results of the three I-ELISAs and real time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At the cut-off values selected at 95% accuracy level by the two-graph receiver operating characteristic analysis, specificity in the SA EBOV negative serum panel (n = 273) ranged from 98.17% (GP ELISA) to 99.27% (WAg ELISA). Diagnostic specificity in the SL EBOV negative panel (n = 676) was 100% by the three ELISAs. The diagnostic sensitivity in 423 RT-PCR confirmed EBOD patients was dependent on the time when the serum was collected after onset of disease. It significantly increased 2 weeks post-onset, reaching 100% sensitivity by WAg and NP and 98.1% by GP I-ELISA.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.034483199,0.053808065999999995,0.128166673,-0.044778157,-0.052851428,-0.001084402,-0.009204988,0.002913603,-0.018845078,-0.030327469,-0.005847196999999999,0.021046588999999997,-0.017553962,0.00965219,-0.01706895,-0.005325720999999999,0.006370995,0.005415693,-0.031360582000000005,-0.09109962099999999,-0.021615335,-0.025748356,0.01621783,-0.014543573,0.026334285,0.021165394,0.040377256,-0.048670685,-0.032486656,0.003236633
1047,Advances in Diagnostic Approaches for Viral Etiologies of Diarrhea: From the Lab to the Field,"The applications of correct diagnostic approaches play a decisive role in timely containment of infectious diseases spread and mitigation of public health risks. Nevertheless, there is a need to update the diagnostics regularly to capture the new, emergent, and highly divergent viruses. Acute gastroenteritis of viral origin has been identified as a significant cause of mortality across the globe, with the more serious consequences seen at the extremes of age groups (young and elderly) and immune-compromised individuals. Therefore, significant advancements and efforts have been put in the development of enteric virus diagnostics to meet the WHO ASSURED criteria as a benchmark over the years. The Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent (ELISA) and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) are the basic assays that provided the platform for development of several efficient diagnostics such as real-time RT-PCR, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), polymerase spiral reaction (PSR), biosensors, microarrays and next generation sequencing.

1070,Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) for the Diagnosis of Zika Virus: A Review,"The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas and its devastating developmental and neurological manifestations has prompted the development of field-based diagnostics that are rapid, reliable, handheld, specific, sensitive, and inexpensive. The gold standard molecular method for lab-based diagnosis of ZIKV, from either patient samples or insect vectors, is reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The method, however, is costly and requires lab-based equipment and expertise, which severely limits its use as a point-of-care (POC) tool in resource-poor settings. Moreover, given the lack of antivirals or approved vaccines for ZIKV infection, a POC diagnostic test is urgently needed for the early detection of new outbreaks and to adequately manage patients. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a compelling alternative to RT-qPCR for ZIKV and other arboviruses. This low-cost molecular system can be freeze-dried for distribution and exhibits high specificity, sensitivity, and efficiency. A growing body of evidence suggests that LAMP assays can provide greater accessibility to much-needed diagnostics for ZIKV infections, especially in developing countries where the ZIKV is now endemic.

1088,Application of Molecular Diagnostic Techniques for Viral Testing,"Nucleic acid amplification techniques are commonly used currently to diagnose viral diseases and manage patients with this kind of illnesses. These techniques have had a rapid but unconventional route of development during the last 30 years, with the discovery and introduction of several assays in clinical diagnosis. The increase in the number of commercially available methods has facilitated the use of this technology in the majority of laboratories worldwide. This technology has reduced the use of some other techniques such as viral culture based methods and serological assays in the clinical virology laboratory. Moreover, nucleic acid amplification techniques are now the methods of reference and also the most useful assays for the diagnosis in several diseases. The introduction of these techniques and their automation provides new opportunities for the clinical laboratory to affect patient care. The main objectives in performing nucleic acid tests in this field are to provide timely results useful for high-quality patient care at a reasonable cost, because rapid results are associated with improvements in patients care. The use of amplification techniques such as polymerase chain reaction, real-time polymerase chain reaction or nucleic acid sequence-based amplification for virus detection, genotyping and quantification have some advantages like high sensitivity and reproducibility, as well as a broad dynamic range.

1091,Tools to Detect Influenza Virus,"In 2009, pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus (H1N1 09) started to spread quickly in many countries. It causes respiratory infection with signs and symptoms of common infectious agents. Thus, clinicians sometimes may miss the H1N1 patient. Clinical laboratory tests are important for the diagnosis of the H1N1 infection. There are several tests available, however, the rapid test and direct fluorescence antigen test are unable to rule out the influenza virus infection and viral culture test is time consuming. Therefore, nucleic acid amplification techniques based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays are regarded as a specific diagnosis to confirm the influenza virus infection. Although the nucleic acid-based techniques are highly sensitive and specific, the high mutation rate of the influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase could limit the utility of the techniques. In addition, their use depends on the availability, cost and throughput of the diagnostic techniques. To overcome these drawbacks, evaluation and development of the techniques should be continued. This review provides an overview of various techniques for specific diagnosis of influenza infection.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.086196047,-0.027508689,0.08657365,0.18951216399999998,-0.112467273,0.223877821,-0.073585866,0.037203902999999997,-0.027008417000000003,0.027196941000000002,-0.0011985519999999999,-0.017356918,0.13498584,-0.117981621,0.027444747999999998,0.034059072999999995,-0.019553975,0.053045862,-0.10467319300000001,-0.044919294000000005,-0.028629053999999998,-0.073231722,0.018629708000000002,-0.162571242,-0.034756995,0.005121791,-0.06760237599999999,-0.020403977,-0.07989329099999999,0.12277802800000001
1094,Development and clinical evaluation of a rapid diagnostic kit for feline leukemia virus infection,"Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) causes a range of neoplastic and degenerative diseases in cats. To obtain a more sensitive and convenient diagnosis of the disease, we prepared monoclonal antibodies specific for the FeLV p27 to develop a rapid diagnostic test with enhanced sensitivity and specificity. Among these antibodies, we identified two clones (hybridomas 8F8B5 and 8G7D1) that specifically bound to FeLV and were very suitable for a diagnostic kit. The affinity constants for 8F8B5 and 8G7D1 were 0.35 × 10(9) and 0.86 × 10(9), respectively. To investigate the diagnostic abilities of the rapid kit using these antibodies, we performed several clinical studies. Assessment of analytical sensitivity revealed that the detection threshold of the rapid diagnostic test was 2 ng/mL for recombinant p27 and 12.5 × 10(4) IU/mL for FeLV. When evaluating 252 cat sera samples, the kit was found to have a kappa value of 0.88 compared to polymerase chain reaction (PCR), indicating a significant correlation between data from the rapid diagnostic test and PCR. Sensitivity and specificity of the kit were 95.2% (20/21) and 98.5% (257/261), respectively. Our results demonstrated that the rapid diagnostic test would be a suitable diagnostic tool for the rapid detection of FeLV infection in cats.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.042624157,0.044886957000000005,0.17950597399999998,-0.037219514,-0.056668022,-0.011743493,0.02414696,0.001790744,-0.019926579,-0.04290338900000001,0.09737654800000001,-0.055438954000000006,0.09691932699999999,-0.060997788,-0.040599233,-0.013074700000000002,0.005055442,0.001336636,0.002233899,-0.036014789,-0.035575734,-0.050116738,0.09663162300000001,-0.066949997,-0.0075921009999999995,0.004702144,-0.015963155,-0.038914372999999995,-0.070706807,0.030407008
1133,Development and application of multiplex PCR assays for detection of virus-induced respiratory disease complex in dogs,"Canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC) viruses have been detected in dogs with respiratory illness. Canine influenza virus (CIV), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAdV-2) and canine herpesvirus 1 (CaHV-1), are all associated with the CIRDC. To allow diagnosis, two conventional multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were developed to simultaneously identify four RNA and two DNA viruses associated with CIRDC. The two multiplex PCR assays were then validated on 102 respiratory samples collected from 51 dogs with respiratory illness by sensitivity and specificity determination in comparison to conventional simplex PCR and a rapid three-antigen test kit. All six viruses were detected in either individual or multiple infections. The developed multiplex PCR assays had a >87% sensitivity and 100% specificity compared to their simplex counterpart. Compared to the three-antigen test kit, the multiplex PCR assays yielded 100% sensitivity and more than 83% specificity for detection of CAdV-2 and CDV, but not for CIV. Therefore, the developed multiplex PCR modalities were able to simultaneously diagnose a panel of CIRDC viruses and facilitated specimen collection through being suitable for use of nasal or oral samples.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.131506169,0.020186383000000002,0.173665538,0.103381308,0.035907006,-0.027211425,0.002724771,-0.024384414,-0.016322875,0.027635954,0.048834884,-0.011795955,0.029459742999999997,-0.006761621999999999,0.094101749,-0.080403664,0.024069037,-0.117109868,0.133726379,-0.083552356,0.215302222,0.080342368,-0.043359567,-0.036923923,0.201983205,-0.13313042,-0.097353645,-0.065149439,-0.076910488,0.00532259
1199,TaqMan probe array for quantitative detection of DNA targets,"To date real-time quantitative PCR and gene expression microarrays are the methods of choice for quantification of nucleic acids. Herein, we described a unique fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based microarray platform for real-time quantification of nucleic acid targets that combines advantages of both and reduces their limitations. A set of 3′ amino-modified TaqMan probes were designed and immobilized on a glass slide composing a regular microarray pattern, and used as probes in the consecutive PCR carried out on the surface. During the extension step of the PCR, 5′ nuclease activity of DNA polymerase will cleave quencher dyes of the immobilized probe in the presence of nucleic acids targets. The increase of fluorescence intensities generated by the change in physical distance between reporter fluorophore and quencher moiety of the probes were collected by a confocal scanner. Using this new approach we successfully monitored five different pathogenic genomic DNAs and analyzed the dynamic characteristics of fluorescence intensity changes on the TaqMan probe array. The results indicate that the TaqMan probe array on a planar glass slide monitors DNA targets with excellent specificity as well as high sensitivity.

1247,Development of a Rapid Detection Method for Potato virus X by Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification,"The primary step for efficient control of viral diseases is the development of simple, rapid, and sensitive virus detection. Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) has been used to detect viral RNA molecules because of its simplicity and high sensitivity for a number of viruses. RT-LAMP for the detection of Potato virus X (PVX) was developed and compared with conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to demonstrate its advantages over RT-PCR. RT-LAMP reactions were conducted with or without a set of loop primers since one out of six primers showed PVX specificity. Based on real-time monitoring, RT-LAMP detected PVX around 30 min, compared to 120 min for RT-PCR. By adding a fluorescent reagent during the reaction, the extra step of visualization by gel electrophoresis was not necessary. RT-LAMP was conducted using simple inexpensive instruments and a regular incubator to evaluate whether RNA could be amplified at a constant temperature instead of using an expensive thermal cycler. This study shows the potential of RT-LAMP for the diagnosis of viral diseases and PVX epidemiology because of its simplicity and rapidness compared to RT-PCR.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.028489455,0.138667194,0.38803638700000004,0.190964087,-0.049538978,-0.120951167,-0.007132175,-0.00604996,-0.029255207999999998,-0.067585706,-0.020575528,0.035283173,-0.056884237000000004,0.15209031,-0.105914005,0.063150641,0.10540357300000001,0.09416450400000001,-0.197445051,0.017545493,-0.159427338,-0.019107299999999997,-0.144440726,0.293509572,0.162741149,0.03330873,-0.044804786,0.076296647,-0.009696953000000001,-0.023066133

(2010) Real time reverse transcription (RRT)‐polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods for detection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus and European swine influenza A virus infections in pigs. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 4(5), 277–293. Background There is a requirement to detect and differentiate pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (H1N1v) and established swine influenza A viruses (SIVs) by real time reverse transcription (RRT) PCR methods. Objectives First, modify an existing matrix (M) gene RRT PCR for sensitive generic detection of H1N1v and other European SIVs. Second, design an H1 RRT PCR to specifically detect H1N1v infections. Methods RRT PCR assays were used to test laboratory isolates of SIV (n = 51; 37 European and 14 North American), H1N1v (n = 5) and avian influenza virus (AIV; n = 43). Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were calculated for swabs (n = 133) and tissues (n = 116) collected from field cases and pigs infected experimentally with SIVs and H1N1v. Results The “perfect match” M gene RRT PCR was the most sensitive variant of this test for detection of established European SIVs and H1N1v. H1 RRT PCR specifically detected H1N1v but not European SIVs. Validation with clinical specimens included comparison with virus isolation (VI) as a “gold standard”, while field infection with H1N1v in swine was independently confirmed by sequencing H1N1v amplified by conventional RT PCR. “Perfect match” M gene RRT PCR had 100% sensitivity and 95·2% specificity for swabs, 93·6% and 98·6% for tissues. H1 RRT PCR demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 99·1%, respectively, for the swabs, and 100% and 100% for the tissues. Conclusions Two RRT PCRs for the purposes of (i) generic detection of SIV and H1N1v infection in European pigs, and for (ii) specific detection of H1N1v (pandemic influenza) infection were validated.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.07349575900000001,0.015464281000000002,0.125450311,0.06356424,0.004302945999999999,0.109134286,-0.081649492,0.020000025,0.000740047,-0.03911645,0.016169315,0.000981624,-0.014925015,0.013175207,0.04802294,-0.010376531999999999,0.020591398,-0.027984903,-0.014278533999999999,-0.08462737599999999,-0.020434074,0.004922175,0.044530782000000005,-0.043165762,-0.027594915,0.009153745999999999,-0.019427271,-0.026988132999999997,0.012565531000000001,0.013226501000000002
1291,Analytical Performance of a Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay for Leishmania DNA Detection in Sandflies and Direct Smears of Patients with Cutaneous Leishmaniasis,"Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is ideal for the detection of Leishmania DNA as it is a quick and easy-to-perform test that does not require complex or sophisticated equipment or infrastructure. However, the application of this technique in the detection of Leishmania DNA has not been comprehensively analyzed to date (analytical validation). Our objective was to evaluate the sensitivity and analytical specificity (anticipated reportable range [ARR], the limit of detection [LoD], and accuracy) of LAMP targeting the 18S rRNA gene in the diagnosis of six New World Leishmania species. We then applied the validated LAMP assay across 50 samples of sandflies and 50 direct smears from a recent outbreak of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia to determine its diagnostic performance. The LAMP assay exclusively amplified the DNA of Leishmania spp., and an ARR of between 1 × 10(4) and 1 × 10(−2) equivalent parasites/mL was determined. An LoD of 1 × 10(−2) equivalent parasites/mL was established and there was no statistically significant variation in terms of accuracy. Finally, a sensitivity of 100% in direct smears and sandflies samples was calculated and a specificity of 90.9% for direct smears using microscopy as reference and 96.8% for sandflies using real-time polymerase chain reaction as reference were determined. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analytically validate a LAMP test to detect Leishmania DNA, which showed good diagnostic potential from sandflies and direct smear samples.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.00383968,0.071163205,0.247088275,0.018891076,-0.06379441200000001,-0.03829,0.055226855,-0.006413738,-0.012197468000000001,-0.052752960999999994,-0.061198463,0.014145903,-0.02623906,-0.01823047,-0.06344986,0.044131167,-0.010392597,0.037356047999999996,-0.06226807,-0.007445792,-0.096295134,-0.047194682,-0.035061449,0.12447565099999999,0.057567027,-0.032092077999999996,-0.134791284,0.110920351,-0.103340335,0.019662395
1292,Evaluation of real-time reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for clinical diagnosis of West Nile virus in patients,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus. The disease can be diagnosed by isolation followed by fluorescent antibody tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. These diagnostic methods are laborious and time-consuming. The present study was aimed to evaluate the real-time reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method for rapid, early and accurate diagnosis of WNV. METHODS: A one-step single tube accelerated quantitative RT-LAMP assay was evaluated by targeting the Env gene of WNV. The gene amplification was accomplished by incubating the reaction mixture at 63°C for 60 min in both real time turbidimeter as well as routine laboratory water bath/dry heating bath. To rule out contamination issues, proper negative controls, including no template, no primer; and no enzyme, were always kept alongside each run. The RT-LAMP assay was evaluated on 105 clinical samples from individuals having ocular infection. RESULTS: Of the 105 samples tested, 27 were positive for WNV by RT-LAMP assay. The comparative evaluation with conventional RT-PCR revealed 100 per cent accordance with sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 95 per cent, respectively. The specificity of this assay was confirmed with serum samples obtained from patients with dengue and chikungunya. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The RT-LAMP test seemed to be a sensitive and specific method for rapid detection of WNV infection and would be useful for rapid screening of a large number of clinical samples in endemic areas during outbreaks.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.080744857,0.139187895,0.34509501200000003,0.092338078,-0.068847116,-0.09223905800000001,-0.008046756,0.011146608,-0.026964434,-0.085085711,-0.021956462000000003,0.033850779,-0.064102564,0.094515264,-0.096965748,0.034180703,0.068766758,0.057285006,-0.100591544,-0.002628253,-0.08685814900000001,-0.038892218,-0.06911252,0.168458857,0.075913221,0.044134234,-0.035957087,0.046393495,-0.06126985099999999,-0.014882468000000001
1315,Rapid detection of tomato leaf curl Bengaluru virus through loop mediated isothermal amplification assay,"A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique was employed to develop a simple and rapid method for the detection of tomato leaf curl Bangalore virus (ToLCBaV) in diseased plants of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Six sets of primers were designed for LAMP technique targeting the conserved AC1 region and successfully detected ToLCBaV. No reaction was detected in the tissues of healthy plants by either the LAMP or the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The LAMP products can be visualized by presence or absence of turbidity and staining (0.2 μL for 25 μL LAMP product) directly in the tube with nucleic acid stain dye which allowed easy detection. Sensitivity of LAMP assay is 100 times of conventional PCR technique. Although, both the LAMP and the PCR methods were capable of detecting ToLCBaV in infected tissues of tomato, the LAMP method would be more useful than the PCR method for detection of ToLCBaV infection in tomato plants because it is more rapid, simple and accurate method.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0046229,0.076043891,0.28512185100000004,0.061198378,-0.058316339,-0.069116915,0.013391905,-0.008004801,-0.01061772,-0.046649993,-0.059346513,0.017948727,-0.01166138,0.012065081,-0.08756605599999999,0.07095712400000001,0.047604494000000004,0.064814573,-0.169909493,-0.003181452,-0.15978848199999998,-0.097092774,-0.060211959,0.22555894199999998,0.146540761,0.014609367,-0.161260169,0.139821563,-0.109530645,0.007383006
1332,"Development of polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostic tests for detection of Malsoor virus & adenovirus isolated from Rousettus species of bats in Maharashtra, India","BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Bats are recognized as important reservoirs for emerging infectious disease and some unknown viral diseases. Two novel viruses, Malsoor virus (family Bunyaviridae, genus, Phlebovirus) and a novel adenovirus (AdV) (family, Adenoviridae genus, Mastadenovirus), were identified from Rousettus bats in the Maharashtra State of India. This study was done to develop and optimize real time reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for Malsoor virus and real time and nested PCR for adenovirus from Rousettus bats. METHODS: For rapid and accurate screening of Malsoor virus and adenovirus a nested polymerase chain reaction and TaqMan-based real-time PCR were developed. Highly conserved region of nucleoprotein gene of phleboviruses and polymerase gene sequence from the Indian bat AdV isolate polyprotein gene were selected respectively for diagnostic assay development of Malsoor virus and AdV. Sensitivity and specificity of assays were calculated and optimized assays were used to screen bat samples. RESULTS: Molecular diagnostic assays were developed for screening of Malsoor virus and AdV and those were found to be specific. Based on the experiments performed with different parameters, nested PCR was found to be more sensitive than real-time PCR; however, for rapid screening, real-time PCR can be used and further nested PCR can be used for final confirmation or in those laboratories where real-time facility/expertise is not existing. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the development and optimization of nested RT-PCR and a TaqMan-based real-time PCR for Malsoor virus and AdV. The diagnostic assays can be used for rapid detection of these novel viruses to understand their prevalence among bat population.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.056882021,0.119974607,0.23890180600000002,0.10601737800000001,0.141326079,0.015298411999999999,0.110610167,0.024108517000000003,-0.054014808,0.007865783000000001,-0.093712441,-0.12014512699999999,0.022437632000000002,0.074212766,-0.013403578999999999,-0.032719288,0.053669892000000004,0.021269613,0.018648896,-0.13263339999999998,0.028837259,0.052496716,0.050534876,-0.08922359699999999,-0.039749168,0.042775139000000004,0.11089303199999999,-0.06058139,0.001215725,0.025957347000000002
1339,Development of a multiplex RT-PCR for simultaneous diagnosis of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) from clinical specimens,"Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) are ubiquitous respiratory viral pathogens. They belong to the family Paramyxoviridae (subfamily Pneumovirinae) and is responsible for acute respiratory tract infections in children, elderly and immunocompromised patients. We designed and tested a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) as a cost-effective alternative to real-time PCR and cell culture based detection for HMPV and HRSV. The newly developed PCR was used to screen nasal/throat swab samples from 356 patients with suspected acute respiratory infection attending the Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. The method was compared with a commercially available kit employing real time PCR, for its sensitivity and specificity. 53 (14.9 %) samples were positive for at least one tested pathogen by mRT-PCR. All except one among the positive samples showed similar pathogen profile when tested using real time PCR. 8 (15.1 %) among these 53 were positive for HRSVA, 33 (62.3 %) positive for HRSVB and 12 (22.6 %) were positive for HMPV. 17 (32.7 %) samples showed co-infections in them. Sensitivity and specificity of the mRT-PCR was comparable to that of the commercial kit. Our findings indicate that this newly developed mRT-PCR can be used as a cost-effective alternative for laboratory diagnosis of HMPV/HRSV infection and will significantly reduce diagnostic costs for these viruses in clinical settings.

1341,Rapid Detection of Cyprinid Herpesvirus 3 in Latently Infected Koi (Cyprinus carpio) by Recombinase Polymerase Amplification,"Since the emergence of cyprinid herpes virus 3 (CyHV-3), outbreaks have been devastating to koi and common carp leading to high economic losses. Current diagnostics for detecting CyHV-3 are limited in sensitivity and are further complicated by latency. Here we describe the detection of CyHV-3 by recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). The RPA assay can detect as low as 10 copies of CyHV-3 genome by an isothermal reaction and yields results in approximately 20 minutes. Using the RPA assay, CyHV-3 genome can be detected in total DNA of white blood cells isolated from koi latently infected with CyHV-3, while less than 10% of the latently infected koi can be detected by a real-time PCR assay in total DNA of white blood cells. In addition, RPA products can be detected in a lateral flow device that is cheap, fast, and can be used outside of the diagnostic lab. The RPA assay and lateral flow device provide for the rapid, sensitive, and specific amplification of CyHV-3 that with future modifications for field use and validation could lead to enhanced surveillance and early diagnosis of CyHV-3 in the laboratory and field.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.010558821000000001,0.08218756299999999,0.294394622,0.058441999999999994,-0.100250715,-0.057308947,0.058163087999999995,0.0225737,-0.000375385,-0.075445535,-0.093152346,0.017903566,-0.015504838,-0.087668145,-0.081875413,0.129479816,-0.116002034,-0.105435809,0.211369561,0.317905129,0.09762068300000001,-0.016939871000000002,0.04266525,-0.081303424,-0.137261239,0.06987568200000001,0.028627805,0.079586546,0.018141125,-0.010619304
1352,Trends and advances in food analysis by real-time polymerase chain reaction,"Analyses to ensure food safety and quality are more relevant now because of rapid changes in the quantity, diversity and mobility of food. Food-contamination must be determined to maintain health and up-hold laws, as well as for ethical and cultural concerns. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a rapid and inexpensive quantitative method to detect the presence of targeted DNA-segments in samples, helps in determining both accidental and intentional adulterations of foods by biological contaminants. This review presents recent developments in theory, techniques, and applications of RT-PCR in food analyses, RT-PCR addresses the limitations of traditional food analyses in terms of sensitivity, range of analytes, multiplexing ability, cost, time, and point-of-care applications. A range of targets, including species of plants or animals which are used as food ingredients, food-borne bacteria or viruses, genetically modified organisms, and allergens, even in highly processed foods can be identified by RT-PCR, even at very low concentrations. Microfluidic RT-PCR eliminates the separate sample-processing step to create opportunities for point-of-care analyses. We also cover the challenges related to using RT-PCR for food analyses, such as the need to further improve sample handling.

1393,Early Detection of Dengue Virus by Use of Reverse Transcription-Recombinase Polymerase Amplification,"A method for the rapid diagnosis of early dengue virus (DENV) infection is highly needed. Here, a prototype reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay was developed. The assay detected DENV RNA in <20 min without the need for thermocycling amplification. The assay enabled the detection of as few as 10 copies of DENV RNA. The designed RT-RPA primers and exo probe detected the DENV genome of at least 12 genotypes of DENV circulating globally without cross-reacting with other arboviruses. We assessed the diagnostic performance of the RT-RPA assay for the detection of DENV RNA in 203 serum samples of patients with clinically suspected dengue. The sera were simultaneously tested for DENV using a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and IgM- and IgG-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Acute DENV infection was confirmed in 130 samples and 61 of the samples (46.9%) were classified as viremic with qRT-PCR. The RT-RPA assay showed good concordance (κ of ≥0.723) with the RT-LAMP and qRT-PCR assays in detecting the dengue viremic samples. When used in combination with ELISA, both the RT-RPA and RT-LAMP assays increased the detection of acute DENV infection to ≥95.7% (≥45/47) in samples obtained within 5 days of illness. The results from the study suggest that the RT-RPA assay is the most rapid molecular diagnostic tool available for the detection of DENV. Hence, it is possible to use the RT-RPA assay in a laboratory to complement routine serology testing for dengue.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.043750937999999996,0.141878699,0.355815649,0.117728955,-0.06797951099999999,-0.10879302199999999,0.021194131,0.024189806,-0.045830825,-0.12282641,-0.040920341,0.071351257,-0.098071227,0.07153278099999999,-0.123027334,0.09813442,0.022615514,-0.022982938999999997,0.081145698,0.178394997,0.020797041000000002,-0.013054403999999999,-0.056342988,0.043616452,0.009088969,0.112915935,0.06418613,0.00956871,0.067887842,-0.033241871
1398,Recombinase polymerase amplification as a promising tool in hepatitis C virus diagnosis,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection represents a significant health problem and represents a heavy load on some countries like Egypt in which about 20% of the total population are infected. Initial infection is usually asymptomatic and result in chronic hepatitis that give rise to complications including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The management of HCV infection should not only be focus on therapy, but also to screen carrier individuals in order to prevent transmission. In the present, molecular detection and quantification of HCV genome by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) represent the gold standard in HCV diagnosis and plays a crucial role in the management of therapeutic regimens. However, real time PCR is a complicated approach and of limited distribution.

In this study, development of Reverse Transcription-Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) assay based on the 3D polymerase gene for specific and rapid detection FMD virus (FMDV) was carried out. The assay was optimised with viral RNA extracted from serotype O, A and Asia 1 FMDV vaccine strains, which resulted a reliable amplification at 65 °C for 60 min. The amplified RT-LAMP products were identified by agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining or observation by naked eye for the presence of turbidity and colour change following the addition of hydroxyl naphthol blue (HNB). The specificity of the assay was demonstrated by the absence of amplification of genome extracted from other viruses or cellular origin. With respect to analytical sensitivity the developed RT-LAMP assay was found more sensitive than routinely used multiplex PCR (mPCR). Further, the assay was evaluated with RNA extracted from cell cultured isolates (n = 50), tongue epithelial samples (n = 150) and semen samples from infected bulls (n = 13). In conclusion, RT-LAMP with HNB dye was shown to be simple, specific and sensitive assay for rapid diagnosis of FMDV infection. Further, the assay has the potential for field deployment and use for rapid FMDV surveillance in India.

1438,"A One‐Step RT‐PCR Array for Detection and Differentiation of Zoonotic Influenza Viruses H5N1, H9N2, and H1N1","BACKGROUND: Rapid and comprehensive pathogen identification is crucial in zoonotic influenza diagnosis. METHODS: By optimizing the design of primers and probes and reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) conditions, we achieved simultaneous detection of multiple influenza and zoonotic influenza viruses, including H1N1, H5N1, and H9N2 strains, in a one‐step, quantitative real‐time RT‐PCR array (rRT‐PCR array) of RNA from multiple influenza strains utilizing a single set of conditions for RT‐PCR amplification. The target sequences from all targeted zoonotic influenza viruses were cloned into recombinant RNA virus particles, which were used to evaluate sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of the zoonotic influenza viruses RT‐PCR array. RESULTS: The detection limit of the array was shown to be between 10(0) and 10(1) copies per reaction, and the standard curve demonstrated a linear range from 10 to 10(6) copies. Thus, the analytical sensitivity of this zoonotic influenza viruses RT‐PCR array is 10–100 times higher than conventional RT‐PCR. Specificity of the one‐step zoonotic influenza viruses RT‐PCR array was verified by comparison of results obtained with retroviral‐like particles (RVPs), which contained RNA from isolates of seasonal influenza viruses, zoonotic influenza viruses, and other pathogens known to cause acute respiratory disease. CONCLUSION: The high sensitivity, rapidity, reproducibility, and specificity of this zoonotic influenza viruses rRT‐PCR array has been verified as being sufficient to detect the presence of multiple zoonotic influenza viruses in a single assay. The zoonotic influenza viruses RT‐PCR array might provide rapid identification of emergent zoonotic influenza viruses strains during influenza outbreaks and disease surveillance initiatives.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.11083630900000001,-0.005256245,0.173801005,0.286034367,0.038084671,0.219394833,-0.112834688,0.019307419,-0.068221904,-0.073940907,0.021375805,-0.008710606,0.00083605,0.078291923,-0.005533885,-0.017064382,0.046960246,-0.02349199,-0.017158907,-0.072186873,0.015487353,0.043149081,0.022584101000000002,0.051592937,-0.037833103,-0.013768606000000001,0.012659936,-0.021652385,0.034014685,0.00014836799999999999
1449,Rapid detection of human rotavirus using NSP4 gene specific reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay,"The seasonal outbreaks of human rotavirus (RV) infection occur every winter. Most patients are diagnosed clinically by a rapid latex agglutination detection kit or polymerase chain reaction assays for RV from stool samples, but some problems have been reported on the specificity and sensitivity of such rapid detection assays. To ratify these issues, a sensitive, specific, simple, and rapid nucleic acid based diagnostic method is expected to be introduced and the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was developed to detect the RV in human stool samples by incubation at 60 °C for 1 h and amplification was confirmed by electrophoretic laddering, restriction enzyme digestion, and hydroxynapthol blue discoloration. The assay established in this study was found to detect only the RVs and no cross-reaction with other viruses, demonstrating its high specificity.

1471,Development of a Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay for Rapid Detection of Capripoxviruses,"Sheep pox (SP), goat pox (GP), and lumpy skin disease (LSD), caused by capripoxviruses (CaPVs), are economically important diseases of sheep, goats, and cattle, respectively. Here, we report the development of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for rapid detection of CaPVs. LAMP primers were designed to target a conserved gene encoding the poly(A) polymerase small subunit (VP39) of CaPVs. Hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) was incorporated to monitor assay progress by color change from violet when negative to sky blue when positive, and results were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The LAMP assay was shown to be highly specific for CaPVs, with no apparent cross-reactivity to other related viruses (near neighbors) or viruses that cause similar clinical signs (look-a-like viruses). The performance of LAMP was compared to that of a highly sensitive quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay. LAMP and qPCR exhibited similar analytical sensitivities, with limits of detection of 3 and 8 viral genome copies, respectively. Diagnostic specificity was assessed on 36 negative specimens, including swabs and EDTA blood from control sheep, goats, and cattle. Diagnostic sensitivity was assessed on 275 specimens, including EDTA blood, swabs, and tissues from experimentally infected sheep, goats, and cattle. Overall agreement on diagnostic test results between the two assays was 90 to 95% for specificity and 89 to 100% for sensitivity. The LAMP assay described in this report is simple to use, inexpensive, highly sensitive, and particularly well suited for the diagnosis of capripox in less well equipped laboratories and in rural settings where resources are limited.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.029813895,0.08556999400000001,0.276265191,0.077993652,-0.062103458,-0.053037194,0.030325941000000002,0.002617321,-0.007973437,-0.056315555,-0.054155441,0.026059501000000002,-0.017266503,0.004457336,-0.093731915,0.030487212000000003,0.01905015,0.023677371000000003,-0.094682167,0.018615333,-0.113235406,-0.064066398,-0.045120112999999996,0.160888428,0.080066722,0.022345377000000003,-0.08717448900000001,0.052930415,-0.077049708,-0.044924262
1497,"Development and Initial Results of a Low Cost, Disposable, Point-of-Care Testing Device for Pathogen Detection","Development of small footprint, disposable, fast, and inexpensive devices for pathogen detection in the field and clinic would benefit human and veterinary medicine by allowing evidence-based responses to future out breaks. We designed and tested an integrated nucleic acid extraction and amplification device employing a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) or reverse transcriptase-LAMP assay. Our system provides a screening tool with polymerase-chain-reaction-level sensitivity and specificity for outbreak detection, response, and recovery. Time to result is ~90 min. The device utilizes a swab that collects sample and then transfers it to a disc of cellulose-based nucleic acid binding paper. The disc is positioned within a disposable containment tube with a manual loading port. In order to test for the presence of target pathogens, LAMP reagents are loaded through the tube’s port into contact with the sample containing cellulose disc. The reagents then are isothermally heated to 63°C for ~1 h to achieve sequence-specific target nucleic acid amplification. Due to the presence of a colorimetric dye, amplification induces visible color change in the reagents from purple to blue.

A previously described pan-Orthopoxvirus assay, based on a broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS), was evaluated for its ability to detect MPXV from spiked human and aerosol-infected cynomolgous macaque (Macaca fascicularis) samples. Detection of MPXV DNA from macaque tissue, blood, and spiked human blood by the PCR/ESI-MS pan-Orthopoxvirus assay was comparable, albeit at slightly higher levels, to the current gold standard method of real-time PCR with the pan-Orthopoxvirus assay and had a limit of detection of 200 plaque-forming units. Furthermore, the platform was able to distinguish MPXV and vaccinia viruses that were spiked into macaque blood samples at various concentrations.

1582,Rapid Detection of Norovirus from Fecal Specimens by Real-Time Reverse Transcription-Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay,"In this study, we developed a one-step, single-tube genogroup-specific reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the detection of norovirus (NoV) genomes targeting from the C terminus of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene to the capsid N-terminal/shell domain region. This is the first report on the development of an RT-LAMP assay for the detection of NoV genomes. Because of the diversity of NoV genotypes, we used 9 and 13 specially designed primers containing mixed bases for genogroup I (GI) and II (GII), respectively. The RT-LAMP assay had the advantages of rapidity, simplicity, specificity, and selectively and could obtain results within 90 min, generally even within 60 min, under isothermal conditions at 62°C. The detection limits for NoV genomes were between 10(2) and 10(3) copies/tube for GI and GII with differentiation by genotype, and no cross-reactions among NoV GI and GII and other gastroenteritis viruses, such as sapovirus, human astrovirus, adenovirus type 40 and 41, and group A and C rotavirus, were found. In the evaluation tests with fecal specimens obtained from gastroenteritis outbreaks, the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay with regard to RT-PCR were 100 and 94% for GI and 100 and 100% for GII, respectively.

In addition to detection of fastidious microorganisms, more rapid detection by molecular methods is now possible for pathogens of public health importance. Molecular methods have now progressed beyond identification to detect antimicrobial resistance genes and provide public health information such as strain characterisation by genotyping. Treatment of certain microorganisms has been improved by viral resistance detection and viral load testing for the monitoring of responses to antiviral therapies. With the advent of multiplex PCR, real-time PCR and improvements in efficiency through automation, the costs of molecular methods are decreasing such that the role of molecular methods will further increase.

STAR demonstrated similar or better sensitivity and precision compared to two commonly used methods, SYBR Green-based and TaqMan probe-based real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. STAR can be used as a flexible platform for building a variety of applications to monitor gene expression, from single gene assays to assays analyzing the expression level of multiple genes. Using severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus as a model system, STAR technology detected single copies of the viral genome in a two-gene multiplex. Blinded studies using RNA extracted from various tissues of a SARS-infected individual showed that STAR correctly identified all samples containing SARS virus and yielded negative results for non-SARS control samples. Using alternate priming strategies, STAR technology can be adapted to transcriptional profiling studies without requiring a priori sequence information.

1712,Rapid and biologically safe diagnosis of African swine fever virus infection by using polymerase chain reaction.,"In order to circumvent the need for infectious virus for the diagnosis of African swine fever (ASF), we established the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique for the detection of ASF virus (ASFV) DNA. A 740-bp fragment that originated from the conserved region of the viral genome was partially sequenced. From this sequence, four PCR primers and one oligonucleotide probe were designed and synthesized. A specific 640-bp PCR product was amplified by using oligonucleotides 1 and 5 as primers and extracts of the following samples as templates: organs and plasma obtained from ASFV-infected pigs, ASFV-infected cell cultures, and cloned DNA fragments containing the same conserved genomic region as that in the original 740-bp clone. No specific reaction products were observed in the corresponding controls. The identities of the PCR products were confirmed either by a second amplification with nested primers or by hybridization with a specific, biotinylated oligonucleotide probe. PCR proved to be a quicker and more sensitive method than virus isolation followed by the hemadsorption test when spleen and plasma samples from experimentally ASFV-infected pigs were tested. Furthermore, cloned virus DNA could be used as a positive control in the place of a live virus control.

1792,Reverse transcription strand invasion based amplification (RT-SIBA): a method for rapid detection of influenza A and B,"Rapid and accurate diagnosis of influenza viruses plays an important role in infection control, as well as in preventing the misuse of antibiotics. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods offer significant advantages over the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), since they are more rapid and do not require the sophisticated instruments needed for thermal cycling. We previously described a novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification method, ‘Strand Invasion Based Amplification’ (SIBA®), with high analytical sensitivity and specificity, for the detection of DNA. In this study, we describe the development of a variant of the SIBA method, namely, reverse transcription SIBA (RT-SIBA), for the rapid detection of viral RNA targets. The RT-SIBA method includes a reverse transcriptase enzyme that allows one-step reverse transcription of RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA) and simultaneous amplification and detection of the cDNA by SIBA under isothermal reaction conditions. The RT-SIBA method was found to be more sensitive than PCR for the detection of influenza A and B and could detect 100 copies of influenza RNA within 15 min. The development of RT-SIBA will enable rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral RNA targets within point-of-care or central laboratory settings.

1794,Viral RNA extraction for in-the-field analysis,"Abstract Retroviruses encode their genetic information with RNA molecules, and have a high genomic recombination rate which allows them to mutate more rapidly, thereby posting a higher risk to humans. One important way to help combat a pandemic of viral infectious diseases is early detection before large-scale outbreaks occur. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) have been used to identify precisely different strains of some very closely related pathogens. However, isolation and detection of viral RNA in the field are difficult due to the unstable nature of viral RNA molecules. Consequently, performing in-the-field nucleic acid analysis to monitor the spread of viruses is financially and technologically challenging in remote and underdeveloped regions that are high-risk areas for outbreaks. A simplified rapid viral RNA extraction method is reported to meet the requirements for in-the-field viral RNA extraction and detection. The ability of this device to perform viral RNA extraction with subsequent RT-PCR detection of retrovirus is demonstrated. This inexpensive device has the potential to be distributed on a large scale to underdeveloped regions for early detection of retrovirus, with the possibility of reducing viral pandemic events.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.064472873,0.034002676,0.137800003,0.154854364,-0.009367727,-0.061026357999999996,0.030299429,0.043872493,-0.055942489000000005,0.092322893,0.047518335,-0.029374567,0.035537727000000005,-7.32e-05,0.030430396000000002,0.008120931999999999,-0.048701318,0.005944652,-0.063476416,-0.007250093000000001,-0.055477887000000004,0.033704118,-0.048489157000000005,-0.002328345,-0.039938647,-0.052350527,0.056989795,-0.046514857,-0.023250196,0.08537538199999999
1796,Development of a Rapid Fluorescent Immunochromatographic Test to Detect Respiratory Syncytial Virus,"Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most common viruses infecting the respiratory tracts of infants. The rapid and sensitive detection of RSV is important to minimize the incidence of infection. In this study, novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; B11A5 and E8A11) against RSV nucleoprotein (NP) were developed and applied to develop a rapid fluorescent immunochromatographic strip test (FICT), employing europium nanoparticles as the fluorescent material. For the FICT, the limits of detection of the antigen and virus were 1.25 µg/mL and 4.23 × 10(6) TCID(50)/mL, respectively, corresponding to 4.75 × 10(6) ± 5.8 ×10(5) (mean ± SD) RNA copy numbers per reaction mixture for RSV NP. A clinical study revealed a sensitivity of 90% (18/20) and specificity of 98.18% (108/110) for RSV detection when comparing the performance to that of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), representing a 15% improvement in sensitivity over the SD Bioline rapid kit.

1818,Picoliter Well Array Chip-Based Digital Recombinase Polymerase Amplification for Absolute Quantification of Nucleic Acids,"Absolute, precise quantification methods expand the scope of nucleic acids research and have many practical applications. Digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) is a powerful method for nucleic acid detection and absolute quantification. However, it requires thermal cycling and accurate temperature control, which are difficult in resource-limited conditions. Accordingly, isothermal methods, such as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), are more attractive. We developed a picoliter well array (PWA) chip with 27,000 consistently sized picoliter reactions (314 pL) for isothermal DNA quantification using digital RPA (dRPA) at 39°C. Sample loading using a scraping liquid blade was simple, fast, and required small reagent volumes (i.e., <20 μL). Passivating the chip surface using a methoxy-PEG-silane agent effectively eliminated cross-contamination during dRPA. Our creative optical design enabled wide-field fluorescence imaging in situ and both end-point and real-time analyses of picoliter wells in a 6-cm(2) area. It was not necessary to use scan shooting and stitch serial small images together. Using this method, we quantified serial dilutions of a Listeria monocytogenes gDNA stock solution from 9 × 10(-1) to 4 × 10(-3) copies per well with an average error of less than 11% (N = 15). Overall dRPA-on-chip processing required less than 30 min, which was a 4-fold decrease compared to dPCR, requiring approximately 2 h. dRPA on the PWA chip provides a simple and highly sensitive method to quantify nucleic acids without thermal cycling or precise micropump/microvalve control. It has applications in fast field analysis and critical clinical diagnostics under resource-limited settings.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.008892709,0.04115696,0.19284431600000002,0.008554575,-0.07821334,-0.023760936,0.046867034,0.018963499999999998,-0.017998363,-0.01981722,-0.086468459,0.030537094,0.013759368000000001,-0.131989385,-0.04089152,0.085987566,-0.096390503,-0.037832971,0.029502059,0.10667194099999999,-0.035602765,-0.06660015799999999,0.021176926000000002,-0.077126208,-0.066004404,-0.008201278000000001,-0.043841125,0.063033344,-0.030250138,0.028199885
1821,Multiplex isothermal solid-phase recombinase polymerase amplification for the specific and fast DNA-based detection of three bacterial pathogens,"We report on the development of an on-chip RPA (recombinase polymerase amplification) with simultaneous multiplex isothermal amplification and detection on a solid surface. The isothermal RPA was applied to amplify specific target sequences from the pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Salmonella enterica and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) using genomic DNA. Additionally, a positive plasmid control was established as an internal control. The four targets were amplified simultaneously in a quadruplex reaction. The amplicon is labeled during on-chip RPA by reverse oligonucleotide primers coupled to a fluorophore. Both amplification and spatially resolved signal generation take place on immobilized forward primers bount to expoxy-silanized glass surfaces in a pump-driven hybridization chamber. The combination of microarray technology and sensitive isothermal nucleic acid amplification at 38 °C allows for a multiparameter analysis on a rather small area. The on-chip RPA was characterized in terms of reaction time, sensitivity and inhibitory conditions. A successful enzymatic reaction is completed in <20 min and results in detection limits of 10 colony-forming units for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica and 100 colony-forming units for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The results show this method to be useful with respect to point-of-care testing and to enable simplified and miniaturized nucleic acid-based diagnostics.

1824,A duplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection of California serogroup and Cache Valley viruses,"Abstract A duplex TaqMan real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed for the detection of California (CAL) serogroup viruses and Cache Valley virus (CVV), for use in human surveillance. The targets selected for the assay were the sequences encoding the nucleocapsid protein of CAL and the G1 glycoprotein of CVV. Conserved regions were selected by aligning genetic sequences from various strains available in the GenBank database. Primers and probes were selected in conserved regions. The assay sensitivity was 75 gene copies (gc)/reaction for CAL serogroup viruses and 30 gc/reaction for CVV. The performance of the assay was linear over at least 6 log10 gc. The assay was specific, given that it did not cross-react with a variety of pathogens. It did, however, detect 11 viruses within the CAL serogroup and 12 CVV isolates. The use of an internal control ensured that possible inefficiency in nucleic acid extraction or PCR inhibition would be detected.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.006461026,0.036556572,0.16497751300000002,0.039184296,0.029826247,0.00340055,-0.0037075790000000003,-0.021690632999999997,0.007134626,-0.002301935,-0.036952637999999996,0.006747797,0.00278574,-0.014721161000000002,-0.013060041000000001,-0.051537350999999995,0.013259278000000001,-0.027461651,0.02696403,-0.015483455,0.050890305,0.01571649,0.045432429,0.022843173999999997,-0.048697738,0.030958847999999997,0.043192145,-0.000564783,0.001190386,0.030731671000000002
1826,Evaluation of real-time RT-PCR for the quantification of FCoV shedding in the faeces of domestic cats,"Faecal samples were taken from cats living in multi-cat households with endemic feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection. Total RNA was extracted from faecal suspensions and FCoV RNA was quantified using a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The real-time RT-PCR threshold cycle (C T) values were consistently high suggesting that the samples contained very little viral RNA. However, experiments in which RNA extracted from FCoV-infected cell culture supernatants was combined with RNA extracted from faecal suspensions revealed the presence of faecal factors that significantly inhibited the reverse transcription reaction. Consequently, three methods of RNA extraction were investigated and RNA dilution was undertaken to investigate whether the effects of the faecal inhibitors could be reduced. Our results show that using the QIAgen RNA mini kit for RNA extraction and dilution of the RNA samples helps to reduce the inhibitory effects. However, because the extent of the inhibitory effects varied between faecal samples, accurate quantification proved difficult. We, therefore, conclude that although real-time RT-PCR provides an excellent method for detecting the presence of viral shedding, quantification of FCoV RNA in faecal material has to take into account the possible effects of RT-PCR inhibitors. It is, therefore, essential that all new assays, and the methods of sample preparation, are carefully evaluated before being used in a clinical setting.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.073270347,0.049000724,0.12776142599999998,0.062137763,-0.013759128999999998,-0.084218623,0.009146749000000001,0.015204883999999998,-0.05785818400000001,-0.065152991,0.252223158,-0.067378805,0.065177232,0.10746208,-0.028864679,-0.008947664000000001,0.037854079,0.017218857,0.040964002,-0.042767274,-0.037387237999999996,0.050673656,0.00340317,-0.012271219,-0.044500739000000004,-0.020364245,0.044468312,-0.022554036,0.049479942,0.023335272999999997
1830,Development of a Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Assay for Detection of Epidemic Human Noroviruses,"Human norovirus is a leading cause of viral gastroenteritis worldwide. Rapid detection could facilitate control, however widespread point-of-care testing is infrequently done due to the lack of robust and portable methods. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is a novel isothermal method which rapidly amplifies and detects nucleic acids using a simple device in near real-time. An RT-RPA assay targeting a recent epidemic human norovirus strain (GII.4 New Orleans) was developed and evaluated in this study. The assay successfully detected purified norovirus RNA from multiple patient outbreak isolates and had a limit of detection of 3.40 ± 0.20 log(10) genomic copies (LGC), which is comparable to most other reported isothermal norovirus amplification methods. The assay also detected norovirus in directly boiled stool, and displayed better resistance to inhibitors than a commonly used RT-qPCR assay. The assay was specific, as it did not amplify genomes from 9 non-related enteric viruses and bacteria. The assay detected norovirus in some samples in as little as 6 min, and the entire detection process can be performed in less than 30 min. The reported RT-RPA method shows promise for sensitive point-of-care detection of epidemic human norovirus, and is the fastest human norovirus amplification method to date.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.020062846000000002,0.09286879599999999,0.274760196,0.098683492,-0.05210244,-0.052948268,0.07884244900000001,0.025620304,-0.017735271,-0.040425376,-0.064614983,0.08586924300000001,-0.034580493,-0.061559905,-0.040446334,0.02825644,-0.073869116,-0.014312093,0.11401448900000001,0.202843975,0.063812539,0.023353996000000002,-0.040904222999999997,0.044850865,-0.061906906,0.021313201,0.040859854,0.051856945999999994,0.058797774000000004,-0.01184554
1835,Comparative evaluation of commercially available manual and automated nucleic acid extraction methods for rotavirus RNA detection in stools,"Abstract Rotaviruses are a major cause of viral gastroenteritis in children. For accurate and sensitive detection of rotavirus RNA from stool samples by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the extraction process must be robust. However, some extraction methods may not remove the strong RT-PCR inhibitors known to be present in stool samples. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the performance of six extraction methods used commonly for extraction of rotavirus RNA from stool, which have never been formally evaluated: the MagNA Pure Compact, KingFisher Flex and NucliSENS® easyMAG® instruments, the NucliSENS® miniMAG® semi-automated system, and two manual purification kits, the QIAamp Viral RNA kit and a modified RNaid® kit. Using each method, total nucleic acid or RNA was extracted from eight rotavirus-positive stool samples with enzyme immunoassay optical density (EIA OD) values ranging from 0.176 to 3.098. Extracts prepared using the MagNA Pure Compact instrument yielded the most consistent results by qRT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR. When extracts prepared from a dilution series were extracted by the 6 methods and tested, rotavirus RNA was detected in all samples by qRT-PCR but by conventional RT-PCR testing, only the MagNA Pure Compact and KingFisher Flex extracts were positive in all cases. RT-PCR inhibitors were detected in extracts produced with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit. The findings of this study should prove useful for selection of extraction methods to be incorporated into future rotavirus detection and genotyping protocols.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.006304258,0.061045058,0.17468880399999998,0.092269037,-0.0029752990000000003,-0.09934001699999999,0.00342007,0.004505402,-0.059282479000000006,0.008143201,0.082016235,0.003575498,-0.037990636,0.09022868099999999,0.038182047000000004,-0.021704615,0.042584524000000006,0.005349657,-3.39e-05,-0.135474755,-0.043803918,0.102353826,-0.031885121,-0.017943483,0.013840755,-0.024871435,0.033741609,-0.070967236,0.032988057,0.033485956000000004
1838,Survey and Visual Detection of Zaire ebolavirus in Clinical Samples Targeting the Nucleoprotein Gene in Sierra Leone,"Ebola virus (EBOV) can lead to severe hemorrhagic fever with a high risk of death in humans and other primates. To guide treatment and prevent spread of the viral infection, a rapid and sensitive detection method is required for clinical samples. Here, we described and evaluated a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method to detect Zaire ebolavirus using the nucleoprotein gene (NP) as a target sequence. Two different techniques were used, a calcein/Mn(2+) complex chromogenic method and real-time turbidity monitoring. The RT-LAMP assay detected the NP target sequence with a limit of 4.56 copies/μL within 45 min under 61°C, a similar even or increase in sensitivity than that of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Additionally, all pseudoviral particles or non- Zaire EBOV genomes were negative for LAMP detection, indicating that the assay was highly specific for EBOV. To appraise the availability of the RT-LAMP method for use in clinical diagnosis of EBOV, of 417 blood or swab samples collected from patients with clinically suspected infections in Sierra Leone, 307 were identified for RT-LAMP-based surveillance of EBOV. Therefore, the highly specific and sensitive RT-LAMP method allows the rapid detection of EBOV, and is a suitable tool for clinical screening, diagnosis, and primary quarantine purposes.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.051803827000000004,0.120014614,0.32115851,0.102532056,-0.072328961,-0.073583648,0.006069743000000001,0.01471766,-0.022468985,-0.04309267,-0.048808616,0.018379515,-0.016155967,0.050456797000000005,-0.086268975,0.041107475,0.041143491000000004,0.09032340300000001,-0.15390753,0.020097375,-0.112442196,-0.058710187000000004,-0.11769969,0.20410608800000002,0.134355491,0.018007395,-0.049399378,0.08496291,-0.052828175,0.006125212
1841,Human virome in nasopharynx and tracheal secretion samples,"BACKGROUND: In Brazil the implementation of the Sentinel Surveillance System of Influenza began in 2000. Central public health laboratories use reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for diagnosis of respiratory viruses, but this protocol identifies only specific targets, resulted in inconclusive diagnosis for many samples. Thus, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) would be complementary method in the identification of pathogens in inconclusive samples for RT-qPCR or other specific detection protocols. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to detect unidentified viruses using HTS approach in negative samples of nasopharynx/tracheal secretions by the standard RT-qPCR collected in the Federal District, Brazil. METHODS: Nucleic acids were extracted from samples collected in winter period of 2016 and subjected to HTS. The results were confirmed by the multiplex PR21 RT-qPCR, which identifies 21 respiratory pathogens. FINDINGS: The main viruses identified by HTS were of families Herpesviridae, Coronaviridae, Parvoviridae and Picornaviridae, with the emphasis on rhinoviruses.

1846,Development and Evaluation of Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay for Rapid and Real-Time Detection of the Swine-Origin Influenza A H1N1 Virus,"The recent emergence of the swine-origin influenza A H1N1 virus (S-OIV) poses a serious global health threat. Rapid detection and differentiation of S-OIV from seasonal influenza is crucial for patient management and control of the epidemics. A one-step, single-tube accelerated and quantitative S-OIV-specific H1 reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RTLAMP) assay for clinical diagnosis of S-OIV by targeting the H1 gene is reported in this article. A comparative evaluation of the H1-specific RTLAMP assay vis-à-vis the World Health Organization-approved real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR), involving 239 acute-phase throat swab samples, demonstrated exceptionally higher sensitivity by picking up all of the 116 H1N1-positive cases and 36 additional positive cases among the negatives that were sequence-confirmed as S-OIV H1N1. None of the real-time RTPCR-positive samples were missed by the RTLAMP system. The comparative analysis revealed that S-OIV RTLAMP was up to tenfold more sensitive than the World Health Organization real-time RTPCR; it had a detection limit of 0.1 tissue culture infectious dosage of 50/ml. One of the most attractive features of this isothermal gene amplification assay is that it seems to have an advantage in monitoring gene amplification by means of SYBR Green I dye-mediated naked-eye visualization within 30 minutes compared to 2 to 3 hours for a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. This suggests that the RTLAMP assay is a valuable tool for rapid, real-time detection and quantification of S-OIV in acute-phase throat swab samples without requiring sophisticated equipment.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.082792499,0.078696066,0.209457253,0.097071937,-0.039979571,0.05757633,-0.07168378,0.025744505,-0.017194896,-0.06993510900000001,-0.049364434000000006,0.010316864,0.0021370770000000002,-0.021616451000000002,-0.016019866,0.00599818,-0.014536023,-0.01197448,0.010165428,-0.021079241000000002,-0.014727,-0.014382913,-0.027050683,-0.050878768,-0.086094208,0.028298635,-0.035519733,0.06875018599999999,-0.011365491,0.007463603
1854,"Field-deployable, quantitative, rapid identification of active Ebola virus infection in unprocessed blood","The West African Ebola virus outbreak underlined the importance of delivering mass diagnostic capability outside the clinical or primary care setting in effectively containing public health emergencies caused by infectious disease. Yet, to date, there is no solution for reliably deploying at the point of need the gold standard diagnostic method, real time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), in a laboratory infrastructure-free manner. In this proof of principle work, we demonstrate direct performance of RT-qPCR on fresh blood using far-red fluorophores to resolve fluorogenic signal inhibition and controlled, rapid freeze/thawing to achieve viral genome extraction in a single reaction chamber assay. The resulting process is entirely free of manual or automated sample pre-processing, requires no microfluidics or magnetic/mechanical sample handling and thus utilizes low cost consumables. This enables a fast, laboratory infrastructure-free, minimal risk and simple standard operating procedure suited to frontline, field use. Developing this novel approach on recombinant bacteriophage and recombinant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; Lentivirus), we demonstrate clinical utility in symptomatic EBOV patient screening using live, infectious Filoviruses and surrogate patient samples. Moreover, we evidence assay co-linearity independent of viral particle structure that may enable viral load quantification through pre-calibration, with no loss of specificity across an 8 log-linear maximum dynamic range. The resulting quantitative rapid identification (QuRapID) molecular diagnostic platform, openly accessible for assay development, meets the requirements of resource-limited countries and provides a fast response solution for mass public health screening against emerging biosecurity threats.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.010904516000000001,0.065564775,0.168352554,0.048877021,-0.089425314,0.009793004000000001,0.047151437000000004,0.020266074,0.007204005,0.038836597,-0.023214846,-0.023048582999999997,0.052341469,-0.05148420099999999,-0.00295481,0.011531943999999999,-0.049377448,0.0144976,-0.045384249,-0.002793825,-0.032648735,-0.00701675,-0.02378968,-0.032967229,-0.040433647,0.009342318,0.046272202000000005,-0.011448835,-0.03686382,0.029387101000000002
1864,Recent advances in lab-on-a-chip technologies for viral diagnosis,"Abstract The global risk of viral disease outbreaks emphasizes the need for rapid, accurate, and sensitive detection techniques to speed up diagnostics allowing early intervention. An emerging field of microfluidics also known as the lab-on-a-chip (LOC) or micro total analysis system includes a wide range of diagnostic devices. This review briefly covers both conventional and microfluidics-based techniques for rapid viral detection. We first describe conventional detection methods such as cell culturing, immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These methods often have limited speed, sensitivity, or specificity and are performed with typically bulky equipment. Here, we discuss some of the LOC technologies that can overcome these demerits, highlighting the latest advances in LOC devices for viral disease diagnosis. We also discuss the fabrication of LOC systems to produce devices for performing either individual steps or virus detection in samples with the sample to answer method. The complete system consists of sample preparation, and ELISA and RT-PCR for viral-antibody and nucleic acid detection, respectively. Finally, we formulate our opinions on these areas for the future development of LOC systems for viral diagnostics.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.033238553,0.069631901,0.244904001,0.081089075,-0.09872162,-0.020803943999999998,0.0786081,0.007136811,-0.006988799,0.076758485,-0.044799356,-0.023320584,0.079235384,-0.07343889999999999,0.006683144,-0.002558478,-0.017232339,-0.001581207,-0.09459848800000001,-0.025419514,-0.074743192,-0.042703125,0.014297477,-0.039876755,0.010493676,-0.021085181,0.018806846999999998,-0.040753766000000004,-0.064954078,0.065834424
1877,A duplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection of St. Louis encephalitis and eastern equine encephalitis viruses,"Abstract A duplex TaqMan real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed for the detection of St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), for use in human and vector surveillance. The respective targets selected for the assay were the conserved NS5 and E1 genes of the 2 viruses. Because of the insufficient number of NS5 sequences from SLEV strains in the GenBank database, we determined the sequence of an approximately 1-kb region for each of 25 strains of SLEV to select primers and probes in a conserved region. Our assay has a sensitivity of 5 gene copies (gc)/reaction for EEEV and 10 gc/reaction for SLEV, and its performance is linear for at least 6 log10 gc. The assay is specific and detected all strains of SLEV (69) and EEEV (12) that were tested.

1885,Comparative evaluation of a laboratory-developed real-time PCR assay and RealStar® Adenovirus PCR Kit for quantitative detection of human adenovirus,"BACKGROUND: Human adenoviruses are common causes of community-acquired respiratory tract and enteric infections. Severe disseminated infections with high mortality rates may be seen in immunocompromised individuals. An accurate and cost-effective quantitative assay is essential not only for laboratory diagnosis of adenoviral infections, but also for monitoring of response to antiviral treatment. The diagnostic performance of an in-house quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay was compared to a commercial system. METHODS: The analytical sensitivity, specificity, linearity, precision and accuracy of an in-house adenovirus quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay were evaluated against the RealStar® Adenovirus PCR Kit (Altona Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany), using 122 clinical specimens and 18 proficiency testing samples. RESULTS: Linear regression analysis of the quantitative results by the in-house assay showed the dynamic range from 2.60 to 9 log(10) (plasma) and 2.94 to 9 log(10) (viral transport medium) copies/mL, with the coefficient of determination (R(2)) of 0.996 and 0.998, respectively. A dilution series demonstrated the limits of detection and lower limits of quantification for plasma were 2.06 log(10) and 2.60 log(10) copies/mL and those for viral transport medium were 2.31 log(10) and 2.94 log(10) copies/mL respectively. The precision of the in-house assay was highly reproducible among runs with coefficients of variance ranging from 0.07 to 3.21% for plasma and 0.17% to 2.11% for viral transport medium. A comparison of 52 matched samples showed an excellent correlation between the quantitative viral loads measured by the in-house assay and the RealStar® Adenovirus PCR Kit (R(2) = 0.984), with an average bias of − 0.16 log(10) copies/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The in-house adenovirus assay is a sensitive and reliable assay with lower cost for the detection and quantification of adenoviral DNA when compared to the RealStar® Adenovirus PCR Kit.

1892,A novel quantitative PCR mediated by high-fidelity DNA polymerase,"The biggest challenge for accurate diagnosis of viral infectious disease is the high genetic variability of involved viruses, which affects amplification efficiency and results in low sensitivity and narrow spectrum. Here, we developed a new simple qPCR mediated by high-fidelity (HF) DNA polymerase. The new method utilizes an HFman probe and one primer. Fluorescent signal was generated from the 3′–5′ hydrolysis of HFman probe by HF DNA polymerase before elongation initiation. Mismatches between probe/primer and template have less influence on the amplification efficiency of the new method. The new qPCR exhibited higher sensitivity and better adaptability to sequence variable templates than the conventional TaqMan probe based-qPCR in quantification of HIV-1 viral load. Further comparison with COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test (v2.0) showed a good correlation coefficient (R(2) = 0.79) between both methods in quantification of HIV-1 viral load among 21 clinical samples. The characteristics of tolerance to variable templates and one probe-one primer system imply that the probe/primer design for the new method will be easier and more flexible than the conventional method for highly heterogeneous viruses. Therefore, the HF DNA polymerase-mediated qPCR method is a simple, sensitive and promising approach for the development of diagnostics for viral infectious diseases.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.033393585,0.028022183,0.152466026,0.040041072000000004,-0.070777071,-0.016199306,0.0632607,-0.011380577,-0.023367521000000002,0.051106455,-0.019790661,0.00082982,0.034172068,-0.058565094000000005,-0.007710304,0.019575527,-0.043334494,-0.012320816000000002,-0.046796650999999995,-0.010871106,-0.046787367999999996,-0.010856188999999999,-0.005557851,0.050339197999999995,-0.033809274,-0.054043093,-0.039101343999999996,0.00200641,-0.051399506,0.064279442

We aimed to demonstrate capacity of the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RT-PCR/ESI-MS) platform to identify clinical relevant respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples and compare the diagnostic performance characteristics relative to conventional culture- and antigen-based methods. An RT-PCR/ESI-MS respiratory virus surveillance kit designed to detect respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1–4, Adenoviridae types A–F, Coronaviridae, human bocavirus, and human metapneumovirus was evaluated using both mock-ups and frozen archived NPA (N = 280), 95 of which were positive by clinical virology methods. RT-PCR/ESI-MS detected 74/95 (77.9%) known positive samples and identified an additional 13/185 (7%) from culture-negative samples. Viruses that are nondetectable with conventional methods were also identified. Viral load was semiquantifiable and ranged from 2400 to >320 000 copies/mL. Time to results was 8 h.

1906,A Field-Deployable Reverse Transcription Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Assay for Rapid Detection of the Chikungunya Virus,"BACKGROUND: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus currently transmitted in about 60 countries. CHIKV causes acute flu-like symptoms and in many cases prolonged musculoskeletal and joint pain. Detection of the infection is mostly done using RT-RCR or ELISA, which are not suitable for point-of-care diagnosis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, a reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay for the detection of the CHIKV was developed. The assay sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reactivity were tested. CHIKV RT-RPA assay detected down to 80 genome copies/reaction in a maximum of 15 minutes. It successfully identified 18 isolates representing the three CHIKV genotypes. No cross-reactivity was detected to other alphaviruses and arboviruses except O'nyong'nyong virus, which could be differentiated by a modified RPA primer pair. Seventy-eight samples were screened both by RT-RPA and real-time RT-PCR. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the CHIKV RT-RPA assay were determined at 100%.

1911,"A Simple, Inexpensive Device for Nucleic Acid Amplification without Electricity—Toward Instrument-Free Molecular Diagnostics in Low-Resource Settings","BACKGROUND: Molecular assays targeted to nucleic acid (NA) markers are becoming increasingly important to medical diagnostics. However, these are typically confined to wealthy, developed countries; or, to the national reference laboratories of developing-world countries. There are many infectious diseases that are endemic in low-resource settings (LRS) where the lack of simple, instrument-free, NA diagnostic tests is a critical barrier to timely treatment. One of the primary barriers to the practicality and availability of NA assays in LRS has been the complexity and power requirements of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrumentation (another is sample preparation). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this article, we investigate the hypothesis that an electricity-free heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays. We assess the heater's equivalence to commercially available PCR instruments through the characterization of the temperature profiles produced, and a minimal method comparison. Versions of the prototype for several different isothermal techniques are presented. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that an electricity-free heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays, and that the results of those assays are not significantly different from ones incubated in parallel in commercially available PCR instruments. These results clearly suggest the potential of the non-instrumented nucleic acid amplification (NINA) heater for molecular diagnostics in LRS. When combined with other innovations in development that eliminate power requirements for sample preparation, cold reagent storage, and readout, the NINA heater will comprise part of a kit that should enable electricity-free NA testing for many important analytes.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.00653888,0.044138551,0.155802682,0.0060140440000000005,-0.076345837,0.024799957,0.06125289,0.009814887,0.001966339,0.034881279,-0.054981318,0.009970479,0.065548053,-0.118465964,-0.016436108,0.042461599,-0.05660468900000001,0.011839208,-0.05600401,-0.038389041,-0.036509129,-0.064617187,0.029434566000000002,-0.084644165,-0.0090647,-0.004675821,-0.022289878,0.005222683,-0.035750626,0.03637818

1919,Applying a Linear Amplification Strategy to Recombinase Polymerase Amplification for Uniform DNA Library Amplification,"[Image: see text] Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is an isothermal DNA amplification method with broad applications as a point-of-care test and in molecular biology techniques. Currently, most of the applications are focused on target-specific amplification. Because RPA has the advantage of amplifying DNA under isothermal conditions, we utilized RPA as a DNA library amplification tool. In this study, we used a sheared genomic DNA library and an oligonucleotide (oligo) library for the comparison of polymerase chain reaction and RPA. For the sheared DNA library, we observed biased amplification after RPA was conducted. Thus, to amplify the size-variable DNA library uniformly, we introduced a linear amplification strategy with RPA and successfully improved the uniformity. On the other hand, using the same-sized oligo library, we confirmed that RPA amplified this library uniformly without modification of the protocol. These results demonstrate that RPA can be applied not only to amplify a specific target as previously demonstrated but also to amplify a complex DNA library composed of a large number of different DNA molecules.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.045360459000000006,0.042346295,0.20753941399999998,0.004736165,-0.10477986,-0.021573566000000002,0.06676721299999999,0.03267061,-0.00582613,-0.067606321,-0.113265275,0.053215447,-0.0013703839999999999,-0.152111245,-0.098144156,0.16803355899999997,-0.115498302,-0.077707278,0.147074676,0.273598361,0.041348071,-0.02610512,-0.007239596,-0.08337004099999999,-0.093606712,0.031930988,-0.032302125,0.07764802700000001,0.03448626,0.010497807
1923,Detecting respiratory viral RNA using expanded genetic alphabets and self-avoiding DNA,"Abstract Nucleic acid (NA)-targeted tests detect and quantify viral DNA and RNA (collectively xNA) to support epidemiological surveillance and, in individual patients, to guide therapy. They commonly use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription PCR. Although these all have rapid turnaround, they are expensive to run. Multiplexing would allow their cost to be spread over multiple targets, but often only with lower sensitivity and accuracy, noise, false positives, and false negatives; these arise by interactions between the multiple nucleic acid primers and probes in a multiplexed kit. Here we offer a multiplexed assay for a panel of respiratory viruses that mitigates these problems by combining several nucleic acid analogs from the emerging field of synthetic biology: (i) self-avoiding molecular recognition systems (SAMRSs), which facilitate multiplexing, and (ii) artificially expanded genetic information systems (AEGISs), which enable low-noise PCR. These are supplemented by “transliteration” technology, which converts standard nucleotides in a target to AEGIS nucleotides in a product, improving hybridization. The combination supports a multiplexed Luminex-based respiratory panel that potentially differentiates influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, detecting as few as 10 MERS virions in a 20-μl sample.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.079860171,0.122704075,0.035838206000000004,0.121451004,-0.031285707999999995,-0.013071575,-0.018126695,0.080570024,0.073434206,0.068088747,-0.021863376,-0.031299109,0.10262686300000001,-0.07160565599999999,0.0277973,-0.039251214,-0.008880832,-0.029709989,-0.005791264,-0.029951716,-0.007933893000000001,-0.078114323,0.034387395,-0.044920826,-0.004264717,-0.04436854900000001,-0.043755418,-0.009906981,-0.048246553,-0.016558406
1934,Evaluation of recombinase polymerase amplification for detection of begomoviruses by plant diagnostic clinics,"BACKGROUND: Plant viruses in the genus Begomovirus, family Geminiviridae often cause substantial crop losses. These viruses have been emerging in many locations throughout the tropics and subtropics. Like many plant viruses, they are often not recognized by plant diagnostic clinics due in large part to the lack of rapid and cost effective assays. An isothermal amplification assay, Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), was evaluated for its ability to detect three begomoviruses and for its suitability for use in plant diagnostic clinics. Methods for DNA extraction and separation of amplicons from proteins used in the assay were modified and compared to RPA manufacturer’s protocols. The modified RPA assays were compared to PCR assays for sensitivity, use in downstream applications, cost, and speed. RESULTS: Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assays for the detection of Bean golden yellow mosaic virus, Tomato mottle virus and Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) were specific, only amplifying the target viruses in three different host species. RPA was able to detect the target virus when the template was in a crude extract generated using a simple inexpensive extraction method, while PCR was not. Separation of RPA-generated amplicons from DNA-binding proteins could be accomplished by several methods, all of which were faster and less expensive than that recommended by the manufacturer. Use of these modifications resulted in an RPA assay that was faster than PCR but with a similar reagent cost. This modified RPA was the more cost effective assay when labor is added to the cost since RPA can be performed much faster than PCR. RPA had a sensitivity approximate to that of ELISA when crude extract was used as template. RPA-generated amplicons could be used in downstream applications (TA cloning, digestion with a restriction endonuclease, direct sequencing) similar to PCR but unlike some other isothermal reactions. CONCLUSIONS: RPA could prove useful for the cost effective detection of plant viruses by plant diagnostic clinics. It can be performed in one hour or less with a reagent cost similar to that of PCR but with a lower labor cost, and with an acceptable level of sensitivity and specificity.

1938,Internal control for real-time polymerase chain reaction based on MS2 bacteriophage for RNA viruses diagnostics,"BACKGROUND: Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is routinely used to detect viral infections. In Brazil, it is mandatory the use of nucleic acid tests to detect hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus in blood banks because of the immunological window. The use of an internal control (IC) is necessary to differentiate the true negative results from those consequent from a failure in some step of the nucleic acid test. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was the construction of virus-modified particles, based on MS2 bacteriophage, to be used as IC for the diagnosis of RNA viruses. METHODS: The MS2 genome was cloned into the pET47b(+) plasmid, generating pET47b(+)-MS2. MS2-like particles were produced through the synthesis of MS2 RNA genome by T7 RNA polymerase. These particles were used as non-competitive IC in assays for RNA virus diagnostics. In addition, a competitive control for HCV diagnosis was developed by cloning a mutated HCV sequence into the MS2 replicase gene of pET47b(+)-MS2, which produces a non-propagating MS2 particle. The utility of MS2-like particles as IC was evaluated in a one-step format multiplex real-time RT-PCR for HCV detection. FINDINGS: We demonstrated that both competitive and non-competitive IC could be successfully used to monitor the HCV amplification performance, including the extraction, reverse transcription, amplification and detection steps, without compromising the detection of samples with low target concentrations. In conclusion, MS2-like particles generated by this strategy proved to be useful IC for RNA virus diagnosis, with advantage that they are produced by a low cost protocol. An attractive feature of this system is that it allows the construction of a multicontrol by the insertion of sequences from more than one pathogen, increasing its applicability for diagnosing different RNA viruses.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.062443973,0.005744743,0.095072036,0.070639865,-0.040869671,-0.037061909,0.00299598,0.025249793,-0.0032128490000000003,0.021787848999999998,-0.000536861,0.004081131,0.044587152000000005,-0.003467734,0.017121479,0.00089626,-0.010554266999999999,0.108657566,0.121788695,-0.082416266,-0.05405293,-0.002506454,0.054283289000000005,-0.004024086,-0.05107842,-0.034513219,-0.023190991,0.018098627,-0.065334504,-0.010702851000000001
