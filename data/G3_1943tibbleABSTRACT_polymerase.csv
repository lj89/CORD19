78,"Chapter 10 Polymerases of Coronaviruses Structure, Function, and Inhibitors","Abstract Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a major group of viruses known to be responsible for wide spectrum of diseases in multiple species. The CoVs affecting human population are referred to as human coronaviruses (HCoVs). They lead to multiple respiratory diseases, such as common cold, pneumonia, bronchitis, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome. CoVs are RNA viruses that require RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) for various steps in their life cycle. Action of RdRP is needed in several steps in the life cycle of CoVs and thus RdRPs constitute potential targets for drugs and other therapeutic interventions for the treatment of diseases caused by CoVs. The chapter therefore presents a detailed discussion on the structure and functions of CoV polymerases and the development of their potential inhibitors.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.058642097000000004,0.074130372,-0.128173338,0.094798564,0.105551127,0.039844767,0.211295037,0.067790562,-0.013709039,0.05637251,-0.001753425,0.013344688,0.002199701,-0.005166049,-0.03424349,0.020944048,-0.000609073,0.06565865,0.007059546,0.022739157000000003,-0.023573588,-0.057116199000000006,0.02626786,-0.001558653,0.05295028,0.001026825,-0.053561605,-0.03376431,0.10802472800000001,-0.061850388
161,Molecular diversity of coronaviruses in bats,"Abstract The existence of coronaviruses in bats is unknown until the recent discovery of bat-SARS-CoV in Chinese horseshoe bats and a novel group 1 coronavirus in other bat species. Among 309 bats of 13 species captured from 20 different locations in rural areas of Hong Kong over a 16-month period, coronaviruses were amplified from anal swabs of 37 (12%) bats by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis of RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (pol) and helicase genes revealed six novel coronaviruses from six different bat species, in addition to the two previously described coronaviruses. Among the six novel coronaviruses, four were group 1 coronaviruses (bat-CoV HKU2 from Chinese horseshoe bat, bat-CoV HKU6 from rickett's big-footed bat, bat-CoV HKU7 from greater bent-winged bat and bat-CoV HKU8 from lesser bent-winged bat) and two were group 2 coronaviruses (bat-CoV HKU4 from lesser bamboo bats and bat-CoV HKU5 from Japanese pipistrelles). An astonishing diversity of coronaviruses was observed in bats.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.076111236,0.246183283,-0.121292643,-0.0038931340000000004,0.39323624700000004,0.150920468,0.322567741,0.11261913800000001,-0.127306268,-0.118645591,-0.13994067699999999,-0.167466896,-0.067276185,0.090368862,-0.084661745,0.11583209800000001,0.04695992,0.07443362099999999,0.028118945,-0.011024123,-0.08317601200000001,-0.042889757,0.04970968,-0.090641906,0.06837678900000001,0.033544393,-0.021558844,-0.001746693,0.003392788,0.020563243999999998
321,Genomic characterization of seven distinct bat coronaviruses in Kenya,"Abstract To better understand the genetic diversity and genomic features of 41 coronaviruses (CoVs) identified from Kenya bats in 2006, seven CoVs as representatives of seven different phylogenetic groups identified from partial polymerase gene sequences, were subjected to extensive genomic sequencing. As a result, 15â€“16kb nucleotide sequences encoding complete RNA dependent RNA polymerase, spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins plus other open reading frames (ORFs) were generated. Sequences analysis confirmed that the CoVs from Kenya bats are divergent members of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera. Furthermore, the CoVs BtKY22, BtKY41, and BtKY43 in Alphacoronavirus genus and BtKY24 in Betacoronavirus genus are likely representatives of 4 novel CoV species. BtKY27 and BtKY33 are members of the established bat CoV species in Alphacoronavirus genus and BtKY06 is a member of the established bat CoV species in Betacoronavirus genus. The genome organization of these seven CoVs is similar to other known CoVs from the same groups except for differences in the number of putative ORFs following the N gene. The present results confirm a significant diversity of CoVs circulating in Kenya bats. These Kenya bat CoVs are phylogenetically distant from any previously described human and animal CoVs. However, because of the examples of host switching among CoVs after relatively minor sequence changes in S1 domain of spike protein, a further surveillance in animal reservoirs and understanding the interface between host susceptibility is critical for predicting and preventing the potential threat of bat CoVs to public health.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.125224793,0.126325671,-0.08251629099999999,-0.009489371,0.355166811,0.118493796,0.24354768100000002,0.105003817,-0.09534590300000001,-0.078978012,-0.144854228,-0.11762790099999999,-0.047399248,0.021909925,-0.085363415,0.054671338,0.029396752999999998,0.072983332,0.0014178910000000001,0.006884865,-0.04296985,-0.03309841,0.060257304000000005,-0.05941406900000001,0.038643827,0.035704539,-0.009161606999999999,-0.031422427,0.027532754,0.022973898
336,Full genome characterization of two novel Alpha-coronavirus species from Italian bats,"Abstract Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been detected worldwide in several bat species, which are considered the main reservoir. The attention to the high diversity of CoVs hosted by bats has increased during the last decade due to the high number of human infections caused by two zoonotic Beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, that cause several respiratory diseases. Among coronaviruses, two Alpha-CoV strains (HuCoV-229E and HuCoV-NL63) cause mild respiratory disease that can change to severe disease in children, elderly and individuals affected by illnesses. Phylogenetic analysis conducted on bat Alpha-CoV strains revealed their evolutive correlation to human strains, suggesting their origin in bats. The genome of CoVs is characterized by a high frequency of mutations and recombination events, increasing their ability to switch hosts and their zoonotic potential. In this study, three strains of Alpha-CoV genera detected in Italian bats (Pipistrellus kuhlii) were fully sequenced by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and characterized. The complete genome analysis showed the correlation of the Italians strains with a Chinese strain detected in 2013 and, based on CoV molecular species demarcation, two new Alpha-CoV species were established. The analysis of a fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) showed the correlation of the Italian strains with CoVs that was only detected in the bat Pipistrellus genera (Pipistrellus kuhlii and Pipistrellus Pipistrellus) in European countries.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.045089992,0.237650186,-0.132889364,0.013183731,0.336295532,0.107935741,0.237100495,0.09748026,0.002161246,-0.020529262,-0.056034137000000005,-0.047748467,-0.041665077,0.011890083000000001,-0.034831142,0.05212241,-0.022792668,0.052990837,-0.000655961,0.010167797,0.016073114,-0.021175661000000002,0.090355694,0.013913225,0.07092554599999999,0.006134631999999999,-0.036853826,-5.7100000000000006e-05,0.021224857000000003,0.06052374
580,Insectivorous bats carry host specific astroviruses and coronaviruses across different regions in Germany,"Abstract Recently several infectious agents with a zoonotic potential have been detected in different bat species. However, there is still a lack of knowledge on the transmission dynamics within and between bat species, as well as from bats to other mammals. To better understand these processes, it is important to compare the phylogenetic relationships between different agents to that of their respective hosts. In this study, we analysed more than 950 urine, faeces and oral swab samples collected from 653 bats from mainly four species (Myotis nattereri, Myotis bechsteinii, Myotis daubentonii, and Plecotus auritus) for the presence of coronavirus, paramyxovirus and astrovirus related nucleic acids located in three different regions of Germany. Using hemi-nested reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR amplification of fragments within the highly conserved regions of the respective RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes, we detected astrovirus sequences at an overall detection rate of 25.8% of the analysed animals, with a maximum of 65% in local populations. The detection rates for coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses were distinctly lower, ranging between 1.4% and 3.1%. Interestingly, the sequence similarities in samples collected from the same bat species in different geographical areas were distinctly larger than the sequence similarities between samples from different species sampled at the same location. This indicates that host specificity may be more important than host ecology for the presence of certain viruses in bats.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.072498242,0.051789043,0.041000389,0.026135866,0.30441671600000003,0.072150479,0.24475833800000002,0.067012848,-0.148300929,-0.028376992,-0.07504377,-0.09073731199999999,-0.035810384,0.03308142,-0.017452021,0.035893554,0.016658079,0.027335041,0.012174288,-0.046527054000000005,-0.021474077999999997,-0.007573096,-0.025648962,-0.038930549,0.026449812000000003,0.0021843170000000003,0.006385209,-0.00296172,0.000390644,0.030890307000000002
584,"Circulation of Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus and Paramyxovirus in Hipposideros bat species in Zimbabwe","Abstract Bats carry a great diversity of zoonotic viruses with a high-impact on human health and livestock. Since the emergence of new coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses in humans (e.g. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Nipah virus), numerous studies clearly established that bats can maintain some of these viruses. Improving our understanding on the role of bats in the epidemiology of the pathogens they harbour is necessary to prevent cross-species spill over along the wild/domestic/human gradient. In this study, we screened bat faecal samples for the presence of Coronavirus and Paramyxovirus in two caves frequently visited by local people to collect manure and/or to hunt bats in Zimbabwe. We amplified partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes of Alpha and Betacoronavirus together with the partial polymerase gene of Paramyxovirus. Identified coronaviruses were related to pathogenic human strains and the paramyxovirus belonged to the recently described Jeilongvirus genus. Our results highlighted the importance of monitoring virus circulation in wildlife, especially bats, in the context of intense human-wildlife interfaces in order to strengthen prevention measures among local populations and to implement sentinel surveillance in sites with high zoonotic diseases transmission potential.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.043194047,0.10931860300000001,-0.065581143,0.045554431,0.29872642899999996,0.12725338,0.237984535,0.044239720999999996,-0.089406881,-0.019845123,-0.087677467,-0.10359776300000001,0.009989343000000001,0.044511567,-0.009382769000000001,0.031921327,0.005335927,0.038130285,0.013464726000000002,0.00979071,0.008470929,-0.000312061,-0.0018188120000000002,-0.02542444,0.037448535,0.018292623,-0.022156565,0.02319594,0.003682772,-0.030965878999999998
585,Interplay between co-divergence and cross-species transmission in the evolutionary history of bat coronaviruses,"Abstract Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been documented in almost every species of bat sampled. Bat CoVs exhibit both extensive genetic diversity and a broad geographic range, indicative of a long-standing host association. Despite this, the respective roles of long-term virus-host co-divergence and cross-species transmission (host-jumping) in the evolution of bat coronaviruses are unclear. Using a phylogenetic approach we provide evidence that CoV diversity in bats is shaped by both species richness and their geographical distribution, and that CoVs exhibit clustering at the level of bat genera, with these genus-specific clusters largely associated with distinct CoV species. Co-phylogenetic analyses revealed that cross-species transmission has been more common than co-divergence across coronavirus evolution as a whole, and that cross-species transmission events were more likely between sympatric bat hosts. Notably, however, an analysis of the CoV RNA polymerase phylogeny suggested that many such host-jumps likely resulted in short-term spill-over infections, with little evidence for sustained onward transmission in new co-roosting host species.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.088493506,0.13509951,-0.09293884699999999,-0.004688062,0.307071422,0.156098237,0.308771338,0.111115909,-0.08749514800000001,-0.055140296,-0.102548855,-0.129260284,-0.030199662000000002,0.056516091,-0.039570703,0.090455546,-0.001912268,0.042243262000000004,-0.000155635,0.029938988,-0.040287402,-0.024645379,0.0017770529999999998,-0.018326115,0.009938790999999999,0.00342144,0.00664582,-0.01170867,-0.00047996199999999996,0.029191604
719,A Real-Time PCR Assay for Bat SARS-Like Coronavirus Detection and Its Application to Italian Greater Horseshoe Bat Faecal Sample Surveys,"Bats are source of coronaviruses closely related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus. Numerous studies have been carried out to identify new bat viruses related to SARS-coronavirus (bat-SARS-like CoVs) using a reverse-transcribed-polymerase chain reaction assay. However, a qualitative PCR could underestimate the prevalence of infection, affecting the epidemiological evaluation of bats in viral ecology. In this work an SYBR Green-real time PCR assay was developed for diagnosing infection with SARS-related coronaviruses from bat guano and was applied as screening tool in a survey carried out on 45 greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) sampled in Italy in 2009. The assay showed high sensitivity and reproducibility. Its application on bats screening resulted in a prevalence of 42%.

811,Detection of new genetic variants of Betacoronaviruses in Endemic Frugivorous Bats of Madagascar,"BACKGROUND: Bats are amongst the natural reservoirs of many coronaviruses (CoVs) of which some can lead to severe infection in human. African bats are known to harbor a range of pathogens (e.g., Ebola and Marburg viruses) that can infect humans and cause disease outbreaks. A recent study in South Africa isolated a genetic variant closely related to MERS-CoV from an insectivorous bat. Though Madagascar is home to 44 bat species (41 insectivorous and 3 frugivorous) of which 34 are endemic, no data exists concerning the circulation of CoVs in the islandâ€™s chiropteran fauna. Certain Malagasy bats can be frequently found in close contact with humans and frugivorous bats feed in the same trees where people collect and consume fruits and are hunted and consumed as bush meat. The purpose of our study is to detect and identify CoVs from frugivorous bats in Madagascar to evaluate the risk of human infection from infected bats. METHODS: Frugivorous bats belonging to three species were captured in four different regions of Madagascar. We analyzed fecal and throat swabs to detect the presence of virus through amplification of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, which is highly conserved in all known coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses were performed from positive specimens. RESULTS: From 351 frugivorous bats, we detected 14 coronaviruses from two endemic bats species, of which 13 viruses were identified from Pteropus rufus and one from Eidolon dupreanum, giving an overall prevalence of 4.5%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Malagasy strains belong to the genus Betacoronavirus but form three distinct clusters, which seem to represent previously undescribed genetic lineages.

814,Diversity of coronavirus in bats from Eastern Thailand,"BACKGROUND: Bats are reservoirs for a diverse range of coronaviruses (CoVs), including those closely related to human pathogens such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV. There are approximately 139 bat species reported to date in Thailand, of which two are endemic species. Due to the zoonotic potential of CoVs, standardized surveillance efforts to characterize viral diversity in wildlife are imperative. FINDINGS: A total of 626 bats from 19 different bat species were individually sampled from 5 provinces in Eastern Thailand between 2008 and 2013 (84 fecal and 542 rectal swabs). Samples collected (either fresh feces or rectal swabs) were placed directly into RNA stabilization reagent, transported on ice within 24 hours and preserved at âˆ’80Â°C until further analysis. CoV RNA was detected in 47 specimens (7.6%), from 13 different bat species, using broadly reactive consensus PCR primers targeting the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase gene designed to detect all CoVs. Thirty seven alphacoronaviruses, nine lineage D betacoronaviruses, and one lineage B betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV related) were identified. Six new bat CoV reservoirs were identified in our study, namely Cynopterus sphinx, Taphozous melanopogon, Hipposideros lekaguli, Rhinolophus shameli, Scotophilus heathii and Megaderma lyra. CONCLUSIONS: CoVs from the same genetic lineage were found in different bat species roosting in similar or different locations. These data suggest that bat CoV lineages are not strictly concordant with their hosts. Our phylogenetic data indicates high diversity and a complex ecology of CoVs in bats sampled from specific areas in eastern regions of Thailand. Further characterization of additional CoV genes may be useful to better describe the CoV divergence.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.043712787,0.3125435,-0.161007675,0.042689381,0.35430151299999996,0.106900773,0.273481213,0.10263442199999999,-0.078669949,-0.075202241,-0.09122681099999999,-0.153742483,-0.07520149400000001,0.058517049,-0.036380127000000005,0.069981435,0.003244214,0.033128957,0.030961047999999998,-0.01024252,-0.052758894,-0.009781101,0.074579107,-0.04434861,0.049396401,0.019459719,-0.036613922,0.018920996000000002,0.033696192,0.028076802999999997
844,Alphacoronaviruses Detected in French Bats Are Phylogeographically Linked to Coronaviruses of European Bats,"Bats are a reservoir for a diverse range of viruses, including coronaviruses (CoVs). To determine the presence of CoVs in French bats, fecal samples were collected between July and August of 2014 from four bat species in seven different locations around the city of Bourges in France. We present for the first time the presence of alpha-CoVs in French Pipistrellus pipistrellus bat species with an estimated prevalence of 4.2%. Based on the analysis of a fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, phylogenetic analyses show that alpha-CoVs sequences detected in French bats are closely related to other European bat alpha-CoVs. Phylogeographic analyses of RdRp sequences show that several CoVs strains circulate in European bats: (i) old strains detected that have probably diverged a long time ago and are detected in different bat subspecies; (ii) strains detected in Myotis and Pipistrellus bat species that have more recently diverged. Our findings support previous observations describing the complexity of the detected CoVs in bats worldwide.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.085598995,0.074538382,-0.040355564,-0.012156291999999999,0.405874644,0.135818446,0.332613606,0.093615025,-0.176320455,-0.075268216,-0.103392076,-0.102592574,-0.10127755699999999,0.063342643,-0.062355689000000006,0.09366557,0.022058038,0.074209051,0.028375672,-0.027507672,-0.017772806999999998,-0.040900891,0.073592042,-0.095350636,0.090591674,0.042313228,-0.043008857000000005,0.002785432,0.037285634,0.047600065
871,Isolation and Characterization of a Novel Gammaherpesvirus from a Microbat Cell Line,"While employing deep sequencing and de novo assembly to characterize the mRNA transcript profile of a cell line derived from the microbat Myotis velifer incautus, we serendipitously identified mRNAs encoding proteins with a high level of identity to herpesviruses. A majority were closely related to proteins of equine herpesvirus 2 (EHV-2), a horse gammaherpesvirus. We demonstrated by electron microscopy the presence of herpesvirus-like particles in the microbat cells. Passage of supernatants from microbat cells to Vero cells resulted in syncytium formation, and expression of viral genes and amplification of viral DNA were demonstrated by quantitative PCR. Susceptibility of human cell lines to productive infection was also demonstrated. Next-generation sequencing and de novo assembly of the viral genome from supernatants from Vero cells yielded a single contig of approximately 130 kb with at least 77 open reading frames (ORFs), predicted microRNAs (miRNAs), and a gammaherpesvirus genomic organization. Phylogenic analysis of the envelope glycoprotein (gB) and DNA polymerase (POLD1) revealed similarity to multiple gammaherpesviruses, including those from as-yet-uncultured viruses of the Rhadinovirus genus that were obtained by deep sequencing of bat tissues. Moreover, the assembled genome revealed ORFs that share little or no homology to known ORFs in EHV-2 but are similar to accessory proteins of other gammaherpesviruses. Some also have striking homology to predicted Myotis bat proteins. Cumulatively, this study provides the first isolation and characterization of a replication-competent bat gammaherpesvirus. IMPORTANCE Bats are of significant interest as reservoirs for zoonotic viral pathogens; however, tools to dissect bat-virus interactions are limited in availability. This study serendipitously identified, in an established bat cell line, a fully replication-competent gammaherpesvirus; determined the complete genome sequence of the virus; and generated a viral transcript map. This virus can replicate in select human and nonhuman primate cell lines. However, analyses of viral sequences support a bat origin for this virus; we therefore refer to the virus as bat gammaherpesvirus 8 (BGHV8). The viral genome contains unique open reading frames that likely encode modulators of bat innate and adaptive immune signaling pathways and expresses viral miRNAs. The virus and its gene products should provide a unique tool to dissect both bat and gammaherpesvirus biology.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.140354838,-0.017517718,-0.030356801,-0.011001317,0.157163172,0.073587587,0.126582749,0.014173011999999999,-0.02919001,-0.031966776,-0.16268384800000002,-0.174653516,0.044347637999999995,0.07837350900000001,-0.028247886,-0.000372641,0.030739533,-0.008128849,-8.79e-05,0.037878541,-0.032969195,0.022805827999999997,-0.00104265,-0.034017918,-0.025649556,0.00850956,0.025849623999999998,-0.005065706,-0.076002339,0.00821096
931,"Detection of Alphacoronavirus vRNA in the Feces of Brazilian Free-Tailed Bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) from a Colony in Florida, USA","Bats are natural reservoirs of coronaviruses and other viruses with zoonotic potential. Florida has indigenous non-migratory populations of Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) that mostly roost in colonies in artificial structures. Unlike their counterparts in Brazil and Mexico, the viruses harbored by the Florida bats have been underexplored. We report the detection of an alphacoronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene sequence in the feces of two of 19 different T. brasiliensis that were capture/release bats that had been evaluated for overall health. The RdRp sequence is similar but not identical to previously detected sequences in the feces of two different species of bats (T. brasiliensis and Molossus molossus) in Brazil. In common with the experience of others doing similar work, attempts to isolate the virus in cell cultures were unsuccessful. We surmise that this and highly related alphacoronavirus are carried by Brazilian free-tailed bats living in a wide eco-spatial region. As various coronaviruses (CoVs) that affect humans emerged from bats, our study raises the question whether CoVs such as the one detected in our work are yet-to-be-detected pathogens of humans and animals other than bats.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.09973208300000001,0.03487687,-0.033278878,0.018784719,0.322457979,0.102782505,0.286953485,0.090756566,-0.16438045199999998,-0.045304544,-0.08900755099999999,-0.106464225,-0.075489634,0.038002367999999995,-0.045541991,0.055533299,0.03245146,0.048231027,0.028126966,-0.032433165,-0.010226512,-0.037380856000000004,0.039139913,-0.087070119,0.070465572,0.056833268,-0.013898743,0.018888343999999998,0.032031635,0.015184591
960,Coronavirus and paramyxovirus in bats from Northwest Italy,"BACKGROUND: Bat-borne virus surveillance is necessary for determining inter-species transmission risks and is important due to the wide-range of bat species which may harbour potential pathogens. This study aimed to monitor coronaviruses (CoVs) and paramyxoviruses (PMVs) in bats roosting in northwest Italian regions. Our investigation was focused on CoVs and PMVs due to their proven ability to switch host and their zoonotic potential. Here we provide the phylogenetic characterization of the highly conserved polymerase gene fragments. RESULTS: Family-wide PCR screenings were used to test 302 bats belonging to 19 different bat species. Thirty-eight animals from 12 locations were confirmed as PCR positive, with an overall detection rate of 12.6% [95% CI: 9.3â€“16.8]. CoV RNA was found in 36 bats belonging to eight species, while PMV RNA in three Pipistrellus spp. Phylogenetic characterization have been obtained for 15 alpha- CoVs, 5 beta-CoVs and three PMVs; moreover one P. pipistrellus resulted co-infected with both CoV and PMV. A divergent alpha-CoV clade from Myotis nattereri SpA is also described. The compact cluster of beta-CoVs from R. ferrumequinum roosts expands the current viral sequence database, specifically for this species in Europe. To our knowledge this is the first report of CoVs in Plecotus auritus and M. oxygnathus, and of PMVs in P. kuhlii. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified alpha and beta-CoVs in new bat species and in previously unsurveyed Italian regions. To our knowledge this represents the first and unique report of PMVs in Italy. The 23 new bat genetic sequences presented will expand the current molecular bat-borne virus databases. Considering the amount of novel bat-borne PMVs associated with the emergence of zoonotic infections in animals and humans in the last years, the definition of viral diversity within European bat species is needed. Performing surveillance studies within a specific geographic area can provide awareness of viral burden where bats roost in close proximity to spillover hosts, and form the basis for the appropriate control measures against potential threats for public health and optimal management of bats and their habitats.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.059734864000000006,0.14023460699999998,-0.06595022099999999,0.018162938,0.37838594600000003,0.168907775,0.35163815,0.127257475,-0.151083836,-0.069123399,-0.140173808,-0.171301538,-0.062091015,0.052616776,-0.066622905,0.102033907,0.0009536010000000001,0.073776405,0.019191447,-0.014913122,-0.075732883,-0.007406485,0.05583046,-0.084891464,0.060236288,0.039394873,-0.006592532,-0.044150330999999994,0.018557861000000002,0.047316477999999995
969,Longitudinal study of age-specific pattern of coronavirus infection in Lyleâ€™s flying fox (Pteropus lylei) in Thailand,"BACKGROUND: Bats are natural reservoirs for several highly pathogenic and novel viruses including coronaviruses (CoVs) (mainly Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus). Lyleâ€™s flying fox (Pteropus lylei)â€˜s roosts and foraging sites are usually in the proximity to humans and animals. Knowledge about age-specific pattern of CoV infection in P. lylei, prevalence, and viral shedding at roosts and foraging sites may have an impact on infection-age-structure model to control CoV outbreak. METHODS: P. lylei bats were captured monthly during Januaryâ€“December 2012 for detection of CoV at three areas in Chonburi province; two human dwellings, S1 and S2, where few fruit trees were located with an open pig farm, 0.6 km and 5.5 km away from the bat roost, S3. Nested RT-PCR of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene from rectal swabs was used for CoV detection. The strain of CoV was confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: CoV infection was found in both juveniles and adult bats between May and October (January, in adults only and April, in juveniles only). Of total rectal swab positives (68/367, 18.5%), ratio was higher in bats captured at S1 (11/44, 25.0%) and S2 (35/99, 35.4%) foraging sites than at roost (S3) (22/224, 9.8%). Juveniles (forearm length â‰¤ 136 mm) were found with more CoV infection than adults at all three sites; S1 (9/24, 37.5% vs 2/20, 10%), S2 (22/49, 44.9% vs 13/50, 26.0%), and S3 (10/30, 33.3% vs 12/194, 6.2%). The average BCI of CoV infected bats was significantly lower than uninfected bats. No gender difference related to infection was found at the sites. Phylogenetic analysis of conserved RdRp gene revealed that the detected CoVs belonged to group D betacoronavirus (n = 64) and alphacoronavirus (n = 4). CONCLUSIONS: The fact that CoV infection and shedding was found in more juvenile than adult bats may suggest transmission from mother during peripartum period.

1156,"Cameroonian fruit bats harbor divergent viruses, including rotavirus H, bastroviruses, and picobirnaviruses using an alternative genetic code","Most human emerging infectious diseases originate from wildlife and bats are a major reservoir of viruses, a few of which have been highly pathogenic to humans. In some regions of Cameroon, bats are hunted and eaten as a delicacy. This close proximity between human and bats provides ample opportunity for zoonotic events. To elucidate the viral diversity of Cameroonian fruit bats, we collected and metagenomically screened eighty-seven fecal samples of Eidolon helvum and Epomophorus gambianus fruit bats. The results showed a plethora of known and novel viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of the eleven gene segments of the first complete bat rotavirus H genome, showed clearly separated clusters of human, porcine, and bat rotavirus H strains, not indicating any recent interspecies transmission events. Additionally, we identified and analyzed a bat bastrovirus genome (a novel group of recently described viruses, related to astroviruses and hepatitis E viruses), confirming their recombinant nature, and provide further evidence of additional recombination events among bat bastroviruses. Interestingly, picobirnavirus-like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene segments were identified using an alternative mitochondrial genetic code, and further principal component analyses suggested that they may have a similar lifestyle to mitoviruses, a group of virus-like elements known to infect the mitochondria of fungi. Although identified bat coronavirus, parvovirus, and cyclovirus strains belong to established genera, most of the identified partitiviruses and densoviruses constitute putative novel genera in their respective families.

1209,Evolutionary Relationships between Bat Coronaviruses and Their Hosts,"Recent studies have suggested that bats are the natural reservoir of a range of coronaviruses (CoVs), and that rhinolophid bats harbor viruses closely related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV, which caused an outbreak of respiratory illness in humans during 2002â€“2003. We examined the evolutionary relationships between bat CoVs and their hosts by using sequence data of the virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene and the bat cytochrome b gene. Phylogenetic analyses showed multiple incongruent associations between the phylogenies of rhinolophid bats and their CoVs, which suggested that host shifts have occurred in the recent evolutionary history of this group.

1217,"Bat Coronaviruses and Experimental Infection of Bats, the Philippines","Fifty-two bats captured during July 2008 in the Philippines were tested by reverse transcriptionâ€“PCR to detect bat coronavirus (CoV) RNA. The overall prevalence of virus RNA was 55.8%. We found 2 groups of sequences that belonged to group 1 (genus Alphacoronavirus) and group 2 (genus Betacoronavirus) CoVs. Phylogenetic analysis of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene showed that groups 1 and 2 CoVs were similar to Bat-CoV/China/A515/2005 (95% nt sequence identity) and Bat-CoV/HKU9â€“1/China/2007 (83% identity), respectively. To propagate group 2 CoVs obtained from a lesser dog-faced fruit bat (Cynopterus brachyotis), we administered intestine samples orally to Leschenault rousette bats (Rousettus leschenaulti) maintained in our laboratory. After virus replication in the bats was confirmed, an additional passage of the virus was made in Leschenault rousette bats, and bat pathogenesis was investigated.

1309,Novel Alphacoronaviruses and Paramyxoviruses Cocirculate with Type 1 and Severe Acute Respiratory System (SARS)-Related Betacoronaviruses in Synanthropic Bats of Luxembourg,"Several infectious disease outbreaks with high mortality in humans have been attributed to viruses that are thought to have evolved from bat viruses. In this study from Luxembourg, the genetic diversity and epidemiology of paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses shed by the bat species Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and Myotis emarginatus were evaluated. Feces collection (n = 624) was performed longitudinally in a mixed-species colony in 2015 and 2016. In addition, feces (n = 254) were collected cross-sectionally from six Myotis emarginatus colonies in 2016. By use of degenerate primers in a nested format, overall prevalences of 1.1% (10/878) and 4.9% (43/878) were determined for paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses. Sequences of the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and spike glycoprotein genes of coronaviruses, as well as sequences of the partial L gene of paramyxoviruses, were obtained. Novel paramyxovirus and Alphacoronavirus strains were identified in different Myotis emarginatus colonies, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related Betacoronavirus strains were shed by Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. Logistic regression revealed that the level of Alphacoronavirus shedding was highest in July (odds ratio, 2.8; P < 0.01), probably due to periparturient stress. Phylogenetic analyses point to close virus-host coevolution, and the high genetic similarity of the study strains suggests that the Myotis emarginatus colonies in Luxembourg are socially connected. Most interestingly, we show that bats also host Betacoronavirus 1 strains. The high similarity of the spike gene sequences of these viruses with mammalian Betacoronavirus 1 strains may be of concern. Both the SARS-related and Betacoronavirus 1 strains detected in bats in Luxembourg may cross the species barrier after a host adaptation process. IMPORTANCE Bats are a natural reservoir of a number of zoonotic pathogens. Several severe outbreaks in humans (e.g., a Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia in 1998, and the almost global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003) have been caused by bat-borne viruses that were transmitted to humans mostly after virus adaptation (e.g., in intermediate animal hosts). Despite the indigenousness of bat species that host viruses with suspected zoonotic potential and despite the zoonotic transmission of European bat 1 lyssavirus in Luxembourg, knowledge about the diversity and epidemiology of bat viruses remains limited in this country. Moreover, in contrast to other European countries, bat viruses are currently not included in the national surveillance activities of this land-locked country. We suggest that this gap in disease surveillance should be addressed, since we show here that synanthropic bats host viruses that may be able to cross the species barrier.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.047798227,0.08830241900000001,-0.055387725,0.020084875,0.35271856700000004,0.168210451,0.254647794,0.030262927000000002,-0.131083741,-0.002719688,-0.09549429699999999,-0.11320113,-0.009751837,0.05450397,-0.023717997999999997,0.031401711,-0.018325425,0.040900106,0.016367242,0.055580925999999996,0.004115087,7.7e-05,-0.027858589,0.001499881,0.017786849,-0.0150969,0.023816094,-0.0030012740000000004,-0.028553175,0.00499764
1369,Evidence for an Ancestral Association of Human Coronavirus 229E with Bats,"We previously showed that close relatives of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) exist in African bats. The small sample and limited genomic characterizations have prevented further analyses so far. Here, we tested 2,087 fecal specimens from 11 bat species sampled in Ghana for HCoV-229E-related viruses by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Only hipposiderid bats tested positive. To compare the genetic diversity of bat viruses and HCoV-229E, we tested historical isolates and diagnostic specimens sampled globally over 10 years. Bat viruses were 5- and 6-fold more diversified than HCoV-229E in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and spike genes. In phylogenetic analyses, HCoV-229E strains were monophyletic and not intermixed with animal viruses. Bat viruses formed three large clades in close and more distant sister relationships. A recently described 229E-related alpaca virus occupied an intermediate phylogenetic position between bat and human viruses. According to taxonomic criteria, human, alpaca, and bat viruses form a single CoV species showing evidence for multiple recombination events. HCoV-229E and the alpaca virus showed a major deletion in the spike S1 region compared to all bat viruses. Analyses of four full genomes from 229E-related bat CoVs revealed an eighth open reading frame (ORF8) located at the genomic 3â€² end. ORF8 also existed in the 229E-related alpaca virus. Reanalysis of HCoV-229E sequences showed a conserved transcription regulatory sequence preceding remnants of this ORF, suggesting its loss after acquisition of a 229E-related CoV by humans. These data suggested an evolutionary origin of 229E-related CoVs in hipposiderid bats, hypothetically with camelids as intermediate hosts preceding the establishment of HCoV-229E. IMPORTANCE The ancestral origins of major human coronaviruses (HCoVs) likely involve bat hosts. Here, we provide conclusive genetic evidence for an evolutionary origin of the common cold virus HCoV-229E in hipposiderid bats by analyzing a large sample of African bats and characterizing several bat viruses on a full-genome level. Our evolutionary analyses show that animal and human viruses are genetically closely related, can exchange genetic material, and form a single viral species. We show that the putative host switches leading to the formation of HCoV-229E were accompanied by major genomic changes, including deletions in the viral spike glycoprotein gene and loss of an open reading frame. We reanalyze a previously described genetically related alpaca virus and discuss the role of camelids as potential intermediate hosts between bat and human viruses. The evolutionary history of HCoV-229E likely shares important characteristics with that of the recently emerged highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.049591399,0.048573687000000004,-0.076211603,0.046117791,0.390046651,0.04837319,0.234449858,0.061426512999999995,0.01682076,-0.09103008,-0.137762962,0.174669783,0.23520178600000002,0.176487969,-0.045770577,0.066537519,-0.008639829,0.01534394,-0.033916238,0.030396354,-0.045231613,-0.034627251,0.053287407,-0.043497373,-0.019409593,-0.017328416,0.061122047,0.00325857,-0.014179677,0.007647007
1408,Influenza A Virus Polymerase Is a Site for Adaptive Changes during Experimental Evolution in Bat Cells,"The recent identification of highly divergent influenza A viruses in bats revealed a new, geographically dispersed viral reservoir. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of host-restricted viral tropism and the potential for transmission of viruses between humans and bats, we exposed a panel of cell lines from bats of diverse species to a prototypical human-origin influenza A virus. All of the tested bat cell lines were susceptible to influenza A virus infection. Experimental evolution of human and avian-like viruses in bat cells resulted in efficient replication and created highly cytopathic variants. Deep sequencing of adapted human influenza A virus revealed a mutation in the PA polymerase subunit not previously described, M285K. Recombinant virus with the PA M285K mutation completely phenocopied the adapted virus. Adaptation of an avian virus-like virus resulted in the canonical PB2 E627K mutation that is required for efficient replication in other mammals. None of the adaptive mutations occurred in the gene for viral hemagglutinin, a gene that frequently acquires changes to recognize host-specific variations in sialic acid receptors. We showed that human influenza A virus uses canonical sialic acid receptors to infect bat cells, even though bat influenza A viruses do not appear to use these receptors for virus entry. Our results demonstrate that bats are unique hosts that select for both a novel mutation and a well-known adaptive mutation in the viral polymerase to support replication. IMPORTANCE Bats constitute well-known reservoirs for viruses that may be transferred into human populations, sometimes with fatal consequences. Influenza A viruses have recently been identified in bats, dramatically expanding the known host range of this virus. Here we investigated the replication of human influenza A virus in bat cell lines and the barriers that the virus faces in this new host. Human influenza A and B viruses infected cells from geographically and evolutionarily diverse New and Old World bats. Viruses mutated during infections in bat cells, resulting in increased replication and cytopathic effects. These mutations were mapped to the viral polymerase and shown to be solely responsible for adaptation to bat cells. Our data suggest that replication of human influenza A viruses in a nonnative host drives the evolution of new variants and may be an important source of genetic diversity.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.05525126,-0.073540207,-0.083263415,0.20388698100000002,0.20295038199999998,0.36795840799999996,0.193919746,0.03239462,-0.08880265,-0.030708551,-0.10869546,-0.181629719,0.018023693,0.16930378399999998,-0.011647309,0.054540124,0.003352022,-0.011659437,-0.010785376999999999,0.07180661,0.020276106999999998,0.007845600999999999,0.027704837000000003,0.016961728,-0.044408881,0.048789762,0.008609410999999999,-0.01323396,-0.10656872699999999,-0.023730247000000003
1422,Dengue Virus in Bats from Southeastern Mexico,"To identify the relationship between landscape use and dengue virus (DENV) occurrence in bats, we investigated the presence of DENV from anthropogenically changed and unaltered landscapes in two Biosphere Reserves: Calakmul (Campeche) and Montes Azules (Chiapas) in southern Mexico. Spleen samples of 146 bats, belonging to 16 species, were tested for four DENV serotypes with standard reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocols. Six bats (4.1%) tested positive for DENV-2: four bats in Calakmul (two Glossophaga soricina, one Artibeus jamaicensis, and one A. lituratus) and two bats in Montes Azules (both A. lituratus). No effect of anthropogenic disturbance on the occurrence of DENV was detected; however, all three RT-PCRâ€“positive bat species are considered abundant species in the Neotropics and well-adapted to disturbed habitats.

1426,Identification of Diverse Alphacoronaviruses and Genomic Characterization of a Novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Like Coronavirus from Bats in China,"Although many severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses (SARS-like CoVs) have been identified in bats in China, Europe, and Africa, most have a genetic organization significantly distinct from human/civet SARS CoVs in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which mediates receptor binding and determines the host spectrum, resulting in their failure to cause human infections and making them unlikely progenitors of human/civet SARS CoVs. Here, a viral metagenomic analysis of 268 bat rectal swabs collected from four counties in Yunnan Province has identified hundreds of sequences relating to alpha- and betacoronaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis based on a conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene revealed that alphacoronaviruses had diversities with some obvious differences from those reported previously. Full genomic analysis of a new SARS-like CoV from Baoshan (LYRa11) showed that it was 29,805 nucleotides (nt) in length with 13 open reading frames (ORFs), sharing 91% nucleotide identity with human/civet SARS CoVs and the most recently reported SARS-like CoV Rs3367, while sharing 89% with other bat SARS-like CoVs. Notably, it showed the highest sequence identity with the S gene of SARS CoVs and Rs3367, especially in the RBD region. Antigenic analysis showed that the S1 domain of LYRa11 could be efficiently recognized by SARS-convalescent human serum, indicating that LYRa11 is a novel virus antigenically close to SARS CoV. Recombination analyses indicate that LYRa11 is likely a recombinant descended from parental lineages that had evolved into a number of bat SARS-like CoVs. IMPORTANCE Although many severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses (SARS-like CoVs) have been discovered in bats worldwide, there are significant different genic structures, particularly in the S1 domain, which are responsible for host tropism determination, between bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS CoVs, indicating that most reported bat SARS-like CoVs are not the progenitors of human SARS CoV. We have identified diverse alphacoronaviruses and a close relative (LYRa11) to SARS CoV in bats collected in Yunnan, China. Further analysis showed that alpha- and betacoronaviruses have different circulation and transmission dynamics in bat populations. Notably, full genomic sequencing and antigenic study demonstrated that LYRa11 is phylogenetically and antigenically closely related to SARS CoV. Recombination analyses indicate that LYRa11 is a recombinant from certain bat SARS-like CoVs circulating in Yunnan Province.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.074918662,0.442023833,-0.260226079,0.028837121,0.264019915,0.108484441,0.129754846,-0.208443026,-0.141247758,-0.058417515,-0.12137264099999999,-0.093329828,-0.015514888999999999,-0.023500023999999998,-0.039027207,0.053228671,-0.004888346,0.04795838400000001,0.017033219,0.022650282,-0.008102806,-0.032617085,0.04993809,-0.011191699,0.011045652,0.007875854,-0.045099592,0.013680908,0.029586573999999997,-0.011957736000000002
1448,Genetic Characterization of Betacoronavirus Lineage C Viruses in Bats Reveals Marked Sequence Divergence in the Spike Protein of Pipistrellus Bat Coronavirus HKU5 in Japanese Pipistrelle: Implications for the Origin of the Novel Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,"While the novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is closely related to Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV HKU4) and Pipistrellus bat CoV HKU5 (Pi-BatCoV HKU5) in bats from Hong Kong, and other potential lineage C betacoronaviruses in bats from Africa, Europe, and America, its animal origin remains obscure. To better understand the role of bats in its origin, we examined the molecular epidemiology and evolution of lineage C betacoronaviruses among bats. Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5 were detected in 29% and 25% of alimentary samples from lesser bamboo bat (Tylonycteris pachypus) and Japanese pipistrelle (Pipistrellus abramus), respectively. Sequencing of their RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes revealed that MERS-CoV is more closely related to Pi-BatCoV HKU5 in RdRp (92.1% to 92.3% amino acid [aa] identity) but is more closely related to Ty-BatCoV HKU4 in S (66.8% to 67.4% aa identity) and N (71.9% to 72.3% aa identity). Although both viruses were under purifying selection, the S of Pi-BatCoV HKU5 displayed marked sequence polymorphisms and more positively selected sites than that of Ty-BatCoV HKU4, suggesting that Pi-BatCoV HKU5 may generate variants to occupy new ecological niches along with its host in diverse habitats. Molecular clock analysis showed that they diverged from a common ancestor with MERS-CoV at least several centuries ago. Although MERS-CoV may have diverged from potential lineage C betacoronaviruses in European bats more recently, these bat viruses were unlikely to be the direct ancestor of MERS-CoV. Intensive surveillance for lineage C betaCoVs in Pipistrellus and related bats with diverse habitats and other animals in the Middle East may fill the evolutionary gap.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.05014862900000001,0.15740647,-0.08100689900000001,-0.03250101,0.18225054,0.09109744,0.151029407,0.18300493399999998,0.05708732,-0.049073989000000005,-0.052181352,-0.043960070999999996,-0.05698162,-0.005694575,-0.034416806,0.026698232000000002,0.018273553,-0.0042350159999999994,-0.007509867,-0.020533277,-0.003484578,-0.012426672,0.053860512,-0.016914359,0.033887971,0.00682495,-0.011267798,-0.003052993,-0.001198538,0.034015798
1509,Coexistence of Different Genotypes in the Same Bat and Serological Characterization of Rousettus Bat Coronavirus HKU9 Belonging to a Novel Betacoronavirus Subgroup,"Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9 (Ro-BatCoV HKU9), a recently identified coronavirus of novel Betacoronavirus subgroup D, from Leschenault's rousette, was previously found to display marked sequence polymorphism among genomes of four strains. Among 10 bats with complete RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes sequenced, three and two sequence clades for all three genes were codetected in two and five bats, respectively, suggesting the coexistence of two or three distinct genotypes of Ro-BatCoV HKU9 in the same bat. Complete genome sequencing of the distinct genotypes from two bats, using degenerate/genome-specific primers with overlapping sequences confirmed by specific PCR, supported the coexistence of at least two distinct genomes in each bat. Recombination analysis using eight Ro-BatCoV HKU9 genomes showed possible recombination events between strains from different bat individuals, which may have allowed for the generation of different genotypes. Western blot assays using recombinant N proteins of Ro-BatCoV HKU9, Betacoronavirus subgroup A (HCoV-HKU1), subgroup B (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV), and subgroup C (Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5) coronaviruses were subgroup specific, supporting their classification as separate subgroups under Betacoronavirus. Antibodies were detected in 75 (43%) of 175 and 224 (64%) of 350 tested serum samples from Leschenault's rousette bats by Ro-BatCoV HKU9 N-protein-based Western blot and enzyme immunoassays, respectively. This is the first report describing coinfection of different coronavirus genotypes in bats and coronavirus genotypes of diverse nucleotide variation in the same host.

Rhinolophids carried severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related CoV at high frequencies and concentrations (26% of animals are positive; up to 2.4 Ã— 10(8) copies per gram of feces), as well as two Alphacoronavirus clades, one novel and one related to the HKU2 clade. All three clades present in Miniopterus bats in China (HKU7, HKU8, and 1A related) were also present in European Miniopterus bats. An additional novel Alphacoronavirus clade (bat CoV [BtCoV]/BNM98-30) was detected in Nyctalus leisleri. A CoV grouping criterion was developed by comparing amino acid identities across an 816-bp fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) of all accepted mammalian CoV species (RdRp-based grouping units [RGU]). Criteria for defining separate RGU in mammalian CoV were a >4.8% amino acid distance for alphacoronaviruses and a >6.3% distance for betacoronaviruses. All the above-mentioned novel clades represented independent RGU. Strict associations between CoV RGU and host bat genera were confirmed for six independent RGU represented simultaneously in China and Europe. A SARS-related virus (BtCoV/BM48-31/Bulgaria/2008) from a Rhinolophus blasii (Rhi bla) bat was fully sequenced. It is predicted that proteins 3b and 6 were highly divergent from those proteins in all known SARS-related CoV. Open reading frame 8 (ORF8) was surprisingly absent. Surface expression of spike and staining with sera of SARS survivors suggested low antigenic overlap with SARS CoV. However, the receptor binding domain of SARS CoV showed higher similarity with that of BtCoV/BM48-31/Bulgaria/2008 than with that of any Chinese bat-borne CoV. Critical spike domains 472 and 487 were identical and similar, respectively. This study underlines the importance of assessments of the zoonotic potential of widely distributed bat-borne CoV.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.082553612,0.43804876,-0.232764345,0.032725232,0.21929452300000002,0.100197698,0.15195469,-0.000932743,-0.024287696,-0.06236475599999999,-0.086169909,-0.085114234,-0.055236245,-0.024239326000000002,-0.053446811,0.016316616000000003,0.031273041,-0.008827551,0.016592373,0.00815226,-0.026257142999999997,0.002929555,0.066314279,-0.011147708999999999,0.025827249,0.014262023,-0.002650145,0.016336266000000002,0.005555113,0.037062197000000005
1545,Comparative Analysis of Complete Genome Sequences of Three Avian Coronaviruses Reveals a Novel Group 3c Coronavirus,"In this territory-wide molecular epidemiology study of coronaviruses (CoVs) in Hong Kong involving 1,541 dead wild birds, three novel CoVs were identified in three different bird families (bulbul CoV HKU11 [BuCoV HKU11], thrush CoV HKU12 [ThCoV HKU12], and munia CoV HKU13 [MuCoV HKU13]). Four complete genomes of the three novel CoVs were sequenced. Their genomes (26,396 to 26,552 bases) represent the smallest known CoV genomes. In phylogenetic trees constructed using chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL(pro)), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol), helicase, spike, and nucleocapsid proteins, BuCoV HKU11, ThCoV HKU12, and MuCoV HKU13 formed a cluster distantly related to infectious bronchitis virus and turkey CoV (group 3a CoVs). For helicase, spike, and nucleocapsid, they were also clustered with a CoV recently discovered in Asian leopard cats, for which the complete genome sequence was not available. The 3CL(pro), Pol, helicase, and nucleocapsid of the three CoVs possessed higher amino acid identities to those of group 3a CoVs than to those of group 1 and group 2 CoVs. Unique genomic features distinguishing them from other group 3 CoVs include a distinct transcription regulatory sequence and coding potential for small open reading frames. Based on these results, we propose a novel CoV subgroup, group 3c, to describe this distinct subgroup of CoVs under the group 3 CoVs. Avian CoVs are genetically more diverse than previously thought and may be closely related to some newly identified mammalian CoVs. Further studies would be important to delineate whether the Asian leopard cat CoV was a result of interspecies jumping from birds, a situation analogous to that of bat and civet severe acute respiratory syndrome CoVs.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.093127691,0.19944000399999998,-0.120277861,-0.01429315,0.23822757,0.069351699,0.145018784,0.08198955200000001,-0.014542155,-0.047757142,-0.037658115,-0.08478071599999999,-0.04291432,-0.013445992,-0.078346261,0.024702303999999998,0.026554545,0.045748817000000004,0.006054489000000001,0.034429099,-0.052003741,-0.056150335,0.055470205,-0.001859381,0.027282083,0.0009271819999999999,-0.046296455,-0.041722796,0.018341596,-0.020607143
1566,Detection of a Novel and Highly Divergent Coronavirus from Asian Leopard Cats and Chinese Ferret Badgers in Southern China,"Since an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was averted in 2004, many novel coronaviruses have been recognized from different species, including humans. Bats have provided the most diverse assemblages of coronaviruses, suggesting that they may be the natural reservoir. Continued virological surveillance has proven to be the best way to avert this infectious disease at the source. Here we provide the first description of a previously unidentified coronavirus lineage detected from wild Asian leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis) and Chinese ferret badgers (Melogale moschata) during virological surveillance in southern China. Partial genome analysis revealed a typical coronavirus genome but with a unique putative accessory gene organization. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the envelope, membrane, and nucleoprotein structural proteins and the two conserved replicase domains, putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA helicase, of these novel coronaviruses were most closely related to those of group 3 coronaviruses identified from birds, while the spike protein gene was most closely related to that of group 1 coronaviruses from mammals. However, these viruses always fell into an outgroup phylogenetic relationship with respect to other coronaviruses and had low amino acid similarity to all known coronavirus groups, indicating that they diverged early in the evolutionary history of coronaviruses. These results suggest that these viruses may represent a previously unrecognized evolutionary pathway, or possibly an unidentified coronavirus group. This study demonstrates the importance of systematic virological surveillance in market animals for understanding the evolution and emergence of viruses with infectious potential.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.113059931,0.073826823,-0.091170159,0.018731736000000002,0.24423329100000002,0.042678477,0.082768633,-0.013022546999999999,-0.07634450400000001,-0.011050115,-0.005256988000000001,-0.046917257000000004,0.081020341,-0.041778077999999996,-0.052574725,-0.056997607,0.04484956,0.005000857,0.011110683,0.062850397,-0.02568292,-0.040781911000000004,-0.069286451,-0.017282412,0.002411764,0.007546518,-0.000553287,0.024666467999999997,-0.04406096,-0.073899141
1572,Comparative Analysis of Twelve Genomes of Three Novel Group 2c and Group 2d Coronaviruses Reveals Unique Group and Subgroup Features,"Twelve complete genomes of three novel coronavirusesâ€”bat coronavirus HKU4 (bat-CoV HKU4), bat-CoV HKU5 (putative group 2c), and bat-CoV HKU9 (putative group 2d)â€”were sequenced. Comparative genome analysis showed that the various open reading frames (ORFs) of the genomes of the three coronaviruses had significantly higher amino acid identities to those of other group 2 coronaviruses than group 1 and 3 coronaviruses. Phylogenetic trees constructed using chymotrypsin-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, spike, and nucleocapsid all showed that the group 2a and 2b and putative group 2c and 2d coronaviruses are more closely related to each other than to group 1 and 3 coronaviruses. Unique genomic features distinguishing between these four subgroups, including the number of papain-like proteases, the presence or absence of hemagglutinin esterase, small ORFs between the membrane and nucleocapsid genes and ORFs (NS7a and NS7b), bulged stem-loop and pseudoknot structures downstream of the nucleocapsid gene, transcription regulatory sequence, and ribosomal recognition signal for the envelope gene, were also observed. This is the first time that NS7a and NS7b downstream of the nucleocapsid gene has been found in a group 2 coronavirus. The high Ka/Ks ratio of NS7a and NS7b in bat-CoV HKU9 implies that these two group 2d-specific genes are under high selective pressure and hence are rapidly evolving. The four subgroups of group 2 coronaviruses probably originated from a common ancestor. Further molecular epidemiological studies on coronaviruses in the bats of other countries, as well as in other animals, and complete genome sequencing will shed more light on coronavirus diversity and their evolutionary histories.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.12615280199999998,0.130995206,-0.092827681,-0.033140629,0.299814297,0.035910771,0.087726594,0.071266788,-0.04574345900000001,-0.086349803,-0.121019537,-0.086800339,5.9999999999999995e-05,-0.022309449,-0.093728084,-0.023852027,0.05463534,0.051062104000000004,0.024947947,0.034390903,-0.07024733799999999,-0.074091669,-0.034642097000000004,-0.017485899,-0.022572382999999998,-0.042946137,-0.00760725,-0.03040946,-0.038770079,-0.039294507
1578,Prevalence and Genetic Diversity of Coronaviruses in Bats from China,"Coronaviruses can infect a variety of animals including poultry, livestock, and humans and are currently classified into three groups. The interspecies transmissions of coronaviruses between different hosts form a complex ecosystem of which little is known. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the recent identification of new coronaviruses have highlighted the necessity for further investigation of coronavirus ecology, in particular the role of bats and other wild animals. In this study, we sampled bat populations in 15 provinces of China and reveal that approximately 6.5% of the bats, from diverse species distributed throughout the region, harbor coronaviruses. Full genomes of four coronavirues from bats were sequenced and analyzed. Phylogenetic analyses of the spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleoprotein structural proteins and the two conserved replicase domains, putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA helicase, revealed that bat coronaviruses cluster in three different groups: group 1, another group that includes all SARS and SARS-like coronaviruses (putative group 4), and an independent bat coronavirus group (putative group 5). Further genetic analyses showed that different species of bats maintain coronaviruses from different groups and that a single bat species from different geographic locations supports similar coronaviruses. Thus, the findings of this study suggest that bats may play an integral role in the ecology and evolution of coronaviruses.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.110720333,0.15704357,-0.136788082,0.0031402229999999997,0.36445115100000003,0.09856417599999999,0.24939671800000002,-0.012523388,-0.199305423,-0.05967555,-0.108685024,-0.11124912099999999,-0.024944264,0.0353013,-0.067958039,0.046205199,0.04307363,0.06659322,0.035017001,0.048314365,-0.069054117,-0.066207688,-0.042345787999999995,-0.09830911099999999,0.037191462,0.003327164,-0.037453665,0.002164016,-0.030650542000000003,-0.032304302
1767,Bat coronavirus phylogeography in the western Indian Ocean,"Bats are important reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens, including coronaviruses (CoVs). The Western Indian Ocean (WIO) islands are a biodiversity hotspot with more than 50 bat species. Here we tested 1,099 bats belonging to 39 species from Mozambique, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Reunion Island and Seychelles. Based on molecular screening and partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene, a total of 88 bats (8.0% {+/-} 1.6%) tested positive for bat-borne coronaviruses (CoVs), with higher prevalence in Mozambican bats (19.6% {+/-} 4.7%) as compared to those sampled on islands (4.2% {+/-} 1.2%). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that a large diversity of - and {beta}-CoVs are maintained in bat populations of the WIO, some being genetically related to human CoVs (e.g. NL63, MERS).

1769,Astrovirus in Reunion Free-tailed Bat (Mormopterus francoismoutoui),"Astroviruses (AstVs) are RNA viruses responsible for infection of a large diversity of avian and mammalian species, including bats, livestock, and humans. We investigated AstV infection in a free-tailed bat species, Mormopterus francoismoutoui, endemic to Reunion Island. A total of 190 guano samples were collected in a maternity colony during 19 different sampling sessions, between June 2016 and June 2017. Biological material was tested for the presence of the AstV RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) gene with a pan-AstV semi-nested polymerase chain reaction assay. In total, 15 guano samples (7.9%) tested positive, with high genetic diversity of the partial RdRp gene sequences among positive samples. A phylogenetic analysis further revealed that the detected viruses were genetically related to AstVs reported in reptiles, dogs, and pigs, but did not cluster with AstVs commonly found in bats.

1803,Evidence for Retrovirus and Paramyxovirus Infection of Multiple Bat Species in China,"Bats are recognized reservoirs for many emerging zoonotic viruses of public health importance. Identifying and cataloguing the viruses of bats is a logical approach to evaluate the range of potential zoonoses of bat origin. We characterized the fecal pathogen microbiome of both insectivorous and frugivorous bats, incorporating 281 individual bats comprising 20 common species, which were sampled in three locations of Yunnan province, by combining reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays and next-generation sequencing. Seven individual bats were paramyxovirus-positive by RT-PCR using degenerate primers, and these paramyxoviruses were mainly classified into three genera (Rubulavirus, Henipavirus and Jeilongvirus). Various additional novel pathogens were detected in the paramyxovirus-positive bats using Illumina sequencing. A total of 7066 assembled contigs (â‰¥200 bp) were constructed, and 105 contigs matched eukaryotic viruses (of them 103 belong to 2 vertebrate virus families, 1 insect virus, and 1 mycovirus), 17 were parasites, and 4913 were homologous to prokaryotic microorganisms. Among the 103 vertebrate viral contigs, 79 displayed low identity (<70%) to known viruses including human viruses at the amino acid level, suggesting that these belong to novel and genetically divergent viruses. Overall, the most frequently identified viruses, particularly in bats from the family Hipposideridae, were retroviruses.

1813,Bat Astrovirus in Mozambique,"Astroviruses (AstVs) are responsible for infection of a large diversity of mammalian and avian species, including bats, aquatic birds, livestock and humans. We investigated AstVs circulation in bats in Mozambique and Mayotte, a small island in the Comoros Archipelago located between east Africa and Madagascar. Biological material was collected from 338 bats and tested for the presence of the AstV RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase gene with a pan-AstV semi-nested polymerase chain reaction assay. None of the 79 samples obtained from Mayotte bats (Pteropus seychellensis comorensis and Chaerephon pusillus) tested positive; however, 20.1% of bats sampled in Mozambique shed AstVs at the time of sampling and significant interspecific variation in the proportion of positive bats was detected. Many AstVs sequences obtained from a given bat species clustered in different phylogenetic lineages, while others seem to reflect some level of host-virus association, but also with AstVs previously reported from Malagasy bats. Our findings support active circulation of a large diversity of AstVs in bats in the western Indian Ocean islands, including the southeastern African coast, and highlight the need for more detailed assessment of its risk of zoonotic transmission to human populations.

1834,Influence of age and body condition on astrovirus infection of bats in Singapore: An evolutionary and epidemiological analysis,"Bats are unique mammals that are reservoirs of high levels of virus diversity. Although several of these viruses are zoonotic, the majority are not. Astroviruses, transmitted fecal-orally, are commonly detected in a wide diversity of bat species, are prevalent at high rates and are not thought to directly infect humans. These features make astroviruses useful in examining virus evolutionary history, epidemiology in the host, and temporal shedding trends. Our study screened for the presence of astroviruses in bats in Singapore, reconstructed the phylogenetic relations of the polymerase genes and tested for population characteristics associated with infection. Of the seven species screened, astroviruses were detected in Rhinolophus lepidus and Eonycteris spelaea. The R. lepidus sequences grouped with other Rhinolophus astrovirus sequences from China and Laos, while the Eoncyteris sequences formed a distinct clade with astroviruses from Rousettus spp. in Laos and Pteropus giganteus in Bangladesh, but not with other E. spelaea sequences. Longitudinal collections of Eonycteris feces demonstrated variable shedding. Juvenile status of bats was a risk factor for astroviruses. This study highlights the diversity of astroviruses in nectivorous and insectivorous bats in Singapore and provides a predictive framework for understanding astrovirus infection in these bats. It also suggests that in addition to host phylogenetic relatedness, host ecology, such as roosting behavior, may drive co-infections, virus maintenance and spillover.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.043900412,-0.000413146,-0.014623543999999999,-0.056962257999999995,0.22993757199999998,0.122438003,0.216201848,0.052108552,-0.095807041,-0.039201917999999995,-0.06323925700000001,-0.096069797,-0.027775456,0.036219447,0.0048245,0.048939184000000004,-7.43e-05,0.031582167,-0.015213461999999999,0.0044690879999999995,0.000333929,0.001750744,-0.046582387,-0.01604083,0.00024265099999999998,-0.013942717,0.023886139,-0.009698153000000001,-0.012925082,0.014296877
1849,An eco-epidemiological study of Morbilli-related paramyxovirus infection in Madagascar bats reveals host-switching as the dominant macro-evolutionary mechanism,"An eco-epidemiological investigation was carried out on Madagascar bat communities to better understand the evolutionary mechanisms and environmental factors that affect virus transmission among bat species in closely related members of the genus Morbillivirus, currently referred to as Unclassified Morbilli-related paramyxoviruses (UMRVs). A total of 947 bats were investigated originating from 52 capture sites (22 caves, 18 buildings, and 12 outdoor sites) distributed over different bioclimatic zones of the island. Using RT-PCR targeting the L-polymerase gene of the Paramyxoviridae family, we found that 10.5% of sampled bats were infected, representing six out of seven families and 15 out of 31 species analyzed. Univariate analysis indicates that both abiotic and biotic factors may promote viral infection. Using generalized linear modeling of UMRV infection overlaid on biotic and abiotic variables, we demonstrate that sympatric occurrence of bats is a major factor for virus transmission. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that all paramyxoviruses infecting Malagasy bats are UMRVs and showed little host specificity. Analyses using the maximum parsimony reconciliation tool CoRe-PA, indicate that host-switching, rather than co-speciation, is the dominant macro-evolutionary mechanism of UMRVs among Malagasy bats.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.064372165,0.034159371,-0.00013057700000000002,-0.024432401,0.26516921600000004,0.141644925,0.26521548300000003,0.075391398,-0.109474605,-0.076446125,-0.12419546599999999,-0.142066282,-0.064340381,0.116605375,-0.044971631,0.068542552,0.035161253999999996,0.039244312999999996,0.000702809,0.010696898,-0.034681582,0.015853015,-0.024169144,-0.067220309,0.023633712,0.033611743,0.03633574,-0.00382339,-0.005780771999999999,0.043068043
1894,New Adenovirus Groups in Western Palaearctic Bats,"In the context of long-term screening for viruses on Western Palaearctic bats, we tested for the presence of adenovirus 1392 oropharyngeal swabs and 325 stool samples taken from 27 bat species. Adenoviruses were detected in 12 species of the Vespertilionidae and the Rhinolophidae families. Fifty positive respiratory and 26 positive stool samples were studied. Phylogenetic analyses of partial hexon protein and partial DNA-dependent DNA polymerase genes indicate that all these bat adenoviruses belong to the genus Mastadenovirus but without constituting a monophyletic cluster. According to genetic identities, the new groups are distinct to the previously described Bat mastadenovirus A and B species and contribute with potentially new members. Our data support that diversity of bat mastadenovirus is host-dependent and increase the knowledge of potentially pathogenic virus from bats. Due to the active role of bats as viral reservoirs, the characterization of these viruses is relevant for Public Health.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.043394172,0.025051676000000002,-0.026755855,-0.0050264590000000005,0.322339555,0.13215526,0.305409124,0.07944443400000001,-0.15532452300000002,-0.04793159599999999,-0.11751215300000001,-0.137465849,-0.034457192000000005,0.078605833,-0.0350102,0.037284344,0.023061841,0.012326509,0.03922147,-0.034040117,-0.04009285,0.029646419,-0.02383278,-0.06686660000000001,0.008780109,0.031123627,-0.005055803,0.02777214,-0.044244197,0.009260761999999999
