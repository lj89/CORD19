1,The coronavirus avian infectious bronchitis virus requires the cell nucleus and host transcriptional factors,"Abstract Replication of avian infectious bronchitis virus in permissive BHK-21 cells is blocked when these cells are enucleated or irradiated with ultraviolet light prior to infection, or if cells are treated with α-amanitin during the virus growth cycle. This coronavirus, like influenza virus, can replicate normally in the presence of α-amanitin in Chinese hamster ovary cells which possess a drug-resistant RNA polymerase II. These findings indicate that avian infectious bronchitis virus requires the intact cell nucleus and one or more host transcriptional functions for productive infections. Preliminary data suggest that these cellular functions involve some aspect of virus-directed RNA synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.127477986,-0.08171597900000001,-0.048511414,0.055472978,-0.052151052,0.11354164900000001,-0.035887892000000005,-0.04441425400000001,0.053715114,0.071304157,0.037532797,-0.08328107400000001,0.019187415,0.148720026,0.034413272,0.068830171,-0.003020058,-0.030426027,0.014660531000000001,0.065104971,-0.004163702,0.017532905,-0.006152911,-0.026847862000000004,0.016201503,0.01478804,-0.020448848000000002,0.027141217999999998,-0.055505847999999997,-0.018209711
3,Further characterization of mouse hepatitis virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerases,"Abstract Two temporally and enzymatically distinct RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activities associated with membranes of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected cells have been identified previously [Brayton et al., J. Virol. 42, 847–853 (1982)]. In this paper, the subcellular distribution and functions of these two polymerases were examined. Fractionation of the postnuclear membranes by sucrose gradient sedimentation showed that the early polymerase activity (detected at 1 hr p.i.) was homogeneous, while the late polymeras e (6 hr p.i.) was associated with two distinct membrane fractions. The early polymerase synthesized a single RNA species of viral genomic size and negative sense. In contrast, the light peak of the late polymerase synthesized genomic-sized RNA of positive sense, while the heavy peak of the activity synthesized positive-sensed genomic and subgenomic mRNAs. These findings suggest that the light peak of the late polymerase represents a replication complex while the heavy peak represents a transcription complex. They also establish the essential features of the mode of replication of MHV.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.162108888,-0.054615817000000004,-0.060576687000000004,0.043005503,-0.018968619,-0.07505274,-0.018855764,0.022310289,-0.021956793,-0.034507542,0.038988833,-0.024704608,-0.00400926,0.070664387,0.057520117999999995,0.071087703,-0.029473726000000002,0.01129126,0.017713027,0.012756238999999999,-0.020645761000000002,0.022233722999999997,-0.01614376,-0.023848478,0.061780842,0.028557988,-0.048222090999999995,-0.008885905,-0.049629494,0.032808962000000004
4,Characterization of Kunjin virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase: Reinitiation of synthesis in Vitro,"Abstract RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) activity was characterized in a cytoplasmic extract of Kunjin virus-infected Vero cells at 24 hr. The activity was influenced, possibly indirectly, by the length of prior treatment of infected cells with actinomycin D; however, 6 μg/ml actinomycin D and 10−5 M α-amanitin in the RDRP assay had no effect. The replication complex was membrane-bound and Mg2+ was essential for RDRP activity. Incorporation was more dependent on exogenous UTP and GTP than ATP or CTP. The specific activity was low, and rate of incorporation of GMP decreased as the period of assay was increased; however, incorporation of label lasted for at least 60 min. RNA products were fractionated by LiCl precipitation, and kinetic studies showed that the sequence of accumulation of label was the same as that observed in vivo, viz., RI → RF → 44 S RNA; limited reinitiation was also observed. This sequence of labeling also indicated that the in vitro RDRP activity was due to an enzyme capable of elongation, release, and reinitiation of Kunjin RNA synthesis and not merely end labeling or elongating preexisting RNA molecules. No labeled bands in urea-polyacrylamide gels were observed using extracts from mock-infected cells and hence the three RNA products of assays were readily identified in a single gel. The replication complex was still active after treatment with nonionic detergent, but no labeled 44 S RNA was detected in gels, even in the presence of RNasin in the assay which inhibited some nuclease activity. Antibodies to flavivirus-specific nonstructural proteins were preincubated with infected cell extracts in the presence and absence of detergent but no inhibition of RDRP activity was observed. However, anti-dsRNA plus detergent blocked activity by as much as 78% and label was found only in RF.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.242382992,-0.037592897,-0.06232561,0.128606856,-0.09919034300000001,-0.075331676,0.045064703,-0.000976701,-0.028273008999999998,-0.0040362029999999995,0.12200207099999999,0.097110131,-0.11309261400000001,0.092953212,-0.031937033999999996,-0.003950015,0.034633545,-0.028624134,0.067834379,-0.024519724,0.028475258,-0.019384295,0.09431150599999999,-0.072145515,0.024338399,0.071352493,-0.022047681,0.05599396,-0.029904704,0.07741693
5,Identification of putative polymerase gene product in cells infected with murine coronavirus A59,"Abstract The virion RNA of mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59 (MHV-A59) is believed to be the mRNA for the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The cell-free translation of virion RNA results in the synthesis of two predominant products p220 and p28 (M. R. Denison and S. Perlman, 1986, J. Virol. 60, 12–18). p28 is a basic protein and is readily detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. When infected cells and isolated virions were assayed for this protein by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, p28 could be detected in infected cells labeled at late times after infection, but not at early times or in purified virions. p28 represents the first protein product of the putative coronavirus polymerase gene to be identified in infected cells.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.174150773,-0.058283392999999996,-0.034245001000000004,-0.0008323089999999999,-0.008219254,-0.073761153,-0.095974028,-0.013868297,0.025991517000000002,-0.042959511,-0.032825107,-0.073592146,0.02299723,0.06478067700000001,0.023662218,0.00985219,0.009558909,-0.005221904,0.038626507000000004,0.033163512,-0.017966641999999998,0.032200026,0.02490969,-0.005745714,0.102526294,0.100439722,-0.021546192000000002,-0.003232831,-0.084669033,0.07409738099999999
6,Analysis of intracellular small RNAs of mouse hepatitis virus: evidence for discontinuous transcription,"Abstract We have previously shown the presence of multiple small leader-containing RNA species in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected cells. In this paper, we have analyzed the origin, structure, and mechanism of synthesis of these small RNAs. Using cDNA probes specific for leader RNA and genes A, D, and F, we demonstrate that subsets of these small RNAs were derived from the various viral genes. These subsets have discrete and reproducible sizes, varying with the gene from which they are derived. The size of each subset correlates with regions of secondary structure, whose free energy ranges from −1.6 to −77.1 kcal/mol, in each of the mRNAs examined. In addition, identical subsets were detected on the replicative intermediate (RI) RNA, suggesting that they represent functional transcriptional intermediates. The biological significance of these small RNAs is further supported by the detection of leader-containing RNAs of 47, 50, and 57 nucleotides in length, which correspond to the crossover sites in two MHV recombinant viruses. These data, coupled with the high frequency of RNA recombination during MHV infection, suggest that the viral polymerase may pause in or around regions of secondary structure, thereby generating pools of free leader-containing RNA intermediates which can reassociate with the template, acting as primers for the synthesis of full-length or recombinant RNAs. These data suggest that MHV transcription uses a discontinuous and nonprocessive mechanism in which RNA polymerase allows the partial RNA products to be dissociated from the template temporarily during the process of transcription.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.231921865,-0.065874982,-0.036089509,0.09084319199999999,0.048342552000000004,-0.144482301,-0.119214929,0.050254199000000006,-0.031060985,-0.045403752,0.0009908410000000001,-0.091039256,0.045215994,0.033741652999999996,0.10625240400000001,0.124651198,-0.145219597,0.043398497,-0.028560747999999997,-0.028895069,0.019938541,-0.009912352,0.028888712999999996,0.034033678,0.047138215,-0.00491721,0.0070206059999999995,0.016286626000000002,0.043332669000000004,0.034159792
7,Synthesis of virus-specific RNA in permeabilized murine coronavirus-infected cells,"Abstract We have developed a permeabilized cell system for assaying mouse hepatitis virus-specific RNA polymerase activity. This activity was characterized as to its requirements for mono- and divalent cations, requirements for an exogenous energy source, and pH optimum. This system faithfully reflects MHV-specific RNA synthesis in the intact cell, with regard to both its time of appearance during the course of infection and the products synthesized. The system is efficient and the RNA products were identical to those observed in intact MHV-infected cells as judged by agarose gel electrophoresis and hybridization. Permeabilized cells appear to be an ideal system for studying coronavirus RNA synthesis since they closely mimic in vivo conditions while allowing much of the experimental flexibility of truly cell-free systems.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.18071548,-0.031659672,-0.013986968999999998,0.038557155,-0.050102737,-0.055521184,-0.055663089000000006,0.006680154000000001,0.017403418,-0.025579232,0.022104163,-0.053195470999999994,0.017697268999999998,0.092353636,0.061052655,0.07978183400000001,-0.047340925,0.02701753,0.033994124,-0.004356185,-0.0008308069999999999,-0.016152778,0.060387064000000004,-0.032369641,0.076331236,0.065771677,-0.059549492999999995,0.028405704,-0.08345313900000001,0.026761456
8,Defective-interfering particles of murine coronavirus: Mechanism of synthesis of defective viral RNAs,"Abstract The mechanism of synthesis of the defective viral RNAs in cells infected with defective-interfering (DI) particles of mouse hepatitis virus was studied. Two DI-specific RNA species, DIssA of genomic size and DIssE of subgenomic size, were detected in DI-infected cells. Purified DI particles, however, were found to contain predominantly DIssA and only a trace amount of DIssE RNA. Despite its negligible amount, the DIssE RNA in virions appears to serve as the template for the synthesis of DIssE RNA in infected cells. This conclusion was supported by two studies. First, the uv target size for DIssE RNA synthesis is significantly smaller than that for DIssA. Second, when purified DIssE RNA was transfected into cells which had been infected with a helper virus, DIssE RNA could replicate itself and became a predominant RNA species in the infected cells. Thus, DIssE RNA was not synthesized from the genomic RNA of DI particles. By studying the relationship between virus dilution and the amount of intracellular viral RNA synthesis, we have further shown that DIssE RNA synthesis requires a helper function, but it does not utilize the leader sequence of the helper virus. In contrast, DIssA synthesis appears to be helper-independent and can replicate itself. Thus DIssA codes for a functional RNA polymerase.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.21780687199999998,-0.07471973700000001,-0.058696232,0.08239826,-0.000238597,-0.13520217199999998,-0.106894684,0.057326155999999996,-0.038254555,-0.053364667000000005,0.048607289000000005,-0.110905343,0.012770983,0.08365092,0.170984923,0.18168581,-0.176132044,0.083362897,0.023449563,-0.003726512,0.020157166,-0.003966313,0.066238856,-0.037528602,0.065674535,0.060231442,-0.01187182,0.0068944259999999995,0.024272911,0.033728284
9,Primary structure and translation of a defective interfering rna of murine coronavirus,"Abstract An intracellular defective-interfering (DI) RNA, DIssE, of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) obtained after serial high multiplicity passage of the virus was cloned and sequenced. DIssE RNA is composed of three noncontiguous genomic regions, representing the first 864 nucleotides of the Fend, an internal 748 nucleotides of the polymerase gene, and 601 nucleotides from the 3′ end of the parental MHV genome. The DIssE sequence contains one large continuous open reading frame. Two protein products from this open reading frame were identified both by in vitro translation and in DI-infected cells. Sequence comparison of DIssE and the corresponding parts of the parental virus genome revealed that DIssE had three base substitutions within the leader sequence and also a deletion of nine nucleotides located at the junction of the leader and the remaining genomic sequence. The 5′ end of DIssE RNA was heterogeneous with respect to the number of UCUAA repeats within the leader sequence. The parental MHV genomic RNA appears to have extensive and stable secondary structures at the regions where DI RNA rearrangements occurred. These data suggest that MHV DI RNA may have been generated as a result of the discontinuous and nonprocessive manner of MHV RNA synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.235051133,-0.076129762,-0.043218853,0.042911399,0.09746101900000001,-0.166250233,-0.237979043,0.069175595,-0.015638886,-0.10252881,-0.048883021,-0.127201854,0.071884136,-0.038626328,0.150816917,0.142887516,-0.18011726600000003,0.127762966,0.010779098,-0.015734519,0.058991122,-0.043078845,0.071805363,0.041520007000000005,0.08601728800000001,0.097841311,0.019233417,-0.040765266,0.048116105,-0.009304357
10,Nucleotide sequence of bovine rotavirus gene 1 and expression of the gene product in Baculovirus,"Abstract The nucleotide sequence of the gene that encodes for the structural viral protein VP1 of bovine rotavirus (RF strain) has been determined. The sequence data indicate that segment 1 contains 3302 by and is A+T rich (65.3%). The positive strand of segment 1 contains a single open reading frame that extends 1088 codons and possesses 5′- and 3′-terminal untranslated regions of 18 and 20 bp, respectively. The first AUG conforms to the Kozak consensus sequence and if utilized, would yield a protein having a calculated molecular weight of 124–847, very close to the apparent molecular weight of VP1 (M.W. 125,000). The deduced amino acid sequence presents significant similarities with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of several RNA viruses. VP1 was also synthesized in baculovirus using two transfer vecors: pAC461 and pVL941. Following infection of Sf9 cells with a recombinant baculovirus, a full-length nonfusion protein was synthesised which shares properties with authentic VP1 made in monkey kidney cells. The level of VP1 synthesis was about 10-fold higher when the baculovirus recombinant was derived from the pVL941 transfer vector. In that case, VP1 was expressed in yields approximately equivalent to 10% of the cellular protein. The recombinant protein was immunoprecipitated by hyperimmune serum raised against purified rotavirus. It also was immunogenic; a hyperimmune serum made in guinea pigs reacted with VP1 using immunoprecipitation and Western blot. This serum did not possess neutralization activity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.159671606,-0.052644804,-0.013342452,-0.043433644,0.030220909,-0.04107281,-0.08731689699999999,-0.008680529000000001,0.019043037,-0.04489972,-0.049966989,0.000957638,-0.006769639,-0.043406520999999997,-0.026644772,-0.095561928,0.039263131,-0.020572383,0.034903002,-0.006548976999999999,0.001119881,0.009489687,0.017971871,-0.009371354,-0.010654021000000001,0.049760707,0.037575791000000004,-0.031351016,-0.062284768,0.073808896
11,"Molecular cloning of the gene encoding the putative polymerase of mouse hepatitis coronavirus, strain A59","Abstract Complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries were constructed representing the genome RNA of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59 (MHV-A59). From these libraries clones were selected to form a linear map across the entire gene A, the putative viral polymerase gene. This gene is approximately 23 kb in length, considerably larger than earlier estimates. Sequence analysis of the U terminal region of the genome indicates the presence of the 66-nucleotide leader that is found on all mRNAs. Secondary structure analysis of the 5′terminal region suggests that transcription of leader terminates in the region of nucleotide 66. The sequence of the first 2000 nucleotides is very similar to that reported for the closely related JHM strain of MHV and potentially encodes p28, a basic protein thought to be a component of the viral polymerase (L. Soe, C. K. Shieh, S. Baker, M. F. Chang, and M. M. C. Lai, 1987, J. Virol., 61, 3968–3976). Gene A contains two of the consensus sequences found in intergenic regions.

12,Complex formation between influenza virus polymerase proteins expressed in Xenopus oocytes,"Abstract All three influenza virus polymerase (P) proteins were expressed in Xenopus oocytes from microinjected in vitro transcribed mRNA analogs, with yields of up to 100 ng per oocyte. To examine the functional state of the Xenopus-expressed P proteins, the polypeptides were tested for their ability to form stable complexes with each other. As seen in virus-infected cells, all three P proteins associated into an immunoprecipitable complex, suggesting that the system has considerable promise for the reconstruction of an active influenza RNA polymerase. Examination of the ability of paired combinations of the P proteins to associate indicated that PB1 contained independent binding sites for PB2 and PA, and so probably formed the backbone of the complex. Sedimentation analysis of free and complexed P proteins indicated that PB1 and PB2 did not exist as free monomers, and that similarly, complexes of all three P proteins did not simply consist of one copy of each protein. The heterodisperse sedimentation rate seen for complexes of all three P proteins did not appear to result from their binding to RNA, suggesting the incorporation of additional polypeptides polymerase complex.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.129945972,-0.07703424099999999,-0.049711255,0.040672085,-0.061396595,0.074789275,-0.04431158599999999,-0.013993301999999999,0.009438211,-0.061007444,-0.022509261000000003,-0.005143824,-0.009063904000000001,0.02379516,-0.025608069,-0.019567152,0.056411737,-0.067644751,0.0026934309999999996,0.028397557,-0.013847944,0.027812972000000002,0.0017756579999999998,-0.062720575,0.062110625,0.054012965,-0.033139774,-0.00692144,-0.051395282,0.026111422000000002

The gene encodes an apoprotein of 1581 amino acids with an Mr of about 178K. The open reading frame was cloned behind the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and its translation product was identified as the BEV P protein precursor by in vivo expression and immunoprecipitation. The deduced amino acid sequence contains a number of domains which are typical for type I membrane glycoproteins: an N-terminal signal sequence, a putative C-terminal transmembrane anchor, and a cytoplasmic tail. Eighteen potential N-glycosylation sites, two heptad repeat domains, and a possible “trypsin-like” cleavage site were identified. The mature P protein consists of two subunits and their electrophoretic mobility upon endoglycosidase F treatment strongly suggests that the predicted cleavage site is functional in vivo. The heptad repeat domains are probably involved in the generation of an intra-chain coiled-coil secondary structure; similar inter-chain interactions can play a role in P protein oligomerization. Using a sucrose gradient assay the P protein was indeed shown to form dimers. The intra- and inter-chain coiled-coil interactions may stabilize the elongated BEV peplomers.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.19115940899999997,-0.060084266,-0.02017505,-0.046067588,0.037581721,-0.038722417,-0.116607066,-0.014311962,0.038423055,-0.065083704,-0.142407129,-0.001554665,0.042028329,-0.12526817,-0.08674073300000001,-0.141085173,0.11976916900000001,-0.022652151000000002,0.001204237,0.011609918,-0.009296128,-0.01553879,-0.012435758,-0.026069895,0.02966755,0.082134035,0.019920133,-0.03045977,-0.002983444,-0.021857371
14,Establishing a genetic recombination map for murine coronavirus strain A59 complementation groups,"Abstract MHV-A59 temperature-sensitive mutants, representing one RNA+ and five RNA− complementation groups, were isolated and characterized by genetic recombination techniques. Maximum recombination frequencies occurred under multiplicities of infection greater than 10 each in which 99.99% of the cells were co-infected. Recombination frequencies between different is mutants increased steadily during infection and peaked late in the virus growth cycle. These data suggest that recombination is a late event in the virus replication cycle. Recombination frequencies were also found to range from 63 to 20,000 times higher than the sum of the spontaneous reversion frequencies of each is mutant used in the cross. Utilizing standard genetic recombination techniques, the five RNA− complementation groups of MHV-A59 were arranged into an additive, linear, genetic map located at the 5′ end of the genome in the 23-kb polymerase region. These data indicate that at least five distinct functions are encoded in the MHV polymerase region which function in virus transcription. Moreover, using well-characterized is mutants the recombination frequency for the entire 32-kb MHV genome was found to approach 25% or more. This is the highest recombination frequency described for a nonsegmented, linear, plus-polarity RNA virus.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.145608755,-0.05801155400000001,-0.019197505,0.023837411,0.06202435,-0.067090807,-0.065785195,0.023800973,-0.033326876,0.0018968260000000001,0.040214659,-0.020796478,0.005266173000000001,-0.009776601,0.073893326,0.110152686,-0.115907262,0.022915405,-0.04649612400000001,0.014361383,0.07307943,-0.089479877,0.05424729599999999,0.073118855,0.013538382,0.061740540999999996,0.0594034,-0.018166109,-0.136206587,-0.016656718
15,Comparison of the genome organization of toro- and coronaviruses: Evidence for two nonhomologous RNA recombination events during berne virus evolution,"Abstract Recently, toroviruses and coronaviruses have been found to be ancestrally related by divergence of their polymerase and envelope proteins from common ancestors. In addition, their genome organization and expression strategy, which involves the synthesis of a 3′-coterminal nested set of mRNAs, are comparable. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the genome of the torovirus prototype, Berne virus (BEV), has now revealed the results of two independent nonhomologous RNA recombinations during torovirus evolution. Berne virus open reading frame (ORF) 4 encodes a protein with significant sequence similarity (30–35% identical residues) to a part of the hemagglutinin esterase proteins of corona-viruses and influenza virus C. The sequence of the C-terminal part of the predicted BEV polymerase ORF1a product contains 31–36% identical amino acids when compared with the sequence of a nonstructural 30 32K corona-virus protein. The cluster of coronaviruses which contains this nonstructural gene expresses it not as a part of their polymerase, but by synthesizing an additional subgenomic mRNA.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.165957662,-0.069865155,-0.038553082,0.02582185,0.127827862,-0.01758682,-0.143129506,0.012950931,0.003962096,-0.06799256,-0.12365422599999999,-0.035769855,0.073490077,-0.105765149,-0.046741762,-0.12230134599999999,0.10670851099999999,-0.02061496,0.024394988,0.037785757,-0.01257411,-0.015534265,-0.029013854,0.018224231,-0.025569355,0.022234893999999998,0.031962056,-0.03104245,-0.0077825559999999995,-0.028308912999999998
16,The complete sequence (22 kilobases) of murine coronavirus gene 1 encoding the putative proteases and RNA polymerase,"Abstract The 5′-most gene, gene 1, of the genome of murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), is presumed to encode the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. We have determined the complete sequence of this gene of the JHM strain by cDNA cloning and sequencing. The total length of this gene is 21,798 nucleotides long, which includes two overlapping, large open reading frames. The first open reading frame, ORF 1 a, is 4488 amino acids long. The second open reading frame, ORF 1 b, overlaps ORF 1 a for 75 nucleotides, and is 2731 amino acids long. The overlapping region may fold into a pseudoknot RNA structure, similar to the corresponding region of the RNA of avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The in vitro transcription and translation studies of this region indicated that these two ORFs were most likely translated into one polyprotein by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. Thus, the predicted molecular weight of the gene 1 product is more than 800,000 Da. The sequence of ORF 1 b is very similar to the corresponding ORF of IBV. In contrast, the ORF 1 a of these two viruses differ in size and have a high degree of divergence. The amino acid sequence analysis suggested that ORF 1 a contains several functional domains, including two hydrophobic, membrane-anchoring domains, and three cysteine-rich domains. It also contains a picornaviral 3C-like protease domain and two papain-like protease domains. The presence of these protease domains suggests that the polyprotein is most likely processed into multiple protein products. In contrast, the ORF 1b contains polymerase, helicase, and zinc-finger motifs. These sequence studies suggested that the MHV gene 1 product is involved in RNA synthesis, and that this product is processed autoproteolytically after translation. This study completes the sequence of the MHV genome, which is 31 kb long, and constitutes the largest viral RNA known.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.264343415,-0.074530704,-0.034984146,0.016413908,0.197986157,-0.115211908,-0.274440248,0.014786829,0.04799034,0.011387588,-0.14501655900000002,-0.050318329,0.093271176,-0.165436472,-0.09854859099999999,-0.112505533,0.093735137,0.052563047,0.06679636900000001,0.046617112,-0.059997685,-0.030074632999999996,-0.049864677,0.013893638,-0.023979606,0.052399205,0.056485484,-0.072044562,-0.025509972000000002,-0.06438793
18,De novo generation of defective interfering RNAs of tomato bushy stunt virus by high multiplicity passage,"Abstract Defective interfering (DI) RNAs were generated de novo in each of 12 independent isolates of tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) upon serial passage at high multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.) in plants, but not in any of 4 additional isolates after 11 serial passages at low m.o.i. The DI RNAs were detected in RNA isolated from virus particles and in 2.3 M LiCl-soluble RNA fractions isolated from inoculated leaves. Symptom attenuation leading to persistent infections was closely correlated with the passage in which DIs first developed. Comparisons of nucleotide sequences of 10 cDNA clones from 2 DI RNA populations and with a previously characterized TBSV DI RNA revealed the same four regions of sequence from the TBSV genome were strictly conserved in each of the DI RNAs: the virus 5′ leader sequence of 168 bases; a region of approximately 200–250 bases from the viral polymerase gene; approximately 70 bases from the 3′ terminus of the viral pl9 and p22 genes; and approximately 130 bases from the 3′terminal noncoding region. Conservation of the sequence motif present in all of the DIs suggests that there might be a common mechanism of DI formation as well as selection pressure to maintain sequences essential for replication and encapsidation.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.173383103,-0.07347427599999999,-0.028874386000000002,0.030310074,0.091154435,-0.11972227,-0.162504097,0.05427145,-0.026401291,-0.038534455,0.0066689359999999994,-0.10294642,0.038135544,-0.009545218000000001,0.174700382,0.153557485,-0.20953142800000002,0.114511254,-0.0064859209999999995,-0.005112198,0.08843490300000001,-0.038460767,0.07380010099999999,0.052917726,0.035451618,0.076937822,0.040297229,-0.010768083999999999,0.076090564,0.000943649
19,Evolutionary relatedness of the predicted gene product of RNA segment 2 of the Tick-Borne Dhori virus and the PB1 polymerase gene of influenza viruses,"Abstract The complete nucleotide sequence of the second largest RNA segment of Dhori/India/1313/61 virus was determined and the deduced amino acid sequence was compared with the polymerase (P) proteins of influenza A, B, and C viruses. RNA segment 2 (2224 nucleotides) of Dhori virus contains a single long open reading frame that can encode a 716-amino amid polypeptide (81.3 kDa). The predicted polypeptide shares between 27 and 31% sequence identities with the PB1 polypeptides of influenza A, B, and C viruses. Among the regions most highly conserved are the sequences around the Asp-Asp motif common to many RNA polymerases. In spite of the high level of sequence identity between the Dhori RNA segment 2 gene product and the influenza A, B, and C virus PB1 proteins the amino acid composition of the Dhori protein indicates an acidic charge feature at pH 7.0 in contrast to the basic nature of the PB1 proteins of the influenza viruses. We suggest that the Dhori PB1-like protein be designated the Pα protein of this virus.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14969976599999998,-0.117688465,-0.047324468,0.13382992400000002,0.089882268,0.09187819300000001,-0.178866818,0.016675273,-0.019082867,-0.06702623,-0.07899906799999999,-0.001907384,0.04886660599999999,-0.12304810699999999,-0.051396887999999995,-0.126784269,0.091103097,-0.031685965,0.018648665,0.028341732999999997,-0.004684682,-0.012446086,-0.005851409,0.019353811000000002,-0.02461647,0.060394192,0.021033164,-0.044364169,-0.068623528,0.017751186999999998
20,Hepatitis E virus (HEV): Molecular cloning and sequencing of the full-length viral genome,"Abstract We have recently described the cloning of a portion of the hepatitis E virus (HEV) and confirmed its etiologic association with enterically transmitted (waterborne, epidemic) non-A, non-B hepatitis. The virus consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.5 kb, with a polyadenylated 3' end. We now report on the cloning and nucleotide sequencing of an overlapping, contiguous set of cDNA clones representing the entire genome of the HEV Burma strain [HEV(B)]. The largest open reading frame extends approximately 5 kb from the Fend and contains the RNA-directed RNA polymerase and nucleoside triphosphate binding motifs. The second major open reading frame (ORF2) begins 37 by downstream of the first and extends approximately 2 kb to the termination codon present 65 by from the 3' terminal stretch of poly(A) residues. ORF2 contains a consensus signal peptide sequence at its amino terminus and a capsid-like region with a high content of basic amino acids similar to that seen with other virus capsid proteins. A third open reading frame partially overlaps the first and second and encompasses only 369 bp. In addition to the 7.5-kb full-length genomic transcript, two subgenomic polyadenylated messages of approximately 3.7 and 2.0 kb were detected in infected liver using a probe from the 3' third of the genome. The genomic organization of the virus is consistent with the Fend encoding nonstructural and the 3' end encoding the viral structural gene(s). The expression strategy of the virus involves the use of three different open reading frames and at least three different transcripts. HEV was previously determined to be a nonenveloped particle with a diameter of 27–34 nm. These findings on the genetic organization and expression strategy of HEV suggest that it is the prototype human pathogen for a new class of RNA virus or perhaps a separate genus within the Caliciviridae family",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.190883413,-0.063916635,-0.029354537000000003,0.020505153,0.09763523800000001,-0.073853386,-0.125492942,0.023159884,0.010414644,-0.03758247,-0.07383062,-0.032052359,0.058453825,-0.09750116,0.00117859,-0.097494876,0.024687735,0.051036217,0.044168719,0.019354175,0.010069001,-0.011279939,-0.038675486,0.019793326,-0.077611702,0.016875684,0.037251853,-0.027730308999999998,-0.006524058,-0.026811757000000002
21,Random nature of coronavirus RNA recombination in the absence of selection pressure,"Abstract RNA-RNA recombination is thought to occur preferentially at certain selected sites and in only a few RNA viruses; the mechanism for these restrictions is unknown. In this paper we report the development of a recombination assay for coronavirus, using polymerase chain reaction, in the absence of selection pressure. Our results showed that within a 1-kb region of the peplomer gene, RNA recombination occurred at almost every potential crossover site. Thus, coronavirus RNA recombination appears to be more random than previously realized. However, after serial passages of the recombinant viruses in tissue culture, the recombination sites among the progeny viruses became clustered in the region which contains the previously reported “hot spot” for coronavirus recombination. These results suggest that RNA recombination is common and random in nature, but only certain recombinants can be selected. Thus, the presence of recombinational “hot spots” for coronavirus or other RNA viruses most likely resulted from selection of certain recombinant viruses and not restriction on the occurrence of RNA recombination. The failure to detect recombinants in other RNA viruses may therefore be due to unfavorable properties of recombinant viruses. This approach can be used to detect recombinants in these viruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.152736237,-0.03398089,-0.030490156,0.112077917,0.10001953699999999,-0.079261641,-0.024594896,0.044732047000000004,-0.062770094,0.05799252,0.07663216,0.004291603,0.025481983,-0.001268792,0.050767438,0.04375199,-0.07857323299999999,-0.014201463000000001,-0.021888281000000002,-0.016983532,0.074106315,-0.037477527000000004,0.005876014000000001,0.086027936,-0.076944115,-0.00186432,0.051927895,-0.0015062279999999999,-0.082499954,-0.053900780999999995
22,Sequence analysis of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus genome segment B and its encoded VP1 protein: A putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase lacking the Gly-Asp-Asp motif,"Abstract The genome segment B sequence of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus was determined for both the Jasper and Sp serotypes. The sequences are 2784 and 2630 by long, respectively, and contain a single large open reading frame encoding the VP1 protein, the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of IPNV. The proteins exhibit an 88% homology with each other, but only 41% with infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) VP1, another member of the Birnaviridae. Despite the low overall homology between the IPNV and IBDV VP1 proteins, homologous regions were detected within the central portion of the proteins. The carboxy-proximal regions of the VP1, which contain very low amino acid homology, displayed evidence of conservation in structural features such as a hydrophilic, highly basic domain. Consensus sequences associated with GTP-binding proteins and RdRps were also detected in VP1. However, unlike the RdRps associated with single-stranded plus RNA viruses, the birnavirus RdRp lacks the Gly-Asp-Asp motif characteristic of this enzyme family.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.16547337199999998,-0.049625637,-0.041609983999999996,0.021808626,0.052860859,-0.043161528,-0.029734351000000003,0.004988843,-0.022781701,0.015808168,0.006521343000000001,0.052494526,-0.007180956,-0.105412812,-0.052776782,-0.080745684,0.06480159,-0.032945559,-0.00940699,-0.008539246,0.016750418,-0.004682072,-0.009049888,-0.019769231,-0.0028135940000000004,0.047288573,0.020656079,-0.0008589369999999999,-0.041131216,0.024682593
23,Cloning and sequencing of the matrix protein (M) gene of turkey rhinotracheitis virus reveal a gene order different from that of respiratory syncytial virus,"Abstract Several biochemical properties and the sequence of the fusion glycoprotein (F) have indicated that turkey rhinotracheitis virus (TRTV) is a pneumovirus, subfamily Pneumovirinae of the Paramyxoviridae family. As TRTV was known to generate polycistronic mRNAs, cDNA was generated from TRTV strain U K/3 BV/85-infected Vero cell mRNAs using an oligonucleotide primer corresponding to a region of the F gene. Sequencing of four cDNAs revealed that the gene adjacent to the beginning (3′ end) of the F gene was that for the matrix (M) protein, i.e., that TRTV had the partial gene order 3′-M-F-5′. This was unexpected as human respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, the type species of the genus Pneumovirus, has the partial gene order 3′-M-SH-G-F-5′, where SH and G are the small hydrophobic protein and attachment glycoprotein, respectively. Instead TRTV resembled the Morbillivirus and Paramyxovirus genera of the Paramyxoviridae (subfamily Paramyxoviridae) which have the partial gene order 3′-M-F-5′. Two further oligonucleotides, one corresponding to a sequence near the end of the M gene and the other (oligo B) to a sequence near the beginning of the F gene, with their 5′ ends spaced 300 nucleotides apart on the basis of the cDNA sequence, were used in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using genomic RNA as template. Only a PCR product of 0.3 kb was obtained. The same sized product was also obtained using these oligonucleotides and genomic RNA from three other TRTV strains (SA/91 /78, UK/8544/85, and SA/2381/88) which had been grown in chicken tracheal organ cultures. In addition PCR was performed using genomic RNA from TRTV-3BV and SA/2381/88 with oligo B and another oligonucleotide near the 5′ end of the gene upstream from M, spaced 1141 nucleotides apart on the basis of the sequence data. Only a 1.14-kb PCR product was obtained. Larger products would have been expected if another gene had been situated between M and F. The absence of such larger products, plus the demonstration that infected cells contained M-F dicistronic mRNAs, supported the conclusion that in the TRTV genome the M gene is adjacent to the F gene in the order 3'-M-F-5′. The 5′ termini of the M and F mRNAs were confirmed by mRNA mapping. The TRTV M gene encoded a protein of 254 amino acids, very similar to that of RS virus (256 residues; 37% amino acid identity) but very different from that of the morbilliviruses and paramyxoviruses (approximately 350 residues). Thus, on the basis of the sequences of both the M and the F genes, TRTV is more closely related to the pneumoviruses than to the paramyxoviruses and morbilliviruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.131066245,-0.031618215,0.03513025,-0.040852174,0.110536744,-0.02823365,-0.113716389,-0.004775468,0.023922959,-0.02774968,-0.08537161800000001,-0.042204618,0.029402531000000003,-0.038655865,-0.024809576,-0.045228955,0.019316281,-0.002286441,-0.002484637,-0.027250862,0.032819238,0.008856104,0.025594597,0.025596447,-0.017991958,-0.006533535,0.018240673,-0.027628438999999998,0.010334304,0.039311371
24,The 9-kDa hydrophobic protein encoded at the 3′ end of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus genome is membrane-associated,"Abstract The open reading frame potentially encoding a 78 amino acid, 9101 Da hydrophobic protein (HP) and, mapping at the 3′ end of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) genome, was shown to be expressed during virus replication. The cloned HP gene was placed in a plasmid under control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and in vitro translation of transcripts generated in vitro yielded a 9.1-kDa protein that was immunoprecipitable with porcine hyperimmune anti-TGEV serum. Antiserum raised in rabbits against a 31 amino acid synthetic polypeptide that represented the central hydrophilic region of HP specifically immunoprecipitated HP from TGEV-infected cells. HP was further shown to become associated with microsomal membranes during synthesis in vitro and was found to be closely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and cell surface membranes in infected cells. The intracellular location of HP suggests that it may play a role in the membrane association of replication complexes or in virion assembly.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.150810138,-0.048356512000000004,-0.013611106000000001,-0.057683881,-0.012069268000000001,-0.021430374,-0.073514843,-0.016940607,0.040974839,-0.06172496400000001,-0.059934815999999995,-0.014243671000000001,-0.002388431,-0.001582633,0.026198138,-0.06070326400000001,0.035101355,-0.017314686,0.029901373999999998,0.053616014000000004,-0.029832527999999997,0.004363614,0.00893199,-0.021994887999999997,0.055231358,0.045002164000000004,-0.021419032,-0.040204352,-0.05488836,0.02269888
25,The hemagglutinin/esterase gene of human coronavirus strain OC43: Phylogenetic relationships to bovine and murine coronaviruses and influenza C virus,"Abstract The complete nucleotide sequences of the hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) genes of human coronavirus (HCV) strain OC43 and bovine respiratory coronavirus (BRCV) strain G95 were determined from single-stranded cDNA fragments generated by reverse transcription of virus-specific mRNAs and amplified by polymerase chain reaction. An open reading frame of 1272 nucleotides was identified as the putative HE gene by homology to the bovine coronavirus HE gene. This open reading frame encodes a protein of 424 amino acids with an estimated molecular weight of 47.7 kDa. Ten potential N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted in the HE protein of HCV-OC43 while nine of them were present in BRCV-G95. Fourteen cysteine residues were conserved in the HE proteins of both viruses. Two hydrophobic sequences at the N-terminus and the C-terminus may serve as signal peptide and transmembrane anchoring domain, respectively. The predicted HE protein of HCV-OC43 was 95% identical to the HEs of BRCV-G95 and other bovine coronaviruses, and 60% identical to the HEs of mouse hepatitis viruses. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the HE genes of coronaviruses and influenza C virus have a common ancestral origin, and that bovine coronaviruses and HCV-OC43 are closely related.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.129473888,-0.042130263,-0.022607352,-0.0014319789999999999,0.156031848,-0.004385494,-0.103625138,-0.020987343999999998,0.069227965,-0.067809756,-0.141068742,0.075595782,0.152467027,-0.045166701,-0.057231658,-0.138969882,0.087904522,0.138998119,0.22788524100000002,-0.049903641,-0.031126228,-0.020632121,0.06475562,0.109536075,-0.006476037,-0.009716782,-0.000188186,-0.025667121,-0.066239779,-0.071855587
27,Comparison of a dengue-2 virus and its candidate vaccine derivative: Sequence relationships with the flaviviruses and other viruses,"Abstract A comparison of the sequence of the dengue-2 16681 virus with that of the candidate vaccine strain (16681-PDK53) derived from it identified 53 of the 10,723 nucleotides which differed between the strains. Nucleotide changes occurred in genes coding for all virion and nonvirion proteins, and in the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions. Twenty-seven of the nucleotide changes resulted in amino acid alterations. The greatest amino acid sequence differences in the virion proteins occurred in prM (2.20%; 2 91 amino acids) followed by the M protein (1.33%; 1 75 amino acids), the C protein (0.88%; 1 114 amino acid), and the E protein (0.61%; 3 495 amino acids). Differences in the amino acid sequence of nonvirion proteins ranged from 1.51% ( 6 398 amino acids) in NS4 to 0.33% ( 3 900 amino acids) in NS5. The encoded protein sequences of 16681-PDK53 were also compared with the published sequences of other flaviviruses to obtain a detailed classification of 17 flaviviruses using the neighbor-joining tree method. The analyses of the sequence data produced dendrograms which supported the traditional groupings based on serological evidence, and they suggested that the flaviviruses have evolved by divergent mutational change and there was no evidence of genetic recombination between members of the group. Comparisons of the sequences of the flavivirus polymerase and helicase-like proteins (NS5 and NS3, respectively) with those from other viruses yielded a classification of the flaviviruses indicating that the primary division of the flaviviruses was between those transmitted by mosquitoes and those transmitted by ticks.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.137640406,-0.055155530999999994,0.002351386,-0.06427179,0.089531023,0.01101103,-0.074886242,-0.012590948999999999,0.014279688,-0.011591818,-0.09106564199999999,0.040991022,0.013836011,-0.145948145,-0.054277507999999995,-0.131759702,0.053181244,-0.010932996,-0.008255621999999999,0.029095475,0.006452116999999999,-0.03288473,-0.005707391,0.014562314,0.024986866,0.092726241,0.054928674000000004,-0.055238638,-0.094162331,0.055129005999999994
28,Evidence for variable rates of recombination in the MHV genome,"Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus has been shown to undergo RNA recombination at high frequency during mixed infection. Temperature-sensitive mutants were isolated using 5-fluorouracil and 5-azacytidine as mutagen. Six RNA+ mutants that reside within a single complementation group mapping within the S glycoprotein gene of MHV-A59 were isolated which did not cause syncytium at the restrictive temperature. Using standard genetic techniques, a recombination map was established that indicated that these mutants mapped into two distinct domains designated F1 and F2. These genetic domains may correspond to mutations mapping within the S1 and S2 glycoproteins, respectively, and suggest that both the S1 and S2 domains are important in eliciting the fusogenic activity of the S glycoprotein gene. In addition, assuming that most distal is alleles map roughly 4.0 kb apart, a recombination frequency of 1 % per 575–676 by was predicted through the S glycoprotein gene. Interestingly, this represents a threefold increase in the recombination frequency as compared to rates predicted through the polymerase region. The increase in the recombination rate was probably not due to recombination events resulting in large deletions or insertions (>50 bp), but rather was probably due to a combination of homologous and nonhomologous recombination. A variety of explanations could account for the increased rates of recombination in the S gene.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.12850893800000002,-0.044088737999999995,0.000509669,-0.028409742,0.086828443,-0.025726579,-0.055582322,0.011438482,-0.013640871,0.021967625,0.010405323000000001,0.015089648999999998,-0.008071471,-0.056181745,0.007809624,0.058310053,-0.073915918,0.016899031999999998,-0.04317591,-0.011745953,0.081534088,-0.095996626,0.051938045,0.08864972900000001,-0.01764894,0.042856289000000006,0.066645534,-0.026483883,-0.09656317699999999,-0.032071001
29,Coronavirus mRNA synthesis: Identification of novel transcription initiation signals which are differentially regulated by different leader sequences,"Abstract The mRNA synthesis of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) has been proposed to be the result of interaction between the leader RNA and the intergenic sites. Previously, we have identified a transcription initiation site (for mRNA 2-1), which is more efficiently transcribed by viruses containing two copies of UCUAA sequence in the leader RNA than by those with three copies. In this study, we have identified several sites which are regulated in the opposite way, namely, they are efficiently transcribed by the leader RNA with three UCUAA copies but not by those with two copies. These sites were characterized by primer extension and amplification by polymerase chain reaction. One of these sites is in the gene 3 region of a recombinant virus between A59 and JHM strains of MHV. Another is in the gene 2 region of MHV-1 strain. Both of these sites have a sequence similar to but different from the consensus transcription initiation signal (UCUAAUCUAUC and UUUAAUCUU, as opposed to UCUAAAC). These two novel intergenic sequences are not present in the genome of the JHM strain, consistent with the absence of these mRNAs in the JHM-infected cells. The discovery of this type of transcription initiation site provides additional evidence for the importance of the leader RNA in the transcription initiation of MHV mRNAs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.201111659,-0.055817469,0.006605324,0.030627737000000002,0.082602469,-0.11000812199999999,-0.16849526199999998,0.031880232,-0.00722999,-0.07966042200000001,-0.054340862000000004,-0.073613255,0.035263535,-0.001791552,0.060194921,0.07015983099999999,-0.09460857800000001,0.04209274,-0.015378484,0.004860631,0.052620712,0.003877138,0.026592886,0.076296959,0.085604995,0.008112171999999999,-0.015992472,0.017327811999999998,0.042332519000000006,0.046733032
30,The mechanism of RNA recombination in poliovirus,"Abstract We have investigated RNA recombination among poliovirus genomes by analyzing both intratypic and intertypic recombinant crosses involving the same defined genetic markers. Sequence analysis of the recombinant junctions of 13 nonsibling intertypic recombinants showed that intertypic RNA recombination is not site-specific, nor does it require extensive homology between the recombining parents at the crossover site. To discriminate between breaking-rejoining and copy choice mechanisms of RNA recombination, we have inhibited the replication of the recombining parents independently and found opposite effects on the frequency of genetic recombination in intratypic crosses. The results strongly support a copy choice mechanism for RNA recombination, in which the viral RNA polymerase switches templates during negative strand synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.187405901,-0.054103589,-0.044146482,0.058631924,0.034325976,-0.080744426,-0.030497611,0.041680195,-0.056249697,0.020822636999999998,0.085367441,0.025276187999999998,-0.024267083999999998,-0.0015923579999999999,0.030542085,0.08692770400000001,-0.089676739,-0.005428422,-0.045859762000000005,-0.036844227,0.043648105,-0.040533868,0.013704031,0.023589682,-0.059194784,-0.026764382000000003,0.026506315,0.010448575,-0.061943842,0.002029846
38,Inhibitory effect of papaverine on RNA and protein synthesis of vesicular stomatitis virus,"Abstract Papaverine, an inhibitor of cAMP phosphodiesterase, reduced yields of infectious vesicular stomatitis virus in HEp-2 cells approximately 100-fold if added to cultures at a concentration of 30 μM before and after virus infection. The extent of papaverine-induced suppression of viral growth was dependent on drug dose and treatment regimen. Cells progressively recovered their viral permissive state after removal of drug. The cyclic nucleotide, cGMP, nullified the inhibitory effect of papaverine if added to cells during drug treatment. Pulse labeling experiments with [35S]methionine showed that papaverine compromises production of all virus-specific proteins in infected cells without adversely affecting host cell protein synthesis. Treatment of cells with papaverine strongly inhibited the production of viral RNA and both cellular RNA and DNA. It was found that VSV causes an immediate but transient stimulation of DNA synthesis in HEp-2 cells which is prevented by papaverine treatment. This drug also selectively blocked primary transcription of VSV in vivo and to a lesser extent in vitro RNA polymerase activity of the virion-bound transcriptase. The finding that papaverine has a strong inhibitory effect on viral biosynthesis including early transcription suggests that VSV replication may depend on host factors that regulate intracellular levels of cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.172517394,-0.061936397000000004,-0.050322026,0.004487502,-0.15982248,0.042369919000000006,0.045419745,-0.032709628,0.057081098,0.026209455,0.006572873000000001,-0.07331360099999999,0.0036834359999999996,0.15151141,0.010600423999999999,0.025455000000000002,-0.016864037,0.018761908,0.045424505,0.052908576,-0.031226322999999997,0.053815222999999995,-0.012240976,0.000488061,0.02935635,0.013647181000000001,0.011484755,0.012627521000000001,-0.019236223,0.057796658

40,The cloning and sequencing of the virion protein genes from a British isolate of porcine respiratory coronavirus: comparison with transmissible gastroenteritis virus genes,"Abstract Previous analysis of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) mRNA species showed that mRNAs 2 and 3 were smaller than the corresponding transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) mRNA species (Page et al. (1991) J. Gen. Virol. 72, 579–587). Sequence analysis showed that mRNA 3 was smaller due to the presence of a new putative RNA-leader binding site upstream of the PRCV ORF-3 gene. However, this observation did not explain the deletion observed in PRCV mRNA 2. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to generate cDNA from the 3' coding region of the putative polymerase gene to the poly (A) tail of PRCV for comparison to the equivalent region from TGEV. The PRCV S protein was found to consist of 1225 amino acids, which had 98% similarity to the TGEV S protein. However, the PRCV S gene contained a 672 nucleotide deletion, corresponding to 224 amino acids (residues 21 to 245 in TGEV S protein), 59 nucleotides downstream of the S gene initiation codon. The PRCV genome from the ORF-3 gene to the poly (A) tail was sequenced for comparison to TGEV in order to identify other potential differences between the two viruses. Four ORFs were identified that showed 98% similarity to the TGEV ORF-4, M, N and ORF-7 genes.

41,Sequence analysis of human coronavirus 229E mRNAs 4 and 5: evidence for polymorphism and homology with myelin basic protein,"Abstract Human coronaviruses (HCV) are important pathogens responsible for respiratory, gastrointestinal and possibly neurological disorders. To better understand the molecular biology of the prototype HCV-229E strain, the nucleotide sequence of the 5'-unique regions of mRNAs 4 and 5 were determined from cloned cDNAs. Sequence analysis of the cDNAs synthesized from mRNA 4 revealed a major difference with previously published results. However, polymerase chain reaction amplification of this region showed that the sequenced cDNAs were produced from minor RNA species, an indication of possible genetic polymorphism in this region of the viral genome. The mutated messenger RNA 4 contains two ORFs: (1) ORF4a consisting of 132 nucleotides which potentially encodes a 44-amino acid polypeptide of 4653 Da; this coding sequence is preceded by a consensus transcriptional initiation sequence, CUAAACU, similar to the ones found upstream of the N and M genes; (2) ORF4b of 249 nucleotides potentially encoding an 83-amino acid basic and leucine-rich polypeptide of 9550 Da. On the other hand, mRNA 5 contains one single ORF of 231 nucleotides which could encode a 77-amino acid basic and leucine-rich polypeptide of 9046 Da. This putative protein presents a significant degree of amino acid homology (33%) with its counterpart found in transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). The proteins in the two different viruses exhibit similar molecular weights and are extremely hydrophobic. Interestingly, a sequence homology of five amino acids was found between the protein encoded by ORF4b of HCV-229E and an immunologically important region of human myelin basic protein.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.1723439,-0.058732723,-0.013616903999999999,-0.02274303,0.11236797800000001,-0.056931464,-0.09057054,0.008092761,0.032887701,-0.025714487999999997,-0.131782976,0.040891858999999996,0.117760399,-0.13059537699999998,-0.063488788,-0.146778443,0.06300939700000001,0.09869442199999999,0.11301017599999999,-0.013890443999999998,-0.032731645,-0.038654141,0.024768252999999997,0.047605729000000006,-0.028156732,-0.013930306000000002,-0.007971576,-0.002106961,-0.057728468,-0.007433034
42,Detection of negative-stranded subgenomic RNAs but not of free leader in LDV-infected macrophages,"Abstract The mechanism of synthesis of the seven subgenomic mRNAs of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) was explored. One proposed mechanism, leader-primed transcription, predicts the formation of free 5'-leader in infected cells which then primes reinitiation of transcription at specific complementary sites on the antigenomic template. No free LDV 5'-leader of 156 nucleotides was detected in LDV-infected macrophages. Another mechanism, independent replication of the subgenomic mRNAs, predicts the presence of negative complements to all subgenomic mRNAs in infected cells which might be generated from subgenomic mRNAs in virions. Full-length antigenomic RNA was detected in LDV-infected macrophages by Northern hybridization at a level of < 1% of that of genomic RNA, but no negative polarity subgenomic RNAs. Negative complements to all subgenomic mRNAs, however, were detected by reverse transcription of total RNA from infected macrophages using as primer an oligonucleotide complementary to the antileader followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification using this sense primer in combination with various oligonucleotide primers complementary to a segment downstream of the junction between the 5' leader and the body of each subgenomic RNA. It is unclear whether these minute amounts of negative subgenomic RNAs function in the replication of the subgenomic mRNAs. They could also be by-products of the RNA replication process. Finally, no subgenomic mRNAs were detected in LDV virions.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.156668359,-0.054365591,-0.010906094,0.016535458,0.000435115,-0.09260535800000001,-0.093925662,0.033248108,-0.011306375,-0.06377519599999999,0.009558162,-0.063706951,0.015231525,0.058029242,0.081632867,0.084975681,-0.067815196,0.016072083,0.002068325,-0.002541644,-0.022061346000000003,0.018250027,-0.008166076999999999,-0.032443146,0.025731659,-0.05865221,-0.06037425,0.035687001,0.049776905999999996,0.034283557
45,Detection of related positive-strand RNA virus genomes by reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers for common replicase sequences,"Abstract A set of degenerate sense and antisense primers were designed on the basis of short segments with identical amino acids in the predicted ORF 1b replicase proteins of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), equine arteritis virus (EAV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, strain Lelystad virus (PRRSV-LV), which are members of a new group of positive-strand RNA viruses. Reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction amplification using this set of degenerate primers yielded products of the expected size from the genomes of all three viruses. It also yielded a product of appropriate size from the genome of another strain of PRRSV (VR2332), the ORF 1b sequence of which is unknown, but the 3′ end of the genome of which differs from that of the PRRSV-LV genome by about 50%. No products were generated from the genome of simian hemorhagic fever virus (SHFV), another member of this virus group. However, an appropriate product was generated with a second set of degenerate primers which was designed from the same ORF 1b segments of LDV, EAV and PRRSV-LV as the first set but on the basis of human codon preferences. Sequence analysis showed that the amplified SHFV ORF 1b segment exhibited about 50% nucleotide identity with the corresponding segments of ORF 1b of LDV, EAV and PRRSV. The results show that these and other degenerate primer sets might be useful for the search of related viruses in other mammalian species.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.106918939,-0.037146381,0.021136815,0.006472103000000001,0.09113093300000001,-0.028890071,-0.09492513,-0.0018261179999999998,0.008467986,-0.014148697,-0.072785511,-0.028406147000000003,0.036223338,-0.044187022,0.036233429,-0.110943839,0.06737059299999999,-0.0058094390000000004,0.023559395,0.05118297,-0.043742317,-0.012794528000000001,-0.025189863,0.0015242720000000001,-0.029828821000000002,0.027394729,0.019780327,-0.043400512999999995,-0.112372046,0.014762148000000001
46,A general method for the induction and screening of antisera for cDNA-encoded polypeptides: antibodies specific for a coronavirus putative polymerase-encoding gene,"Abstract A prokaryotic vector, pGE374, containing the recA and lacZ genes, out-of-frame, was used for the expression of cDNA derived from the putative polymerase-encoding gene of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59). The pGE374/viral recombinant vector generates a tripartite bacterial/viral protein composed of a segment of the RecA protein at the N terminus, the coronaviral sequences in the middle, and an enzymatically active β-galactosidase at the C terminus. Rabbits immunized with such recombinant proteins generated antibodies to the MHV-A59 portion of the tripartite protein. Because the MHV-A59 polymerase proteins have been difficult to identify during infection, we used a novel method to demonstrate the viral specificity of the antiserum. The viral cDNA was excised from the expression vector, and transferred to a pGem vector, downstream from and in-frame with a portion of the cat gene. This construct contained a bacteriophage RNA polymerase promoter that enabled the cell-free synthesis of a fusion protein that was used to verify that antibodies were generated to the expressed viral DNA. This strategy was shown to successfully result in the specific generation of antibodies to the encoded information of the viral cDNA. Furthermore, this method has general applicability in the generation and characterization of antibodies directed against proteins encoded in cDNAs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.178433874,-0.054643922000000004,-0.005888081,-0.01863746,-0.016416512,-0.04601387,-0.118764177,-0.023393996,0.062704318,-0.02653088,-0.12254764800000001,-0.121839763,0.098333531,0.0026746540000000003,0.010285439,-0.038451311,-0.002918294,-0.012119436,0.000957382,0.032240921,-0.011943433,0.016735358999999998,0.049938962,0.018521742,0.091293666,0.123434165,0.051855715999999996,-0.060624705999999993,-0.10388819199999999,0.092211347
47,Enhancement of the vaccinia virus/phage T7 RNA polymerase expression system using encephalomyocarditis virus 5'-untranslated region sequences,"Abstract A recombinant vaccinia virus producing the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase was used to express foreign genes in eukaryotic cells. Translation efficiency in this expression system was enhanced significantly by employing the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 5'-untranslated region (UTR) which confers cap-independent translation by directing internal initiation of translation. The enhancement was accomplished by fusing open reading frames (ORFs) to the N terminus of the EMCV polyprotein coding region, thus utilizing its highly efficient translation initiation site. Expression vectors were constructed to allow cloning in all three reading frames. As reporter genes, we used the lacZ gene and a number of genes encoding coronavirus structural proteins: among others the genes encoding glycoproteins with N-terminal signal sequences. The signal sequences of these glycoproteins are located internally in the primary translation product. We demonstrated that this did not interfere with translocation and glycosylation and yields biologically active proteins. The usefulness of sequences that direct internal initiation was extended by using EMCV UTR s to express two and three ORFs from polycistronic mRNAs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.176274703,-0.060981204000000004,-0.016474763,-0.039696711,0.036067762999999996,-0.034662712000000005,-0.116648536,0.00250996,0.030461317,-0.053527872000000004,-0.134981687,-0.060302262,0.044858718,-0.034176701000000004,-0.052066995,-0.068836091,0.05083491,-0.033978969,-0.011379857,-0.005516234,-0.005812023,0.015657758,0.00158479,0.024432166,-0.04240231,-0.056428904,0.011395831,0.021891651,0.072161431,-0.0018273520000000002
49,Molecular biology of transmissible gastroenteritis virus,"Abstract The causative agent (TGEV) of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis belongs to the Coronaviridae, a family of enveloped viruses with a positive, single-stranded RNA genome. Important progress has recently been made concerning the molecular biology of TGEV. The research work of our group has been focused on two main aspects: genome structure and functional domains of the envelope proteins. TGEV genomic RNA is organised into seven regions. The sequence of six of them, i.e. the 3′ most 8300 nucleotides, has been established from cDNA clones. Three genes encoding the structural proteins, the peplomer protein E2, the transmembrane protein E1 and the nucleoprotein, have been identified. Additional open reading frames allowed for the prediction of four non-structural polypeptides, the role of which remains to be discovered. The remaining part of the genome (estimated length 20 kb) is thought to encode the polymerase. Expression of TGEV genes involves the production of six subgenomic mRNAs, which together with the virion RNA, form a 3′ terminal nested set. The peplomer glycoprotein E2 (220 kDa) is 1431 residues long and highly glycosylated. Several domains were identified, including a C-terminal anchoring region and at least four major antigenic sites, which cluster in the amino half part of the molecule. Two sites containing most of the critical neutralisation determinants are highly conserved among TGEV strains. The glycoprotein E1 (29kDa) is mostly embedded in the membrane and plays a crucial role in the virion architecture. However, a short N-terminal domain protruding out of the particle mediates complement-dependent neutralisation, and induces alpha interferon synthesis, likely through a direct interaction with the lymphocyte membrane.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.21426437199999998,-0.048461729,-0.034685764,0.004990955,0.07407449,-0.059179694000000005,-0.091817426,0.006753554,0.004337901,-0.037289476,-0.075481305,0.010909096,0.01012635,-0.078477141,-0.012453905,-0.121472643,0.077491209,-0.012150847,0.0018469110000000001,0.057965055999999994,-0.031620067,0.006767686,-0.031640565,-0.024639552000000002,0.037471924,0.014644081000000001,0.018034353,-0.032913944,0.002688051,0.019630672
53,Origin of the human L1 elements: Proposed progenitor genes deduced from a consensus DNA sequence,"Abstract A consensus sequence for the human long interspersed repeated DNA element, L1H8 (LINE or KpnI sequence), is presented. The sequence contains two open reading frames (ORFs) which are homologous to ORFs in corresponding regions of L1 elements in other species. The L1H8 ORFs are separated by a small evolutionarily nonconserved region. The 5′ end of the consensus contains frequent terminators in all three reading frames and has a relatively high GC content with numerous stretches of weak homology with AluI repeats. The 5′ ORF extends for a minimum of 723 bp (241 codons). The 3′ ORF is 3843 bp (1281 codons) and predicts a protein of 149 kD which has regions of weak homology to the polymerase domain of various reverse transcriptases. The 3′ end of the consensus has a 208-bp nonconserved region followed by an adenine-rich end. The organization of the L1H8 consensus sequence resembles the structure of eukaryotic mRNAs except for the noncoding region between ORFs. However, due to base substitutions or truncation most elements appear incapable of producing mRNA that can be translated. Our observation that individual elements cluster into subfamilies on the basis of the presence or absence of blocks of sequence, or by the linkage of alternative bases at multiple positions, suggests that most L1 sequences were derived from a small number of structural genes. An estimate of the mammalian L1 substitution rate was derived and used to predict the age of individual human elements. From this it follows that the majority of human L1 sequences have been generated within the last 30 million years. The human elements studied here differ from each other, yet overall the L1H8 sequences demonstrate a pattern of species-specificity when compared to the L1 families of other mammals. Possible mechanisms that may account for the origin and evolution of the L1 family are discussed. These include pseudogene formation (retroposition), transposition, gene conversion, and RNA recombination.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.152644908,-0.051026129,-0.011360503999999999,-0.026537276000000002,0.145167619,-0.056060194,-0.093749813,0.029998878,-0.003451257,-0.053299948,-0.09986376,-0.019396768999999998,0.068686711,-0.130335145,-0.041750575,-0.062386755,0.013234976,0.026083474,-0.023424305,-0.026005784,0.018773493999999998,-0.014290965,-0.063694432,0.054108595,-0.097147679,-0.055614073,0.018186558999999998,0.00637951,0.052251044,-0.032996285
57,CHAPTER 28 Coronaviridae,"Publisher Summary Coronaviruses are ssRNA viruses that infect a wide range of mammalian and avian species; they are important causes of respiratory and enteric disease, encephalomyelitis, hepatitis, serositis, and vasculitis in domestic animals. In humans, coronaviruses are one of several groups of viruses that cause the common cold. The prototype of the family, avian infectious brochitis virus, is one of the most infectious of all viruses and causes an acute respiratory disease, which in young chicks can cause very high mortality. Outbreaks can be explosive, involving nearly every bird in the flock at about the same time, because of respiratory transmission and a very short incubation period. In many ways, transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine and mouse hepatitis virus behave similarly, affecting young animals most severely, spreading very quickly to all animals at risk, and causing major economic losses before control strategies can be put into place. The strategy of expression of the coronavirus genome is unique. The input virion RNA molecule is translated directly, one of the products being an RNA polymerase that then transcribes a full-length (—) sense copy RNA, from which in turn is transcribed a 3′-coterminal nested set of subgenomic mRNAs. The nested set comprises six overlapping species of mRNAs that extend for different lengths from a common 3′ terminus. Only the unique sequence toward the 5′ end, which is not shared with the next smallest mRNA in the nested set, is translated, each product, therefore, being a unique protein.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.074485045,-0.034665273999999996,-0.02034601,0.053634250999999994,0.11528069699999999,-0.009016059,0.004482651,0.007860217,-0.0016775420000000002,0.046220089000000006,-0.011394996999999999,-0.062416131,0.056671241,-0.009965462,0.046684805999999995,-0.011274663999999998,-0.00858716,-0.0043194159999999995,0.019097204,0.047493648,0.0038119779999999997,-0.02047047,-0.076780679,0.023538575,-0.0037688229999999997,-0.044393447999999995,-0.026076727,-0.016123846,0.011153264,-0.053576556
59,Leader Sequence,"Abstract The region of a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule that precedes the coding sequence of a gene is called the ‘leader sequence’. This region is also known as the ‘five prime untranslated region’ (Figure 1) of the mRNA. Leader sequences have the propensity for forming secondary structures (stem-loops) by base pairing of complementary sequences. They are involved in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In eukaryotes, the leader sequence may vary from few nucleotides to more than 1000 nucleotides. In prokaryotes, the leader sequences are usually short and at times contain an attenuator segment that is translated to a short-leader peptide. The leader peptide functions to terminate transcripts before the RNA polymerase reaches the first structural gene of the operon. The leader sequences in viruses have been shown to play an important role in the regulation of gene expression, replication, and pathogenicity. Mutations in the leader sequences of cellular mRNAs can have implications for disease and tumorigenesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.18166966199999998,-0.060715497,-0.011998364,-0.038386983,0.083247381,-0.06419251599999999,-0.143731048,0.026437757000000003,0.007495885,-0.073413357,-0.07653494200000001,-0.070525676,0.052228277000000004,-0.048627518,0.021463487000000003,0.040220038,-0.068356503,0.023762198,-0.040919973,-0.04256255900000001,0.052513610999999995,-0.009140525,-0.013202887,0.059506101,-0.019577632,-0.081321804,-0.001901965,0.009440663,0.14358459,-0.009382799999999998
63,Chapter 2 Recent Advances in Hantavirus Molecular Biology and Disease,"Abstract Hantaviruses are emerging zoonotic pathogens that belong to the Bunyaviridae family. They have been classified as category A pathogens by CDC (centers for disease control and prevention). Hantaviruses pose a serious threat to human health because their infection causes two highly fatal diseases, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). These pathogens are transmitted to humans through aerosolized excreta of their infected rodent hosts. Hantaviruses have a tripartite-segmented negative-sense RNA genome. The three genomic RNA segments, S, M, and L, encode a nucleocapsid protein (N), a precursor glycoprotein that is processed into two envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively. N protein is the major structural component of the virus, its main function is to protect and encapsidate the three genomic RNAs forming three viral ribonucleocapsids. Recent studies have proposed that N in conjunction with RdRp plays important roles in the transcription and replication of viral genome. In addition, N preferentially facilitates the translation of viral mRNA in cells. Glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, play major roles in viral attachment and entry to the host cells, virulence, and assembly and packaging of new virions in infected cells. RdRp functions as RNA replicase and transcriptase to replicate and transcribe the viral RNA and is also thought to have endonuclease activity. Currently, no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available for the treatment of hantavirus-associated diseases. Understanding the molecular details of hantavirus life cycle will help in the identification of targets for antiviral therapeutics and in the design of potential antiviral drug for the treatment of HFRS and HCPS. Due to the alarming fatality of hantavirus diseases, development of an effective vaccine against hantaviruses is a necessity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.19220294300000001,-0.038496597,-0.09803005,0.114789124,-0.09169867400000001,0.004781039,0.08343558,0.026932674,0.007761743000000001,0.108573566,0.047309738,-0.007430966,0.022470072999999997,0.030260624,0.007023296,-0.049258914,-0.018422114,0.033309956,-0.013933683999999998,0.062649365,-0.016061608,0.059084618,-0.039255946,-0.023507629,0.033489868,0.00028277099999999997,0.071330028,-0.037616038,0.050832845999999994,0.078234441
67,Chapter 42 Group IV Viruses Single-Stranded (+)Sense RNA,"The Group IV viruses have a positive sense genome. Positive sense RNA can be translated directly into protein, without a DNA intermediate and without creating a complementary RNA strand. To replicate its genome, though, a complementary DNA strand is required. The positive RNA strand serves as a template for an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, yielding a complementary RNA strand, to form a dimer with the template strand. The double-stranded RNA subsequently serves as the template for a new positive sense genome. The positive strand RNA genome is independently infectious, for most Group IV viruses. This means that in the absence of a capsid, envelope, or enclosed proteins, the RNA molecule, when inserted into a cell, is capable of using host cell machinery to construct additional viruses. There are six subclasses of the Group IV single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses: Picornaviridae, Togaviridae, Coronaviridae, Hepeviridae, Caliciviridae, Flaviviridae, and Astroviridae. As expected, within each class, viruses share structural similarities; but there are no properties, other than the defining property of a (+)-sense single stranded RNA genome, that extends to all six classes of the Group IV viruses. For example, some classes have envelopes (i.e., Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Coronaviridae), and others do not (i.e., Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Hepeviridae, and Astroviridae).

69,Chapter 3 Features of Host Cells Cellular and Molecular Biology Review,"Abstract As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses are completely dependent upon a host cell for their replication. They use energy generated by the host cell, and they exploit the host's machinery to manufacture viral proteins. Many of the cell's organelles, as well as the plasma membrane, are involved in viral replication processes. The organelles involved in protein synthesis, processing, and transport—namely the ribosome, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi complex—are utilized in the manufacture of viral proteins, as well, and viruses use ATP generated by the host cell's mitochondria. The plasma membrane, made of a phospholipid bilayer, is the cell's primary zone of contact with the extracellular world. As such, it is the first obstacle that a virus must overcome for entry into a cell. The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology states that DNA is replicated to create more DNA, DNA is transcribed into mRNA, and mRNA is translated by ribosomes to create proteins. All viruses are dependent upon the host's translation machinery, and many viruses will use other portions of the cell's replication and transcription mechanisms. DNA polymerase is the major enzyme involved in DNA replication, while RNA polymerase creates messenger RNA. Host ribosomes translate the messenger RNA into proteins, composed of amino acids. Viruses also have many unique strategies to ensure the translation of their proteins over host proteins.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.199852223,-0.085242845,-0.05716723,0.069709662,-0.10813436900000001,0.028250042000000003,0.078971309,-0.015548581,0.02819377,0.040726521,-0.058200905,-0.098286304,0.049269331,0.101184391,-0.014953321,-0.010402606,0.025523791,-0.10451865800000001,-0.0035877290000000004,0.092797744,-0.062933016,0.093099615,-0.072639288,-0.026314702000000002,-0.008729928,-0.048154909,-0.02557298,-0.009339088,-0.09699386199999999,-0.003489393
73,Chapter 17 Family Coronaviridae,"Abstract Members of the family Coronaviridae are large, enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses. They are the largest known RNA viruses, with genomes ranging from 25 to 32kb and virions of 118–140nm in diameter. The family is divided into two subfamilies, the Coronavirinae and the Torovirinae. They can be distinguished on the basis of their nucleocapsids as the toroviruses have unique doughnut-shaped nucleocapsids. Virions are roughly spherical and are notable for the large spike (S) glycoprotein that extends from the virus envelope. Current taxonomy places the family in the order Nidovirales. Within the subfamily Coronavirinae are four genera, the alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and deltacoronaviruses. All family members share the same unique strategy for mRNA synthesis whereby the polymerase complex jumps or moves from one region of the template to a more distant region. The need for the polymerase complex to dissociate from the template may explain the high rate of RNA recombination that occurs during genome replication. Both the coronaviruses and toroviruses are enteric and respiratory tract pathogens, usually associated with only mild disease (or inapparent infection). However the human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus cause severe respiratory diseases.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.059574151,0.057710562,-0.11984032,0.088930286,0.066198285,-0.069447798,0.013766438999999998,0.048690845999999996,0.035687475,0.043494791,0.026345642000000002,-0.013428326,0.054208657,-0.023643208,0.026505222999999998,-0.021957531000000002,0.005027535,-0.039791013,-0.001623661,0.045731767,0.015717544,-0.016121955,-0.070843839,0.015178033,-0.014964483999999998,-0.056369293,-0.058225397000000005,0.001799599,0.002897827,-0.082272535
74,Chapter 2 Genetic Instability of RNA Viruses,"Abstract Despite having very limited coding capacity, RNA viruses are able to withstand challenge of antiviral drugs, cause epidemics in previously exposed human populations, and, in some cases, infect multiple host species. They are able to achieve this by virtue of their ability to multiply very rapidly, coupled with their extraordinary degree of genetic heterogeneity. RNA viruses exist not as single genotypes, but as a swarm of related variants, and this genomic diversity is an essential feature of their biology. RNA viruses have a variety of mechanisms that act in combination to determine their genetic heterogeneity. These include polymerase fidelity, error-mitigation mechanisms, genomic recombination, and different modes of genome replication. RNA viruses can vary in their ability to tolerate mutations, or “genetic robustness,” and several factors contribute to this. Finally, there is evidence that some RNA viruses exist close to a threshold where polymerase error rate has evolved to maximize the possible sequence space available, while avoiding the accumulation of a lethal load of deleterious mutations. We speculate that different viruses have evolved different error rates to complement the different “life-styles” they possess.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.137786505,-0.058862115,-0.054354884000000006,0.10827742800000001,0.05413852,0.0062076069999999995,0.099114816,0.046687865,-0.060308705,0.08415710400000001,0.064780832,0.008888608000000001,0.011095713,-0.008745805,0.04204414099999999,0.020171631000000002,-0.082842987,-0.010849595,-0.042364745999999995,0.014816671000000002,0.048384374,-0.002527174,-0.046214282999999995,0.110340768,-0.125203881,-0.030946799,0.070302617,-0.035959632000000005,-0.055907121,-0.06702739099999999
91,Effective Amplification of 20-kb DNA by Reverse Transcription PCR,"Abstract Polymerase chain reaction has been applied to the amplification of long DNA fragments from a variety of sources, including genomic, mitochondrial, and viral DNAs. However, polymerase chain reaction amplification from cDNA templates produced by reverse transcription has generally been restricted to products of less than 10 kilobases. In this paper, we report a system to effectively amplify fragments up to 20 kilobases from human coronavirus 229E genomic RNA. We demonstrate that the integrity of the RNA template and the prevention of false priming events during reverse transcription are the critical parameters to achieve the synthesis of long cDNAs. The optimization of the polymerase chain reaction conditions enabled us to improve the specificity and yield of product but they were not definitive. Finally, we have shown that the same reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technology can be used for the amplification of extended regions of the dystrophin mRNA, a cellular RNA of relatively low abundance.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.105461796,0.009652904,0.068071729,0.054794745,-0.025132326,-0.07083009,-0.019512987,0.020338734,-0.010394305,-0.010907697,-0.016726762,-0.009709552,0.072268063,-0.016573318,-0.006523920999999999,0.061123091,-0.045055465999999995,0.0064954669999999996,-0.043335938,0.006743128,-0.07863738599999999,-0.010793856000000001,-0.002842569,-0.022615382000000003,-0.022002182000000002,-0.08419138,-0.065771143,0.05799582599999999,-0.02717966,0.068021709
95,Regulation of hepatitis C virus replication by the core protein through its interaction with viral RNA polymerase,"Abstract The hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein is a structural component of the nucleocapsid and has been shown to modulate cellular signaling pathways by interaction with various cellular proteins. In the present study, we investigated the role of HCV core protein in viral RNA replication. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the core protein binds to the amino-terminal region of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which encompasses the finger and palm domains. Direct interaction between HCV RdRp and core protein led to inhibition of RdRp RNA synthesis activity of in vitro. Furthermore, over-expression of core protein, but not its derivatives lacking the RdRp-interacting domain, suppressed HCV replication in a hepatoma cell line harboring an HCV subgenomic replicon RNA. Collectively, our results suggest that the core protein, through binding to RdRp and inhibiting its RNA synthesis activity, is a viral regulator of HCV RNA replication.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.286157779,-0.075045221,-0.11973409,0.10282198,-0.11755758699999999,-0.07367114599999999,0.043093299,0.001051492,0.0060121969999999995,0.017304146,0.041832494,0.134023577,-0.044231173,0.06098436,-0.093964528,-0.09308034400000001,0.12674775300000002,0.13355019199999998,0.250371827,-0.11006075800000001,-0.05807622900000001,0.011645915,0.126212274,-0.041616808,0.003860067,0.018705861,-0.042128504000000004,0.055827762,-0.054168799000000004,0.022011502000000002
123,Comparative analysis of selected genes from Diachasmimorpha longicaudata entomopoxvirus and other poxviruses,"Abstract The Diachasmimorpha longicaudata entomopoxvirus (DlEPV) is the first symbiotic EPV described from a parasitic wasp. The DlEPV is introduced into the tephritid fruit fly larval host along with the wasp egg at oviposition. We sequenced a shotgun genomic library of the DlEPV DNA and analyzed and compared the predicted protein sequences of eight ORFs with those of selected poxviruses and other organisms. BlastP searches showed that five of these are homologous to poxvirus putative proteins such as metalloprotease, a putative membrane protein, late transcription factor-3, virion surface protein, and poly (A) polymerase (PAP) regulatory small subunit. Three of these are similar to those of other organisms such as the gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) of Arabidopsis thaliana, eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) of Caenorhabditis briggsae and lambda phage integrase ( λ -Int) of Enterococcus faecium. Transcription motifs for early (TGA,A/T,XXXXA) or late (TAAATG, TAAT, or TAAAT) gene expression conserved in poxviruses were identified with those ORFs. Phylogenetic analysis of multiple alignments of five ORFs and 20 poxvirus homologous sequences and of a concatenate of multiple alignments suggested that DlEPV probably diverged from the ancestral node between the fowlpox virus and the genus B, lepidopteran and orthopteran EPVs, to which Amsacta moorei and Melanoplus sanguinipes EPV, respectively, belong. The DlEPV putative GGT, eIF4A, and λ -Int contained many conserved domains that typified these proteins. These homologues may be involved in either viral pathogenicity or enhancing parasitism via the gamma-glutamyl cycle and compensation of eIF4A levels in the parasitized fly, or via the integration of a portion of the viral genome into the wasp and/or parasitized fly.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14192965300000002,-0.051126615,-0.013143847,-0.058954335,0.032277434,-0.001305608,-0.028335371,-0.017581028000000002,0.019563371,-0.02784572,-0.115714598,-0.032469724,0.029544317,-0.0397571,-0.068111673,-0.074755767,0.075111969,-0.044412453,-0.015648619,0.025142484,-0.029477833999999998,0.031562812999999995,-0.057566055,-0.016801353999999998,-0.005780456999999999,0.0018410879999999998,0.021118729,-0.018981701,-0.0073285040000000004,0.021356191
125,The Palm Subdomain-based Active Site is Internally Permuted in Viral RNA-dependent RNA Polymerases of an Ancient Lineage,"Abstract Template-dependent polynucleotide synthesis is catalyzed by enzymes whose core component includes a ubiquitous αβ palm subdomain comprising A, B and C sequence motifs crucial for catalysis. Due to its unique, universal conservation in all RNA viruses, the palm subdomain of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) is widely used for evolutionary and taxonomic inferences. We report here the results of elaborated computer-assisted analysis of newly sequenced replicases from Thosea asigna virus (TaV) and the closely related Euprosterna elaeasa virus (EeV), insect-specific ssRNA+ viruses, which revise a capsid-based classification of these viruses with tetraviruses, an Alphavirus-like family. The replicases of TaV and EeV do not have characteristic methyltransferase and helicase domains, and include a putative RdRp with a unique C–A–B motif arrangement in the palm subdomain that is also found in two dsRNA birnaviruses. This circular motif rearrangement is a result of migration of ∼22 amino acid (aa) residues encompassing motif C between two internal positions, separated by ∼110aa, in a conserved region of ∼550aa. Protein modeling shows that the canonical palm subdomain architecture of poliovirus (ssRNA+) RdRp could accommodate the identified sequence permutation through changes in backbone connectivity of the major structural elements in three loop regions underlying the active site. This permutation transforms the ferredoxin-like β1αAβ2β3αBβ4 fold of the palm subdomain into the β2β3β1αAαBβ4 structure and brings β-strands carrying two principal catalytic Asp residues into sequential proximity such that unique structural properties and, ultimately, unique functionality of the permuted RdRps may result. The permuted enzymes show unprecedented interclass sequence conservation between RdRps of true ssRNA+ and dsRNA viruses and form a minor, deeply separated cluster in the RdRp tree, implying that other, as yet unidentified, viruses may employ this type of RdRp. The structural diversification of the palm subdomain might be a major event in the evolution of template-dependent polynucleotide polymerases in the RNA–protein world.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.171753956,-0.041595641,-0.058222138,0.07752893,0.034079345,-0.036442272000000005,0.031731672999999995,0.024987092000000002,-0.060329710999999994,0.024365616,0.042369171,0.11355834199999999,-0.051819427,-0.11018741900000001,-0.055639065999999994,-0.064903253,0.067611406,-0.040504387999999995,-0.042112832999999995,-0.045293658,0.045065712,-0.040266107,0.003975259,-0.012819351000000001,-0.014312317,0.032326229,-0.007554992,0.025631779,0.024048915,-0.017491067
151,Identification of a Noncanonical Signal for Transcription of a Novel Subgenomic mRNA of Mouse Hepatitis Virus: Implication for the Mechanism of Coronavirus RNA Transcription,"Abstract Subgenomic RNA transcription of coronaviruses involves the interaction between the leader (or antileader) and the intergenic (IG) sequences. However, it is not clear how these two sequences interact with each other. In this report, a previously unrecognized minor species of subgenomic mRNA, termed mRNA5–1, was identified in cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains JHM2c, JHM(2), JHM(3), A59, and MHV-1. Sequence analysis revealed that the leader-body fusion site of the mRNA is located at approximately 150 nucleotides (nt) downstream of the consensus IG sequence for mRNA 5 and did not have sequence homology with any known IG consensus sequences. To determine whether this sequence functions independently as a promoter, we cloned a 140-nt sequence (from ≈70 nt upstream to ≈70 nt downstream of the fusion site) from viral genomic RNA and placed it in front of a reporter gene in the defective-interfering (DI) RNA-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter vector. Transfection of the reporter RNA into MHV-infected cells resulted in synthesis of a CAT-specific subgenomic mRNA detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The strength of this promoter was similar to that of the IG7 (for mRNA 7) as measured by the CAT activity. Deletion analysis showed that the sequence as few as 13 nt was sufficient to initiate mRNA transcription, while mutations within the 13-nt abolished mRNA transcription. In vitro translation study confirmed that the envelope (E) protein was translated from mRNA5–1, which encodes the open reading frame (ORF) 5b at its 5′-end, indicating that mRNA5–1 is a functional message. Furthermore, when the ORF5b was replaced with the CAT gene and placed in the DI in the context of viral mini-genome, CAT was expressed not only from the first ORF of mRNA5–1 but also from the second and third ORF of mRNA5 and genomic DI RNA, respectively, suggesting that more than one mechanism is involved in regulation of ORF5b expression. Our findings thus support the notion that base-pairing between the leader (or antileader) and the IG is not the sole mechanism in subgenomic RNA transcription.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.253462392,-0.077563883,-0.026100897999999997,0.00214758,0.11197581,-0.157398018,-0.24742950100000002,0.047086416,-0.009323851,-0.140683004,-0.06589091,-0.153149652,0.087578085,0.001181891,0.057927945,0.061919080999999994,-0.09513757,0.074820771,-0.013726226999999999,-0.028422118,0.042458217,-0.0074625,0.022164253999999998,0.055921039000000006,0.036851262999999995,-0.02769531,0.007303586999999999,-0.005715652,0.14669180099999998,0.0017988289999999998
152,Emergence of a coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus mutant with a truncated 3b gene: functional characterization of the 3b protein in pathogenesis and replication,"Abstract The subgenomic RNA 3 of IBV has been shown to be a tricistronic mRNA, encoding three products in IBV-infected cells. To explore if the least expressed ORF, ORF 3b, which encodes a nonstructural protein, is evolutionarily conserved and functionally indispensable for viral propagation in cultured cells, the Beaudette strain of IBV was propagated in chicken embryonated eggs for three passages and then adapted to a monkey kidney cell line, Vero. The 3b gene of passage 3 in embryonated eggs and passages 7, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 50, and 65 in Vero cells were amplified by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The results showed that viral RNA extracted from passages 35, 50, and 65 contained a single A insertion in a 6A stretch of the 3b gene between nucleotides 24075 and 24080, whereas the early passages carried the normal 3b gene. This insertion resulted in a frameshift event and therefore, if expressed, a C-terminally truncated protein. We showed that the frameshifting product, cloned in a plasmid, was expressed in vitro and in cells transfected with the mutant construct. The normal product of the 3b gene is 64 amino acids long, whereas the frameshifting product is 34 amino acids long with only 17 homogeneous amino acid residues at the N-terminal half. Immunofluorescent studies revealed that the normal 3b protein was localized to the nucleus and the truncated product showed a “free” distribution pattern, indicating that the C-terminal portion of 3b was responsible for its nuclear localization. Comparison of the complete genome sequences (27.6 kb) of isolates p20c22 and p36c12 (from passages 20 and 36, respectively) revealed that p36c12 contains three amino acid substitutions, two in the 195-kDa protein (encoded by gene 1) and one in the S protein, in addition to the frameshifting 3b product. Further characterization of the two isolates demonstrated that p36c12 showed growth advantage over p20c22 in both Vero cells and chicken embryos and was more virulent in chicken embryos than p20c22. These results suggest that the 3b gene product is not essential for the replication of IBV.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.161020464,-0.052289755,0.017147026,-0.096201837,0.083042157,0.005948359,-0.16912175100000001,-0.065978443,0.08341426,0.070828132,-0.067399362,-0.025029863,-0.021713549,0.00014346,-0.094863677,-0.015564817,0.055735952000000005,-0.013076059,0.033987373,0.024249113,-0.023276446,-0.010036866,0.02762268,-0.014194697,-0.009872894,0.07224777,0.010470943,0.005876061,-0.036516907,0.007939154
156,Comparison of four regions in the replicase gene of heterologous infectious bronchitis virus strains,"Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) produces six subgenomic (sg) mRNAs, each containing a 64 nucleotide (nt) leader sequence, derived from the 5′ end of the genome by a discontinuous process. Several putative functional domains such as a papain-like proteinase (PLpro), main protease (Mpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and RNA helicase encoded by the replicase gene are important for virus replication. We have sequenced four regions of the replicase genes corresponding to the 5′-terminal sequence, PLpro, Mpro, and RdRp domains from 20 heterologous IBV strains, and compared them with previously published coronavirus sequences. All the coronavirus 5′-termini and PLpro domains were divergent, unlike the Mpro and the RdRp domains that were highly conserved with 28% and 48% conserved residues, respectively. Among IBV strains, the 5′ untranslated region including the leader sequence was highly conserved (>94% identical); whereas, the N-terminal coding region and the PLpro domains were highly variable ranging from 84.6% to 100%, and 77.6% to 100% identity, respectively. The IBV Mpro and RdRp domains were highly conserved with 82.7% and 92.7% conserved residues, respectively. The BJ strain was the most different from other IBVs in all four regions of the replicase. Phylogeny-based clustering based on replicase genes was identical to the antigen-based classification of coronaviruses into three groups. However, the IBV strain classification based on replicase gene domains did not correlate with that of the type-specific antigenic groups. The replicase gene sequences of many IBVs recovered from infected chickens were identical to those of vaccine viruses irrespective of serotype, suggesting that either there has been an exchange of genetic material among vaccine and field isolates or that there is a convergent evolution to a specific replicase genotype. There was no correlation between the genotype of any region of the replicase gene and pathotype, suggesting that the replicase is not the sole determinant of IBV pathogenicity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.205457525,-0.034718739,0.009179226,-0.01371205,0.201307426,-0.009051373,-0.16461226,-0.047134442,0.041427995,0.186349099,0.042358953,0.098599293,-0.056292405999999996,-0.074897177,-0.155067073,0.011446857,0.063026951,-0.015026302,0.016463149,0.013033349,-0.008045931999999999,-0.026739278,0.023956709,-0.049913510999999994,0.036605427999999995,0.031608147,0.002707997,0.022719016,0.039219077000000005,0.01828258
162,Genetic diversity in the yellow head nidovirus complex,"Abstract Penaeus monodon shrimp collected from across the Indo-Pacific region during 1997–2004 were screened for the presence of yellow head-related viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of amplified ORF1b gene segments identified at least six distinct genetic lineages (genotypes). Genotype 1 (YHV) was detected only in shrimp with yellow head disease. Genotype 2 (GAV) was detected in diseased shrimp with the less severe condition described as mid-crop mortality syndrome and in healthy shrimp from Australia, Thailand and Vietnam. Other genotypes occurred commonly in healthy shrimp. Sequence comparisons of structural protein genes (ORF2 and ORF3), intergenic regions (IGRs) and the long 3′-UTR supported the delineation of genotypes and identified both conserved and variant structural features. In putative transcription regulating sequences (TRSs) encompassing the sub-genomic mRNA 5′-termini, a core motif (5′-GUCAAUUACAAC-3′) is absolutely conserved. A small (83 nt) open reading frame (ORF4) in the 3′-UTR of GAV is variously truncated in all other genotypes and a TRS-like element preceding ORF4 is invariably corrupted by a A > G/U substitution in the central core motif (5′-UU(G/U)CAAC-3′). The data support previous evidence that ORF4 is a non-functional gene under construction or deconstruction. The 3′-UTRs also contain predicted 3′-terminal hairpin-loop structures that are preserved in all genotypes by compensatory nucleotide substitutions, suggesting a role in polymerase recognition for minus-strand RNA synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.11611635199999999,-0.037362619,-0.019716378,-0.055958949,0.09324873199999999,-0.023156055,-0.048358782,0.001314673,-0.010563973,-0.039486542,-0.046728569000000005,0.039936321000000004,0.000862673,-0.067423118,-0.048645497999999995,-0.040794537,0.016336795,4.74e-05,-0.023525825,-0.042437024000000004,0.014200998999999999,-0.009064937,-0.037772551,0.050759966,-0.051421654000000004,-0.064050743,-0.020125848999999998,0.007856938,0.065707047,-0.016400585
164,Molecular characterization of genome segment 2 encoding RNA dependent RNA polymerase of Antheraea mylitta cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus,"Abstract Genome segment 2 (S2) from Antheraea mylitta cypovirus (AmCPV) was converted into cDNA, cloned and sequenced. S2 consisted of 3798 nucleotides with a long ORF encoding a 1116 amino acid long protein (123kDa). BLAST and phylogenetic analysis showed 29% sequence identity and close relatedness of AmCPV S2 with RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of other insect cypoviruses, suggesting a common origin of all insect cypoviruses. The ORF of S2 was expressed as 123kDa soluble His-tagged fusion protein in insect cells via baculovirus recombinants which exhibited RdRp activity in an in vitro RNA polymerase assay without any intrinsic terminal transferase activity. Maximum activity was observed at 37°C at pH 6.0 in the presence of 3mM MgCl2. Site directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of the conserved GDD motif. This is the first report of functional characterization of a cypoviral RdRp which may lead to the development of anti-viral agents.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.198626637,-0.042152389000000005,-0.050346895999999995,0.035385831,0.016981664,-0.043162161,-0.025144896,0.015872551000000002,-0.021306751000000002,-0.022076772999999997,0.000788921,0.083784083,-0.038450815,-0.076596443,-0.056061112999999996,-0.083582709,0.072388432,0.0024633429999999998,0.016906371,-0.027407723999999998,0.041446655,-0.036811065,0.041101736,-0.032031651,0.006488644,0.089487316,0.034991726,0.002022732,-0.007506616,0.066485984
165,Identification of aromatic amino acid residues in conserved region VI of the large polymerase of vesicular stomatitis virus is essential for both guanine-N-7 and ribose 2'-O methyltransferases,"Abstract Non-segmented negative-sense RNA viruses possess a unique mechanism for mRNA cap methylation. For vesicular stomatitis virus, conserved region VI in the large (L) polymerase protein catalyzes both guanine-N-7 (G-N-7) and ribose 2'-O (2'-O) methyltransferases, and the two methylases share a binding site for the methyl donor S-adenosyl-l-methionine. Unlike conventional mRNA cap methylation, the 2'-O methylation of VSV precedes subsequent G-N-7 methylation. In this study, we found that individual alanine substitutions in two conserved aromatic residues (Y1650 and F1691) in region VI of L protein abolished both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylation. However, replacement of one aromatic residue with another aromatic residue did not significantly affect the methyltransferase activities. Our studies provide genetic and biochemical evidence that conserved aromatic residues in region VI of L protein essential for both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylations. In combination with the structural prediction, our results suggest that these aromatic residues may participate in RNA recognition.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.11117743699999999,-0.048871604000000006,-0.030304422999999997,-0.026167903,-0.019657123999999998,-0.016778999,-0.010649519,0.014547208,-0.032383805,-0.00979701,-0.027032611,0.031628712999999996,-0.007362505,-0.044204623,-0.056120422999999996,-0.042348906,0.043443657000000004,-0.032182622,-0.051693489,0.016529272,0.009870511,0.023291617,0.055340234,0.018564798,0.055474739,-0.010754168,-0.029222562,0.014959756000000001,0.09857443800000001,0.001119063
167,The interaction of nonstructural protein 9 with retinoblastoma protein benefits the replication of genotype 2 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in vitro,"Abstract The nonstructural protein 9 (Nsp9) of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that plays a vital role in viral replication. This study first demonstrated that the Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV interacted with cellular retinoblastoma protein (pRb), and Nsp9 co-localized with pRb in the cytoplasm of PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells and pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Next, the overexpression of truncated pRb was shown to inhibit the PRRSV replication and silencing the pRb gene could facilitate the PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells. Finally, the pRb level was confirmed to be down-regulated in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells, and Nsp9 was shown to promote the pRb degradation by proteasome pathway. These findings indicate that the interaction of Nsp 9 with pRb benefits the replication of genotype 2 PRRSV in vitro, helping to understand the roles of Nsp9 in the replication and pathogenesis of PRRSV.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14515262,-0.051991403,-0.046358641,-0.019772243999999998,-0.078959595,-0.0040972890000000005,0.008976141,-0.034504236,0.051171895,-0.006131416,-0.006932382,-0.008706307,-0.037020331000000004,0.105805729,0.057473804,-0.065176191,0.057337161,-0.07905274,-0.0014191920000000001,0.08723249400000001,-0.052669562999999996,0.026738689,0.04361117900000001,-0.11775016,0.040944728,0.084035426,0.006008763,-0.033612817999999996,-0.11857156099999999,0.084774251

Using pathway specific PCR array, we identified 9 apoptosis-related genes that are dysregulated during HCV infection, of which the BH3-only pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, BIK, was consistently up-regulated at the mRNA and protein levels. Depletion of BIK protected host cells from HCV-induced caspase-3/7 activation but not the inhibitory effect of HCV on cell viability. Furthermore, viral RNA replication and release were significantly suppressed in BIK-depleted cells and over-expression of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, NS5B, was able to induce BIK expression. Immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation assays showed co-localization and interaction of BIK and NS5B, suggesting that BIK may be interacting with the HCV replication complex through NS5B.

170,Arterivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase: Vital enzymatic activity remains elusive,"Abstract All RNA viruses encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which in arteriviruses is expressed as the C-terminal domain of nonstructural protein 9 (nsp9). Previously, potent primer-dependent RdRp activity has been demonstrated for the homologous polymerase subunit (nsp12) of the distantly related coronaviruses. The only previous study focusing on the in vitro activity of nsp9 of an arterivirus (equine arteritis virus; EAV) reported weak de novo polymerase activity on homopolymeric RNA templates. However, this activity was not retained when Mn2+ ions were omitted from the assay or when biologically relevant templates were supplied, which prompted us to revisit the biochemical properties of this polymerase. Based on the properties of active-site mutants, we conclude that the RNA-synthesizing activities observed in de novo and primer-dependent polymerase and terminal transferase assays cannot be attributed to recombinant EAV nsp9-RdRp. Our results illustrate the potential pitfalls of characterizing polymerases using highly sensitive biochemical assays.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.21600649100000002,-0.01752281,-0.063468429,0.145941014,-0.034786173999999996,-0.069619906,0.048925527,0.013426773999999999,-0.048866108,0.00364918,0.085779984,0.131749278,-0.083615782,-0.020907811999999998,-0.060222650999999995,-0.06026605,0.10026197099999999,-0.052306711,0.025971638999999998,-0.061308064,0.020999011,-0.042907552,0.09206678900000001,-0.080120779,0.035970761000000004,0.081922874,-0.020315984,0.029735231,0.006681814,0.03873592
172,Coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus non-structural proteins 8 and 12 form stable complex independent of the non-translated regions of viral RNA and other viral proteins,"Abstract The cleavage products from coronavirus polyproteins, known as the non-structural proteins (nsps), are believed to make up the major components of the viral replication/transcription complex. In this study, several nsps encoded by avian gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were screened for RNA-binding activity and interaction with its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, nsp12. Nsp2, nsp5, nsp8, nsp9 and nsp10 were found to bind to untranslated regions (UTRs), while nsp8 was confirmed to interact with nsp12. Nsp8 has been reported to interact with nsp7 and functions as a primase synthesizing RNA primers for nsp12. Further characterization revealed that nsp8-nsp12 interaction is independent of the UTRs of viral RNA, and nsp8 interacts with both the N- and C-terminal regions of nsp12. These results have prompted a proposal of how the nsp7-nsp8 complex could possibly function in tandem with nsp12, forming a highly efficient complex that could synthesize both the RNA primer and viral RNA during coronavirus infection.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.178964729,-0.008105395,-0.075880593,0.08931559900000001,-0.009615138,-0.057274287,-0.015964057,-0.002506965,-0.012065065,0.062881562,0.101747231,0.057185577,-0.038338086,0.014504682,-0.047319044000000005,0.02800555,0.069756885,-0.057990347000000005,-0.008787813,0.02617448,-0.064069633,0.020967521,0.001179647,-0.09992837199999999,0.040227346000000004,0.010776501,-0.068159456,0.027956685,-0.004420053,0.033988799
173,Synthesis of the Putative Red Clover Necrotic Mosaic Virus RNA Polymerase by Ribosomal Frameshifting in Vitro,"Abstract The red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) genome is split between two single-stranded RNA species termed RNA-1 and RNA-2. RNA-1 directs the synthesis of 88-kDa (p88), 57-kDa (p57), 37-kDa (p37), and 27-kDa (p27) polypeptides and RNA-2 a 35-kDa (p35) polypeptide in vitro. The coding order of the RNA-1 products was determined to be 5′-p27-p57-p37-3′. Antibodies to synthetic peptides representing the carboxyl terminal portions of p27 and p57 immunoprecipitated their respective polypeptides in addition to p88, suggesting that p88 is a fusion protein. A frameshift heptanucleotide sequence element has been identified in RCNMV RNA-1. In addition, a stable stem-loop secondary structure adjacent to the heptanucleotide sequence is predicted. Together, these sequence elements suggest that a ribosomal frameshifting event occurs which allows translational readthrough of the p27 open reading frame into the p57 open reading frame, generating the observed p88 product. An RNA-1 expression construct fusing the p57 and the CP open reading frame was engineered to investigate the ribosomal frameshifting event. CP antibodies immunoprecipitated a fusion protein of the predicted size containing the carboxyl portion of CP. Site-directed mutagenesis of the frameshift element indicates that in vitro, p88 can also be expressed alternatively by suppression of an amber termination codon. Based on these data, we propose that the putative RCNMV RNA polymerase is an 88-kDa polypeptide expressed by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism similar to those utilized by retroviruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.22477003199999998,-0.064421375,-0.047325186,0.025200072,0.054685763,-0.11130268800000001,-0.12524870000000002,0.039347374,-0.0103813,-0.077195662,-0.080861317,-0.011091055,0.02961816,-0.10124451599999999,-0.055582892,-0.07256517400000001,0.07334037,-0.00034634300000000004,0.021281404,-0.031932572,-0.044333388,-0.034246942,-0.061019237000000004,-0.028592883,-0.065835742,-0.02949279,-0.006822764,0.001731708,0.040019583,-0.058479615
174,"Molecular Characterization of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus, a Member of the Arterivirus Group","Abstract Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)-specific cDNA clones spanning the 3′ terminal 5 kb of the genomic RNA were isolated, sequenced, and used as probes for identification of PRRSV-specific RNAs. The PRRSV genome is a positive-stranded polyadenylated RNA of about 15 kb. In infected cells, a 3′ coterminal nested set of six major subgenomic mRNAs could be demonstrated. Within the 3′ terminal 3.5 kb of the PRRSV genome, six overlapping reading frames (ORFs) were identified, each most likely expressed by one of the subgenomic mRNAs. Amino acid sequence comparisons revealed that the most 3′ terminal ORF (ORF7) encodes the PRRSV nucleocapsid protein with a calculated molecular weight of 14 kDa. It displays 44.8% amino acid identity with the capsid protein of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) and 23.6% with that of equine arteritis virus (EAV). The product of ORF6, the second 3′ terminal ORF, represents a putative membrane protein and exhibits 53.2 and 27.2% amino acid identity with the corresponding LDV and EAV polypeptides, respectively. Similar to EAV, ORFs 2 through 5 might encode glycosylated viral proteins.

176,Leader-mRNA Junction Sequences Are Unique for Each Subgenomic mRNA Species in the Bovine Coronavirus and Remain So Throughout Persistent Infection,"Abstract The common leader sequence on bovine coronavirus subgenomic mRNAs and genome was determined. To examine leader-mRNA junction sequences on subgenomic mRNAs, specific oligodeoxynucleotide sets were used in a polymerase chain reaction to amplify junction sequences from either the positive-strand mRNA (eight of nine total identified species) or the negative-strand anti-mRNA (six of the nine species), and sequenced. The mRNA species studied were those for the N, M, S, and HE structural proteins and the 9.5-, 12.7-, 4.8-, and 4.9-kDa putative nonstructural proteins. By defining the leader-mRNA junction sequence as the sequence between (i) the point of mismatch between the leader and genome and (ii) the 3′ end of the consensus heptameric intergenic sequence [(U/A)C(U/C)AAAC)], or its variant, a unique junction sequence was found for each subgenomic mRNA species studied. In one instance (mRNA for the 12.7-kDa protein) the predicted intergenic sequence UCCAAAC was not part of the junction region, and in its place was the nonconforming sequence GGTAGAC that occurs just 15 nt downstream in the genome. Leader-mRNA junction sequences found after 296 days of persistent infection were the same as those found during acute infection (<18 hr postinfection). These data indicate that, in contrast to the closely related mouse hepatitis virus, the bovine coronavirus maintains a stable leader-mRNA junction sequence for each mRNA. Interestingly, this stability may be related to the fact that a UCUAA sequence element, postulated by others to be a regulator of the leader-mRNA fusion event, occurs only once within the 3′ flanking sequence of the genomic leader donor and once at intergenic sites in the bovine coronavirus genome, whereas it occurs two to four times at these sites in the mouse hepatitis coronavirus.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.160184135,-0.048856523,-0.021975879,-0.064088111,0.106797062,-0.079506298,-0.14705299,0.02917381,-0.012355718,-0.114867636,-0.095815124,-0.086918929,0.082273601,-0.055864802000000005,0.028407962000000002,0.037573156,-0.049658985,0.028362863999999998,-0.01876483,-0.023205787000000002,0.031812988,0.00025712900000000004,-0.03329141,0.039896668999999996,0.020426043999999997,-0.084780356,-0.026929243999999998,0.013306331000000001,0.163892108,-0.001968327
177,Characterization of a Replicating and Packaged Defective RNA of Avian Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus,"Abstract The Beaudette strain of IBV was passaged 16 times in chick kidney cells. Total cellular RNA was analyzed by Northern hybridization and was probed with 32 P-labeled cDNA probes corresponding to the first 2 kb of the 5′ end of the genome, but excluding the leader, and to the last 1.8 kb of the 3′ end of the genome. A new, defective IBV RNA species (CD-91) was detected at passage 6. The defective RNA, present in total cell extract RNA and in oligo-(dT)30-selected RNA from passage 15, was amplified by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to give four fragments. The oligonucleotides used were selected such that CD-91 RNA, but not the genomic RNA, would be amplified. Cloning and sequencing of the PCR products showed that CD-91 comprises 9.1 kb and has three regions of the genome. It contains 1133 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the genome, 6322 from gene 1b corresponding to position 12,423 to 18,744 in the IBV genome, and 1626 from the 3′ end of the genome. At position 749 one nucleotide, an adenine residue, was absent from CD-91 RNA. By Northern hybridization CD-91 RNA was detected in virions in higher amounts than the subgenomic mRNAs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.172020497,-0.030287776000000002,0.02716541,0.030851835,0.123174404,-0.089062515,-0.164049776,-0.00113878,0.001844564,0.090240444,0.048210231,-0.033807777000000004,-0.017034254,0.03003197,-0.012434725,0.092852925,-0.03252436,0.032367309,0.023379645,-0.022176227000000003,-0.018292142,0.016004384,0.0184377,-0.018444452,-0.044206005,-0.028911306,0.004486953,0.016048277,0.029829453,0.030576617
178,Determinants of the p28 Cleavage Site Recognized by the First Papain-like Cysteine Proteinase of Murine Coronavirus,"Abstract The murine coronavirus polymerase gene is 22 kb in length with the potential to encode a polyprotein of approximately 750 kDa. The polyprotein has been proposed to encode three proteinase domains which are responsible for the processing of the polyprotein into mature proteins. The proteolytic activity of the first proteinase domain has been characterized and resembles the papain family of cysteine proteinases. This proteinase domain acts autoproteolytically to cleave the amino terminal portion of the polymerase polyprotein, releasing a 28-kDa protein designated p28. To identify the cleavage site of this papain-like cysteine proteinase, we isolated the peptide adjacent to p28 and determined the amino terminus sequence by Edman degradation reaction. We report that proteolysis occurs between the Gly-247 and Val-248 dipeptide bond. To determine the role of the amino acid residues surrounding the cleavage site, we introduced a total of 42 site-specific mutations at the residues spanning the P5 to P3′ positions and assessed the effects of the mutations on the processing of p28 in an in vitro transcription and translation system. The substitutions of Gly-247 at the P1 position or Arg-246 at the P2 position resulted in a dramatic decrease of proteolytic activity, and the mutations of Arg-243 at P5 position also led to considerable reduction in p28 cleavage. In contrast, the substitutions of amino acids Gly-244 (P4), Tyr-245 (P3), Val-248 (P1′), Lys-249 (P2′), and Pro-250 (P3′) had little or no effect on the amount of p26 that was released. This work has identified Gly-247-Val-248 as the cleavage site for the release of p28, the amino-terminal protein of the murine coronavirus polymerase polyprotein. Additionally, we conclude that the Gly-247 and Arg-246 are the major determinants for the cleavage site recognition by the first papain-like cysteine proteinase of murine coronavirus.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.141233622,-0.045246027,-0.026241509,-0.056677795999999996,0.009178357,-0.013297388,-0.072175648,-0.015972122,0.036896822,-0.068231113,-0.087315795,0.045439283,0.016896397,-0.108096959,-0.060360984000000006,-0.08373280400000001,0.09438677599999999,-0.00977899,0.024035833,0.008907026,-0.002427374,-0.021877839,0.0067304159999999995,-0.0341892,0.102114168,0.137246197,-0.014386121000000002,-0.018694571,-0.044638445,-0.053326132000000005
180,Evolution of Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) during Chronic Infection: Quasispecies Nature of the Persisting MHV RNA,"Abstract Coronavirus infection of mice has been used extensively as a model for the study of acute encephalitis and chronic demyelination. To examine the evolution of coronavirus RNA during chronic demyelinating infection, we isolated RNA from intracerebrally inoculated mice at 4, 6, 8, 13, 20, and 42 days postinfection and used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification methods (RT-PCR) to detect viral sequences. RNA sequences from two viral structural genes, the spike gene and the nucleocapsid gene, were detected throughout the chronic infection. In contrast, infectious virus was not detectable from brain homongenates beyond 13 days postinfection. These results indicate that coronavirus RNA persists in the brain at times when infectious virus is not detected. To determine if genetic changes were occurring during viral replication in the host, we cloned and sequenced the RT-PCR products from the spike and nucleocapsid regions and analyzed the sequences for mutations. Sequencing of the cloned products revealed that a variety of mutant forms of viral RNA persisted in the CNS, including point mutants, deletion mutants, and termination mutants. The mutations accumulated during persistent infection in both the spike and the nucleocapsid sequences, with greater than 65% of the mutations encoding amino acid changes. These results show that a diverse population or quasispecies consisting of mutant and deletion variant viral RNAs (which may not be capable of producing infectious virus particles) persists in the central nervous system of mice during chronic demyelinating infection. The implications of these results for the role of persistent viral genetic information in the pathogenesis of chronic demyelination are discussed.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.106617252,-0.007291279,0.011532733,0.0291974,0.051882505,-0.032755549,-0.046621364000000005,0.005285732,-0.00487182,0.061592947,0.041276369,-0.05886597,0.036056475,0.046943142,0.023241731,0.002535695,-0.030030274,0.006791004000000001,-0.048361145999999994,0.041657658,0.00994851,-0.012890996000000002,-0.030669517,0.06438118799999999,-0.039564047000000005,-0.012488363,0.066587363,-0.049162095999999995,-0.065233583,0.039685752000000005
182,Characterization of proteins encoded by ORFs 2 to 7 of Lelystad virus,"Abstract The genome of Lelystad virus (LV), a positive-strand RNA virus, is 15 kb in length and contains 8 open reading frames (ORFs) that encode putative viral proteins. ORFs 2 to 7 were cloned in plasmids downstream of the Sp6 RNA polymerase promoter, and the translation of transcripts generated in vitro yielded proteins that could be immunoprecipitated with porcine anti-LV serum. Synthetic polypeptides of 15 to 17 amino acids were selected from the amino acid sequences of ORFs 2 to 7 and antipeptide sera were raised in rabbits. Antisera that immunoprecipitated the in vitro translation products of ORFs 2 to 5 and 7 were obtained. Sera containing antibodies directed against peptides from ORFs 3 to 7 reacted positively with LV-infected alveolar lung macrophages in the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay. Using these antipeptide sera and porcine anti-LV serum, we identified three structural proteins and assigned their corresponding genes. Virions were found to contain a nucleocapsid protein of 15 kDa (N), an unglycosylated membrane protein of 18 kDa (M), and a glycosylated membrane protein of 25 kDa (E). The N protein is encoded by ORF7, the M protein is encoded by ORF6, and the E protein is encoded by ORF5. The E protein in virus particles contains one or two N-glycans that are resistant to endo-β-N-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase H. This finding indicates that the high-mannose glycans are processed into complex glycans in the Golgi compartment. The protein composition of the LV virions further confirms that LV is evolutionarily related to equine arteritis virus, simian hemorrhagic fever virus, and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.160834187,-0.057318627000000004,-0.028252815,-0.025916957,0.011417365,-0.033552227000000004,-0.09947373400000001,-0.017425364,0.035993841,-0.05392566,-0.10598550699999999,-0.03984116,0.023308379,-0.041777919,-0.029969874,-0.135143794,0.114662032,-0.034056513,0.031543809,0.075156818,-0.06535795700000001,0.01951245,-0.015343445,-0.050253238,0.019379447,0.09146744400000001,0.039545172,-0.056516159,-0.069332873,0.029814425
183,Molecular Characterization of Transmissible Gastroenteritis Coronavirus Defective Interfering Genomes: Packaging and Heterogeneity,"Abstract Three transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) defective RNAs were selected by serial undiluted passage of the PUR46 strain in ST cells. These RNAs of 22, 10.6, and 9.7 kb (DI-A, DI-B, and DI-C, respectively) were detected at passage 30, remained stable upon further passage in cell culture, and significantly interfered with helper mRNA synthesis. RNA analysis from purified virions showed that the three defective RNAs were efficiently packaged. Virions of different densities containing either full-length or defective RNAs were sorted in sucrose gradients, indicating that defective and full-length genomes were independently encapsidated. DI-B and DI-C RNAs were amplified by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and sequenced. DI-B and DI-C genomes are formed by three and four discontinuous regions of the wild-type genome, respectively. DI-C contains 2144 nucleotides (nt) from the 5′-end of the genome, two fragments of 4540 and 2531 nt mostly from gene 1b, and 493 nt from the 3′ end of the genome. DI-B and DI-C RNAs include sequences with the pseudoknot motif and encoding the polymerase, metal ion binding, and helicase motifs. DI-B RNA has a structure closely related to DI-C RNA with two main differences: it maintains the entire ORF 1b and shows heterogeneity in the size of the 3′ end deletion. This heterogeneity maps at the beginning of the S gene, where other natural TGEV recombination events have been observed, suggesting that either a process of template switching occurs with high frequency at this point or that the derived genomes have a selective advantage.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.187780408,-0.067349344,-0.020563158,0.011551746000000002,0.08060461099999999,-0.141548545,-0.20948769899999997,0.061964948,-0.031254801,-0.09918806,-0.020245224,-0.12315156599999999,0.047164572,-0.006997679000000001,0.21074405,0.214780583,-0.259900623,0.138169718,-0.006940903000000001,-0.020226769,0.102087259,-0.046580372,0.103375331,0.031453801,0.087959374,0.085898534,0.029521600000000002,-0.030391123,0.10504947199999999,-0.020839071
184,The Production of Recombinant Infectious DI-Particles of a Murine Coronavirus in the Absence of Helper Virus,"Abstract We have studied the production and release of infectious DI-particles in vaccinia-T7-polymerase recombinant virus-infected L cells that were transfected with five different plasmids expressing the synthetic DI RNA MIDI-HD and the four structural proteins (M, N, S, and E) of the murine coronavirus MHV-A59. The DI cDNA contains the hepatitis delta ribozyme sequences to generate in the transfected cells a defined 3′ end. In EM studies of transfected cells virus-like particles (VLP) were observed in vesicles. Release of the particles into the medium was studied by immunoprecipitations of proteins released into the culture supernatant. Particle release was independent of S or N, but required M and E. Coexpression of E and M was sufficient for particle release. Coexpression of the structural proteins and the MIDI-HD RNA resulted in the production and release of infectious DI-particles. Infectivity of the DI-particles was determined by adding helper virus MHV-A59 to the medium containing the VLPs and using this mixture to infect new L cells. Intracellular RNA of several subsequent undiluted passages was isolated to detect the MIDI-HD RNA. Passage of the MIDI-HD RNA was dependent on the expression of the structural proteins of MHV-A59 in the transfected cells. In the absence of either E or M, MIDI-HD RNA could not be passaged to fresh L cells. We have thus developed a system in which we can produce coronavirus-like particles and an assay to test their infectivity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.206505267,-0.057908918,-0.029007321000000003,0.03128196,-0.012253298999999999,-0.08304449700000001,-0.136795223,0.012828919,0.011863876,-0.055994989,-0.011258523999999999,-0.135461779,0.039411485,0.08813379800000001,0.173774578,0.156543584,-0.159410073,0.078656712,0.032203745,0.00651707,0.048637349,-0.007969031,0.11098393599999999,-0.023161202000000002,0.11218887699999999,0.166935162,0.025092786000000002,-0.008169208,-0.053912332,-0.008676489
185,Characterization of a 105-kDa Polypeptide Encoded in Gene 1 of the Human Coronavirus HCV 229E,"Abstract Gene 1 of the human coronavirus HCV 229E encompasses approximately 20.7 kb and contains two overlapping open reading frames, ORF 1a and ORF 1b. The downstream ORF 1b is expressed by a mechanism involving (−1) ribosomal frameshifting. Translation of mRNA 1, which is thought to be equivalent to the viral genomic RNA, results in the synthesis of two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. These polyproteins contain motifs characteristic of papain-like and 3C-like proteinases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helicases, and metal-binding proteins. In this study, we have produced pp1ab-specific monoclonal antibodies and have used them to detect an intracellular, 105-kDa viral polypeptide that contains the putative RNA polymerase domain. Furthermore, usingtranscleavage assays with bacterially expressed HCV 229E 3C-like proteinase, we have demonstrated that the 105-kDa polypeptide is released from pp1ab by cleavage at the dipeptide bonds Gln-4068/Ser-4069 and Gln-4995/Ala-4996. These data contribute to the characterization of coronavirus 3C-like proteinase-mediated processing of pp1ab and provide the first identification of an HCV 229E ORF 1ab-encoded polypeptide in virus-infected cells.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.184336356,-0.053199268,-0.041123377999999995,0.021505292000000002,0.031394342,-0.07188723,-0.08728589699999999,0.00517911,0.048907541,-0.055260654000000006,-0.106068366,0.029927574,0.100094468,-0.034951722000000005,-0.063304842,-0.09082496300000001,0.101202612,0.09797097,0.16711036099999999,-0.033467466,-0.082713048,-0.012285511,0.008056243000000001,-0.021595046,-0.037011478,-0.015178626,-0.026656613,0.01097737,-0.071345122,-0.089340807
187,Further Requirements for Cleavage by the Murine Coronavirus 3C-like Proteinase: Identification of a Cleavage Site within ORF1b,"Abstract The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) encodes a 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) that is proposed to be responsible for the majority of the processing events that take place within the replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. In this study we demonstrate that the Q939↓S940 peptide bond, located between the polymerase and Zn-finger regions of pp1ab (the POL↓Zn site), is processed by the 3CLpro, albeit inefficiently. Mutagenesis of the POL↓Zn site, as well as the previously identified HD1↓3C site in the 1a region of pp1a and pp1ab, demonstrated that the amino acid residues at the P2 and P1 positions of the cleavage site, occupied by L and Q, respectively, were important determinants of 3CLpro substrate specificity. Finally, a direct comparison of the 3CLpro-mediated cleavages at the HD1↓3C and POL↓Zn sites was made by determining the rate constants using synthetic peptides. The results show that while a larger polypeptide substrate carrying the HD1↓3C site was processed more efficiently than a polypeptide substrate carrying the POL↓Zn site, cleavage of the synthetic peptide substrates containing these two cleavage sites occurred at similar efficiencies. This indicates that the overall conformation of a large polyprotein substrate is important in the accessibility of the cleavage site to the proteinase.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.114843526,-0.038153833,-0.007438999,-0.047404384,-0.0015163660000000001,-0.014339781000000001,-0.047040122999999996,-0.006196513000000001,0.025348045,-0.062172088,-0.05942515,0.034522722,0.00448459,-0.076634724,-0.034409199,-0.01468765,0.046071608,-0.001844726,-0.007635849,-0.018222064,0.000394113,-0.023545583,-0.005615399,0.003040213,0.09752065900000001,0.078240831,-0.037291488,-0.000490817,-0.033082711,-0.086883525
190,Rna Viruses Redirect Host Factors to Better Amplify Their Genome,"Publisher Summary This chapter provides an updated view of the host factors that are, at present, believed to participate in replication/transcription of RNA viruses. One of the major hurdles faced when attempting to identify host factors specifically involved in viral RNA replication/transcription is how to discriminate these factors from those involved in translation. Several of the host factors shown to affect viral RNA synthesis are factors known to be involved in protein synthesis, for example, translation factors. In addition, some of the factors identified to date appear to influence viral RNA amplification as well as viral protein synthesis, and translation and replication are frequently tightly associated. Several specific host factors actively participating in viral RNA transcription/replication have been identified and the regions of host protein/replicase or host protein/viral RNA interaction have been determined. The chapter centers exclusively on those factors that appear functionally important for viral amplification. It presents a list of the viruses for which a specific host factor associates with the polymerase, affecting viral genome amplification. It also indicates the usually accepted cell function of the factor and the viral polymerase or polymerase subunit to which the host factor binds.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.197180578,-0.081606383,-0.081469734,0.10991321400000001,-0.09976322800000001,-0.040011567000000005,0.07480073,0.00540168,-0.004146554,0.054820875,-0.013753868,-0.085098373,0.02930895,0.101716882,-0.026017962000000002,0.003070485,0.014237328999999998,-0.070473128,-0.037003679,0.114322891,-0.10662693300000001,0.105321574,-0.120964011,-0.006580643000000001,-0.009380998,-0.085266546,0.040213907,-0.066682628,-0.035168363,0.078384444
191,The Molecular Biology of Coronaviruses,"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the manipulation of clones of coronavirus and of complementary DNAs (cDNAs) of defective-interfering (DI) RNAs to study coronavirus RNA replication, transcription, recombination, processing and transport of proteins, virion assembly, identification of cell receptors for coronaviruses, and processing of the polymerase. The nature of the coronavirus genome is nonsegmented, single-stranded, and positive-sense RNA. Its size ranges from 27 to 32 kb, which is significantly larger when compared with other RNA viruses. The gene encoding the large surface glycoprotein is up to 4.4 kb, encoding an imposing trimeric, highly glycosylated protein. This soars some 20 nm above the virion envelope, giving the virus the appearance-with a little imagination-of a crown or coronet. Coronavirus research has contributed to the understanding of many aspects of molecular biology in general, such as the mechanism of RNA synthesis, translational control, and protein transport and processing.

193,The Molecular Biology of Coronaviruses,"Publisher Summary Coronaviruses have recently emerged as an important group of animal and human pathogens that share a distinctive replicative cycle. Some of the unique characteristics in the replication of coronaviruses include generation of a 3' coterminal-nested set of five or six subgenomic mRNAs, each of which appears to direct the synthesis of one protein. Two virus-specific RNA polymerase activities have been identified. Many of the distinctive features of coronavirus infection and coronavirus-induced diseases may result from the properties of the two coronavirus glycoproteins. The intracellular budding site, which may be important in the establishment and maintenance of persistent infections, appears to be due to the restricted intracytoplasmic migration of the E1 glycoprotein, which acts as a matrix-like transmembrane glycoprotein. E1 also exhibits distinctive behavior by self-aggregating on heating at 100°C in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and by its interaction with RNA in the viral nucleocapsid. The E1 of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is an O-linked glycoprotein, unlike most other viral glycoproteins. Thus, the coronavirus system may be a useful model for the study of synthesis, glycosylation, and transport of O-linked cellular glycoproteins.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.119547244,-0.023611535,-0.058369519,0.028839379,0.013825761,-0.035961747999999995,-0.0010567719999999999,-0.0029138890000000002,0.018051951,0.009350875,-0.008952940999999999,-0.042159429000000005,0.059019340999999996,0.023636400000000002,0.033108628,0.003564903,0.0041798320000000005,0.019554441000000002,0.000935108,0.048862409,-0.019241337,-0.018274048,-0.030228072,-0.005134151,0.083558658,0.021917336000000003,-0.020186329,-0.027048425,-0.017271758,-0.015862088
194,Chapter Three The Nonstructural Proteins Directing Coronavirus RNA Synthesis and Processing,"Abstract Coronaviruses are animal and human pathogens that can cause lethal zoonotic infections like SARS and MERS. They have polycistronic plus-stranded RNA genomes and belong to the order Nidovirales, a diverse group of viruses for which common ancestry was inferred from the common principles underlying their genome organization and expression, and from the conservation of an array of core replicase domains, including key RNA-synthesizing enzymes. Coronavirus genomes (~26–32 kilobases) are the largest RNA genomes known to date and their expansion was likely enabled by acquiring enzyme functions that counter the commonly high error frequency of viral RNA polymerases. The primary functions that direct coronavirus RNA synthesis and processing reside in nonstructural protein (nsp) 7 to nsp16, which are cleavage products of two large replicase polyproteins translated from the coronavirus genome. Significant progress has now been made regarding their structural and functional characterization, stimulated by technical advances like improved methods for bioinformatics and structural biology, in vitro enzyme characterization, and site-directed mutagenesis of coronavirus genomes. Coronavirus replicase functions include more or less universal activities of plus-stranded RNA viruses, like an RNA polymerase (nsp12) and helicase (nsp13), but also a number of rare or even unique domains involved in mRNA capping (nsp14, nsp16) and fidelity control (nsp14). Several smaller subunits (nsp7–nsp10) act as crucial cofactors of these enzymes and contribute to the emerging “nsp interactome.” Understanding the structure, function, and interactions of the RNA-synthesizing machinery of coronaviruses will be key to rationalizing their evolutionary success and the development of improved control strategies.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.20118527,0.025102969,-0.13572408,0.143986833,0.024492019,-0.080677922,0.022891232999999997,0.035422447,-0.031588936,0.041554026,0.039146231000000004,0.0331774,0.038144685,-0.050652928,-0.039151412000000003,-0.025225253,0.058904022,-0.057116125999999996,-0.032424588,0.036259987,-0.040979876,-0.008709371,-0.030317917000000003,-0.050509095999999996,-0.011188597,-0.022181864,-0.059617267,0.00901975,-0.003403529,-0.083731286
195,Conventional and nonconventional roles of the nucleolus,"Abstract As the most prominent of subnuclear structures, the nucleolus has a well-established role in ribosomal subunit assembly. Additional nucleolar functions, not related to ribosome biogenesis, have been discovered within the last decade. Built around multiple copies of the genes for preribosomal RNA (rDNA), nucleolar structure is largely dependent on the process of ribosome assembly. The nucleolus is disassembled during mitosis at which time preribosomal RNA transcription and processing are suppressed; it is reassembled at the end of mitosis in part from components preserved from the previous cell cycle. Expression of preribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) is regulated by the silencing of individual rDNA genes via alterations in chromatin structure or by controlling RNA polymerase I initiation complex formation. Preribosomal RNA processing and posttranscriptional modifications are guided by a multitude of small nucleolar RNAs. Nearly completed ribosomal subunits are exported to the cytoplasm by an established nuclear export system with the aid of specialized adapter molecules. Some preribosomal and nucleolar components are transiently localized in Cajal bodies, presumably for modification or assembly. The nonconventional functions of nucleolus include roles in viral infections, nuclear export, sequestration of regulatory molecules, modification of small RNAs, RNP assembly, and control of aging, although some of these functions are not well established. Additional progress in defining the mechanisms of each step in ribosome biogenesis as well as clarification of the precise role of the nucleolus in nonconventional activities is expected in the next decade.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.146627567,-0.045003627000000004,-0.023822121,0.009575898000000001,-0.051676907,-0.026689757999999997,0.020038722,0.013864183,0.006943869,-0.021664947,-0.016474832,-0.00296506,-0.011458805,0.022573574,0.004314341,0.030536222999999998,-0.005586776,-0.036244252000000005,-0.050894327,-0.013477171999999999,-0.019641436,0.016444361,-0.051256719000000006,-0.044953592,-0.015612539,-0.05514127,-0.022007584,0.027173417000000002,0.066220999,-0.035398723
197,Structure of the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Polymerase Complex,"Summary Numerous interventions are in clinical development for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, including small molecules that target viral transcription and replication. These processes are catalyzed by a complex comprising the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and the tetrameric phosphoprotein (P). RSV P recruits multiple proteins to the polymerase complex and, with the exception of its oligomerization domain, is thought to be intrinsically disordered. Despite their critical roles in RSV transcription and replication, structures of L and P have remained elusive. Here, we describe the 3.2-Å cryo-EM structure of RSV L bound to tetrameric P. The structure reveals a striking tentacular arrangement of P, with each of the four monomers adopting a distinct conformation. The structure also rationalizes inhibitor escape mutants and mutations observed in live-attenuated vaccine candidates. These results provide a framework for determining the molecular underpinnings of RSV replication and transcription and should facilitate the design of effective RSV inhibitors.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.049117565999999994,-0.105093484,-0.08762136699999999,0.126513334,-0.05696084,-0.054713559,0.067847589,-0.0886421,0.122452497,-0.041404007,0.062992443,-0.058711081,-0.152501964,-0.038274385,-0.087003104,-0.015761944,-0.014315196,0.080733158,-0.05228794,0.021128524,0.013674471,-0.119935109,-0.012771675,-0.07418813099999999,0.136848784,-0.198956026,0.243491391,0.1105491,-0.034992119,0.038611642
200,Development of robust in vitro RNA-dependent RNA polymerase assay as a possible platform for antiviral drug testing against dengue,"Abstract NS5 is the largest and most conserved protein among the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. It has been the target of interest for antiviral drug development due to its major role in replication. NS5 consists of two domains, the N-terminal methyltransferase domain and C-terminal catalytic RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain. It is an unstable protein and is prone to inactivation upon prolonged incubation at room temperature, thus affecting the inhibitor screening assays. In the current study, we expressed and purified DENV RdRp alone in Esherichia coli (E. coli) cells. The N-terminally His-tagged construct of DENV RdRp was transformed into E. coli expression strain BL-21 (DE3) pLysS cells. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 0.4mM. The induced cultures were then grown for 20h at 18°C and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000xg for 15min at 4°C. The recombinant protein was purified using HisTrap affinity column (Ni-NTA) and then the sample was subjected to size exclusion chromatography, which successfully removed the degradation product obtained during the previous purification step. The in vitro polymerase activity of RdRp was successfully demonstrated using homopolymeric polycytidylic acid (poly(rC)) RNA template. This study describes the high level production of enzymatically active DENV RdRp protein which can be used to develop assays for testing large number of compounds in a high-throughput manner. RdRp has the de novo initiation activity and the in vitro polymerase assays for the protein provide a platform for highly robust and efficient antiviral compound screening systems.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.223876816,-0.029646825,-0.040730516,0.067984814,-0.118239963,-0.010384022,0.05921736,-0.025541618999999998,0.008698191999999999,0.00564155,0.011238076000000001,0.11893318,-0.08239596099999999,-0.008255428,-0.103987532,-0.074612557,0.09943451199999999,-0.047363968,0.02791822,-0.048949205999999995,0.028119955,-0.023581311,0.090869357,-0.07946112,0.08390007099999999,0.169691562,0.060515754000000005,0.000532266,0.037244902,0.09189243400000001
243,Gene optimization leads to robust expression of human respiratory syncytial virus nucleoprotein and phosphoprotein in human cells and induction of humoral immunity in mice,"Abstract Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the major pathogen leading to respiratory disease in infants and neonates worldwide. An effective vaccine has not yet been developed against this virus, despite considerable efforts in basic and clinical research. HRSV replication is independent of the nuclear RNA processing constraints, since the virus genes are adapted to the cytoplasmic transcription, a process performed by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This study shows that meaningful nuclear RNA polymerase II dependent expression of the HRSV nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) proteins can only be achieved with the optimization of their genes, and that the intracellular localization of N and P proteins changes when they are expressed out of the virus replication context. Immunization tests performed in mice resulted in the induction of humoral immunity using the optimized genes. This result was not observed for the non-optimized genes. In conclusion, optimization is a valuable tool for improving expression of HRSV genes in DNA vaccines.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.09696531800000001,-0.056175002,-0.026283493999999998,0.03697879,-0.044579648,-0.00933417,0.023894062999999997,-0.028604281000000002,0.060674475,0.021672709,-0.03233217,-0.048353905,0.000987106,0.065406212,0.018932171,-0.014013343000000001,0.008617741,-0.046710518,-0.018246608,0.011904308,0.024139197,-0.009414941,-0.008540478,-0.011493712,-0.030016205,-0.042772964000000004,0.000600585,0.028527856,0.003279195,-0.054344997
254,Immunogenic characterization and epitope mapping of transmissible gastroenteritis virus RNA dependent RNA polymerase,"Abstract Coronavirus RNA synthesis is a sophisticated process performed by a viral multienzymatic replicase complex, together with cellular factors. A key enzyme of this replication complex is the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). To study the replication of coronavirus genome, six monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) RdRp were generated and characterized. His-tagged RdRp was expressed in baculovirus, purified and used as immunogen to produce mAbs. The TGEV RdRp was recognized by these mAbs in the context of virus infection by immunofluorescence analysis and Western blot. Epitope mapping by Pepscan indicated that RdRp mAbs recognized four non-overlapping linear epitopes located in a 62-amino acid region of the N-terminal domain, suggesting that this region may constitute an immunodominant domain. The availability of TGEV RdRp mAbs will be instrumental to study coronavirus replication and to analyze the function of RdRp in pathogenesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.19382517800000001,-0.028159293999999998,-0.070810576,0.067240303,-0.020009858000000002,-0.058264102000000005,0.028914147,-0.00027651,-0.033422975,0.009072569,0.082716703,0.137310951,-0.08597019199999999,-0.04819193099999999,-0.035060493,-0.066501246,0.08889381800000001,-0.061873735,-0.019644818,-0.010853653000000001,0.044990942,-0.0373223,0.072937352,-0.073716022,0.088592974,0.09218505699999999,0.02615496,0.0037061990000000003,-0.001148047,0.083331975
284,Inhibition of measles virus and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis virus by RNA interference,"Abstract Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare, but fatal outcome of measles virus (MeV) infection. SSPE develops after prolonged persistence of mutated MeV called SSPE virus. Although a combination therapy using interferon and inosiplex or ribavirin appears to prolong survival time to some extent, there is currently no effective treatment to completely cure SSPE and a new treatment strategy is greatly needed. In this study, we adopted RNA interference (RNAi) strategy and examined whether small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can be used to inhibit replication of MeV and SSPE virus. We report here that siRNAs targeted against L mRNA of MeV, either synthetic siRNAs or those generated by pcPUR+U6i-based expression plasmids, effectively and specifically inhibited replication of both MeV and SSPE virus without exhibiting any cytotoxic effect. The L protein of MeV is a major component of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is essential for viral RNA replication, and yet it is least abundant among all the MeV proteins expressed. Therefore, mRNA encoding the L protein would be a good target for RNAi strategy. The present results imply the possibility that our siRNAs against MeV L mRNA are among the potential candidates to be used to treat patients with SSPE.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.152134396,-0.051140464000000004,-0.060311287000000005,0.025461839,-0.113340111,-0.003178078,-0.005140967,0.012258848999999999,0.011280278000000001,0.021250082000000003,-0.0026293420000000002,-0.059890495999999994,0.023185027999999996,0.092859425,0.022281122,-0.003058292,-0.021143705,0.029419099,0.02368987,0.038121021,0.011331906999999999,0.026748482,-0.014192014,-0.009797409,-0.008382106,-0.0181914,0.041486462,-0.030096535,0.032509576,0.048167229000000006
288,Effective inhibition of hepatitis E virus replication in A549 cells and piglets by RNA interference (RNAi) targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,"Abstract RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural mechanism for suppressing or silencing expression of aberrant or foreign genes. It is a powerful antiviral strategy that has been widely employed to protect hosts from viral infection. Hepatitis E (HE) is an acute fulminant hepatitis in adults that has particularly high mortality in pregnant women. At this point in time, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment that is effective against the infectious agent, HEV. The nonstructural polyprotein region possesses an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that is responsible for the replication of the viral RNA genome. RdRp is therefore regarded as one of the most attractive candidates for RNA interference (RNAi). In the present study, the high efficiency and specificity of siRNA were evaluated by Real-Time quantitative PCR and Western blot assays. Protective effects against HEV infection were achieved in A549 cells and in piglets. In piglets treated with a shRNA-RdRp-1 expression plasmid prior to HEV inoculation, HEV antigens were significantly reduced in the liver, spleen, and kidneys, and the activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total bilirubin (TBIL) were clearly decreased. These results suggested that RNAi is a potentially effective antiviral strategy against HEV replication and infection.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.139349398,-0.020784504,-0.038404207999999995,0.031516317,-0.096125405,-0.006574208000000001,0.047919813,0.010717366,0.015753516000000002,0.026628242000000003,0.05612475,0.033773661,-0.049503708,0.047830526,0.001375701,-0.03313532,-0.003803967,0.036666096,0.049122315,-0.031973116,0.043102431,-0.014592392,0.01887026,-0.04628871,-0.02458464,0.02592412,0.046464387,-0.013859044,0.043864792,0.025777624
302,Similarity relations of DNA and RNA polymerases investigated by the principal component analysis of amino acid sequences,"Abstract The principal component analysis based on the physicochemical properties of amino acid residues is applied to DNA and RNA polymerases to assign the sequence motifs for the polymerization activities of these proteins. After the reconfirmation of the sequence motifs of families A and B of DNA polymerases indicated previously, it elucidates the sequence motifs for the polymerization activity of DNA polymerase III (family C) by the similarity to the polymerization center of multimeric DNA dependent RNA polymerases. This identification proceeds to clarify the sequence motifs for polymerization activities of primases; eukaryotic and archaebacterial primases carry motifs similar to those of family C, while the motifs of eubacterial primase fall into the category of the motifs in family B DNA polymerases such as α, δ, ϵ and II. This finding means that DNA dependent RNA polymerases are also divided into groups corresponding to three families, A, B and C, because the monomeric DNA dependent RNA polymerases in phages are reconfirmed to carry sequence motifs similar to those of family A DNA polymerases. Furthermore, the three families of polymerization motifs are found to fall within the variation range of polymerization motifs displayed by many RNA dependent RNA polymerases, suggesting a close evolutionary relation between them. The sequence motifs for polymerization activities of reverse transcriptase and telomerase seem to be the intermediate between family A DNA polymerase and some RNA dependent RNA polymerases, e.g., from Leviviridae. On the contrary, the sequence fragments similar to the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily including DNA polymerase β are not found in any RNA dependent RNA polymerase, suggesting their other lineage of polymerization motifs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.16684683,-0.031887833,-0.013768229,0.02994232,0.005877096,-0.04769324900000001,0.025571599,0.032983422000000005,-0.045461090999999995,-0.000492328,0.010154599,0.048842820999999995,-0.010304994,-0.08008078099999999,-0.030385200000000005,0.008204986,-0.005769476999999999,-1.45e-06,-0.01283605,-0.031039692,-0.007311626,-0.010891681,-0.022787331,-0.019326424,-0.046673112,-0.044170259,-0.054330210999999996,0.043668923,0.005040204,0.011660249
310,Complete sequences of 3′ end coding region for structural protein genes of turkey coronavirus,"Abstract Overlapping fragments of genomic RNA spanning 6963 nucleotides from 5′ end of spike (S) protein gene to 3′ end of nucleocapsid (N) protein gene of turkey coronavirus (TCoV) were amplified by reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The primers were derived from the corresponding sequences of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The PCR products were cloned and sequenced and their nucleic acid structure and similarity to published sequences of other coronaviruses were analyzed. Sequencing and subsequent analysis revealed 9 open reading frames (ORFs) representing the entire S protein gene, tricistronic gene 3, membrane (M) protein gene, bicistronic gene 5, and N protein gene in the order of 5′–3′. The overall nucleic acid structures of these encoding regions of TCoV were very similar to the homologous regions of IBV. The consensus transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) of IBV, CT(T/G)AACAA, was highly conserved in TCoV genome at the levels of nucleotide sequence and location in regarding to the initiation codon of individual genes. Pair-wise comparison of gene 3, M gene, gene 5, or N gene sequences with their counterparts of IBV revealed high levels (82.1–92.0%) of similarity. Phylogenetic analysis based on the deduced amino acid sequences of S, M, or N protein demonstrated that TCoV was clustered within the same genomic lineage as the IBV strains while all the other mammalian coronaviruses were grouped into separate clusters corresponding to antigenic groups I or II. There were substantial differences of S protein sequence between TCoV and IBV with only 33.8–33.9% of similarity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.18520972,-0.011508347,0.090830914,-0.097071282,0.251501515,-0.000992373,-0.25360094699999997,-0.06886806,0.107749322,0.169212265,-0.086807675,-0.038621149,0.012381986000000001,-0.04589240000000001,-0.182029505,-0.024122524,0.081155742,0.007509327,-0.0039447679999999995,0.001585842,-0.036260007000000004,-0.001121356,0.003006371,-0.014396276999999999,-0.01920835,0.023348387999999998,0.055535666,-0.040402162,0.026249198999999997,0.07245155
311,"Incorporation fidelity of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase: a kinetic, thermodynamic and structural perspective","Abstract Positive-strand RNA viruses exist as a quasi-species due to the incorporation of mutations into the viral genome during replication by the virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). Therefore, the RdRP is often described as a low-fidelity enzyme. However, until recently, a complete description of the kinetic, thermodynamic and structural basis for the nucleotide incorporation fidelity of the RdRP has not been available. In this article, we review the following: (i) the steps employed by the RdRP to incorporate a correct nucleotide; (ii) the steps that are employed by the RdRP for nucleotide selection; (iii) the structure-based hypothesis for nucleotide selection; (iv) the impact of sites remote from the active site on polymerase fidelity. Given the recent observation that RNA viruses exist on the threshold of error catastrophe, the studies reviewed herein suggest novel strategies to perturb RdRP fidelity that may lead ultimately to the development of antiviral agents to treat RNA virus infection.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.22095340600000002,-0.045338780999999995,-0.097908795,0.16990544600000002,-0.020821862,-0.043692463,0.12704147,0.056245384,-0.10294635199999999,0.09558972,0.185866888,0.183323595,-0.119125039,-0.090984303,-0.023258641,-0.023205704,0.005896643000000001,-0.038892365,-0.09491951400000001,-0.078468928,0.139676458,-0.10185508,0.08716042,0.048812212,-0.034445816000000004,0.066493824,0.07075414099999999,-0.020141165,-0.0026144429999999997,-0.032494472999999996
312,De novo RNA synthesis and homology modeling of the classical swine fever virus RNA polymerase,"Abstract Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) non-structural protein 5B (NS5B) encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a key enzyme which initiates RNA replication by a de novo mechanism without a primer and is a potential target for anti-virus therapy. We expressed the NS5B protein in Escherichia coli. The rGTP can stimulate de novo initiation of RNA synthesis and mutation of the GDD motif to Gly–Asp–Asp (GAA) abolishes the RNA synthesis. To better understand the mechanism of viral RNA synthesis in CSFV, a three-dimensional model was built by homology modeling based on the alignment with several virus RdRps. The model contains 605 residues folded in the characteristic fingers, palm and thumb domains. The fingers domain contains an N-terminal region that plays an important role in conformational change. We propose that the experimentally observed promotion of polymerase efficiency by rGTP is probably due to the conformational changes of the polymerase caused by binding the rGTP. Mutation of the GDD to GAA interferes with the interaction between the residues at the polymerase active site and metal ions, and thus renders the polymerase inactive.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.235585798,-0.056752778,-0.079044962,0.10761043199999999,-0.05866948,-0.065716785,0.001224234,0.019678178,-0.040086879,0.019096994,0.057379726,0.082815971,-0.049172703,-0.032587153,-0.035187866,-0.051479742,0.063679968,-0.001188105,0.009873089,-0.029242324,-0.022140164,-0.019251976,0.038608097,-0.050541682000000004,0.009765600000000001,0.043342385,-0.00483363,0.002038925,0.012335512,0.021173937
313,The complete sequence of the bovine torovirus genome,"Abstract Viruses in the family Coronaviridae have elicited new interest, with the outbreaks caused by SARS-HCoV in 2003 and the recent discovery of a new human coronavirus, HCoV-NL63. The genus Torovirus, within the family Coronaviridae, is less well characterized, in part because toroviruses cannot yet be grown in cell culture (except for the Berne virus). In this study, we determined the sequence of the complete genome of Breda-1 (BoTV-1), a bovine torovirus. This is the first complete torovirus genome sequence to be reported. BoTV-1 RNA was amplified using long RT-PCR and the amplicons sequenced. The genome has a length of 28.475kb and consisted mainly of the replicase gene (∼20.2kb) which contains two large overlapping ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, encoding polyproteins pp1a and pp1b, respectively. Sequence analysis identified conserved domains within the predicted sequences of pp1a and pp1b. Sequence alignments and protein secondary structure prediction data suggest the presence of a 3C-like serine protease domain with similarity to the arterivirus 3C-like serine protease and a single papain-like cysteine protease domain with similarity to the picornavirus leader protease. The ADRP (APPR-1″) domain – unique to the Coronaviridae – was also located in BoTV pp1a. In addition, several hydrophobic domains were identified that are typical of a nidovirus replicase. Within the pp1b sequence the polymerase and helicase domains were identified, as well as sequences predicted to be involved in ribosomal frameshifting, including the conserved slippery sequence UUUAAAC and two potential pseudoknot structures.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.15341946,0.0046991490000000006,-0.039918452,0.004061764,0.157406708,-0.055304159000000006,-0.09189597,-0.042249384,0.021928441,-0.054916103,-0.122709825,0.11650841,0.141005645,-0.09945637800000001,-0.060668597000000005,-0.112230089,0.08742677800000001,0.01997433,-0.008979852,0.013143789,-0.011908445,0.007761978,-0.063496447,-0.005621349,-0.019494861000000002,0.018374064,0.050107599999999995,-0.00682511,0.043161162999999995,-0.067732241
314,Nidovirales: Evolving the largest RNA virus genome,"Abstract This review focuses on the monophyletic group of animal RNA viruses united in the order Nidovirales. The order includes the distantly related coronaviruses, toroviruses, and roniviruses, which possess the largest known RNA genomes (from 26 to 32kb) and will therefore be called ‘large’ nidoviruses in this review. They are compared with their arterivirus cousins, which also belong to the Nidovirales despite having a much smaller genome (13–16kb). Common and unique features that have been identified for either large or all nidoviruses are outlined. These include the nidovirus genetic plan and genome diversity, the composition of the replicase machinery and virus particles, virus-specific accessory genes, the mechanisms of RNA and protein synthesis, and the origin and evolution of nidoviruses with small and large genomes. Nidoviruses employ single-stranded, polycistronic RNA genomes of positive polarity that direct the synthesis of the subunits of the replicative complex, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and helicase. Replicase gene expression is under the principal control of a ribosomal frameshifting signal and a chymotrypsin-like protease, which is assisted by one or more papain-like proteases. A nested set of subgenomic RNAs is synthesized to express the 3′-proximal ORFs that encode most conserved structural proteins and, in some large nidoviruses, also diverse accessory proteins that may promote virus adaptation to specific hosts. The replicase machinery includes a set of RNA-processing enzymes some of which are unique for either all or large nidoviruses. The acquisition of these enzymes may have improved the low fidelity of RNA replication to allow genome expansion and give rise to the ancestors of small and, subsequently, large nidoviruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.201854475,-0.040997899,-0.062476017,0.101209508,0.043565365,-0.062973227,0.001938125,0.033732658,-0.040116692999999995,0.013021988,0.013932409,0.003443349,0.011155834,-0.022060356,-0.015976245,-0.021863386000000002,0.038061616,-0.034057329,-0.028130062,0.028337868999999998,-0.030622214,-0.0020373039999999998,-0.04962554,-0.048065182000000005,-0.045308275999999995,-0.023057787000000003,-0.021994239,-0.002407036,-0.035535485,-0.06954027
315,Sequence analysis of a reovirus isolated from the winter moth Operophtera brumata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) and its parasitoid wasp Phobocampe tempestiva (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae),"Abstract A reovirus was isolated from Operophtera brumata (ObRV) and its parasitoid wasp Phobocampe tempestiva. Each of the 10 dsRNA genome segments of ObRV was sequenced and shown to contain a single open reading frame (ORF). Conserved motifs ([+ve] 5′-AAATAAA … G/TAGGTT-3′) were found at the termini of each segment, with the exception of Seg-6 and Seg-8, where the 5′ termini were 5′-AACAAA…-3′. The putative proteins encoded by each segment were compared with those of other members of the family Reoviridae. Phylogenetic comparisons to published sequences for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes from other reoviruses indicated that ObRV is most closely related to members of the genus Cypovirus. However, unlike the cypoviruses, ObRV has a double-layered capsid structure. When the protein encoded by ObRV Seg-10 was expressed (by inserting the open reading frame into a baculovirus expression vector) no ‘occlusion bodies’ were observed in the recombinant baculovirus infected insect cell cultures. This suggests that unlike the cypoviruses, Seg-10 of ObRV does not contain a polyhedrin gene. Further phylogenetic comparisons also identified relationships between Seg-2 and Seg-10 of ObRV, and genes of Diadromus pulchellus Idnoreovirus 1 (DpIRV1), suggesting that ObRV represents a new species from the genus Idnoreovirus.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.171725278,-0.041005105,-0.015663919,-0.040639722,0.100358499,-0.026456271,-0.048998467000000004,0.009743791,0.0043184370000000005,-0.057443564,-0.102373554,-0.025956161000000002,0.006569081,-0.0406346,-0.037958078,-0.09507409800000001,0.052507229,-0.00727812,0.032342723999999996,-0.006294207,0.0063941630000000005,0.011689254,-0.028219899,0.01027039,-0.102714971,-0.0036719229999999997,0.053162172,0.003350657,-0.033954925,0.012801503
318,The PRRSV replicase: Exploring the multifunctionality of an intriguing set of nonstructural proteins,"Abstract Our knowledge about the structure and function of the nonstructural proteins (nsps) encoded by the arterivirus replicase gene has advanced in recent years. The continued characterization of the nsps of the arterivirus prototype equine arteritis virus has not only corroborated several important functional predictions, but also revealed various novel features of arteriviral replication. For porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), based on bioinformatics predictions and experimental studies, a processing map for the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins has been developed. Crystal structures have been resolved for two of the PRRSV nonstructural proteins that possess proteinase activity (nsp1α and nsp4). The functional characterization of the key enzymes for arterivirus RNA synthesis, the nsp9 RNA polymerase and nsp10 helicase, has been initiated. In addition, progress has been made on nsp functions relating to the regulation of subgenomic mRNAs synthesis (nsp1), the induction of replication-associated membrane rearrangements (nsp2 and nsp3), and an intriguing replicative endoribonuclease (nsp11) for which the natural substrate remains to be identified. The role of nsps in viral pathogenesis and host immunity is also being explored, and specific nsps (including nsp1α/β, nsp2, nsp4, nsp7, and nsp11) have been implicated in the modulation of host immune responses to PRRSV infection. The nsp3–8 region was identified as containing major virulence factors, although mechanistic information is scarce. The biological significance of PRRSV nsps in virus-host interactions and the technical advancements in engineering the PRRSV genome by reverse genetics are also reflected in recent developments in the area of vaccines and diagnostic assays.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14425308,-0.040762797,-0.051859169000000004,0.033771987,-0.052748487999999996,-0.003644483,0.028960184,-0.017251772,0.035377877,0.016025466999999998,-0.021376401,-0.010793186000000001,0.007038648000000001,0.026341899,0.01444035,-0.066137485,0.065524023,-0.065871492,-0.02949138,0.08676295699999999,-0.07251257400000001,0.023627283,-0.014402345,-0.10511680400000001,0.05354379099999999,0.037251783,-0.011284038,-0.02746364,-0.07727328,0.023933106000000003
323,Retrospective on the all-in-one retroviral nucleocapsid protein,"Abstract This review aims at briefly presenting a retrospect on the retroviral nucleocapsid protein (NC), from an unspecific nucleic acid binding protein (NABP) to an all-in-one viral protein with multiple key functions in the early and late phases of the retrovirus replication cycle, notably reverse transcription of the genomic RNA and viral DNA integration into the host genome, and selection of the genomic RNA together with the initial steps of virus morphogenesis. In this context we will discuss the notion that NC protein has a flexible conformation and is thus a member of the growing family of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) where disorder may account, at least in part, for its function as a nucleic acid (NA) chaperone and possibly as a protein chaperone vis-à-vis the viral DNA polymerase during reverse transcription. Lastly, we will briefly review the development of new anti-retroviral/AIDS compounds targeting HIV-1 NC because it represents an ideal target due to its multiple roles in the early and late phases of virus replication and its high degree of conservation.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.17033965899999998,-0.039640313999999996,-0.019070856,0.051148136,-0.110892445,0.0008245969999999999,0.043348835,-0.023235257000000002,0.027608703999999998,0.042473239,-0.044211339,-0.02652462,0.056142403,-0.024458907999999998,-0.032726411000000004,-0.034818156,0.019959417,-0.0028166190000000002,-0.03160255,0.06606298599999999,-0.08740186400000001,0.041924943,-0.067524998,-0.033944219,0.029710458,0.022835762000000003,0.025486928,-0.053613007000000004,-0.053469384,0.092537759
328,"Structure(s), function(s), and inhibition of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of noroviruses","Abstract Noroviruses belong to the Caliciviridae family of single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses. The genus Norovirus includes seven genogroups (designated GI-GVII), of which GI, GII and GIV infect humans. Human noroviruses are responsible for widespread outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis and represent one of the most common causes of foodborne illness. No vaccine or antiviral treatment options are available for norovirus infection. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of noroviruses is a key enzyme responsible for transcription and replication of the viral genome. Here, we review the progress made in understanding the structures and functions of norovirus RdRp and its use as a target for small molecule inhibitors. Crystal structures of the RdRp at different stages of substrate interaction have been determined, which shed light on its multi-step catalytic cycle. The in vitro assays and in vivo animal models that have been developed to identify and characterize inhibitors of norovirus RdRp are also summarized, followed by an update on the current antiviral research targeting different regions of norovirus RdRp. In the future, structure-based drug design and rational optimization of known nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors of norovirus RdRp may pave the way towards the next generation of direct-acting antivirals.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.150806128,-0.018196938,-0.052553790999999996,0.09486428699999999,-0.05587029599999999,0.016060676,0.14375886599999999,0.021271149,-0.030501996,0.062956968,0.107231127,0.154740896,-0.060025514,-0.078339618,-0.020242887,-0.061425808,0.003277628,0.06345982,0.020115307,-0.022252581,0.06982621,0.011695975,-0.042936425,0.027111976,0.027811847999999997,-0.009295425,0.046601752999999996,-0.016320102,0.137219284,0.031959731
329,Transcription and replication mechanisms of Bunyaviridae and Arenaviridae L proteins,"Abstract Bunyaviridae and Arenaviridae virus families include an important number of highly pathogenic viruses for humans. They are enveloped viruses with negative stranded RNA genomes divided into three (bunyaviruses) or two (arenaviruses) segments. Each genome segment is coated by the viral nucleoproteins (NPs) and the polymerase (L protein) to form a functional ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. The viral RNP provides the necessary context on which the L protein carries out the biosynthetic processes of RNA replication and gene transcription. Decades of research have provided a good understanding of the molecular processes underlying RNA synthesis, both RNA replication and gene transcription, for these two families of viruses. In this review we will provide a global view of the common features, as well as differences, of the molecular biology of Bunyaviridae and Arenaviridae. We will also describe structures of protein and protein-RNA complexes so far determined for these viral families, mainly focusing on the L protein, and discuss their implications for understanding the mechanisms of viral RNA replication and gene transcription within the architecture of viral RNPs, also taking into account the cellular context in which these processes occur. Finally, we will discuss the implications of these structural findings for the development of antiviral drugs to treat human diseases caused by members of the Bunyaviridae and Arenaviridae families.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.193849665,-0.063357948,-0.072948927,0.12753974699999998,-0.039631723,-0.027181657,0.04475883,0.01145194,-0.000471016,0.07650496400000001,-0.004307511,-0.045856237,0.052962119,0.03301744,-0.009931684,-0.060490599000000006,0.02997082,-0.017969845,-0.026234234,0.068708562,-0.053745367,0.07206069400000001,-0.091171258,-0.002864674,-0.018081582,-0.016079259,0.047684184000000004,-0.056729059000000005,-0.01172397,0.038144775
330,Nidovirus RNA polymerases: Complex enzymes handling exceptional RNA genomes,"Abstract Coronaviruses and arteriviruses are distantly related human and animal pathogens that belong to the order Nidovirales. Nidoviruses are characterized by their polycistronic plus-stranded RNA genome, the production of subgenomic mRNAs and the conservation of a specific array of replicase domains, including key RNA-synthesizing enzymes. Coronaviruses (26–34 kilobases) have the largest known RNA genomes and their replication presumably requires a processive RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and enzymatic functions that suppress the consequences of the typically high error rate of viral RdRps. The arteriviruses have significantly smaller genomes and form an intriguing package with the coronaviruses to analyse viral RdRp evolution and function. The RdRp domain of nidoviruses resides in a cleavage product of the replicase polyprotein named non-structural protein (nsp) 12 in coronaviruses and nsp9 in arteriviruses. In all nidoviruses, the C-terminal RdRp domain is linked to a conserved N-terminal domain, which has been coined NiRAN (nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyl transferase). Although no structural information is available, the functional characterization of the nidovirus RdRp and the larger enzyme complex of which it is part, has progressed significantly over the past decade. In coronaviruses several smaller, non-enzymatic nsps were characterized that direct RdRp function, while a 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease activity in nsp14 was implicated in fidelity. In arteriviruses, the nsp1 subunit was found to maintain the balance between genome replication and subgenomic mRNA production. Understanding RdRp behaviour and interactions during RNA synthesis and subsequent processing will be key to rationalising the evolutionary success of nidoviruses and the development of antiviral strategies.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.241705378,-0.029622155,-0.126843486,0.144438436,-0.002711914,-0.077929857,0.088615674,0.026281061,-0.077373678,0.036067739,0.102392799,0.141785621,-0.065206983,-0.060388235,-0.086031099,-0.04713052400000001,0.095450736,-0.072653304,-0.050920632,-0.022788429,0.014618029,-0.045180773,0.047965154,-0.087610835,0.032292316,0.063400134,-0.016859008,0.022704001,0.04440105,-0.011612195
333,Isolation and characterization of a novel mesonivirus from Culex mosquitoes in China,"Abstract A new insect nidovirus (named Yichang virus) from the family Mesoniviridae was isolated, identified, and characterized from Culex mosquitoes in Hubei, China. Results showed a high number of viral RNA copies (up to 1011 copies/ml) within 48h in C6/36 cells. In addition, the titers of the Yichang virus reached maximal levels of 107 PFU/mL at 6 d post-infection (dpi). The virus produced moderate cytopathic effects when the multiplicity of infection ranged from 0.001–0.1 at 6 dpi, but did not replicate in mammalian cells. Under electron microscopy, the virion of the Yichang virus appeared as spherical particles with diameters of ∼80nm and large club-shaped projections. Although subsequent genomic sequence analysis revealed that the Yichang virus had similar protein patterns as those of other mesoniviruses, the nucleotide acids shared less than 20% BLAST query coverage with known viruses in the family Mesoniviridae, and showed a maximum sequence identity of 67% for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The putative protein sequences showed slightly higher identity (28%–68%), and the most conserved domain was RdRp. Based on the phylogenetic and pairwise evolutionary distance analyses, the Yichang virus should be considered a new species belonging to a currently unassigned genus within the family Mesoniviridae.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.151683533,-0.043849378,-0.038266182,0.037111177,0.071983607,-0.009145161,0.014035431999999999,0.00189748,-0.03070689,0.020067354,0.0017433829999999998,0.002220582,-0.040102696,0.000813337,0.007794219,-0.079638112,0.032194956000000004,-0.008887401999999999,0.006387222,0.025673752999999997,0.036323853999999996,0.007215458,0.013634568,0.006148875,-0.04114798,0.066275295,0.067776344,0.011938376,-0.062604391,0.07203949999999999
338,Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor X1 restricts porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus-2 replication by interacting with viral Nsp9,"Abstract Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes one of the most economically important diseases of swine worldwide. Current antiviral strategies provide only limited protection. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) X1 is unique among NLR proteins in its functions as a pro-viral or antiviral factor to different viral infections. To date, the impact of NLRX1 on PRRSV infection remains unclear. In this study, we found that PRRSV infection promoted the expression of NLRX1 gene. In turn, ectopic expression of NLRX1 inhibited PRRSV replication in Marc-145 cells, whereas knockdown of NLRX1 enhanced PRRSV propagation in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Mechanistically, NLRX1 was revealed to impair intracellular viral subgenomic RNAs accumulation. Finally, Mutagenic analyses indicated that the LRR (leucine-rich repeats) domain of NLRX1 interacted with PRRSV Nonstructural Protein 9 (Nsp9) RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase) domain and was necessary for antiviral activity. Thus, our study establishes the role of NLRX1 as a new host restriction factor in PRRSV infection.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.138097099,-0.055397761,-0.059038336,0.0064367619999999995,-0.077059937,0.024054482999999998,0.035955227,-0.031559828,0.064502215,0.021353108,-0.028548088,-0.017598192,-0.014742753,0.07820911,0.061133049,-0.11254976300000001,0.057713775999999994,-0.04780552,-0.00173873,0.09836952800000001,-0.05143531900000001,0.002480186,0.041223484,-0.085179522,0.050773723,0.07685985299999999,0.038937516,-0.049063157999999996,-0.053663047,0.08765092699999999
339,Identification of the polymerase polyprotein products p72 and p65 of the murine coronavirus MHV-JHM,"Abstract The RNA polymerase gene of murine coronavirus MHV-JHM encodes a polyprotein of greater than 750 kDa. This polyprotein is proposed to be processed by two papain-like cysteine proteinases, PCP-1 and PCP-2, and a poliovirus 3C-like proteinase domain, 3C-pro, to generate protein products. The amino-terminal product of the MHV polymerase polyprotein, p28, is generated by cleavage of the polyprotein by PCP-1. To identify the viral products downstream of p28, we generated a fusion-protein specific antiserum directed against the region adjacent to p28 and used the antiserum to detect virus-specific proteins from MHV-JHM infected cells. When this antiserum was used to immunoprecipitate radiolabeled proteins from MHV-JHM infected cell lysates, virus-specific proteins of 72 and 65 kDa were detected. Furthermore, pulse and chase experiments demonstrated that p72 is likely a precursor to the mature protein product, p65. To investigate which viral proteinase may be responsible for generating p72 and p65, we expressed the 5′-region of the MHV-JHM RNA polymerase gene including the two papain-like cysteine proteinase domains in an in vitro transcription/translation system and analyzed the translation products for proteolytic processing. We also cloned and expressed the 72 kDa region immediately downstream from p28, and tested the ability of in vitro translated PCP-1 and PCP-2 to cleave p72 to p65 in trans. Our results indicate that neither viral proteinase domain PCP-1 nor PCP-2 is capable of cleavage of p72 to produce p65 in vitro. The role of MHV proteinases in the processing of p72 and p65 is discussed.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.172080503,-0.062930942,-0.02230227,-0.022989814,0.006517057,-0.057154379000000005,-0.125792402,-0.021504699,0.050566592,-0.07515819900000001,-0.114212875,-0.049548552999999995,0.058295714000000005,-0.029913559,-0.017593733,-0.036461446,0.050034725,-0.000284457,0.032067855,0.022314202,-0.023011449,0.000918821,0.029683757999999998,-0.025261487000000003,0.142237216,0.170682105,-0.005024241,-0.035219516,-0.081850347,-0.015123042
384,"Sequence analysis of gene 3, gene 4 and gene 5 of avian infectious bronchitis virus strain CU-T2","Abstract We have previously reported the nucleotide sequences of gene 2 (spike (S) protein gene), gene 6 (nucleocapsid (N) protein gene), and the 3′ end untranslated region of a novel avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain, CU-T2 [Jia et al. (1995) Arch. Virol. 140, 259–271]. In the present report we describe the sequences of the remaining genes of this strain (gene 3, 4 and 5) with the exception of gene 1 (RNA polymerase gene). Gene 3 contained three open reading frames (ORFs), 3a, 3b and 3c of 174, 195 and 282 nucleotides (nt), respectively. Gene 4 (membrane (M) protein gene) consisted of 749 nt with a single ORF of 687 nt. Gene 5 contained two ORFs, 5a and 5b, with 198 and 249 nt, respectively. Thus, in total, there were 7349 nt from the 5′ end of S protein gene to the 3′ end of the CU-T2 genome. The overall nt sequence homologies between gene 3, 4, and 5 of CU-T2 and those of other strains were between 84.1–90.8%, 85.8–88.8% and 90.4–96.4%, respectively. The predicted amino acid (aa) sequence homologies revealed that gene 3b and 5b were more conserved than 3a, 3c and 5a. Each individual gene of CU-T2 strain (with the exception of the RNA polymerase gene) had a different level of homology with the homologous gene of other strains, suggesting that the evolution of IBV strains in general has been a complex, and as yet, poorly understood process. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

427,Sequence and analysis of bovine enteritic coronavirus (F15) genome I.—Sequence of the gene coding for the nucleocapsid protein; analysis of the predicted protein,"Summary Sequences encoding the N protein of the bovine enteritic coronavirus-F15 strain (BECV-F15) have been cloned in PBR322 plasmid using cDNA produced by priming with oligo-dT on purified viral genomic RNA. Some 265 insert-containing clones were studied. Hybridization of these inserts with poly(A)+ RNA extracted from infected cells led to the conclusion that they were located at the 3′-end of the genome. After subcloning in M13 phage DNA, clones were sequenced by the Sanger technique. A 1,710-nucleotide sequence corresponding to the gene coding for the viral N-protein was established. It shows 2 overlapping open reading frames (ORF). The 3′-non-coding end of the gene has an 8-nucleotide sequence in common with the homologous genome areas of MHV, TGE and IBV viruses. This sequence may represent the polymerase RNA binding site. An upstream sequence surrounding the first AUG of the smaller ORF corresponds to a potentially functional initiation codon. The sequence of the primary translation product deduced from the DNA sequence predicts a polypeptide of 207 amino acids (22.9 Kd) with a high leucine (19.8%) content, possessing a hydrophobic N-terminal end. The larger ORF has a coding capacity of 448 amino acids (49.4 Kd), corresponding to the N-protein molecular weight. The deduced protein possesses 43 serine residues (9.6% of the total amino acid content) which may be phosporylated and involved in N-protein/RNA binding. N-protein also has 5 regions with a high basic amino acid content. One of them is also serine-rich and has a strong homology site with MHV, TGE and IBV viruses. In the first part of the N-terminal, a 12-amino-acid sequence (PRWYFYYLGTGP) is highly conserved for BECV-F15, JHM, TGE and IBV viruses. BCV Mebus strain and BECV-F15 have only minor differences in their N-protein sequence.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.239109054,-0.07842394400000001,-0.0015373989999999998,-0.019215496000000002,0.157610734,-0.087004333,-0.238282329,-0.016727498,0.045032594,0.050057877,-0.11369052,-0.017156887,0.068000667,-0.144041071,-0.101620325,-0.100831449,0.071005864,0.010594283999999999,0.033208451,0.029072416,-0.032829255,-0.018888973,-0.011520876000000001,0.01862495,-0.005653314,0.084018596,0.049813851,-0.062340348,-0.039425667000000005,0.029196271
446,Progress towards a higher taxonomy of viruses,"Summary The current consensus view is that a higher hierarchical taxonomy of viruses cannot be established for two reasons. Firstly, viruses appear to be polyphyletic in origin, with several sets of viruses arising by different, independent routes at different times. Secondly, subsequent virus adaptation for survival in different host/vector combinations has involved the selective acquisition of additional genes by a process of cassette or modular evolution, with these additional gene modules coming from other viruses or host genetic material. Thus, depending on the gene product used for comparison, different phylogenetic relationships can be deduced. Further virus adaptation can arise by reassortment of segmented genomes, gene duplication, deletions, frameshift mutations, point mutations or de novo development of new gene products from existing, unused reading frames. The solution to the first objection is to place all viruses in a separate kingdom and assign the current viruses to several phyla that reflect these diverse origins. The solution to the second objection is to consider the core module of replication machinery as the major criterion on which to make the initial assignments to classes and orders. For RNA viruses, the major criterion is the sequence identity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Using this criterion, the positive strand RNA viruses can be assigned to five classes that correspond to the recently recognized supergroups of RNA viruses. These five classes contain four, three, three, three and one order(s) respectively. These fourteen orders contain 31 virus families (including 17 families of plant viruses) and 48 genera (including 30 genera of plant viruses). This approach confirms the separation of the alphaviruses and flaviviruses into two families, the Togaviridae and Flaviridae, but suggests that several other current taxonomic assignments, such as the pestiviruses, hepatitis C virus, rubiviruses, hepatitis E virus and arteriviruses, may be wrong. The coronaviruses and toroviruses appear to be distinct families in distinct orders, not distinct genera of the same family as currently classified. In addition, the luteoviruses are split into two families and apple chlorotic leaf spot virus appears not to be a closterovirus but a new genus of the Potexviridae. From an analysis of the polymerase dendrograms of the dsRNA viruses, it appears that they are not closely related to each other, but belong to four additional classes (Partitiviridae, Reoviridae, Birnaviridae and Cystoviridae) and one additional order (Totiviridae) of one of the classes of positive ssRNA viruses in the same subphylum as the positive strand RNA viruses. The negative strand virus polymerase relationships confirm the assignment of the negative strand viruses to two orders in a single class in a separate subphylum of the RNA viruses. This review includes preliminary data suggesting that the DNA viruses can also be assigned to higher taxa on the basis of the sequence identities of their highly conserved DNA polymerases. The suggested use of viral polymerases to establish higher order relationships is similar in principle to the use of highly conserved ribosomal RNA gene sequences in prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxonomy. This review also discusses the assignment of 33 of the 35 groups of plant viruses into genera of 25 families based on the nature of the genome and its arrangement, the level of sequence identity and, to a lesser extent, particle morphology.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.143860498,-0.070103855,-0.028041858,0.14663931800000002,0.11316762699999999,-0.010611441999999999,0.046131904,0.052429632000000004,-0.077338604,0.079017882,-0.00489884,-0.048724428,0.046311961,-0.019706778,0.021208222000000002,-0.049814638,-0.009367361,-0.04730212599999999,-0.0030473220000000003,0.030807462999999997,-0.005515154,0.017695534,-0.082753295,0.086844294,-0.136634853,-0.070096256,0.033694004,-0.021899400000000003,-0.023746545,-0.076824647

476,Recombination and Coronavirus Defective Interfering RNAs,"Abstract Naturally occurring defective interfering RNAs have been found in 4 of 14 coronavirus species. They range in size from 2.2 kb to approximately 25 kb, or 80% of the 30-kb parent virus genome. The large DI RNAs do not in all cases appear to require helper virus for intracellular replication and it has been postulated that they may on their own function as agents of disease. Coronavirus DI RNAs appear to arise by internal deletions (through nonhomologous recombination events) on the virus genome or on DI RNAs of larger size by a polymerase strand-switching (copy-choice) mechanism. In addition to their use in the study of virus RNA replication and virus assembly, coronavirus DI RNAs are being used in a major way to study the mechanism of a high-frequency, site-specific RNA recombination event that leads to leader acquisition during virus replication (i.e., the leader fusion event that occurs during synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs, and the leader-switching event that can occur during DI RNA replication), a distinguishing feature of coronaviruses (and arteriviruses).

478,Visual detection of Flavivirus RNA in living cells,"Abstract Flaviviruses include a wide range of important human pathogens delivered by insects or ticks. These viruses have a positive-stranded RNA genome that is replicated in the cytoplasm of the infected cell. The viral RNA genome is the template for transcription by the virally encoded RNA polymerase and for translation of the viral proteins. Furthermore, the double-stranded RNA intermediates of viral replication are believed to trigger the innate immune response through interaction with cytoplasmic cellular sensors. Therefore, understanding the subcellular distribution and dynamics of Flavivirus RNAs is of paramount importance to understand the interaction of the virus with its cellular host, which could be of insect, tick or mammalian, including human, origin. Recent advances on the visualization of Flavivirus RNA in living cells together with the development of methods to measure the dynamic properties of viral RNA are reviewed and discussed in this essay. In particular the application of bleaching techniques such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) are analysed in the context of tick-borne encephalitis virus replication.

494,"Visualization of protein sequence space with force-directed graphs, and their application to the choice of target-template pairs for homology modelling","Abstract The protein sequence-structure gap results from the contrast between rapid, low-cost deep sequencing, and slow, expensive experimental structure determination techniques. Comparative homology modelling may have the potential to close this gap by predicting protein structure in target sequences using existing experimentally solved structures as templates. This paper presents the first use of force-directed graphs for the visualization of sequence space in two dimensions, and applies them to the choice of suitable RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) target-template pairs within human-infective RNA virus genera. Measures of centrality in protein sequence space for each genus were also derived and used to identify centroid nearest-neighbour sequences (CNNs) potentially useful for production of homology models most representative of their genera. Homology modelling was then carried out for target-template pairs in different species, different genera and different families, and model quality assessed using several metrics. Reconstructed ancestral RdRP sequences for individual genera were also used as templates for the production of ancestral RdRP homology models. High quality ancestral RdRP models were consistently produced, as were good quality models for target-template pairs in the same genus.

528,The interaction of the SARS coronavirus non-structural protein 10 with the cellular oxido-reductase system causes an extensive cytopathic effect,"Abstract The pathological mechanism of SARS-CoV infection was investigated. The gene for the SARS-CoV non-structural protein 10, which is located in the open reading frame of pp1a/pp1ab gene, was synthesized and used to screen for the specific cellular gene coding for the protein interacting with this nsp10 protein in a human embryo lung cDNA library using a yeast trap method. The results indicated that apart from the two subunits of cellular RNA polymerase complex, BTF3 and ATF5, this nsp10 protein was also able to interact specifically with the NADH 4L subunit and cytochrome oxidase II. Further study revealed that the activity of the NADH-cytochrome was altered and the inner mitochondrial membrane was depolarized in the transfected human embryo lung fibroblast by the nsp10 protein gene. The cytopathic effect of the Coronavirus 229E strain appeared more extensive in these cells than in the control cells.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.153107382,0.142526349,-0.10518359099999999,-0.038454396,-0.009490543,0.001043111,-0.08830630199999999,-0.10952217800000001,0.07841772,-0.054387196,-0.10333120800000001,-0.03193797,0.036057236,0.027195931,-0.039706429,-0.06339767,0.052916963,-0.057067562999999995,0.027138207,0.033420939,0.008441324,0.025786977000000003,0.056249254000000005,0.012230698,0.019483366000000002,0.040801872999999995,-0.012508347,-0.005735775,-0.045883018,0.034898328
576,Biased mutational pattern and quasispecies hypothesis in H5N1 virus,"Abstract Like other RNA viruses, influenza viruses are subject to high mutation rates. Carrying segmented RNA genomes, their genetic variability is even higher. We aimed at analyzing the mutational events occurring during the infection of chickens by the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus. We therefore studied the different sequences of two surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), as well as two internal proteins, PB2 and NS. Three organs (lung, spleen, brain) were obtained from a chicken, experimentally infected with a lethal dose of HPAI H5N1 virus. Cloning these PCR fragments enabled us to investigate the mutations undergone by the virus after several replicative cycles. The first outcome is the presence of a strong mutational bias, resembling host-driven ADAR1 adenosine deamination, which is responsible for 81% of all mutations. Whereas the frequency of RNA dependent RNA polymerase-related mutations is compatible with the survival of the virus, the ADAR1-like activity usually strongly increases the mutation frequency into a level of “error catastrophe” in theory incompatible with virus survival. Nevertheless, the virus was successfully infective. HPAI H5N1 virus displayed traits in agreement with the quasispecies theory. The role of this quasispecies structure in successful infection and the superposition with the ADAR1-like response is discussed.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.09578249300000001,-0.076540579,-0.031823876,0.11640067300000001,0.018952196,0.13067641800000002,-0.018726087,0.003398065,-0.02794772,0.032875174,0.049059961,-0.027431721000000003,0.001236168,0.02540043,0.018051354,0.021528804,-0.00712026,-0.036271012000000005,-0.027347826000000002,0.031005835,0.036355151,-0.021572196000000002,-0.008017330999999999,0.056638945,-0.06779264,-0.005615146999999999,0.014868331,-0.027138901,-0.061679875999999995,-0.038948417
607,The European race of Gremmeniella abietina hosts a single species of Gammapartitivirus showing a global distribution and possible recombinant events in its history,"Abstract The population genetics of the family Partitiviridae was studied within the European race of the conifer pathogen Gremmeniella abietina. One hundred sixty-two isolates were collected from different countries, including Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, Montenegro, Serbia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States. A unique species of G. abietina RNA virus–MS1 (GaRV-MS1) appears to occur indistinctly in G. abietina biotypes A and B, without a particular geographical distribution pattern. Forty-six isolates were shown to host GaRV-MS1 according to direct specific RT-PCR screening, and the virus was more common in biotype A than B. Phylogenetic analysis based on 46 partial coat protein (CP) cDNA sequences divided the GaRV-MS1 population into two closely related clades, while RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequences revealed only one clade. The evolution of the virus appears to mainly occur through purifying selection but also through recombination. Recombination events were detected within alignments of the three complete CP and RdRp sequences of GaRV-MS1. This is the first time that recombination events have been directly identified in fungal partitiviruses and in G. abietina in particular. The results suggest that the population dynamics of GaRV-MS1 do not have a direct impact on the genetic structure of its host, G. abietina, though they might have had an innocuous ancestral relationship.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.128205724,-0.021972709,-0.002566308,0.041642913999999996,0.12168615099999999,0.002903019,0.043487684000000006,0.028913105,-0.050765141,0.053914357,0.058868065,0.041051818999999996,-0.03153526,-0.02556952,-0.0052173390000000005,0.004381316,-0.016307323999999998,-0.001848424,-0.062792464,-0.034708984,0.078688753,-0.017601182,-0.002849871,0.03477984,-0.055823409000000004,0.0038221170000000003,0.08647657199999999,0.009227924,-0.012135221000000002,0.031854066
609,Inhibition of viral RNA polymerases by nucleoside and nucleotide analogs: therapeutic applications against positive-strand RNA viruses beyond hepatitis C virus,"A number of important human infections are caused by positive-strand RNA viruses, yet almost none can be treated with small molecule antiviral therapeutics. One exception is the chronic infection caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV), against which new generations of potent inhibitors are being developed. One of the main molecular targets for anti-HCV drugs is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, NS5B. This review summarizes the search for nucleoside and nucleotide analogs that inhibit HCV NS5B, which led to the FDA approval of sofosbuvir in 2013. Advances in anti-HCV therapeutics have also stimulated efforts to develop nucleoside analogs against other positive-strand RNA viruses. Although it remains to be validated in the clinic, the prospect of using nucleoside analogs to treat acute infections caused by RNA viruses represents an important paradigm shift and a new frontier for future antiviral therapies.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.120409515,-0.050708105,-0.067833573,0.107896405,-0.098298737,0.014466545,0.10709552800000001,0.027620824,0.022445218,0.08515622199999999,0.056550485,0.085399556,0.060390349,0.027585163,0.025155061,-0.051706392000000004,-0.008792295,0.309051476,0.30428370600000004,-0.083899851,-0.071228522,0.004769198,0.015190041999999999,0.10145131,-0.044485365,-0.087192496,-0.04867461,0.021188087,0.029505046,-0.065138929
615,Rapid Recovery of Classical Swine Fever Virus Directly from Cloned cDNA,"Abstract The reverse genetics for classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is currently based on the transfection of in vitro transcribed RNA from a viral genomic cDNA clone, which is inefficient and time-consuming. This study was aimed to develop an improved method for rapid recovery of CSFV directly from cloned cDNA. Full-length genomic cDNA from the CSFV Shimen strain, which was flanked by a T7 promoter, the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme and T7 terminator sequences, was cloned into the low-copy vector pOK12, producing pOKShimen-RzTΦ. Direct transfection of pOKShimen-RzTΦ into PK/T7 cells, a PK-15-derived cell line stably expressing bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase, allowed CSFV to be rescued rapidly and efficiently, i.e., at least 12 h faster and 31.6-fold greater viral titer when compared with the in vitro transcription-based rescue system. Furthermore, the progeny virus rescued from PK/T7 cells was indistinguishable, both in vitro and in vivo, from its parent virus and the virus rescued from classical reverse genetics. The reverse genetics based on intracellular transcription is efficient, convenient and cost-effective. The PK/T7 cell line can be used to rescue CSFV directly from cloned cDNA and it can also be used as an intracellular transcription and expression system for studying the structure and function of viral genes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.112169357,-0.036590388,0.033539396,0.007259006,-0.03683193,-0.007709181999999999,-0.056626780999999994,-0.018916206,0.026553276,0.007624559,-0.026759718,-0.069366842,0.019385393,0.038671421,0.061884337000000005,0.028087805,-0.04493768,0.005084696,-0.017274054,0.002335361,-0.008254249,-0.012943485,0.04947857,0.001184532,-0.019431722,0.01835707,0.025347421000000002,0.0010093510000000001,-0.047825307000000004,0.050306374
648,"In the pipeline Derek Lowe's commentary on drug discovery and the pharma industry. An editorially independent blog from the publishers of Science Translational Medicine. All content is Derek’s own, and he does not in any way speak for his employer","Let’s take inventory on the therapies that are being developed for the coronavirus epidemic. Here is a very thorough list of at Biocentury, and I should note that (like Stat and several other organizations) they’re making all their Covid-19 content free to all readers during this crisis. I’d like to zoom in today on the potential small-molecule therapies, since some of these have the most immediate prospects for use in the real world. The ones at the front of the line are repurposed drugs that are already approved for human use, for a lot of obvious reasons. The Biocentury list doesn’t cover these, but here’s an article at Nature Biotechnology that goes into detail. Clinical trials are a huge time sink – they sort of have to be, in most cases, if they’re going to be any good – and if you’ve already done all that stuff it’s a huge leg up, even if the drug itself is not exactly a perfect fit for the disease. So what do we have? The compound that is most advanced is probably remdesivir from Gilead, at right. This has been in development for a few years as an RNA virus therapy – it was originally developed for Ebola, and has been tried out against a whole list of single-strand RNA viruses. That includes the related coronaviruses SARS and MERS, so Covid-19 was an obvious fit. The compound is a prodrug – that phosphoramide gets cleaved off completely, leaving the active 5-OH compound GS-44-1524. It mechanism of action is to get incorporated into viral RNA, since it’s taken up by RNA polymerase and it largely seems to evade proofreading. This causes RNA termination trouble later on, since that alpha-nitrile C-nucleoside is not exactly what the virus is expecting in its genome at that point, and thus viral replication is inhibited.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.09773256400000001,0.05267896,-0.07510587,0.08654090099999999,-0.056515964,0.003428451,0.03514034,0.041474082999999995,0.0060340440000000006,0.032495865,0.05485939099999999,0.007568453,0.018571927,-0.007928883000000001,0.019296781000000002,0.018446356,-0.043024106,0.08927394,0.034246378,0.020701235,-0.038004473,0.054200825,-0.094197062,-0.010102299,-0.017319504,0.012718436999999999,0.056994249000000004,0.000550294,0.046982394000000004,-0.018686375
653,"Replicative homeostasis II: Influence of polymerase fidelity on RNA virus quasispecies biology: Implications for immune recognition, viral autoimmunity and other ""virus receptor"" diseases","Much of the worlds' population is in active or imminent danger from established infectious pathogens, while sporadic and pandemic infections by these and emerging agents threaten everyone. RNA polymerases (RNA(pol)) generate enormous genetic and consequent antigenic heterogeneity permitting both viruses and cellular pathogens to evade host defences. Thus, RNA(pol )causes more morbidity and premature mortality than any other molecule. The extraordinary genetic heterogeneity defining viral quasispecies results from RNA(pol )infidelity causing rapid cumulative genomic RNA mutation a process that, if uncontrolled, would cause catastrophic loss of sequence integrity and inexorable quasispecies extinction. Selective replication and replicative homeostasis, an epicyclical regulatory mechanism dynamically linking RNApol fidelity and processivity with quasispecies phenotypic diversity, modulating polymerase fidelity and, hence, controlling quasispecies behaviour, prevents this happening and also mediates immune escape. Perhaps more importantly, ineluctable generation of broad phenotypic diversity after viral RNA is translated to protein quasispecies suggests a mechanism of disease that specifically targets, and functionally disrupts, the host cell surface molecules – including hormone, lipid, cell signalling or neurotransmitter receptors – that viruses co-opt for cell entry. This mechanism – ""Viral Receptor Disease (VRD)"" – may explain so-called ""viral autoimmunity"", some classical autoimmune disorders and other diseases, including type II diabetes mellitus, and some forms of obesity. Viral receptor disease is a unifying hypothesis that may also explain some diseases with well-established, but multi-factorial and apparently unrelated aetiologies – like coronary artery and other vascular diseases – in addition to diseases like schizophrenia that are poorly understood and lack plausible, coherent, pathogenic explanations.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14328481199999998,-0.061286185,-0.04774239,0.07036184,-0.049494664,0.014543775,0.09086698800000001,0.018285227,-0.013442843999999999,0.089109505,0.0398864,-0.023789533999999998,0.029949721000000002,0.02563038,0.015610695,0.00701417,-0.044853303,-0.032827299,-0.084989447,0.029399652999999998,0.029604026000000002,0.013498191000000001,-0.047917129,0.055770329,-0.044796504,-0.056593112,0.039261204,-0.033436722,-0.02108999,-0.063422764

662,Universal primers that amplify RNA from all three flavivirus subgroups,"BACKGROUND: Species within the Flavivirus genus pose public health problems around the world. Increasing cases of Dengue and Japanese encephalitis virus in Asia, frequent outbreaks of Yellow fever virus in Africa and South America, and the ongoing spread of West Nile virus throughout the Americas, show the geographical burden of flavivirus diseases. Flavivirus infections are often indistinct from and confused with other febrile illnesses. Here we review the specificity of published primers, and describe a new universal primer pair that can detect a wide range of flaviviruses, including viruses from each of the recognised subgroups. RESULTS: Bioinformatic analysis of 257 published full-length Flavivirus genomes revealed conserved regions not previously targeted by primers. Two degenerate primers, Flav100F and Flav200R were designed from these regions and used to generate an 800 base pair cDNA product. The region amplified encoded part of the methyltransferase and most of the RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (NS5) coding sequence. One-step RT-PCR testing was successful using standard conditions with RNA from over 60 different flavivirus strains representing about 50 species. The cDNA from each virus isolate was sequenced then used in phylogenetic analyses and database searches to confirm the identity of the template RNA.

664,Ubiquitination Is Required for Effective Replication of Coxsackievirus B3,"BACKGROUND: Protein ubiquitination and/or degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) have been recognized as critical mechanisms in the regulation of numerous essential cellular functions. The importance of the UPS in viral pathogenesis has become increasingly apparent. Using murine cardiomyocytes, we have previously demonstrated that the UPS plays a key role in the replication of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), an important human pathogen associated with various diseases. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we examined the interplay between the UPS and CVB3, focusing on the role of ubiquitination in viral lifecycle. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: As assessed by in situ hybridization, Western blot, and plaque assay, we showed that proteasome inhibition decreased CVB3 RNA replication, protein synthesis, and viral titers in HeLa cells. There were no apparent changes in 20S proteasome activities following CVB3 infection. However, we found viral infection led to an accumulation of protein-ubiquitin conjugates, accompanied by a decreased protein expression of free ubiquitin, implicating an important role of ubiquitination in the UPS-mediated viral replication. Using small-interfering RNA, we demonstrated that gene-silencing of ubiquitin significantly reduced viral titers, possibly through downregulation of protein ubiquitination and subsequent alteration of protein function and/or degradation. Inhibition of deubiquitinating enzymes apparently enhances the inhibitory effects of proteasome inhibitors on CVB3 replication. Finally, by immunoprecipitation, we showed that coxsackieviral polymerase 3D was post-translationally modified by ubiquitination and such modification might be a prerequisite for its function in transcriptional regulation of viral genome. CONCLUSION: Coxsackievirus infection promotes protein ubiquitination, contributing to effective viral replication, probably through ubiquitin modification of viral polymerase.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.13530346099999999,-0.063547511,-0.047054545999999996,-0.01507696,-0.11838732800000001,0.005806295,0.050214694000000004,-0.032007104,0.049969125,0.015743988,-0.021701312,-0.039948947,-0.005598403,0.087754845,-0.018238912,-0.031863552999999996,0.031960254,-0.048112087000000005,-0.021529633,0.050877869000000006,-0.024383826,0.056296558,-0.029801105,-0.020092726,0.037748366,0.033997723,0.013882755,-0.040273849,-0.020790317,0.042921747
671,An Amphipathic α-Helix Controls Multiple Roles of Brome Mosaic Virus Protein 1a in RNA Replication Complex Assembly and Function,"Brome mosaic virus (BMV) protein 1a has multiple key roles in viral RNA replication. 1a localizes to perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes as a peripheral membrane protein, induces ER membrane invaginations in which RNA replication complexes form, and recruits and stabilizes BMV 2a polymerase (2a(Pol)) and RNA replication templates at these sites to establish active replication complexes. During replication, 1a provides RNA capping, NTPase and possibly RNA helicase functions. Here we identify in BMV 1a an amphipathic α-helix, helix A, and use NMR analysis to define its structure and propensity to insert in hydrophobic membrane-mimicking micelles. We show that helix A is essential for efficient 1a–ER membrane association and normal perinuclear ER localization, and that deletion or mutation of helix A abolishes RNA replication. Strikingly, mutations in helix A give rise to two dramatically opposite 1a function phenotypes, implying that helix A acts as a molecular switch regulating the intricate balance between separable 1a functions. One class of helix A deletions and amino acid substitutions markedly inhibits 1a–membrane association and abolishes ER membrane invagination, viral RNA template recruitment, and replication, but doubles the 1a-mediated increase in 2a(Pol) accumulation. The second class of helix A mutations not only maintains efficient 1a–membrane association but also amplifies the number of 1a-induced membrane invaginations 5- to 8-fold and enhances viral RNA template recruitment, while failing to stimulate 2a(Pol) accumulation. The results provide new insights into the pathways of RNA replication complex assembly and show that helix A is critical for assembly and function of the viral RNA replication complex, including its central role in targeting replication components and controlling modes of 1a action.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.188062148,-0.062231197,-0.068191383,0.05329146,-0.083942856,-0.055166513,0.019215381,0.028217700000000002,-0.007640994,-0.005645799,0.04397938,0.012648433,-0.047842987999999996,0.06649451599999999,-0.011757155,0.031372483,0.029515617,-0.05692361,-0.001614631,0.026855296,-0.06575494900000001,0.035426794,-0.069363761,-0.085517886,0.023148909,-0.062425327,-0.079893367,0.007015306,-0.0511547,-0.029468462999999997
676,Reverse genetic characterization of the natural genomic deletion in SARS-Coronavirus strain Frankfurt-1 open reading frame 7b reveals an attenuating function of the 7b protein in-vitro and in-vivo,"During the outbreak of SARS in 2002/3, a prototype virus was isolated from a patient in Frankfurt/Germany (strain Frankfurt-1). As opposed to all other SARS-Coronavirus strains, Frankfurt-1 has a 45-nucleotide deletion in the transmembrane domain of its ORF 7b protein. When over-expressed in HEK 293 cells, the full-length protein but not the variant with the deletion caused interferon beta induction and cleavage of procaspase 3. To study the role of ORF 7b in the context of virus replication, we cloned a full genome cDNA copy of Frankfurt-1 in a bacterial artificial chromosome downstream of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Transfection of capped RNA transcribed from this construct yielded infectious virus that was indistinguishable from the original virus isolate. The presumed Frankfurt-1 ancestor with an intact ORF 7b was reconstructed. In CaCo-2 and HUH7 cells, but not in Vero cells, the variant carrying the ORF 7b deletion had a replicative advantage against the parental virus (4- and 6-fold increase of virus RNA in supernatant, respectively). This effect was neither associated with changes in the induction or secretion of type I interferon, nor with altered induction of apoptosis in cell culture. However, pretreatment of cells with interferon beta caused the deleted virus to replicate to higher titers than the parental strain (3.4-fold in Vero cells, 7.9-fold in CaCo-2 cells). In Syrian Golden Hamsters inoculated intranasally with 10e4 plaque forming units of either virus, mean titers of infectious virus and viral RNA in the lungs after 24 h were increased 23- and 94.8-fold, respectively, with the deleted virus. This difference could explain earlier observations of enhanced virulence of Frankfurt-1 in Hamsters as compared to other SARS-Coronavirus reference strains and identifies the SARS-CoV 7b protein as an attenuating factor with the SARS-Coronavirus genome. Because attenuation was focused on the early phase of infection in-vivo, ORF 7b might have contributed to the delayed accumulation of virus in patients that was suggested to have limited the spread of the SARS epidemic.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.125477597,0.119174523,-0.118145267,-0.016859052,-0.014872782,0.001212267,-0.119520709,-0.16114446,-0.012545253000000001,0.017014465,-0.029153633999999998,-0.064234532,0.020574516,0.028765449,0.050123307,-0.017302009,-0.006301308,-0.018150433,0.033506617999999995,0.078641536,0.028671804,0.000922101,0.039021731000000004,0.03731546,-0.015769959,0.033208059,0.036482146,-0.014014368999999999,-0.119569064,0.015849495
691,Zn(2+) Inhibits Coronavirus and Arterivirus RNA Polymerase Activity In Vitro and Zinc Ionophores Block the Replication of These Viruses in Cell Culture,"Increasing the intracellular Zn(2+) concentration with zinc-ionophores like pyrithione (PT) can efficiently impair the replication of a variety of RNA viruses, including poliovirus and influenza virus. For some viruses this effect has been attributed to interference with viral polyprotein processing. In this study we demonstrate that the combination of Zn(2+) and PT at low concentrations (2 µM Zn(2+) and 2 µM PT) inhibits the replication of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and equine arteritis virus (EAV) in cell culture. The RNA synthesis of these two distantly related nidoviruses is catalyzed by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is the core enzyme of their multiprotein replication and transcription complex (RTC). Using an activity assay for RTCs isolated from cells infected with SARS-CoV or EAV—thus eliminating the need for PT to transport Zn(2+) across the plasma membrane—we show that Zn(2+) efficiently inhibits the RNA-synthesizing activity of the RTCs of both viruses. Enzymatic studies using recombinant RdRps (SARS-CoV nsp12 and EAV nsp9) purified from E. coli subsequently revealed that Zn(2+) directly inhibited the in vitro activity of both nidovirus polymerases. More specifically, Zn(2+) was found to block the initiation step of EAV RNA synthesis, whereas in the case of the SARS-CoV RdRp elongation was inhibited and template binding reduced. By chelating Zn(2+) with MgEDTA, the inhibitory effect of the divalent cation could be reversed, which provides a novel experimental tool for in vitro studies of the molecular details of nidovirus replication and transcription.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.149638985,0.151756661,-0.14515103199999999,0.10753341599999999,-0.070914184,-0.005815926,0.004155757,-0.077937206,-0.024897883,-0.00361311,0.057591327000000005,0.035058222,-0.046896682,0.01356441,-0.002860652,0.010642032,0.029278243,-0.048456899000000005,0.019452359,-0.006855644,-0.008789308000000001,0.011404224,0.046249440999999995,-0.022494495,0.012643193,0.020729725,-0.043729940999999994,0.024716461000000002,-0.016791373000000002,0.008453598
700,StralSV: assessment of sequence variability within similar 3D structures and application to polio RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,"BACKGROUND: Most of the currently used methods for protein function prediction rely on sequence-based comparisons between a query protein and those for which a functional annotation is provided. A serious limitation of sequence similarity-based approaches for identifying residue conservation among proteins is the low confidence in assigning residue-residue correspondences among proteins when the level of sequence identity between the compared proteins is poor. Multiple sequence alignment methods are more satisfactory--still, they cannot provide reliable results at low levels of sequence identity. Our goal in the current work was to develop an algorithm that could help overcome these difficulties by facilitating the identification of structurally (and possibly functionally) relevant residue-residue correspondences between compared protein structures. RESULTS: Here we present StralSV (structure-alignment sequence variability), a new algorithm for detecting closely related structure fragments and quantifying residue frequency from tight local structure alignments. We apply StralSV in a study of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of poliovirus, and we demonstrate that the algorithm can be used to determine regions of the protein that are relatively unique, or that share structural similarity with proteins that would be considered distantly related. By quantifying residue frequencies among many residue-residue pairs extracted from local structural alignments, one can infer potential structural or functional importance of specific residues that are determined to be highly conserved or that deviate from a consensus. We further demonstrate that considerable detailed structural and phylogenetic information can be derived from StralSV analyses. CONCLUSIONS: StralSV is a new structure-based algorithm for identifying and aligning structure fragments that have similarity to a reference protein. StralSV analysis can be used to quantify residue-residue correspondences and identify residues that may be of particular structural or functional importance, as well as unusual or unexpected residues at a given sequence position.

710,Multifaceted Regulation of Translational Readthrough by RNA Replication Elements in a Tombusvirus,"Translational readthrough of stop codons by ribosomes is a recoding event used by a variety of viruses, including plus-strand RNA tombusviruses. Translation of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in tombusviruses is mediated using this strategy and we have investigated this process using a variety of in vitro and in vivo approaches. Our results indicate that readthrough generating the RdRp requires a novel long-range RNA-RNA interaction, spanning a distance of ∼3.5 kb, which occurs between a large RNA stem-loop located 3'-proximal to the stop codon and an RNA replication structure termed RIV at the 3'-end of the viral genome. Interestingly, this long-distance RNA-RNA interaction is modulated by mutually-exclusive RNA structures in RIV that represent a type of RNA switch. Moreover, a different long-range RNA-RNA interaction that was previously shown to be necessary for viral RNA replicase assembly was also required for efficient readthrough production of the RdRp. Accordingly, multiple replication-associated RNA elements are involved in modulating the readthrough event in tombusviruses and we propose an integrated mechanistic model to describe how this regulatory network could be advantageous by (i) providing a quality control system for culling truncated viral genomes at an early stage in the replication process, (ii) mediating cis-preferential replication of viral genomes, and (iii) coordinating translational readthrough of the RdRp with viral genome replication. Based on comparative sequence analysis and experimental data, basic elements of this regulatory model extend to other members of Tombusviridae, as well as to viruses outside of this family.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.28338577800000003,-0.067863022,-0.11040745699999999,0.197201252,-0.024463045,-0.146827368,0.015314246,0.072751331,-0.09790443199999999,0.047114569,0.102250861,0.029804812000000003,-0.044902784,0.014560455,-0.010798506999999999,0.017819666,-0.002474415,-0.03507485,-0.04506635,-0.032339235,-0.037922303,0.011613554,-0.074267896,-0.040595524,-0.08652575800000001,-0.11311584699999999,0.009059272,0.02942724,0.050853202,0.004954539
711,Synergistic Roles of Eukaryotic Translation Elongation Factors 1Bγ and 1A in Stimulation of Tombusvirus Minus-Strand Synthesis,"Host factors are recruited into viral replicase complexes to aid replication of plus-strand RNA viruses. In this paper, we show that deletion of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1Bgamma (eEF1Bγ) reduces Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) replication in yeast host. Also, knock down of eEF1Bγ level in plant host decreases TBSV accumulation. eEF1Bγ binds to the viral RNA and is one of the resident host proteins in the tombusvirus replicase complex. Additional in vitro assays with whole cell extracts prepared from yeast strains lacking eEF1Bγ demonstrated its role in minus-strand synthesis by opening of the structured 3′ end of the viral RNA and reducing the possibility of re-utilization of (+)-strand templates for repeated (-)-strand synthesis within the replicase. We also show that eEF1Bγ plays a synergistic role with eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A in tombusvirus replication, possibly via stimulation of the proper positioning of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase over the promoter region in the viral RNA template.These roles for translation factors during TBSV replication are separate from their canonical roles in host and viral protein translation.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.250287109,-0.097024145,-0.10586377699999999,0.136225724,-0.088537899,-0.083303821,0.030078836,0.030283314,-0.02934099,0.033098156000000004,0.03534049,-0.04798319400000001,-0.009438929,0.125701535,-0.013615105,0.02488078,0.025107785,-0.068707475,-0.007081136,0.06706618,-0.10031427,0.104264693,-0.11285888300000001,-0.069074629,-0.015649193,-0.12155181,-0.032812799,-0.024408149,0.002783537,0.047547562
738,An Upstream Open Reading Frame Modulates Ebola Virus Polymerase Translation and Virus Replication,"Ebolaviruses, highly lethal zoonotic pathogens, possess longer genomes than most other non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses due in part to long 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) present in the seven viral transcriptional units. To date, specific functions have not been assigned to these UTRs. With reporter assays, we demonstrated that the Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) 5′-UTRs lack internal ribosomal entry site function. However, the 5′-UTRs do differentially regulate cap-dependent translation when placed upstream of a GFP reporter gene. Most dramatically, the 5′-UTR derived from the viral polymerase (L) mRNA strongly suppressed translation of GFP compared to a β-actin 5′-UTR. The L 5′-UTR is one of four viral genes to possess upstream AUGs (uAUGs), and ablation of each uAUG enhanced translation of the primary ORF (pORF), most dramatically in the case of the L 5′-UTR. The L uAUG was sufficient to initiate translation, is surrounded by a “weak” Kozak sequence and suppressed pORF translation in a position-dependent manner. Under conditions where eIF2α was phosphorylated, the presence of the uORF maintained translation of the L pORF, indicating that the uORF modulates L translation in response to cellular stress. To directly address the role of the L uAUG in virus replication, a recombinant EBOV was generated in which the L uAUG was mutated to UCG. Strikingly, mutating two nucleotides outside of previously-defined protein coding and cis-acting regulatory sequences attenuated virus growth to titers 10–100-fold lower than a wild-type virus in Vero and A549 cells. The mutant virus also exhibited decreased viral RNA synthesis as early as 6 hours post-infection and enhanced sensitivity to the stress inducer thapsigargin. Cumulatively, these data identify novel mechanisms by which EBOV regulates its polymerase expression, demonstrate their relevance to virus replication and identify a potential therapeutic target.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.149407812,-0.067663155,-0.032406236,0.007337581,-0.043383991,-0.013982405,-0.0317964,0.006595178,0.012835068,-0.0032224090000000003,-0.056241227000000005,-0.070941463,0.013298748,0.032037448999999996,-0.02064705,-0.024459171000000002,0.011589663,-0.047862365999999996,-0.029721864,0.024838392999999997,-0.010625703,0.036595335,-0.020310912,0.036211278,-0.014634091,-0.070036347,0.012979667,0.007146849,0.05160126,0.005077469
748,"Comprehensive analysis of the HEPN superfamily: identification of novel roles in intra-genomic conflicts, defense, pathogenesis and RNA processing","BACKGROUND: The major role of enzymatic toxins that target nucleic acids in biological conflicts at all levels has become increasingly apparent thanks in large part to the advances of comparative genomics. Typically, toxins evolve rapidly hampering the identification of these proteins by sequence analysis. Here we analyze an unexpectedly widespread superfamily of toxin domains most of which possess RNase activity. RESULTS: The HEPN superfamily is comprised of all α-helical domains that were first identified as being associated with DNA polymerase β-type nucleotidyltransferases in prokaryotes and animal Sacsin proteins. Using sensitive sequence and structure comparison methods, we vastly extend the HEPN superfamily by identifying numerous novel families and by detecting diverged HEPN domains in several known protein families. The new HEPN families include the RNase LS and LsoA catalytic domains, KEN domains (e.g. RNaseL and Ire1) and the RNase domains of RloC and PrrC. The majority of HEPN domains contain conserved motifs that constitute a metal-independent endoRNase active site. Some HEPN domains lacking this motif probably function as non-catalytic RNA-binding domains, such as in the case of the mannitol repressor MtlR. Our analysis shows that HEPN domains function as toxins that are shared by numerous systems implicated in intra-genomic, inter-genomic and intra-organismal conflicts across the three domains of cellular life. In prokaryotes HEPN domains are essential components of numerous toxin-antitoxin (TA) and abortive infection (Abi) systems and in addition are tightly associated with many restriction-modification (R-M) and CRISPR-Cas systems, and occasionally with other defense systems such as Pgl and Ter. We present evidence of multiple modes of action of HEPN domains in these systems, which include direct attack on viral RNAs (e.g. LsoA and RNase LS) in conjunction with other RNase domains (e.g. a novel RNase H fold domain, NamA), suicidal or dormancy-inducing attack on self RNAs (RM systems and possibly CRISPR-Cas systems), and suicidal attack coupled with direct interaction with phage components (Abi systems). These findings are compatible with the hypothesis on coupling of pathogen-targeting (immunity) and self-directed (programmed cell death and dormancy induction) responses in the evolution of robust antiviral strategies. We propose that altruistic cell suicide mediated by HEPN domains and other functionally similar RNases was essential for the evolution of kin and group selection and cell cooperation. HEPN domains were repeatedly acquired by eukaryotes and incorporated into several core functions such as endonucleolytic processing of the 5.8S-25S/28S rRNA precursor (Las1), a novel ER membrane-associated RNA degradation system (C6orf70), sensing of unprocessed transcripts at the nuclear periphery (Swt1). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that, similar to prokaryotes, HEPN proteins were recruited to antiviral, antitransposon, apoptotic systems or RNA-level response to unfolded proteins (Sacsin and KEN domains) in several groups of eukaryotes. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive sequence and structure comparisons reveal unexpectedly broad presence of the HEPN domain in an enormous variety of defense and stress response systems across the tree of life. In addition, HEPN domains have been recruited to perform essential functions, in particular in eukaryotic rRNA processing. These findings are expected to stimulate experiments that could shed light on diverse cellular processes across the three domains of life.

754,Efficient generation of recombinant RNA viruses using targeted recombination-mediated mutagenesis of bacterial artificial chromosomes containing full-length cDNA,"BACKGROUND: Infectious cDNA clones are a prerequisite for directed genetic manipulation of RNA viruses. Here, a strategy to facilitate manipulation and rescue of classical swine fever viruses (CSFVs) from full-length cDNAs present within bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) is described. This strategy allows manipulation of viral cDNA by targeted recombination-mediated mutagenesis within bacteria. RESULTS: A new CSFV-BAC (pBeloR26) derived from the Riems vaccine strain has been constructed and subsequently modified in the E2 coding sequence, using the targeted recombination strategy to enable rescue of chimeric pestiviruses (vR26_E2gif and vR26_TAV) with potential as new marker vaccine candidates. Sequencing of the BACs revealed a high genetic stability during passages within bacteria. The complete genome sequences of rescued viruses, after extensive passages in mammalian cells showed that modifications in the E2 protein coding sequence were stably maintained. A single amino acid substitution (D3431G) in the RNA dependent RNA polymerase was observed in the rescued viruses vR26_E2gif and vR26, which was reversion to the parental Riems sequence. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that targeted recombination-mediated mutagenesis provides a powerful tool for expediting the construction of novel RNA genomes and should be applicable to the manipulation of other RNA viruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14855347,-0.055238817999999995,-0.009640272,0.048865377,0.07100885700000001,-0.022824574,-0.033356727,0.025311046,-0.042499407,0.066579049,0.009719006,-0.006704897,0.022046601000000002,-0.04176578,0.030595027,-0.018847408,-0.061272899000000006,-0.014803385,-0.039641424,0.014152663000000001,0.028999069,-0.006756268,0.017470675,0.06826510200000001,-0.067208919,0.0025808989999999998,0.058509878,1.7899999999999998e-05,-0.07303792099999999,0.001626676
757,Cell Tropism Predicts Long-term Nucleotide Substitution Rates of Mammalian RNA Viruses,"The high rates of RNA virus evolution are generally attributed to replication with error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. However, these long-term nucleotide substitution rates span three orders of magnitude and do not correlate well with mutation rates or selection pressures. This substitution rate variation may be explained by differences in virus ecology or intrinsic genomic properties. We generated nucleotide substitution rate estimates for mammalian RNA viruses and compiled comparable published rates, yielding a dataset of 118 substitution rates of structural genes from 51 different species, as well as 40 rates of non-structural genes from 28 species. Through ANCOVA analyses, we evaluated the relationships between these rates and four ecological factors: target cell, transmission route, host range, infection duration; and three genomic properties: genome length, genome sense, genome segmentation. Of these seven factors, we found target cells to be the only significant predictors of viral substitution rates, with tropisms for epithelial cells or neurons (P<0.0001) as the most significant predictors. Further, one-tailed t-tests showed that viruses primarily infecting epithelial cells evolve significantly faster than neurotropic viruses (P<0.0001 and P<0.001 for the structural genes and non-structural genes, respectively). These results provide strong evidence that the fastest evolving mammalian RNA viruses infect cells with the highest turnover rates: the highly proliferative epithelial cells. Estimated viral generation times suggest that epithelial-infecting viruses replicate more quickly than viruses with different cell tropisms. Our results indicate that cell tropism is a key factor in viral evolvability.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.129452342,-0.065603437,-0.058296872,0.046995235,0.010018612,0.013116593999999999,0.067548523,0.005444862,-0.033424752,0.043161158,0.00748581,-0.043219654,-0.000544687,0.05969837099999999,0.031035056000000002,0.007547605,-0.044793234,-0.074270374,-0.028732806,0.004158409,0.038160251,-0.011640596000000001,-0.014409587,0.097327636,-0.12194634900000001,-0.024399486,0.077145668,-0.00877635,-0.078632229,-0.06722293
758,Alphavirus Mutator Variants Present Host-Specific Defects and Attenuation in Mammalian and Insect Models,"Arboviruses cycle through both vertebrates and invertebrates, which requires them to adapt to disparate hosts while maintaining genetic integrity during genome replication. To study the genetic mechanisms and determinants of these processes, we use chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a re-emerging human pathogen transmitted by the Aedes mosquito. We previously isolated a high fidelity (or antimutator) polymerase variant, C483Y, which had decreased fitness in both mammalian and mosquito hosts, suggesting this residue may be a key molecular determinant. To further investigate effects of position 483 on RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) fidelity, we substituted every amino acid at this position. We isolated novel mutators with decreased replication fidelity and higher mutation frequencies, allowing us to examine the fitness of error-prone arbovirus variants. Although CHIKV mutators displayed no major replication defects in mammalian cell culture, they had reduced specific infectivity and were attenuated in vivo. Unexpectedly, mutator phenotypes were suppressed in mosquito cells and the variants exhibited significant defects in RNA synthesis. Consequently, these replication defects resulted in strong selection for reversion during infection of mosquitoes. Since residue 483 is conserved among alphaviruses, we examined the analogous mutations in Sindbis virus (SINV), which also reduced polymerase fidelity and generated replication defects in mosquito cells. However, replication defects were mosquito cell-specific and were not observed in Drosophila S2 cells, allowing us to evaluate the potential attenuation of mutators in insect models where pressure for reversion was absent. Indeed, the SINV mutator variant was attenuated in fruit flies. These findings confirm that residue 483 is a determinant regulating alphavirus polymerase fidelity and demonstrate proof of principle that arboviruses can be attenuated in mammalian and insect hosts by reducing fidelity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.157542504,-0.052924843,-0.04503681599999999,0.026260747,-0.056179335,0.025127952000000002,0.081344992,0.000734506,-0.016190438999999997,0.051477929000000006,0.079977057,0.06067267900000001,-0.07730095599999999,0.014561082,0.009425896,0.034954245,-0.04323932900000001,-0.052739203,-0.085823913,0.001946043,0.119833675,-0.072041019,0.067051476,0.06395569200000001,-0.046069869000000006,0.07187292099999999,0.025366005,-0.038161626000000004,-0.113843457,-0.10091022699999999
778,The 3′-Terminal 55 Nucleotides of Bovine Coronavirus Defective Interfering RNA Harbor Cis-Acting Elements Required for Both Negative- and Positive-Strand RNA Synthesis,"The synthesis of the negative-strand [(−)-strand] complement of the ∼30 kilobase, positive-strand [(+)-strand] coronaviral genome is a necessary early step for genome replication. The identification of cis-acting elements required for (−)-strand RNA synthesis in coronaviruses, however, has been hampered due to insufficiencies in the techniques used to detect the (−)-strand RNA species. Here, we employed a method of head-to-tail ligation and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to detect and quantitate the synthesis of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) defective interfering (DI) RNA (−) strands. Furthermore, using the aforementioned techniques along with Northern blot assay, we specifically defined the cis-acting RNA elements within the 3′-terminal 55 nucleotides (nts) which function in the synthesis of (−)- or (+)-strand BCoV DI RNA. The major findings are as follows: (i) nts from -5 to -39 within the 3′-terminal 55 nts are the cis-acting elements responsible for (−)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis, (ii) nts from −3 to −34 within the 3′-terminal 55 nts are cis-acting elements required for (+)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis, and (iii) the nucleotide species at the 3′-most position (−1) is important, but not critical, for both (−)- and (+)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis. These results demonstrate that the 3′-terminal 55 nts in BCoV DI RNA harbor cis-acting RNA elements required for both (−)- and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis and extend our knowledge on the mechanisms of coronavirus replication. The method of head-to-tail ligation and qRT-PCR employed in the study may also be applied to identify other cis-acting elements required for (−)-strand RNA synthesis in coronaviruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.200376146,-0.04116611,-0.022883953,0.113235998,0.006269548000000001,-0.16838866,-0.09390232,0.08217945900000001,-0.07937419999999999,-0.05164758,0.067164707,-0.040189595,-8.65e-06,0.045114314,0.11886708800000001,0.161493366,-0.113151465,0.07159914,0.020566683,-0.06650724400000001,-0.01553134,0.003917298,-0.0018514389999999999,-0.090611991,0.030197176000000003,-0.040324279,-0.070648049,0.006301694,0.126834707,-0.009517732
779,A highly conserved WDYPKCDRA epitope in the RNA directed RNA polymerase of human coronaviruses can be used as epitope-based universal vaccine design,"BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses are the diverse group of RNA virus. From 1960, six strains of human coronaviruses have emerged that includes SARS-CoV and the recent infection by deadly MERS-CoV which is now going to cause another outbreak. Prevention of these viruses is urgent and a universal vaccine for all strain could be a promising solution in this circumstance. In this study we aimed to design an epitope based vaccine against all strain of human coronavirus. RESULTS: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) approach was employed among spike (S), membrane (M), enveloped (E) and nucleocapsid (N) protein and replicase polyprotein 1ab to identify which one is highly conserve in all coronaviruses strains. Next, we use various in silico tools to predict consensus immunogenic and conserved peptide. We found that conserved region is present only in the RNA directed RNA polymerase protein. In this protein we identified one epitope WDYPKCDRA is highly immunogenic and 100% conserved among all available human coronavirus strains. CONCLUSIONS: Here we suggest in vivo study of our identified novel peptide antigen in RNA directed RNA polymerase protein for universal vaccine – which may be the way to prevent all human coronavirus disease.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.135863299,0.130610674,-0.10781760900000001,0.051599607,0.122398874,0.007628296,-0.03630526,0.020573048,0.076111012,0.034026024,0.00620944,0.037326312,0.034074522999999995,-0.055259627,-0.031299544,-0.092647912,0.022026656000000002,-0.005707762,0.007009373,0.06941608,0.026324566,0.03343481,0.002432239,0.047598985999999996,0.06239923,0.010974468999999999,0.009578696999999999,-0.000548791,-0.04730300900000001,0.054829382999999995
802,Cytoplasmic Translocation of Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein and Its Binding to Viral RNA during Japanese Encephalitis Virus Infection Inhibits Virus Replication,"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome containing a single open reading frame flanked by the 5′- and 3′-non-coding regions (NCRs). The virus genome replicates via a negative-sense RNA intermediate. The NCRs and their complementary sequences in the negative-sense RNA are the sites for assembly of the RNA replicase complex thereby regulating the RNA synthesis and virus replication. In this study, we show that the 55-kDa polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) interacts in vitro with both the 5′-NCR of the positive-sense genomic RNA - 5NCR(+), and its complementary sequence in the negative-sense replication intermediate RNA - 3NCR(-). The interaction of viral RNA with PTB was validated in infected cells by JEV RNA co-immunoprecipitation and JEV RNA-PTB colocalization experiments. Interestingly, we observed phosphorylation-coupled translocation of nuclear PTB to cytoplasmic foci that co-localized with JEV RNA early during JEV infection. Our studies employing the PTB silencing and over-expression in cultured cells established an inhibitory role of PTB in JEV replication. Using RNA-protein binding assay we show that PTB competitively inhibits association of JEV 3NCR(-) RNA with viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5 protein), an event required for the synthesis of the plus-sense genomic RNA. cAMP is known to promote the Protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated PTB phosphorylation. We show that cells treated with a cAMP analogue had an enhanced level of phosphorylated PTB in the cytoplasm and a significantly suppressed JEV replication. Data presented here show a novel, cAMP-induced, PTB-mediated, innate host response that could effectively suppress JEV replication in mammalian cells.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.198476663,-0.053355505,-0.061728835999999995,0.06563048,-0.041059665,-0.076894088,-0.021148534,0.028571866,-0.017891866,-0.01470188,0.040811812,-0.020842188,-0.027503244,0.08432199900000001,0.012451423,0.02468278,0.009316974,-0.030697118,0.005705408,0.008809206,-0.036952606,0.032987591000000004,-0.032874529,-0.058497863,-0.027945192,-0.022805697000000003,-0.010603226,0.00827158,-0.024718982,0.024077559
803,Subgenomic promoter recognition by the norovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerases,"The replication enzyme of RNA viruses must preferentially recognize their RNAs in an environment that contains an abundance of cellular RNAs. The factors responsible for specific RNA recognition are not well understood, in part because viral RNA synthesis takes place within enzyme complexes associated with modified cellular membrane compartments. Recombinant RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) from the human norovirus and the murine norovirus (MNV) were found to preferentially recognize RNA segments that contain the promoter and a short template sequence for subgenomic RNA synthesis. Both the promoter and template sequence contribute to stable RdRp binding, accurate initiation of the subgenomic RNAs and efficient RNA synthesis. Using a method that combines RNA crosslinking and mass spectrometry, residues near the template channel of the MNV RdRp were found to contact the hairpin RNA motif. Mutations in the hairpin contact site in the MNV RdRp reduced MNV replication and virus production in cells. This work demonstrates that the specific recognition of the norovirus subgenomic promoter is through binding by the viral RdRp.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.25932623,-0.063131329,-0.080914084,0.156908048,-0.041528116000000004,-0.128252089,0.00193163,0.05727051,-0.07066692,0.01113253,0.100371666,0.071654539,-0.065464425,0.017888625,0.000565745,0.041606203,-0.016269746,-0.043465595999999995,-0.017264069,-0.015285465,0.015906286999999998,0.0008140280000000001,0.0038616609999999997,-0.057650745,-0.011498988,-0.02888941,-0.01611046,0.033942876000000004,0.065838765,0.052713054
810,mRNA maturation in giant viruses: variation on a theme,"Giant viruses from the Mimiviridae family replicate entirely in their host cytoplasm where their genes are transcribed by a viral transcription apparatus. mRNA polyadenylation uniquely occurs at hairpin-forming palindromic sequences terminating viral transcripts. Here we show that a conserved gene cluster both encode the enzyme responsible for the hairpin cleavage and the viral polyA polymerases (vPAP). Unexpectedly, the vPAPs are homodimeric and uniquely self-processive. The vPAP backbone structures exhibit a symmetrical architecture with two subdomains sharing a nucleotidyltransferase topology, suggesting that vPAPs originate from an ancestral duplication. A Poxvirus processivity factor homologue encoded by Megavirus chilensis displays a conserved 5′-GpppA 2′O methyltransferase activity but is also able to internally methylate the mRNAs’ polyA tails.

813,Resolution of the cellular proteome of the nucleocapsid protein from a highly pathogenic isolate of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus identifies PARP-1 as a cellular target whose interaction is critical for virus biology,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a major threat to the swine industry and food security worldwide. The nucleocapsid (N) protein is a major structural protein of PRRSV. The primary function of this protein is to encapsidate the viral RNA genome, and it is also thought to participate in the modulation of host cell biology and recruitment of cellular factors to facilitate virus infection. In order to the better understand these latter roles the cellular interactome of PRRSV N protein was defined using label free quantitative proteomics. This identified several cellular factors that could interact with the N protein including poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1), a cellular protein, which can add adenosine diphosphate ribose to a protein. Use of the PARP-1 small molecule inhibitor, 3-AB, in PRRSV infected cells demonstrated that PARP-1 was required and acted as an enhancer factor for virus biology. Serial growth of PRRSV in different concentrations of 3-AB did not yield viruses that were able to grow with wild type kinetics, suggesting that by targeting a cellular protein crucial for virus biology, resistant phenotypes did not emerge. This study provides further evidence that cellular proteins, which are critical for virus biology, can also be targeted to ablate virus growth and provide a high barrier for the emergence of drug resistance.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.135400747,-0.064656189,-0.038816168,-0.010082903,-0.083523237,0.045123500999999996,0.018189311,-0.053603128,0.082624999,0.023823842999999997,-0.077659941,-0.058541620999999995,0.019268294,0.058283061,0.02462873,-0.10580682300000001,0.079607311,-0.08170251,-0.011610968000000001,0.131008165,-0.058327074000000007,0.041189274,0.010153024,-0.061154404,0.068210554,0.101483177,0.045163941,-0.060343268,-0.09205816,0.056630197

The importance of keeping rDNA transcription under tight control is reflected by the fact that deranged Pol I transcription is a feature of cancer and other human disorders. In this review, we discuss multiple aspects of rDNA function including the relationship between Pol I transcription and proliferative capacity, the role of Pol I transcription in mediating nucleolar structure and integrity, and rDNA/nucleolar interactions with the genome and their influence on heterochromatin and global genome stability.

822,Sequence-Specific Fidelity Alterations Associated with West Nile Virus Attenuation in Mosquitoes,"High rates of error-prone replication result in the rapid accumulation of genetic diversity of RNA viruses. Recent studies suggest that mutation rates are selected for optimal viral fitness and that modest variations in replicase fidelity may be associated with viral attenuation. Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are unique in their requirement for host cycling and may necessitate substantial genetic and phenotypic plasticity. In order to more thoroughly investigate the correlates, mechanisms and consequences of arbovirus fidelity, we selected fidelity variants of West Nile virus (WNV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) utilizing selection in the presence of a mutagen. We identified two mutations in the WNV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase associated with increased fidelity, V793I and G806R, and a single mutation in the WNV methyltransferase, T248I, associated with decreased fidelity. Both deep-sequencing and in vitro biochemical assays confirmed strain-specific differences in both fidelity and mutational bias. WNV fidelity variants demonstrated host-specific alterations to replicative fitness in vitro, with modest attenuation in mosquito but not vertebrate cell culture. Experimental infections of colonized and field populations of Cx. quinquefaciatus demonstrated that WNV fidelity alterations are associated with a significantly impaired capacity to establish viable infections in mosquitoes. Taken together, these studies (i) demonstrate the importance of allosteric interactions in regulating mutation rates, (ii) establish that mutational spectra can be both sequence and strain-dependent, and (iii) display the profound phenotypic consequences associated with altered replication complex function of flaviviruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.125558853,-0.053785177999999996,-0.044632606,0.055679354,-0.029245196,0.011506335,0.10109006699999999,0.0069070419999999995,-0.041086366,0.076232387,0.096156649,0.072300608,-0.068660113,-0.018966384,0.00951417,0.023586706000000002,-0.052272517000000004,-0.07510412799999999,-0.116870985,-0.007937708,0.124926329,-0.08098532900000001,0.046036485999999995,0.13901312400000002,-0.070777168,0.047684407000000005,0.055619336,-0.07861481299999999,-0.12235504900000001,-0.11906736
824,Characterisation of Structural Proteins from Chronic Bee Paralysis Virus (CBPV) Using Mass Spectrometry,"Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) is the etiological agent of chronic paralysis, an infectious and contagious disease in adult honeybees. CBPV is a positive single-stranded RNA virus which contains two major viral RNA fragments. RNA 1 (3674 nt) and RNA 2 (2305 nt) encode three and four putative open reading frames (ORFs), respectively. RNA 1 is thought to encode the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) since the amino acid sequence derived from ORF 3 shares similarities with the RdRP of families Nodaviridae and Tombusviridae. The genomic organization of CBPV and in silico analyses have suggested that RNA 1 encodes non-structural proteins, while RNA 2 encodes structural proteins, which are probably encoded by ORFs 2 and 3. In this study, purified CBPV particles were used to characterize virion proteins by mass spectrometry. Several polypeptides corresponding to proteins encoded by ORF 2 and 3 on RNA 2 were detected.

837,Nucleobase but not Sugar Fidelity is Maintained in the Sabin I RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase,"The Sabin I poliovirus live, attenuated vaccine strain encodes for four amino acid changes (i.e., D53N, Y73H, K250E, and T362I) in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We have previously shown that the T362I substitution leads to a lower fidelity RdRp, and viruses encoding this variant are attenuated in a mouse model of poliovirus. Given these results, it was surprising that the nucleotide incorporation rate and nucleobase fidelity of the Sabin I RdRp is similar to that of wild-type enzyme, although the Sabin I RdRp is less selective against nucleotides with modified sugar groups. We suggest that the other Sabin amino acid changes (i.e., D53N, Y73H, K250E) help to re-establish nucleotide incorporation rates and nucleotide discrimination near wild-type levels, which may be a requirement for the propagation of the virus and its efficacy as a vaccine strain.

851,Multiple Cis-acting elements modulate programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting in Pea enation mosaic virus,"Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) is used by many positive-strand RNA viruses for translation of required products. Despite extensive studies, it remains unresolved how cis-elements just downstream of the recoding site promote a precise level of frameshifting. The Umbravirus Pea enation mosaic virus RNA2 expresses its RNA polymerase by -1 PRF of the 5′-proximal ORF (p33). Three hairpins located in the vicinity of the recoding site are phylogenetically conserved among Umbraviruses. The central Recoding Stimulatory Element (RSE), located downstream of the p33 termination codon, is a large hairpin with two asymmetric internal loops. Mutational analyses revealed that sequences throughout the RSE and the RSE lower stem (LS) structure are important for frameshifting. SHAPE probing of mutants indicated the presence of higher order structure, and sequences in the LS may also adapt an alternative conformation. Long-distance pairing between the RSE and a 3′ terminal hairpin was less critical when the LS structure was stabilized. A basal level of frameshifting occurring in the absence of the RSE increases to 72% of wild-type when a hairpin upstream of the slippery site is also deleted. These results suggest that suppression of frameshifting may be needed in the absence of an active RSE conformation.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14643240800000001,-0.059341436,-0.027359646,-0.001937149,0.035603083,-0.055792130999999995,-0.066165713,0.035791012000000004,-0.023907769,-0.048893785999999995,-0.04048011,0.022818416,-0.010328802,-0.097762888,-0.038312781000000004,-0.016558661000000002,0.029154521,-0.00537932,-0.03164137,-0.053335322000000004,0.000506181,-0.045986439000000004,-0.063930681,0.010189474,-0.050111214,-0.085623451,-0.040532324,0.027759467000000003,0.102933784,-0.103190962
862,Low-Fidelity Polymerases of Alphaviruses Recombine at Higher Rates To Overproduce Defective Interfering Particles,"Low-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerases for many RNA virus mutators have been shown to confer attenuated phenotypes, presumably due to increased mutation rates. Additionally, for many RNA viruses, replication to high titers results in the production of defective interfering particles (DIs) that also attenuate infection. We hypothesized that fidelity, recombination, and DI production are tightly linked. We show that a Sindbis virus mutator replicating at a high multiplicity of infection manifests an earlier and greater accumulation of DIs than its wild-type counterpart. The isolated DIs interfere with the replication of full-length virus in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, the ability of the mutator virus to overproduce DIs could be linked to an increased recombination frequency. These data confirm that RNA-dependent RNA polymerase fidelity and recombination are inversely correlated for this mutator. Our findings suggest that defective interference resulting from higher recombination rates may be more detrimental to RNA virus mutators than the increase in mutational burden. IMPORTANCE Replication, adaptation, and evolution of RNA viruses rely in large part on their low-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Viruses artificially modified in their polymerases to decrease fidelity (mutator viruses) are attenuated in vivo, demonstrating the important role of fidelity in viral fitness. However, attenuation was attributed solely to the modification of the viral mutation rate and the accumulation of detrimental point mutations. In this work, we described an additional phenotype of mutator viruses: an increased recombination rate leading to defective interfering particle (DI) overproduction. Because DIs are known for their inhibitory effect on viral replication, our work suggests that fidelity variants may be attenuated in vivo via several mechanisms. This has important implications in the development of fidelity variants as live attenuated vaccine strains.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.182775028,-0.082887146,-0.077556691,0.12201986699999999,-0.008879401,-0.038515832,0.048127276,0.041620574,-0.06591033,0.082335349,0.151525938,0.039278837999999996,-0.078194841,0.01250166,0.072464553,0.09887305199999999,-0.132690298,-0.03501465,-0.09410155699999999,0.003099681,0.160354561,-0.097914914,0.08675919300000001,0.130534502,-0.05905978,0.064189943,0.073576955,-0.07160467400000001,-0.11943913099999999,-0.120323187
893,Mechanisms of viral mutation,"The remarkable capacity of some viruses to adapt to new hosts and environments is highly dependent on their ability to generate de novo diversity in a short period of time. Rates of spontaneous mutation vary amply among viruses. RNA viruses mutate faster than DNA viruses, single-stranded viruses mutate faster than double-strand virus, and genome size appears to correlate negatively with mutation rate. Viral mutation rates are modulated at different levels, including polymerase fidelity, sequence context, template secondary structure, cellular microenvironment, replication mechanisms, proofreading, and access to post-replicative repair. Additionally, massive numbers of mutations can be introduced by some virus-encoded diversity-generating elements, as well as by host-encoded cytidine/adenine deaminases.

896,Deep Sequencing Analysis Reveals the Mycoviral Diversity of the Virome of an Avirulent Isolate of Rhizoctonia solani AG-2-2 IV,"Rhizoctonia solani represents an important plant pathogenic Basidiomycota species complex and the host of many different mycoviruses, as indicated by frequent detection of dsRNA elements in natural populations of the fungus. To date, eight different mycoviruses have been characterized in Rhizoctonia and some of them have been reported to modulate its virulence. DsRNA extracts of the avirulent R. solani isolate DC17 (AG2-2-IV) displayed a diverse pattern, indicating multiple infections with mycoviruses. Deep sequencing analysis of the dsRNA extract, converted to cDNA, revealed that this isolate harbors at least 17 different mycovirus species. Based on the alignment of the conserved RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) domain, this viral community included putative members of the families Narnaviridae, Endornaviridae, Partitiviridae and Megabirnaviridae as well as of the order Tymovirales. Furthermore, viruses, which could not be assigned to any existing family or order, but showed similarities to so far unassigned species like Sclerotinia sclerotiorum RNA virus L, Rhizoctonia solani dsRNA virus 1, Aspergillus foetidus slow virus 2 or Rhizoctonia fumigata virus 1, were identified.

913,A Novel Mechanism Underlying the Innate Immune Response Induction upon Viral-Dependent Replication of Host Cell mRNA: A Mistake of +sRNA Viruses' Replicases,"Viruses are lifeless particles designed for setting virus-host interactome assuring a new generation of virions for dissemination. This interactome generates a pressure on host organisms evolving mechanisms to neutralize viral infection, which places the pressure back onto virus, a process known as virus-host cell co-evolution. Positive-single stranded RNA (+sRNA) viruses are an important group of viral agents illustrating this interesting phenomenon. During replication, their genomic +sRNA is employed as template for translation of viral proteins; among them the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is responsible of viral genome replication originating double-strand RNA molecules (dsRNA) as intermediates, which accumulate representing a potent threat for cellular dsRNA receptors to initiate an antiviral response. A common feature shared by these viruses is their ability to rearrange cellular membranes to serve as platforms for genome replication and assembly of new virions, supporting replication efficiency increase by concentrating critical factors and protecting the viral genome from host anti-viral systems. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding cellular dsRNA receptors and describes prototype viruses developing replication niches inside rearranged membranes. However, for several viral agents it's been observed both, a complex rearrangement of cellular membranes and a strong innate immune antiviral response induction.

925,The Functional Roles of the Cis-acting Elements in Bamboo mosaic virus RNA Genome,"Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV), which belongs to the genus Potexvirus in the family Alphaflexiviridae, has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome that is approximately 6400 nucleotides (nts) in length. Positive-sense RNA viruses can use genomic RNA as a template for translation and replication after entering a suitable host cell. Furthermore, such viral RNA is recognized by capsid protein for packaging and by viral movement protein(s) or the movement protein complex for cell-to-cell and systemic movement. Hence, viral RNA must contain signals for different functions to complete the viral infection cycle. In this review, we examine various cis-acting elements in the genome of BaMV. The highly structured 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the BaMV genomic RNA plays multiple roles in the BaMV infection cycle, including targeting chloroplasts for RNA replication, providing an initiation site for the synthesis of minus-strand RNA, signaling for polyadenylation, and directing viral long-distance movement. The nt at the extreme 3′ end and the structure of the 3′-terminus of minus-strand RNA are involved in the initiation of plus-strand genomic RNA synthesis. Both these regions have been mapped and reported to interact with the viral-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Moreover, the sequences upstream of open reading frames (ORFs) 2, 3, and 5 are involved in regulating subgenomic RNA synthesis.

936,Molecular characterization of a novel cryptic virus infecting pigeonpea plants,"A new member of the genus Deltapartitivirus was identified containing three dsRNAs with an estimated size of 1.71, 1.49 and 1.43 kb. The dsRNAs were extracted from symptomless pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millspaugh] plants cv. Erra Kandulu. This new virus with 4.64 kb genome was tentatively named Arhar cryptic virus-1 (ArCV-1). The genomic RNAs were amplified and characterized by sequence independent single primer amplification. The dsRNAs shared a highly conserved 16 nt 5’ non-coding region (5’-GATAATGATCCAAGGA-3’). The largest dsRNA (dsRNA-1) was identified as the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (replicase), predicted to encode a putative 55.34 kDa protein (P1). The two other smaller dsRNAs (dsRNA-2 and dsRNA-3) predicted to encode for putative capsid proteins of 38.50kDa (P2) and 38.51kDa (P3), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that ArCV-1 formed a clade together with Fragaria chiloensis cryptic virus, Rosa multiflora cryptic virus and Rose cryptic virus-1, indicating that ArCV-1 could be a new member of the genus Deltapartitivirus. ArCV-1 3D(pol) structure revealed several interesting features. The 3D(pol) in its full-length shares structural similarities with members of the family Caliciviridaeand family Picornaviridae. In addition, fourth dsRNA molecule (dsRNA-2A), not related to ArCV-1 genome, was found in the same plant tissue. The dsRNA-2A (1.6 kb) encodes a protein (P4), with a predicted size of 44.5 kDa. P4 shares similarity with coat protein genes of several cryptic viruses, in particular the bipartite cryptic viruses including Raphanus sativus cryptic virus-3.

939,HIV-1 tolerates changes in A-count in a small segment of the pol gene,"BACKGROUND: The HIV-1 RNA genome has a biased nucleotide composition with a surplus of As. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this striking phenomenon, but the A-count of the HIV-1 genome has thus far not been systematically manipulated. The reason for this reservation is the likelihood that known and unknown sequence motifs will be affected by such a massive mutational approach, thus resulting in replication-impaired virus mutants. We present the first attempt to increase and decrease the A-count in a relatively small polymerase (pol) gene segment of HIV-1 RNA. RESULTS: To minimize the mutational impact, a new mutational approach was developed that is inspired by natural sequence variation as present in HIV-1 isolates. This phylogeny-instructed mutagenesis allowed us to create replication-competent HIV-1 mutants with a significantly increased or decreased local A-count. The local A-count of the wild-type (wt) virus (40.2%) was further increased to 46.9% or reduced to 31.7 and 26.3%. These HIV-1 variants replicate efficiently in vitro, despite the fact that the pol changes cause a quite profound move in HIV–SIV sequence space. CONCLUSIONS: Extrapolating these results to the complete 9 kb RNA genome, we may cautiously suggest that the A-rich signature does not have to be maintained.

943,HBV core protein allosteric modulators differentially alter cccDNA biosynthesis from de novo infection and intracellular amplification pathways,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) core protein assembles viral pre-genomic (pg) RNA and DNA polymerase into nucleocapsids for reverse transcriptional DNA replication to take place. Several chemotypes of small molecules, including heteroaryldihydropyrimidines (HAPs) and sulfamoylbenzamides (SBAs), have been discovered to allosterically modulate core protein structure and consequentially alter the kinetics and pathway of core protein assembly, resulting in formation of irregularly-shaped core protein aggregates or “empty” capsids devoid of pre-genomic RNA and viral DNA polymerase. Interestingly, in addition to inhibiting nucleocapsid assembly and subsequent viral genome replication, we have now demonstrated that HAPs and SBAs differentially modulate the biosynthesis of covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA from de novo infection and intracellular amplification pathways by inducing disassembly of nucleocapsids derived from virions as well as double-stranded DNA-containing progeny nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm. Specifically, the mistimed cuing of nucleocapsid uncoating prevents cccDNA formation during de novo infection of hepatocytes, while transiently accelerating cccDNA synthesis from cytoplasmic progeny nucleocapsids. Our studies indicate that elongation of positive-stranded DNA induces structural changes of nucleocapsids, which confers ability of mature nucleocapsids to bind CpAMs and triggers its disassembly. Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the dual effects of the core protein allosteric modulators on nucleocapsid assembly and disassembly will facilitate the discovery of novel core protein-targeting antiviral agents that can more efficiently suppress cccDNA synthesis and cure chronic hepatitis B.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.153105735,-0.044714962999999996,-0.020618674,0.000192337,-0.086778928,-0.015097768999999999,0.026147997000000003,-0.004920177,0.031847472,0.004467095,-0.032276111,-0.018754593,0.021047885,0.008894649000000001,-0.02359098,0.0074494769999999995,0.005213545,-0.014787406000000001,0.008397261,0.038283002999999996,-0.046586950999999995,0.037388553,-0.031943462,-0.02432649,0.015482891,-0.007803944,-0.038351357999999995,0.003749627,-0.018312403,0.05205502099999999
952,Polyprotein Processing as a Determinant for In Vitro Activity of Semliki Forest Virus Replicase,"Semliki Forest virus (SFV) is an arthropod-borne alphavirus that induces membrane invaginations (spherules) in host cells. These harbor the viral replication complexes (RC) that synthesize viral RNA. Alphaviruses have four replicase or nonstructural proteins (nsPs), nsP1–4, expressed as polyprotein P1234. An early RC, which synthesizes minus-strand RNA, is formed by the polyprotein P123 and the polymerase nsP4. Further proteolytic cleavage results in a late RC consisting of nsP1–4 and synthesizing plus strands. Here, we show that only the late RCs are highly active in RNA synthesis in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that active RCs can be isolated from both virus-infected cells and cells transfected with the wild-type replicase in combination with a plasmid expressing a template RNA. When an uncleavable polyprotein P123 and polymerase nsP4 were expressed together with a template, high levels of minus-strand RNA were produced in cells, but RCs isolated from these cells were hardly active in vitro. Furthermore, we observed that the uncleavable polyprotein P123 and polymerase nsP4, which have previously been shown to form spherules even in the absence of the template, did not replicate an exogenous template. Consequently, we hypothesize that the replicase proteins were sequestered in spherules and were no longer able to recruit a template.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.20511338899999998,-0.064915604,-0.06460821900000001,0.055611502,-0.078750424,-0.06498794299999999,-0.010240749,0.006286118,-0.0032320120000000003,-0.018079135,0.030268954,-0.012710392,-0.029106501,0.09651598800000001,0.016579844,0.03965025,0.022348606,-0.049875580999999995,0.034598299,0.028221724,-0.045515975,0.045887780999999996,-0.028710705,-0.094125704,0.037592187,0.007107859,-0.075701263,0.040687737,-0.09308714,0.012434411000000001
972,Structural and Functional Basis of the Fidelity of Nucleotide Selection by Flavivirus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases,"Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) play a central role not only in viral replication, but also in the genetic evolution of viral RNAs. After binding to an RNA template and selecting 5′-triphosphate ribonucleosides, viral RdRps synthesize an RNA copy according to Watson-Crick base-pairing rules. The copy process sometimes deviates from both the base-pairing rules specified by the template and the natural ribose selectivity and, thus, the process is error-prone due to the intrinsic (in)fidelity of viral RdRps. These enzymes share a number of conserved amino-acid sequence strings, called motifs A–G, which can be defined from a structural and functional point-of-view. A co-relation is gradually emerging between mutations in these motifs and viral genome evolution or observed mutation rates. Here, we review our current knowledge on these motifs and their role on the structural and mechanistic basis of the fidelity of nucleotide selection and RNA synthesis by Flavivirus RdRps.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.20735050600000002,-0.06123874,-0.079857888,0.11564031,-0.030304069,-0.06956240400000001,0.057866444,0.041079482,-0.07196048299999999,0.069164305,0.092626672,0.06404757400000001,-0.032236087999999996,-0.06121990000000001,-0.009097718000000001,0.0032256409999999996,-0.020467251000000002,-0.030118863,-0.089625989,-0.009012124,0.021518989,-0.019300755,-0.021722025,0.029290962,-0.066214571,-0.020512633,0.033567432,-0.019676285,-0.015485681000000001,-0.016043596
984,The conserved stem-loop II structure at the 3' untranslated region of Japanese encephalitis virus genome is required for the formation of subgenomic flaviviral RNA,"Flaviviruses accumulate abundant subgenomic RNA (sfRNA) in infected cells. It has been reported that sfRNA results from stalling of host 5’-to-3’ exoribonuclease XRN1 at the highly structured RNA of the 3’ untranslated region (UTR). Although XRN1 digestion of a 3’-terminal 800-nt RNA could stall at a position to generate the sfRNA in vitro, we found that knocking out XRN1 had no effect on the accumulation of sfRNA in Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infected cells. Mutagenesis studies revealed that the stemloop II (SLII) at the 3’ UTR is required for the accumulation of sfRNA. According to the results of an in vitro RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) assay, the (-)10431-10566 RNA fragment, containing the putative promoter on the antigenome for the sfRNA transcription, binds to RdRp protein and exhibits a strong promoter activity.

992,Host Shutoff in Influenza A Virus: Many Means to an End,"Influenza A virus carries few of its own proteins, but uses them effectively to take control of the infected cells and avoid immune responses. Over the years, host shutoff, the widespread down-regulation of host gene expression, has emerged as a key process that contributes to cellular takeover in infected cells. Interestingly, multiple mechanisms of host shutoff have been described in influenza A virus, involving changes in translation, RNA synthesis and stability. Several viral proteins, notably the non-structural protein NS1, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the endoribonuclease PA-X have been implicated in host shutoff. This multitude of host shutoff mechanisms indicates that host shutoff is an important component of the influenza A virus replication cycle. Here we review the various mechanisms of host shutoff in influenza A virus and the evidence that they contribute to immune evasion and/or viral replication.

995,"Changes in mRNA abundance drive shuttling of RNA binding proteins, linking cytoplasmic RNA degradation to transcription","Alterations in global mRNA decay broadly impact multiple stages of gene expression, although signals that connect these processes are incompletely defined. Here, we used tandem mass tag labeling coupled with mass spectrometry to reveal that changing the mRNA decay landscape, as frequently occurs during viral infection, results in subcellular redistribution of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in human cells. Accelerating Xrn1-dependent mRNA decay through expression of a gammaherpesviral endonuclease drove nuclear translocation of many RBPs, including poly(A) tail-associated proteins. Conversely, cells lacking Xrn1 exhibited changes in the localization or abundance of numerous factors linked to mRNA turnover. Using these data, we uncovered a new role for relocalized cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein in repressing recruitment of TATA binding protein and RNA polymerase II to promoters. Collectively, our results show that changes in cytoplasmic mRNA decay can directly impact protein localization, providing a mechanism to connect seemingly distal stages of gene expression.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.149893957,-0.060020812,-0.041584999,-0.071051698,-0.08473480000000001,0.004465871,-0.013844773999999999,-0.041125107,0.055970375999999995,-0.059598662000000004,-0.092537547,-0.059672867000000004,0.011991888000000001,0.08696087,-0.05455572400000001,-0.005372351,0.039365099,-0.116499655,-0.072475008,-0.027289643,0.009646099,0.04508565,-0.0069801559999999995,-0.02176382,0.013302745,-0.09435110599999999,-0.028555564,0.03311961,0.10652407400000001,0.0035688459999999997
999,RNA Virus Fidelity Mutants: A Useful Tool for Evolutionary Biology or a Complex Challenge?,"RNA viruses replicate with low fidelity due to the error-prone nature of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which generates approximately one mutation per round of genome replication. Due to the large population sizes produced by RNA viruses during replication, this results in a cloud of closely related virus variants during host infection, of which small increases or decreases in replication fidelity have been shown to result in virus attenuation in vivo, but not typically in vitro. Since the discovery of the first RNA virus fidelity mutants during the mid-aughts, the field has exploded with the identification of over 50 virus fidelity mutants distributed amongst 7 RNA virus families. This review summarizes the current RNA virus fidelity mutant literature, with a focus upon the definition of a fidelity mutant as well as methods to confirm any mutational changes associated with the fidelity mutant.

1025,Mechanism of Inhibition of Ebola Virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase by Remdesivir,"Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a 1′-cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide analogue prodrug that shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses. This compound is currently under clinical development for the treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD). While antiviral effects have been demonstrated in cell culture and in non-human primates, the mechanism of action of Ebola virus (EBOV) inhibition for remdesivir remains to be fully elucidated. The EBOV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex was recently expressed and purified, enabling biochemical studies with the relevant triphosphate (TP) form of remdesivir and its presumptive target. In this study, we confirmed that remdesivir-TP is able to compete for incorporation with adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Enzyme kinetics revealed that EBOV RdRp and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RdRp incorporate ATP and remdesivir-TP with similar efficiencies. The selectivity of ATP against remdesivir-TP is ~4 for EBOV RdRp and ~3 for RSV RdRp. In contrast, purified human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (h-mtRNAP) effectively discriminates against remdesivir-TP with a selectivity value of ~500-fold. For EBOV RdRp, the incorporated inhibitor at position i does not affect the ensuing nucleotide incorporation event at position i+1. For RSV RdRp, we measured a ~6-fold inhibition at position i+1 although RNA synthesis was not terminated. Chain termination was in both cases delayed and was seen predominantly at position i+5. This pattern is specific to remdesivir-TP and its 1′-cyano modification. Compounds with modifications at the 2′-position show different patterns of inhibition. While 2′-C-methyl-ATP is not incorporated, ara-ATP acts as a non-obligate chain terminator and prevents nucleotide incorporation at position i+1. Taken together, our biochemical data indicate that the major contribution to EBOV RNA synthesis inhibition by remdesivir can be ascribed to delayed chain termination. The long distance of five residues between the incorporated nucleotide analogue and its inhibitory effect warrant further investigation.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.109473604,-0.037338944,-0.057100705999999994,0.048779458,-0.062692752,-0.0061297669999999995,0.073985821,-0.00166587,0.007662383,0.01106492,0.08417400300000001,0.085409986,-0.086907186,-0.042748838,-0.038962809,-0.014679263,0.011879678000000001,0.037671305,-0.006443293,-0.062016339000000004,0.040080506,-0.054403386,0.041663353,-0.008997357,0.049730948,0.007586384,0.0629136,0.043919679,0.031977346000000004,0.033584287000000004
1032,Global analysis of polysome-associated mRNA in vesicular stomatitis virus infected cells,"Infection of mammalian cells with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) results in the inhibition of cellular translation while viral translation proceeds efficiently. VSV RNA synthesis occurs entirely within the cytoplasm, where during transcription the viral polymerase produces 5 mRNAs that are structurally indistinct to cellular mRNAs with respect to their 5′ cap-structure and 3′-polyadenylate tail. Using the global approach of massively parallel sequencing of total cytoplasmic, monosome- and polysome-associated mRNA, we interrogate the impact of VSV infection of HeLa cells on translation. Analysis of sequence reads in the different fractions shows >60% of total cytoplasmic and polysome-associated reads map to the 5 viral genes by 6 hours post-infection, a time point at which robust host cell translational shut-off is observed. Consistent with an overwhelming abundance of viral mRNA in the polysome fraction, the reads mapping to cellular genes were reduced. The cellular mRNAs that remain most polysome-associated following infection had longer half-lives, were typically larger, and were more AU rich, features that are shared with the viral mRNAs. Several of those mRNAs encode proteins known to positively affect viral replication, and using chemical inhibition and siRNA depletion we confirm that the host chaperone heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3A (eIF3A)—encoded by 2 such mRNAs—support viral replication. Correspondingly, regulated in development and DNA damage 1 (Redd1) encoded by a host mRNA with reduced polysome association inhibits viral infection. These data underscore the importance of viral mRNA abundance in the shut-off of host translation in VSV infected cells and link the differential translatability of some cellular mRNAs with pro- or antiviral function.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14497354699999998,-0.085440175,-0.067862096,-0.021416384,-0.10514136199999999,-0.002255655,0.012468412,-0.009233485999999999,0.042766755,-0.0014068129999999998,-0.075546679,-0.115246758,0.041922835,0.11745489099999999,-0.01899107,0.000759865,0.007584999,-0.071474126,-0.044576925,0.081676481,-0.044631245,0.10552345199999999,-0.060731659,0.015902088999999998,0.006314376,-0.119741722,0.00833548,-0.001114703,0.072706054,0.067059217
1039,The Curious Case of the Nidovirus Exoribonuclease: Its Role in RNA Synthesis and Replication Fidelity,"Among RNA viruses, the order Nidovirales stands out for including viruses with the largest RNA genomes currently known. Nidoviruses employ a complex RNA-synthesizing machinery comprising a variety of non-structural proteins (nsps). One of the postulated drivers of the expansion of nidovirus genomes is the presence of a proofreading 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease (ExoN) belonging to the DEDDh family. ExoN may enhance the fidelity of RNA synthesis by correcting nucleotide incorporation errors made by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Here, we review our current understanding of ExoN evolution, structure, and function. Most experimental data are derived from studies of the ExoN domain of coronaviruses (CoVs), which were triggered by the bioinformatics-based identification of ExoN in the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and its relatives in 2003. Although convincing data supporting the proofreading hypothesis have been obtained, from biochemical assays and studies with CoV mutants lacking ExoN functionality, the features of ExoN from most other nidovirus families remain to be characterized. Remarkably, viable ExoN knockout mutants were obtained only for two CoVs, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV, whose RNA synthesis and replication kinetics were mildly affected by the lack of ExoN function. In several other CoV species, ExoN inactivation was not tolerated, and knockout mutants could not be rescued when launched using a reverse genetics system. This suggests that ExoN is also critical for primary viral RNA synthesis, a property that poorly matches the profile of an enzyme that would merely boost long-term replication fidelity. In CoVs, ExoN resides in a bifunctional replicase subunit (nsp14) whose C-terminal part has (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase activity. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV nsp14 has shed light on the interplay between these two domains, and on nsp14’s interactions with nsp10, a co-factor that strongly enhances ExoN activity in vitro assays. Further elucidation of the structure-function relationships of ExoN and its interactions with other (viral and/or host) members of the CoV replication machinery will be key to understanding the enzyme’s role in viral RNA synthesis and pathogenesis, and may contribute to the design of new approaches to combat emerging nidoviruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.164860495,0.131825086,-0.15979412699999998,0.113333053,-0.002836747,-0.031762206,0.07578949,0.009810179,-0.025101212,0.02031491,0.066793804,0.018648252,-0.05195063900000001,-0.019391713,0.000615471,0.049173077,-0.00973885,-0.04073358,-0.051040592999999995,0.004524109,0.027322365,-0.052424017,0.08902828800000001,0.049871828,0.043754394,0.064081524,-0.048840765,-0.059590748,-0.035503713,-0.097196028
1042,A Structure-Function Diversity Survey of the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases From the Positive-Strand RNA Viruses,"The RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) encoded by the RNA viruses are a unique class of nucleic acid polymerases. Each viral RdRP contains a 500–600 residue catalytic module with palm, fingers, and thumb domains forming an encircled human right hand architecture. Seven polymerase catalytic motifs are located in the RdRP palm and fingers domains, comprising the most conserved parts of the RdRP and are responsible for the RNA-only specificity in catalysis. Functional regions are often found fused to the RdRP catalytic module, resulting in a high level of diversity in RdRP global structure and regulatory mechanism. In this review, we surveyed all 46 RdRP-sequence available virus families of the positive-strand RNA viruses listed in the 2018b collection of the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy (ICTV) and chose a total of 49 RdRPs as representatives. By locating hallmark residues in RdRP catalytic motifs and by referencing structural and functional information in the literature, we were able to estimate the N- and C-terminal boundaries of the catalytic module in these RdRPs, which in turn serve as reference points to predict additional functional regions beyond the catalytic module. Interestingly, a large number of virus families may have additional regions fused to the RdRP N-terminus, while only a few of them have such regions on the C-terminal side of the RdRP. The current knowledge on these additional regions, either in three-dimensional (3D) structure or in function, is quite limited. In the five RdRP-structure available virus families in the positive-strand RNA viruses, only the Flaviviridae family has the 3D structural information resolved for such regions. Hence, future efforts to solve full-length RdRP structures containing these regions and to dissect the functional contribution of them are necessary to improve the overall understanding of the RdRP proteins as an evolutionarily integrated group, and our analyses here may serve as a guideline for selecting representative RdRP systems in these studies.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.20151379100000003,-0.036722313,-0.09119832,0.144480564,0.005978038000000001,-0.057783753,0.091233712,0.040784122,-0.09944263699999999,0.05732026900000001,0.118021309,0.183324984,-0.104457435,-0.128366479,-0.067302032,-0.06491884,0.07754788,-0.06751046,-0.062731862,-0.087225005,0.058457413,-0.060525734000000005,0.050225025,-0.06244323,-0.004649403,0.061204247,0.024810982000000002,0.042920255,0.072807789,0.028235861
1044,Hepatitis E Virus Replication,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a small quasi-enveloped, (+)-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Hepeviridae family. There are at least 20 million HEV infections annually and 60,000 HEV-related deaths worldwide. HEV can cause up to 30% mortality in pregnant women and progress to liver cirrhosis in immunocompromised individuals and is, therefore, a greatly underestimated public health concern. Although a prophylactic vaccine for HEV has been developed, it is only licensed in China, and there is currently no effective, non-teratogenic treatment. HEV encodes three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 is the largest viral gene product, encoding the replicative machinery of the virus including a methyltransferase, RNA helicase, and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. ORF1 additionally contains a number of poorly understood domains including a hypervariable region, a putative protease, and the so-called ‘X’ and ‘Y’ domains. ORF2 is the viral capsid essential for formation of infectious particles and ORF3 is a small protein essential for viral release. In this review, we focus on the domains encoded by ORF1, which collectively mediate the virus’ asymmetric genome replication strategy. We summarize what is known, unknown, and hotly debated regarding the coding and non-coding regions of HEV ORF1, and present a model of how HEV replicates its genome.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.133982726,-0.049635524,-0.042054250999999994,0.02008852,-0.001160917,-0.011893613999999999,-0.007165753,0.017120549,0.013773671000000001,0.015522297,-0.014441586999999999,0.009343232,0.012908942,-0.066167667,-0.007338283,-0.069377072,0.028502022000000002,0.048427158,0.042138607,0.037410835,-0.014116469,0.014981293,-0.078485231,-0.027552335,-0.022696378,0.031807655,0.024417316,-0.027230181000000003,0.021603183999999997,-0.027816696000000002
1049,Impact of RNA Virus Evolution on Quasispecies Formation and Virulence,"RNA viruses are known to replicate by low fidelity polymerases and have high mutation rates whereby the resulting virus population tends to exist as a distribution of mutants. In this review, we aim to explore how genetic events such as spontaneous mutations could alter the genomic organization of RNA viruses in such a way that they impact virus replications and plaque morphology. The phenomenon of quasispecies within a viral population is also discussed to reflect virulence and its implications for RNA viruses. An understanding of how such events occur will provide further evidence about whether there are molecular determinants for plaque morphology of RNA viruses or whether different plaque phenotypes arise due to the presence of quasispecies within a population. Ultimately this review gives an insight into whether the intrinsically high error rates due to the low fidelity of RNA polymerases is responsible for the variation in plaque morphology and diversity in virulence. This can be a useful tool in characterizing mechanisms that facilitate virus adaptation and evolution.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.12014595300000001,-0.058749218,-0.039110299,0.098968931,0.015855539,0.008157211999999999,0.090702185,0.033590006,-0.059881755999999994,0.08502335300000001,0.08569819099999999,0.022334064,-0.008196693,-0.022060686,0.04566138,0.03127484,-0.063565114,-0.045102755,-0.077294873,0.008225956999999999,0.064352612,-0.052936300000000006,0.001130814,0.09955179800000001,-0.096219422,-0.008232610999999999,0.063168545,-0.050148193,-0.099741895,-0.08829036
1060,RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Speed and Fidelity are not the Only Determinants of the Mechanism or Efficiency of Recombination,"Using the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from poliovirus (PV) as our model system, we have shown that Lys-359 in motif-D functions as a general acid in the mechanism of nucleotidyl transfer. A K359H (KH) RdRp derivative is slow and faithful relative to wild-type enzyme. In the context of the KH virus, RdRp-coding sequence evolves, selecting for the following substitutions: I331F (IF, motif-C) and P356S (PS, motif-D). We have evaluated IF-KH, PS-KH, and IF-PS-KH viruses and enzymes. The speed and fidelity of each double mutant are equivalent. Each exhibits a unique recombination phenotype, with IF-KH being competent for copy-choice recombination and PS-KH being competent for forced-copy-choice recombination. Although the IF-PS-KH RdRp exhibits biochemical properties within twofold of wild type, the virus is impaired substantially for recombination in cells. We conclude that there are biochemical properties of the RdRp in addition to speed and fidelity that determine the mechanism and efficiency of recombination. The interwoven nature of speed, fidelity, the undefined property suggested here, and recombination makes it impossible to attribute a single property of the RdRp to fitness. However, the derivatives described here may permit elucidation of the importance of recombination on the fitness of the viral population in a background of constant polymerase speed and fidelity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.129478885,-0.039795109,-0.03435897,0.029734947,-0.009666312,-0.011486886000000002,0.06617364099999999,0.017403343999999998,-0.053500902999999995,0.042121251,0.10799651699999999,0.135372085,-0.093679552,-0.079523972,-0.006713295,0.031594835,-0.024349412,-0.057524732,-0.104172481,-0.072901239,0.15502021,-0.113793569,0.09545982300000001,0.060614892000000004,-0.026055827,0.072251725,0.058566364,-0.007153046999999999,-0.061365808,-0.046410963
1068,A case for a negative-strand coding sequence in a group of positive-sense RNA viruses,"Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses form the largest and most diverse group of eukaryote-infecting viruses. Their genomes comprise one or more segments of coding-sense RNA that function directly as messenger RNAs upon release into the cytoplasm of infected cells. Positive-sense RNA viruses are generally accepted to encode proteins solely on the positive strand. However, we previously identified a surprisingly long (∼1,000-codon) open reading frame (ORF) on the negative strand of some members of the family Narnaviridae which, together with RNA bacteriophages of the family Leviviridae, form a sister group to all other positive-sense RNA viruses. Here, we completed the genomes of three mosquito-associated narnaviruses, all of which have the long reverse-frame ORF. We systematically identified narnaviral sequences in public data sets from a wide range of sources, including arthropod, fungal, and plant transcriptomic data sets. Long reverse-frame ORFs are widespread in one clade of narnaviruses, where they frequently occupy >95 per cent of the genome. The reverse-frame ORFs correspond to a specific avoidance of CUA, UUA, and UCA codons (i.e. stop codon reverse complements) in the forward-frame RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ORF. However, absence of these codons cannot be explained by other factors such as inability to decode these codons or GC3 bias. Together with other analyses, we provide the strongest evidence yet of coding capacity on the negative strand of a positive-sense RNA virus. As these ORFs comprise some of the longest known overlapping genes, their study may be of broad relevance to understanding overlapping gene evolution and de novo origin of genes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.179421832,-0.052401223,-0.056301544,0.08921025699999999,0.111177974,-0.10512111,-0.084995349,0.075556288,-0.061818338,-0.03203889,-0.005931884,-0.041968924000000005,0.01547755,-0.009752408,0.006924001,-0.03923282,0.021581375,-0.021552957,0.014254738999999999,-0.0067455219999999995,-0.076479776,0.023736585,-0.124140506,0.006482774,-0.163127921,-0.097741644,0.030494087000000003,-0.041943163,-0.015978816,-0.07220900000000001
1071,A nucleobase-binding pocket in a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase contributes to elongation complex stability,"The enterovirus 71 (EV71) 3D(pol) is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that plays the central role in the viral genome replication, and is an important target in antiviral studies. Here, we report a crystal structure of EV71 3D(pol) elongation complex (EC) at 1.8 Å resolution. The structure reveals that the 5′-end guanosine of the downstream RNA template interacts with a fingers domain pocket, with the base sandwiched by H44 and R277 side chains through hydrophobic stacking interactions, and these interactions are still maintained after one in-crystal translocation event induced by nucleotide incorporation, implying that the pocket could regulate the functional properties of the polymerase by interacting with RNA. When mutated, residue R277 showed an impact on virus proliferation in virological studies with residue H44 having a synergistic effect. In vitro biochemical data further suggest that mutations at these two sites affect RNA binding, EC stability, but not polymerase catalytic rate (k(cat)) and apparent NTP affinity (K(M,NTP)). We propose that, although rarely captured by crystallography, similar surface pocket interaction with nucleobase may commonly exist in nucleic acid motor enzymes to facilitate their processivity.

1073,RNA decay during gammaherpesvirus infection reduces RNA polymerase II occupancy of host promoters but spares viral promoters,"In mammalian cells, widespread acceleration of cytoplasmic mRNA degradation is linked to impaired RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription. This mRNA decay-induced transcriptional repression occurs during infection with gammaherpesviruses including Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), which encode an mRNA endonuclease that initiates widespread RNA decay. Here, we show that MHV68-induced mRNA decay leads to a genome-wide reduction of Pol II occupancy at mammalian promoters. This reduced Pol II occupancy is accompanied by down-regulation of multiple Pol II subunits and TFIIB in the nucleus of infected cells, as revealed by mass spectrometry-based global measurements of protein abundance. Viral genes, despite the fact that they require Pol II for transcription, escape transcriptional repression. Protection is not governed by viral promoter sequences; instead, location on the viral genome is both necessary and sufficient to escape the transcriptional repression effects of mRNA decay. We propose a model in which the ability to escape from transcriptional repression is linked to the localization of viral DNA within replication compartments, providing a means for these viruses to counteract decay-induced transcript loss.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.135375774,-0.05969942,-0.024680615,-0.058305533,-0.080894334,0.002106663,0.01632121,-0.018371441000000002,0.037115632,-0.041217136,-0.050393882,-0.072664945,0.010484279,0.0965695,-0.015567422,0.040803754,-0.005988386,-0.115731221,-0.114137185,-0.021889739,0.015993906999999998,0.042235992,-0.05868653099999999,0.03182012,-0.012177056,-0.15290113800000002,-0.03291146,0.04371008,0.100706516,-0.044570797
1077,Hairpin structure within the 3′UTR of DNA polymerase β mRNA acts as a post-transcriptional regulatory element and interacts with Hax-1,"Aberrant expression of DNA polymerase β, a key enzyme involved in base excision repair, leads to genetic instability and carcinogenesis. Pol β expression has been previously shown to be regulated at the level of transcription, but there is also evidence of post-transcriptional regulation, since rat transcripts undergo alternative polyadenylation, and the resulting 3′UTR contain at least one regulatory element. Data presented here indicate that RNA of the short 3′UTR folds to form a strong secondary structure (hairpin). Its regulatory role was established utilizing a luciferase-based reporter system. Further studies led to the identification of a protein factor, which binds to this element—the anti-apoptotic, cytoskeleton-related protein Hax-1. The results of in vitro binding analysis indicate that the formation of the RNA–protein complex is significantly impaired by disruption of the hairpin motif. We demonstrate that Hax-1 binds to Pol β mRNA exclusively in the form of a dimer. Biochemical analysis revealed the presence of Hax-1 in mitochondria, but also in the nuclear matrix, which, along with its transcript-binding properties, suggests that Hax-1 plays a role in post-transcriptional regulation of expression of Pol β.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.17377867800000002,-0.051837522000000004,-0.029794776000000002,-0.056636527,-0.071305328,0.00115703,0.01006466,-0.02420532,0.025617451,-0.057343955,-0.066550945,-0.018682785,-0.009520809,0.033712192,-0.063926129,-0.015491752,0.038874206,-0.09346051699999999,-0.094111802,-0.052095447999999996,0.016929307,0.004540206,-0.021311445,0.0030779320000000002,-0.01748017,-0.07048710400000001,-0.019173506,0.036521701000000004,0.093483694,-0.054731479000000006
1079,The RNA polymerase activity of SARS-coronavirus nsp12 is primer dependent,"An RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is the central catalytic subunit of the RNA-synthesizing machinery of all positive-strand RNA viruses. Usually, RdRp domains are readily identifiable by comparative sequence analysis, but biochemical confirmation and characterization can be hampered by intrinsic protein properties and technical complications. It is presumed that replication and transcription of the ∼30-kb severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RNA genome are catalyzed by an RdRp domain in the C-terminal part of nonstructural protein 12 (nsp12), one of 16 replicase subunits. However, thus far full-length nsp12 has proven refractory to expression in bacterial systems, which has hindered both the biochemical characterization of coronavirus RNA synthesis and RdRp-targeted antiviral drug design. Here, we describe a combined strategy involving bacterial expression of an nsp12 fusion protein and its in vivo cleavage to generate and purify stable SARS-CoV nsp12 (106 kDa) with a natural N-terminus and C-terminal hexahistidine tag. This recombinant protein possesses robust in vitro RdRp activity, as well as a significant DNA-dependent activity that may facilitate future inhibitor studies.

1087,Genomic Characterization of a Newly Discovered Coronavirus Associated with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Humans,"A novel human coronavirus (HCoV-EMC/2012) was isolated from a man with acute pneumonia and renal failure in June 2012. This report describes the complete genome sequence, genome organization, and expression strategy of HCoV-EMC/2012 and its relation with known coronaviruses. The genome contains 30,119 nucleotides and contains at least 10 predicted open reading frames, 9 of which are predicted to be expressed from a nested set of seven subgenomic mRNAs. Phylogenetic analysis of the replicase gene of coronaviruses with completely sequenced genomes showed that HCoV-EMC/2012 is most closely related to Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 (BtCoV-HKU4) and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5 (BtCoV-HKU5), which prototype two species in lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus. In accordance with the guidelines of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, and in view of the 75% and 77% amino acid sequence identity in 7 conserved replicase domains with BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5, respectively, we propose that HCoV-EMC/2012 prototypes a novel species in the genus Betacoronavirus. HCoV-EMC/2012 may be most closely related to a coronavirus detected in Pipistrellus pipistrellus in The Netherlands, but because only a short sequence from the most conserved part of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-encoding region of the genome was reported for this bat virus, its genetic distance from HCoV-EMC remains uncertain.

1111,RNA methyltransferases involved in 5′ cap biosynthesis,"In eukaryotes and viruses that infect them, the 5′ end of mRNA molecules, and also many other functionally important RNAs, are modified to form a so-called cap structure that is important for interactions of these RNAs with many nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. The RNA cap has multiple roles in gene expression, including enhancement of RNA stability, splicing, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and translation initiation. Apart from guanosine addition to the 5′ end in the most typical cap structure common to transcripts produced by RNA polymerase II (in particular mRNA), essentially all cap modifications are due to methylation. The complexity of the cap structure and its formation can range from just a single methylation of the unprocessed 5′ end of the primary transcript, as in mammalian U6 and 7SK, mouse B2, and plant U3 RNAs, to an elaborate m(7)Gpppm(6,6)AmpAmpCmpm(3)Um structure at the 5′ end of processed RNA in trypanosomes, which are formed by as many as 8 methylation reactions. While all enzymes responsible for methylation of the cap structure characterized to date were found to belong to the same evolutionarily related and structurally similar Rossmann Fold Methyltransferase superfamily, that uses the same methyl group donor, S-adenosylmethionine; the enzymes also exhibit interesting differences that are responsible for their distinct functions. This review focuses on the evolutionary classification of enzymes responsible for cap methylation in RNA, with a focus on the sequence relationships and structural similarities and dissimilarities that provide the basis for understanding the mechanism of biosynthesis of different caps in cellular and viral RNAs. Particular attention is paid to the similarities and differences between methyltransferases from human cells and from human pathogens that may be helpful in the development of antiviral and antiparasitic drugs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14434934,-0.074376845,-0.066331867,0.023682612999999998,-0.025346507999999997,-0.061342447,-0.007563746,0.048480851,-0.08192250200000001,0.033726985,-0.066832009,-0.024519093999999998,0.034838106,-0.01323801,-0.057421779000000006,-0.018595648,-0.033413461,0.0059299159999999995,-0.086695121,0.074122995,-0.000803138,0.091448161,0.10847269,0.066451792,0.07156565,-0.135749161,-0.015261865,0.06637675,0.22501749199999999,0.004443628
1114,Viral Polymerase-Helicase Complexes Regulate Replication Fidelity To Overcome Intracellular Nucleotide Depletion,"To date, the majority of work on RNA virus replication fidelity has focused on the viral RNA polymerase, while the potential role of other viral replicase proteins in this process is poorly understood. Previous studies used resistance to broad-spectrum RNA mutagens, such as ribavirin, to identify polymerases with increased fidelity that avoid misincorporation of such base analogues. We identified a novel variant in the alphavirus viral helicase/protease, nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) that operates in concert with the viral polymerase nsP4 to further alter replication complex fidelity, a functional linkage that was conserved among the alphavirus genus. Purified chikungunya virus nsP2 presented delayed helicase activity of the high-fidelity enzyme, and yet purified replication complexes manifested stronger RNA polymerization kinetics. Because mutagenic nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin also affect intracellular nucleotide pools, we addressed the link between nucleotide depletion and replication fidelity by using purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors. High-fidelity viruses were more resistant to these conditions, and viral growth could be rescued by the addition of exogenous nucleosides, suggesting that mutagenesis by base analogues requires nucleotide pool depletion. This study describes a novel function for nsP2, highlighting the role of other components of the replication complex in regulating viral replication fidelity, and suggests that viruses can alter their replication complex fidelity to overcome intracellular nucleotide-depleting conditions. IMPORTANCE Previous studies using the RNA mutagen ribavirin to select for drug-resistant variants have highlighted the essential role of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in regulating replication fidelity. However, the role of other viral replicase components in replication fidelity has not been studied in detail. We identified here an RNA mutagen-resistant variant of the nsP2 helicase/protease that conferred increased fidelity and yet could not operate in the same manner as high-fidelity polymerases. We show that the alphavirus helicase is a key component of the fidelity-regulating machinery. Our data show that the RNA mutagenic activity of compounds such as ribavirin is coupled to and potentiated by nucleotide depletion and that RNA viruses can fine-tune their replication fidelity when faced with an intracellular environment depleted of nucleotides.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.20891020100000002,-0.069599124,-0.1006779,0.12465738800000001,-0.09197278699999999,-0.02052133,0.103543594,0.023733782999999998,-0.04166579,0.084401154,0.125505228,0.094807146,-0.086397565,0.004194208,-0.007481341,0.010028756,-0.016161018,-0.025401611,-0.05651256599999999,0.0035146170000000003,0.08271625,-0.047097072000000004,0.047038138,0.08663277800000001,-0.01561065,0.076422294,0.035333139,-0.079748158,-0.10019759199999999,-0.10558695400000001
1117,Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes: A Functional Genomics Tool for the Study of Positive-strand RNA Viruses,"Reverse genetics, an approach to rescue infectious virus entirely from a cloned cDNA, has revolutionized the field of positive-strand RNA viruses, whose genomes have the same polarity as cellular mRNA. The cDNA-based reverse genetics system is a seminal method that enables direct manipulation of the viral genomic RNA, thereby generating recombinant viruses for molecular and genetic studies of both viral RNA elements and gene products in viral replication and pathogenesis. It also provides a valuable platform that allows the development of genetically defined vaccines and viral vectors for the delivery of foreign genes. For many positive-strand RNA viruses such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), however, the cloned cDNAs are unstable, posing a major obstacle to the construction and propagation of the functional cDNA. Here, the present report describes the strategic considerations in creating and amplifying a genetically stable full-length infectious JEV cDNA as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) using the following general experimental procedures: viral RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, cDNA subcloning and modification, assembly of a full-length cDNA, cDNA linearization, in vitro RNA synthesis, and virus recovery. This protocol provides a general methodology applicable to cloning full-length cDNA for a range of positive-strand RNA viruses, particularly those with a genome of >10 kb in length, into a BAC vector, from which infectious RNAs can be transcribed in vitro with a bacteriophage RNA polymerase.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.180779227,-0.063611187,-0.01861597,0.120565134,0.012252718999999999,-0.086198951,-0.063048584,0.02721694,-0.041955967000000004,0.075283785,0.041208241,-0.077956042,0.048665772,0.038490975,0.062057691,0.026128311,-0.05460477,-0.01119328,-0.019241926,0.019115694,-0.061728294,0.018494636000000002,-0.00762538,-0.023414661,-0.072759172,-0.046331504,0.01679899,-0.013415073999999999,-0.045162217000000004,0.078089913

Previous studies have shown that SIRT7 is required for RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription and pre-rRNA processing. Here, we took a proteomic approach to identify novel molecular targets and characterize the role of SIRT7 in non-nucleolar processes. We show that SIRT7 interacts with numerous proteins involved in transcriptional regulation and RNA metabolism, the majority of interactions requiring ongoing transcription. In addition to its role in Pol I transcription, we found that SIRT7 also regulates transcription of snoRNAs and mRNAs. Mechanistically, SIRT7 promotes the release of P-TEFb from the inactive 7SK snRNP complex and deacetylates CDK9, a subunit of the elongation factor P-TEFb, which activates transcription by phosphorylating serine 2 within the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II.

1150,"Stimulation of reverse transcriptase generated cDNAs with specific indels by template RNA structure: retrotransposon, dNTP balance, RT-reagent usage","RNA dependent DNA-polymerases, reverse transcriptases, are key enzymes for retroviruses and retroelements. Their fidelity, including indel generation, is significant for their use as reagents including for deep sequencing. Here, we report that certain RNA template structures and G-rich sequences, ahead of diverse reverse transcriptases can be strong stimulators for slippage at slippage-prone template motif sequence 3′ of such ‘slippage-stimulatory’ structures. Where slippage is stimulated, the resulting products have one or more additional base(s) compared to the corresponding template motif. Such structures also inhibit slippage-mediated base omission which can be more frequent in the absence of a relevant stem–loop. Slippage directionality, base insertion and omission, is sensitive to the relative concentration ratio of dNTPs specified by the RNA template slippage-prone sequence and its 5′ adjacent base. The retrotransposon-derived enzyme TGIRT exhibits more slippage in vitro than the retroviral enzymes tested including that from HIV. Structure-mediated slippage may be exhibited by other polymerases and enrich gene expression. A cassette from Drosophila retrotransposon Dme1_chrX_2630566, a candidate for utilizing slippage for its GagPol synthesis, exhibits strong slippage in vitro.

1154,Low-fidelity Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus polymerase mutants to improve live-attenuated vaccine safety and efficacy,"During RNA virus replication, there is the potential to incorporate mutations that affect virulence or pathogenesis. For live-attenuated vaccines, this has implications for stability, as replication may result in mutations that either restore the wild-type phenotype via reversion or compensate for the attenuating mutations by increasing virulence (pseudoreversion). Recent studies have demonstrated that altering the mutation rate of an RNA virus is an effective attenuation tool. To validate the safety of low-fidelity mutations to increase vaccine attenuation, several mutations in the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) were tested in the live-attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus vaccine strain, TC-83. Next generation sequencing after passage in the presence of mutagens revealed a mutant containing three mutations in the RdRp, TC-83 3x, to have decreased replication fidelity, while a second mutant, TC-83 4x displayed no change in fidelity, but shared many phenotypic characteristics with TC-83 3x. Both mutants exhibited increased, albeit inconsistent attenuation in an infant mouse model, as well as increased immunogenicity and complete protection against lethal challenge of an adult murine model compared with the parent TC-83. During serial passaging in a highly permissive model, the mutants increased in virulence but remained less virulent than the parent TC-83. These results suggest that the incorporation of low-fidelity mutations into the RdRp of live-attenuated vaccines for RNA viruses can confer increased immunogenicity whilst showing some evidence of increased attenuation. However, while in theory such constructs may result in more effective vaccines, the instability of the vaccine phenotype decreases the likelihood of this being an effective vaccine strategy.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.145967306,-0.050388947999999996,-0.050388370999999994,0.045668072000000004,-0.02590722,0.026750196,0.055779802999999996,0.009313690999999999,-0.02809834,0.062785783,0.126645504,0.09654275,-0.11624066599999999,-0.036652305,0.008881289,0.02783725,-0.06419437,-0.044564935,-0.09036083,-0.011854848999999999,0.152118173,-0.09889587300000001,0.096386494,0.102302395,-0.017158882,0.060718771,0.043323664000000005,-0.058220352,-0.088528314,-0.094032978

1201,Nucleolus: the fascinating nuclear body,"Nucleoli are the prominent contrasted structures of the cell nucleus. In the nucleolus, ribosomal RNAs are synthesized, processed and assembled with ribosomal proteins. RNA polymerase I synthesizes the ribosomal RNAs and this activity is cell cycle regulated. The nucleolus reveals the functional organization of the nucleus in which the compartmentation of the different steps of ribosome biogenesis is observed whereas the nucleolar machineries are in permanent exchange with the nucleoplasm and other nuclear bodies. After mitosis, nucleolar assembly is a time and space regulated process controlled by the cell cycle. In addition, by generating a large volume in the nucleus with apparently no RNA polymerase II activity, the nucleolus creates a domain of retention/sequestration of molecules normally active outside the nucleolus. Viruses interact with the nucleolus and recruit nucleolar proteins to facilitate virus replication. The nucleolus is also a sensor of stress due to the redistribution of the ribosomal proteins in the nucleoplasm by nucleolus disruption. The nucleolus plays several crucial functions in the nucleus: in addition to its function as ribosome factory of the cells it is a multifunctional nuclear domain, and nucleolar activity is linked with several pathologies.

1241,In vitro RNA interference targeting the DNA polymerase gene inhibits orf virus replication in primary ovine fetal turbinate cells,"Orf, which is caused by orf virus (ORFV), is distributed worldwide and is endemic in most sheep- and/or goat-raising countries. RNA interference (RNAi) pathways have emerged as important regulators of virus-host cell interactions. In this study, the specific effect of RNAi on the replication of ORFV was explored. The application of RNA interference (RNAi) inhibited the replication of ORFV in cell culture by targeting the ORF025 gene of ORFV, which encodes the viral polymerase. Three small interfering RNA (siRNA) (named siRNA704, siRNA1017 and siRNA1388) were prepared by in vitro transcription. The siRNAs were evaluated for antiviral activity against the ORFV Jilin isolate by the observation of cytopathic effects (CPE), virus titration, and real-time PCR. After 48 h of infection, siRNA704, siRNA1017 and siRNA1388 reduced virus titers by 59- to 199-fold and reduced the level of viral replication by 73-89 %.

1242,Common and unique features of viral RNA-dependent polymerases,"Eukaryotes and bacteria can be infected with a wide variety of RNA viruses. On average, these pathogens share little sequence similarity and use different replication and transcription strategies. Nevertheless, the members of nearly all RNA virus families depend on the activity of a virally encoded RNA-dependent polymerase for the condensation of nucleotide triphosphates.

1258,Stable Occupancy of the Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus-Encoded Deubiquitinase Blocks Viral Infection,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) infection can result in a severe hemorrhagic syndrome for which there are no antiviral interventions available to date. Certain RNA viruses, such as CCHFV, encode cysteine proteases of the ovarian tumor (OTU) family that antagonize interferon (IFN) production by deconjugating ubiquitin (Ub). The OTU of CCHFV, a negative-strand RNA virus, is dispensable for replication of the viral genome, despite being part of the large viral RNA polymerase. Here, we show that mutations that prevent binding of the OTU to cellular ubiquitin are required for the generation of recombinant CCHFV containing a mutated catalytic cysteine. Similarly, the high-affinity binding of a synthetic ubiquitin variant (UbV-CC4) to CCHFV OTU strongly inhibits viral growth. UbV-CC4 inhibits CCHFV infection even in the absence of intact IFN signaling, suggesting that its antiviral activity is not due to blocking the OTU’s immunosuppressive function. Instead, the prolonged occupancy of the OTU with UbV-CC4 directly targets viral replication by interfering with CCHFV RNA synthesis. Together, our data provide mechanistic details supporting the development of antivirals targeting viral OTUs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.113670934,-0.043506815,-0.047272771,0.007723158000000001,-0.082706223,0.012169521,0.045563343,0.009936643,0.018917114,0.023001429,0.024104224,-0.0048855059999999995,-0.011752061999999999,0.030124962,0.007779898,0.013963554,-0.010377189,0.0064473609999999995,-0.0008651860000000001,0.029453755,-0.014263205,0.024900311,-0.041896237,-0.006025091999999999,0.014541688,-0.004289177,0.013675193,-0.017465986,-0.001804721,0.010710994
1261,Direct RNA nanopore sequencing of full-length coronavirus genomes provides novel insights into structural variants and enables modification analysis,"Sequence analyses of RNA virus genomes remain challenging owing to the exceptional genetic plasticity of these viruses. Because of high mutation and recombination rates, genome replication by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases leads to populations of closely related viruses, so-called “quasispecies.” Standard (short-read) sequencing technologies are ill-suited to reconstruct large numbers of full-length haplotypes of (1) RNA virus genomes and (2) subgenome-length (sg) RNAs composed of noncontiguous genome regions. Here, we used a full-length, direct RNA sequencing (DRS) approach based on nanopores to characterize viral RNAs produced in cells infected with a human coronavirus. By using DRS, we were able to map the longest (∼26-kb) contiguous read to the viral reference genome. By combining Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing, we reconstructed a highly accurate consensus sequence of the human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E genome (27.3 kb). Furthermore, by using long reads that did not require an assembly step, we were able to identify, in infected cells, diverse and novel HCoV-229E sg RNAs that remain to be characterized. Also, the DRS approach, which circumvents reverse transcription and amplification of RNA, allowed us to detect methylation sites in viral RNAs. Our work paves the way for haplotype-based analyses of viral quasispecies by showing the feasibility of intra-sample haplotype separation. Even though several technical challenges remain to be addressed to exploit the potential of the nanopore technology fully, our work illustrates that DRS may significantly advance genomic studies of complex virus populations, including predictions on long-range interactions in individual full-length viral RNA haplotypes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.17947484100000002,-0.046265334000000005,-0.042218393,0.137840758,0.08165566,-0.10135606400000001,0.013117677,0.032673183,-0.017142304,0.040956176000000004,0.011756486000000002,0.045426577999999995,0.166817979,0.066634206,0.05631423,0.061046435999999996,-0.115366001,-0.00904013,-0.078345227,0.042830902000000004,-0.022027012000000002,0.013357731999999999,-0.017211088,0.014407782,-0.083850937,-0.08613962900000001,0.080023067,0.005644893000000001,-0.058246516,0.057892512
1262,Identification and Characterization of a Human Coronavirus 229E Nonstructural Protein 8-Associated RNA 3′-Terminal Adenylyltransferase Activity,"Coronavirus nonstructural protein 8 (nsp8) has been suggested to have diverse activities, including noncanonical template-dependent polymerase activities. Here, we characterized a recombinant form of the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) nsp8 and found that the protein has metal ion-dependent RNA 3′-terminal adenylyltransferase (TATase) activity, while other nucleotides were not (or very inefficiently) transferred to the 3′ ends of single-stranded and (fully) double-stranded acceptor RNAs. Using partially double-stranded RNAs, very efficient TATase activity was observed if the opposite (template) strand contained a short 5′ oligo(U) sequence, while very little (if any) activity was detected for substrates with other homopolymeric or heteropolymeric sequences in the 5′ overhang. The oligo(U)-assisted/templated TATase activity on partial-duplex RNAs was confirmed for two other coronavirus nsp8 proteins, suggesting that the activity is conserved among coronaviruses. Replacement of a conserved Lys residue with Ala abolished the in vitro RNA-binding and TATase activities of nsp8 and caused a nonviable phenotype when the corresponding mutation was introduced into the HCoV-229E genome, confirming that these activities are mediated by nsp8 and critical for viral replication. In additional experiments, we obtained evidence that nsp8 has a pronounced specificity for adenylate and is unable to incorporate guanylate into RNA products, which strongly argues against the previously proposed template-dependent RNA polymerase activity of this protein. Given the presence of an oligo(U) stretch at the 5′ end of coronavirus minus-strand RNAs, it is tempting to speculate (but remains to be confirmed) that the nsp8-mediated TATase activity is involved in the 3′ polyadenylation of viral plus-strand RNAs. IMPORTANCE Previously, coronavirus nsp8 proteins were suggested to have template-dependent RNA polymerase activities resembling those of RNA primases or even canonical RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, while more recent studies have suggested an essential cofactor function of nsp8 (plus nsp7) for nsp12-mediated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. In an effort to reconcile conflicting data from earlier studies, the study revisits coronavirus nsp8-associated activities using additional controls and proteins. The data obtained for three coronavirus nsp8 proteins provide evidence that the proteins share metal ion-dependent RNA 3′ polyadenylation activities that are greatly stimulated by a short oligo(U) stretch in the template strand. In contrast, nsp8 was found to be unable to select and incorporate appropriate (matching) nucleotides to produce cRNA products from heteropolymeric and other homooligomeric templates. While confirming the critical role of nsp8 in coronavirus replication, the study amends the list of activities mediated by coronavirus nsp8 proteins in the absence of other proteins.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.208416501,-0.021516677999999997,-0.100741425,0.09919168099999999,0.001210805,-0.095514352,-0.006685384,0.01342207,-0.012857496999999999,-0.030742536,0.051834390999999994,0.109657449,0.043118294,0.030317957000000003,-0.023651053,0.025391776,0.039821432000000004,-0.032919664,0.0016626820000000002,0.011952391000000001,-0.060442607999999995,0.014527501000000002,0.006315156999999999,-0.09290020199999999,0.051566709,0.008482928,-0.06833565,0.045991212000000004,0.0048662259999999995,0.026271056
1271,Identification of Nonstructural Protein 8 as the N-Terminus of the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a member within the family Arteriviridae of the order Nidovirales. Replication of this positive-stranded RNA virus within the host cell involves expression of viral replicase proteins encoded by two ORFs, namely ORF1a and ORF1b. In particular, translation of ORF1b depends on a -1-ribosomal frameshift strategy. Thus, nonstructural protein 9 (nsp9), the first protein within ORF1b that specifies the function of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is expressed as the C-terminal extension of nsp8, a small nsp that is encoded by ORF1a. However, it has remained unclear whether the mature form of nsp9 in virus-infected cells still retains nsp8, addressing which is clearly critical to understand the biological function of nsp9. By taking advantage of specific antibodies to both nsp8 and nsp9, we report the following findings. (1) In infected cells, PRRSV nsp9 was identified as a major product with a size between 72 and 95 kDa (72–95 KDa form), which exhibited the similar mobility on the gel to the in vitro expressed nsp8–9(ORF1b), but not the ORF1b-coded portion (nsp9(ORF1b)). (2) The antibodies to nsp8, but not to nsp7 or nsp10, could detect a major product that had the similar mobility to the 72–95 KDa form of nsp9. Moreover, nsp9 could be co-immunoprecipitated by antibodies to nsp8, and vice versa. (3) Neither nsp4 nor nsp2 PLP2 was able to cleave nsp8–nsp9 in vitro. Together, our studies provide experimental evidence to suggest that nsp8 is an N-terminal extension of nsp9. Our findings here paves way for further charactering the biological function of PRRSV nsp9.

1272,ADP-ribosyl–binding and hydrolase activities of the alphavirus nsP3 macrodomain are critical for initiation of virus replication,"Alphaviruses are plus-strand RNA viruses that cause encephalitis, rash, and arthritis. The nonstructural protein (nsP) precursor polyprotein is translated from genomic RNA and processed into four nsPs. nsP3 has a highly conserved macrodomain (MD) that binds ADP-ribose (ADPr), which can be conjugated to protein as a posttranslational modification involving transfer of ADPr from NAD(+) by poly ADPr polymerases (PARPs). The nsP3(MD) also removes ADPr from mono ADP-ribosylated (MARylated) substrates. To determine which aspects of alphavirus replication require nsP3(MD) ADPr-binding and/or hydrolysis function, we studied NSC34 neuronal cells infected with chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Infection induced ADP-ribosylation of cellular proteins without increasing PARP expression, and inhibition of MARylation decreased virus replication. CHIKV with a G32S mutation that reduced ADPr-binding and hydrolase activities was less efficient than WT CHIKV in establishing infection and in producing nsPs, dsRNA, viral RNA, and infectious virus. CHIKV with a Y114A mutation that increased ADPr binding but reduced hydrolase activity, established infection like WT CHIKV, rapidly induced nsP translation, and shut off host protein synthesis with reduced amplification of dsRNA. To assess replicase function independent of virus infection, a transreplicase system was used. Mutant nsP3(MD)s D10A, G32E, and G112E with no binding or hydrolase activity had no replicase activity, G32S had little, and Y114A was intermediate to WT. Therefore, ADP ribosylation of proteins and nsP3(MD) ADPr binding are necessary for initiation of alphavirus replication, while hydrolase activity facilitates amplification of replication complexes. These observations are consistent with observed nsP3(MD) conservation and limited tolerance for mutation.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.139796148,-0.052164819,-0.039277166,0.007826663000000001,-0.09138210000000001,0.009529618,0.036628963,-0.014261718,0.032215466,-0.010297812,-0.003294977,0.01819871,-0.024009036,0.03052599,-0.023662792000000002,0.013915812,0.043219034,-0.052170380999999995,-0.004668964,0.047591312000000004,-0.016969046,0.011652418000000001,-0.006941347,-0.057863042,0.046512063,0.048438475,-0.041596726,0.013042738,-0.028678856000000003,-0.022066459
1273,From APOBEC to ZAP: Diverse mechanisms used by cellular restriction factors to inhibit virus infections,"Antiviral restriction factors are cellular proteins that inhibit the entry, replication, or spread of viruses. These proteins are critical components of the innate immune system and function to limit the severity and host range of virus infections. Here we review the current knowledge on the mechanisms of action of several restriction factors that affect multiple viruses at distinct stages of their life cycles. For example, APOBEC3G deaminates cytosines to hypermutate reverse transcribed viral DNA; IFITM3 alters membranes to inhibit virus membrane fusion; MXA/B oligomerize on viral protein complexes to inhibit virus replication; SAMHD1 decreases dNTP intracellular concentrations to prevent reverse transcription of retrovirus genomes; tetherin prevents release of budding virions from cells; Viperin catalyzes formation of a nucleoside analogue that inhibits viral RNA polymerases; and ZAP binds virus RNAs to target them for degradation. We also discuss countermeasures employed by specific viruses against these restriction factors, and mention secondary functions of several of these factors in modulating immune responses.

1277,Contribution of a Multifunctional Polymerase Region of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus to Lethal Mutagenesis,"Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) are major determinants of high mutation rates and generation of mutant spectra that mediate RNA virus adaptability. The RdRp of the picornavirus foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), termed 3D, is a multifunctional protein that includes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in its N-terminal region. Previous studies documented that some amino acid substitutions within the NLS altered nucleotide recognition and enhanced the incorporation of the mutagenic purine analogue ribavirin in viral RNA, but the mutants tested were not viable and their response to lethal mutagenesis could not be studied. Here we demonstrate that NLS amino acid substitution M16A of FMDV serotype C does not affect infectious virus production but accelerates ribavirin-mediated virus extinction. The mutant 3D displays polymerase activity, RNA binding, and copying processivity that are similar to those of the wild-type enzyme but shows increased ribavirin-triphosphate incorporation. Crystal structures of the mutant 3D in the apo and RNA-bound forms reveal an expansion of the template entry channel due to the replacement of the bulky Met by Ala. This is a major difference with other 3D mutants with altered nucleotide analogue recognition. Remarkably, two distinct loop β9-α11 conformations distinguish 3Ds that exhibit higher or lower ribavirin incorporation than the wild-type enzyme. This difference identifies a specific molecular determinant of ribavirin sensitivity of FMDV. Comparison of several polymerase mutants indicates that different domains of the molecule can modify nucleotide recognition and response to lethal mutagenesis. The connection of this observation with current views on quasispecies adaptability is discussed. IMPORTANCE The nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) polymerase includes residues that modulate the sensitivity to mutagenic agents. Here we have described a viable NLS mutant with an amino acid replacement that facilitates virus extinction by ribavirin. The corresponding polymerase shows increased incorporation of ribavirin triphosphate and local structural modifications that implicate the template entry channel. Specifically, comparison of the structures of ribavirin-sensitive and ribavirin-resistant FMDV polymerases has identified loop β9-α11 conformation as a determinant of sensitivity to ribavirin mutagenesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.147062221,-0.045184965,-0.017932481,0.03730446,-0.049551222,-0.001310125,0.035826662,0.007803613,-0.01362959,0.034272458,0.041276903999999996,0.07195626299999999,-0.045152327,-0.066431016,-0.024165821,-0.012837265,0.002124795,0.008406629,-0.051903208,-0.011579606000000001,0.058624012999999996,-0.082550435,0.026256541,0.068630094,0.012713293999999998,0.040920159,0.00727094,-0.009276234,-0.04590303,-0.028070334
1279,Strand-Specific Dual RNA Sequencing of Bronchial Epithelial Cells Infected with Influenza A/H3N2 Viruses Reveals Splicing of Gene Segment 6 and Novel Host-Virus Interactions,"Host-influenza virus interplay at the transcript level has been extensively characterized in epithelial cells. Yet, there are no studies that simultaneously characterize human host and influenza A virus (IAV) genomes. We infected human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells with two seasonal IAV/H3N2 strains, Brisbane/10/07 and Perth/16/09 (reference strains for past vaccine seasons) and the well-characterized laboratory strain Udorn/307/72. Strand-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of the infected BEAS-2B cells allowed for simultaneous analysis of host and viral transcriptomes, in addition to pathogen genomes, to reveal changes in mRNA expression and alternative splicing (AS). In general, patterns of global and immune gene expression induced by the three IAVs were mostly shared. However, AS of host transcripts and small nuclear RNAs differed between the seasonal and laboratory strains. Analysis of viral transcriptomes showed deletions of the polymerase components (defective interfering-like RNAs) within the genome. Surprisingly, we found that the neuraminidase gene undergoes AS and that the splicing event differs between seasonal and laboratory strains. Our findings reveal novel elements of the host-virus interaction and highlight the importance of RNA-seq in identifying molecular changes at the genome level that may contribute to shaping RNA-based innate immunity. IMPORTANCE The use of massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has revealed insights into human and pathogen genomes and their evolution. Dual RNA-seq allows simultaneous dissection of host and pathogen genomes and strand-specific RNA-seq provides information about the polarity of the RNA. This is important in the case of negative-strand RNA viruses like influenza virus, which generate positive (complementary and mRNA) and negative-strand RNAs (genome) that differ in their potential to trigger innate immunity.

1282,N-terminal acetylation by NatB is required for the shutoff activity of influenza A virus PA-X,"N-terminal acetylation is a major posttranslational modification in eukaryotes catalyzed by N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs), NatA through NatF. Although N-terminal acetylation modulates diverse protein functions, little is known about its roles in virus replication. We found that NatB, which comprises NAA20 and NAA25, is involved in the shutoff activity of influenza virus PA-X. The shutoff activity of PA-X was suppressed in NatB-deficient cells, and PA-X mutants that are not acetylated by NatB showed reduced shutoff activities. We also evaluated the importance of N-terminal acetylation of PA, because PA-X shares its N-terminal sequence with PA. Viral polymerase activity was reduced in NatB-deficient cells. Moreover, mutant PAs that are not acetylated by NatB lost their function in the viral polymerase complex. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that N-terminal acetylation is required for the shutoff activity of PA-X and for viral polymerase activity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.11334362199999999,-0.070299796,-0.044285886,0.0055292169999999995,-0.07672908099999999,0.079495365,-0.00012493,-0.015112493999999999,0.024746804,-0.04388492,-0.020474702,0.005737951,-0.024184459,0.03859496,-0.01794391,-0.001250355,0.039117362,-0.042803645,-0.005895429000000001,0.006864184000000001,0.019387589,0.01577269,0.015252968,-0.022968173999999997,0.02581058,0.054419852000000005,-0.019591495,0.015226517,0.00728145,0.024419673
1294,Human Norovirus NS3 Has RNA Helicase and Chaperoning Activities,"RNA-remodeling proteins, including RNA helicases and chaperones, act to remodel RNA structures and/or protein-RNA interactions and are required for all processes involving RNAs. Although many viruses encode RNA helicases and chaperones, their in vitro activities and their roles in infected cells largely remain elusive. Noroviruses are a diverse group of positive-strand RNA viruses in the family Caliciviridae and constitute a significant and potentially fatal threat to human health. Here, we report that the protein NS3 encoded by human norovirus has both ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity that unwinds RNA helices and ATP-independent RNA-chaperoning activity that can remodel structured RNAs and facilitate strand annealing. Moreover, NS3 can facilitate viral RNA synthesis in vitro by norovirus polymerase. NS3 may therefore play an important role in norovirus RNA replication. Lastly, we demonstrate that the RNA-remodeling activity of NS3 is inhibited by guanidine hydrochloride, an FDA-approved compound, and, more importantly, that it reduces the replication of the norovirus replicon in cultured human cells. Altogether, these findings are the first to demonstrate the presence of RNA-remodeling activities encoded by Caliciviridae and highlight the functional significance of NS3 in the noroviral life cycle. IMPORTANCE Noroviruses are a diverse group of positive-strand RNA viruses, which annually cause hundreds of millions of human infections and over 200,000 deaths worldwide. For RNA viruses, cellular or virus-encoded RNA helicases and/or chaperones have long been considered to play pivotal roles in viral life cycles. However, neither RNA helicase nor chaperoning activity has been demonstrated to be associated with any norovirus-encoded proteins, and it is also unknown whether norovirus replication requires the participation of any viral or cellular RNA helicases/chaperones. We found that a norovirus protein, NS3, not only has ATP-dependent helicase activity, but also acts as an ATP-independent RNA chaperone. Also, NS3 can facilitate in vitro viral RNA synthesis, suggesting the important role of NS3 in norovirus replication. Moreover, NS3 activities can be inhibited by an FDA-approved compound, which also suppresses norovirus replicon replication in human cells, raising the possibility that NS3 could be a target for antinoroviral drug development.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.221171317,-0.07083606099999999,-0.098558089,0.130785197,-0.062295907000000005,-0.069187727,0.051467180999999994,0.031685844,-0.024364884,0.021931365,0.071599779,0.030193783999999998,-0.019263023,0.074584745,0.014552258,-0.003003579,-0.001690536,0.026409352999999997,0.075121221,0.035560141,-0.038267507,0.067229494,-0.065600109,-0.042153115,0.001050297,-0.025164798,-0.019768538000000002,-0.011056274,0.006474354,0.015270545
1298,Structural and molecular basis of mismatch correction and ribavirin excision from coronavirus RNA,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) stand out among RNA viruses because of their unusually large genomes (∼30 kb) associated with low mutation rates. CoVs code for nsp14, a bifunctional enzyme carrying RNA cap guanine N7-methyltransferase (MTase) and 3′-5′ exoribonuclease (ExoN) activities. ExoN excises nucleotide mismatches at the RNA 3′-end in vitro, and its inactivation in vivo jeopardizes viral genetic stability. Here, we demonstrate for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV an RNA synthesis and proofreading pathway through association of nsp14 with the low-fidelity nsp12 viral RNA polymerase. Through this pathway, the antiviral compound ribavirin 5′-monophosphate is significantly incorporated but also readily excised from RNA, which may explain its limited efficacy in vivo. The crystal structure at 3.38 Å resolution of SARS-CoV nsp14 in complex with its cofactor nsp10 adds to the uniqueness of CoVs among RNA viruses: The MTase domain presents a new fold that differs sharply from the canonical Rossmann fold.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.162422835,0.15192951300000002,-0.19452100100000003,0.150549997,0.026052742,-0.046191027999999995,0.087149506,-0.009371963,-0.088147361,0.033521992,0.072793039,0.014280093999999998,-0.056716906,-0.010117622,-0.016918428,0.042083744000000006,-0.019828131000000002,-0.015624125,-0.026633976,0.029669029,0.015758636,-0.03888696,0.11229776,0.064375488,0.026208889,5.6999999999999996e-05,-0.057692004000000005,-0.031083324,0.027092002,-0.061535337999999995
1301,Nuclear TRIM25 specifically targets influenza virus ribonucleoproteins to block the onset of RNA chain elongation,"TRIM25 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that activates RIG-I to promote the anti-viral interferon response. The NS1 protein from all strains of influenza A virus bind TRIM25, although not all virus strains block the interferon response, suggesting alternative mechanisms for TRIM25 action. Here we present a nuclear role for TRIM25 in specifically restricting influenza A virus replication. TRIM25 inhibits viral RNA synthesis through a direct mechanism, independent of its ubiquitin ligase activity and the interferon pathway. This activity can be inhibited by the viral NS1 protein. TRIM25 inhibition of viral RNA synthesis results from its binding to viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs), the structures containing individual viral RNA segments, the viral polymerase, and multiple viral nucleoproteins. TRIM25 binding does not inhibit initiation of capped RNA-primed viral mRNA synthesis by the viral polymerase. Rather, the onset of RNA chain elongation is inhibited because TRIM25 prohibits the movement of RNA into the polymerase complex.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.183771238,-0.104476486,-0.10073545800000001,0.152440905,-0.11721221,0.024694872000000003,-0.003753904,0.001035633,-0.008408379,0.040586376,0.05119371599999999,-0.040990523,-0.00022672599999999998,0.10914418,-0.007442280999999999,-0.016422224,0.014592313999999999,-0.034899655,0.006181267,0.05889504,-0.058511123,0.090668135,-0.048319851,-0.014925727,0.018238921,-0.049306975,0.011788014,-0.030581587,0.008711347,0.140502508
1308,Zinc Finger-Containing Cellular Transcription Corepressor ZBTB25 Promotes Influenza Virus RNA Transcription and Is a Target for Zinc Ejector Drugs,"Influenza A virus (IAV) replication relies on an intricate interaction between virus and host cells. How the cellular proteins are usurped for IAV replication remains largely obscure. The aim of this study was to search for novel and potential cellular factors that participate in IAV replication. ZBTB25, a transcription repressor of a variety of cellular genes, was identified by an RNA interference (RNAi) genomic library screen. Depletion of ZBTB25 significantly reduced IAV production. Conversely, overexpression of ZBTB25 enhanced it. ZBTB25 interacted with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein and modulated its transcription activity. In addition, ZBTB25 also functioned as a viral RNA (vRNA)-binding protein, binding preferentially to the U-rich sequence within the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of vRNA. Both protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions involving ZBTB25 facilitated viral RNA transcription and replication. In addition, ZBTB25 suppressed interferon production, further enhancing viral replication. ZBTB25-associated functions required an intact zinc finger domain and posttranslational SUMO-1 modification of ZBTB25. Furthermore, treatment with disulfiram (a zinc ejector) of ZBTB25-overexpressing cells showed significantly reduced IAV production as a result of reduced RNA synthesis. Our findings indicate that IAV usurps ZBTB25 for IAV RNA synthesis and serves as a novel and potential therapeutic antiviral target. IMPORTANCE IAV-induced seasonal influenza causes severe illness and death in high-risk populations. However, IAV has developed resistance to current antiviral drugs due to its high mutation rate. Therefore, development of drugs targeting cellular factors required for IAV replication is an attractive alternative for IAV therapy. Here, we discovered a cellular protein, ZBTB25, that enhances viral RdRp activity by binding to both viral RdRp and viral RNA to stimulate viral RNA synthesis. A unique feature of ZBTB25 in the regulation of viral replication is its dual transcription functions, namely, promoting viral RNA transcription through binding to the U-rich region of vRNA and suppressing cellular interferon production. ZBTB25 contains a zinc finger domain that is required for RNA-inhibitory activity by chelating zinc ions. Disulfiram treatment disrupts the zinc finger functions, effectively repressing IAV replication. Based on our findings, we demonstrate that ZBTB25 regulates IAV RNA transcription and replication and serves as a promising antiviral target for IAV treatment.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.162473678,-0.062574459,-0.07169122,0.064590032,-0.105111875,0.020624326999999998,0.028316096000000002,0.002122505,0.008019156999999999,0.007711371,0.035561063999999996,0.011379063,-0.033425422,0.064160172,-0.007882003,0.005835231,0.006764476,-0.006510791,-0.003433474,0.032870411,-0.025297552,0.047134669000000004,-0.019699762,-0.04100235,0.024856916,-0.003227422,0.026109482000000003,-0.010517335,0.035916238999999996,0.057869702
1310,Partially Uncleaved Alphavirus Replicase Forms Spherule Structures in the Presence and Absence of RNA Template,"Alphaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses expressing their replicase as a polyprotein, P1234, which is cleaved to four final products, nonstructural proteins nsP1 to nsP4. The replicase proteins together with viral RNA and host factors form membrane invaginations termed spherules, which act as the replication complexes producing progeny RNAs. We have previously shown that the wild-type alphavirus replicase requires a functional RNA template and active polymerase to generate spherule structures. However, we now find that specific partially processed forms of the replicase proteins alone can give rise to membrane invaginations in the absence of RNA or replication. The minimal requirement for spherule formation was the expression of properly cleaved nsP4, together with either uncleaved P123 or with the combination of nsP1 and uncleaved P23. These inactive spherules were morphologically less regular than replication-induced spherules. In the presence of template, nsP1 plus uncleaved P23 plus nsP4 could efficiently assemble active replication spherules producing both negative-sense and positive-sense RNA strands. P23 alone did not have membrane affinity, but could be recruited to membrane sites in the presence of nsP1 and nsP4. These results define the set of viral components required for alphavirus replication complex assembly and suggest the possibility that it could be reconstituted from separately expressed nonstructural proteins. IMPORTANCE All positive-strand RNA viruses extensively modify host cell membranes to serve as efficient platforms for viral RNA replication. Alphaviruses and several other groups induce protective membrane invaginations (spherules) as their genome factories. Most positive-strand viruses produce their replicase as a polyprotein precursor, which is further processed through precise and regulated cleavages. We show here that specific cleavage intermediates of the alphavirus replicase can give rise to spherule structures in the absence of viral RNA. In the presence of template RNA, the same intermediates yield active replication complexes. Thus, partially cleaved replicase proteins play key roles that connect replication complex assembly, membrane deformation, and the different stages of RNA synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.22131593100000002,-0.071630787,-0.091891418,0.104276182,-0.07450435799999999,-0.082778714,0.009032382,0.029496538,-0.027897496,0.006828926999999999,0.054502674,-0.005814273000000001,-0.030625964,0.104639709,0.0065136859999999994,0.029570825,0.041068627,-0.07771333700000001,0.01157346,0.044876128,-0.083769476,0.071932466,-0.08483605400000001,-0.120207165,0.036163011,-0.019888957,-0.079899975,0.0040925959999999996,-0.085361929,-0.005431282
1313,Attenuation of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus by Engineered Viral Polymerase Fidelity,"Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (3D(pol)) catalyzes viral RNA synthesis. Its characteristic low fidelity and absence of proofreading activity allow FMDV to rapidly mutate and adapt to dynamic environments. In this study, we used the structure of FMDV 3D(pol) in combination with previously reported results from similar picornaviral polymerases to design point mutations that would alter replication fidelity. In particular, we targeted Trp237 within conserved polymerase motif A because of the low reversion potential inherent in the single UGG codon. Using biochemical and genetic tools, we show that the replacement of tryptophan 237 with phenylalanine imparts higher fidelity, but replacements with isoleucine and leucine resulted in lower-fidelity phenotypes. Viruses containing these W237 substitutions show in vitro growth kinetics and plaque morphologies similar to those of the wild-type (WT) A(24) Cruzeiro strain in BHK cells, and both high- and low-fidelity variants retained fitness during coinfection with the wild-type virus. The higher-fidelity W237F (W237F(HF)) mutant virus was more resistant to the mutagenic nucleoside analogs ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil than the WT virus, whereas the lower-fidelity W237I (W237I(LF)) and W237L(LF) mutant viruses exhibited lower ribavirin resistance. Interestingly, the variant viruses showed heterogeneous and slightly delayed growth kinetics in primary porcine kidney cells, and they were significantly attenuated in mouse infection experiments. These data demonstrate, for a single virus, that either increased or decreased RdRp fidelity attenuates virus growth in animals, which is a desirable feature for the development of safer and genetically more stable vaccine candidates. IMPORTANCE Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is the most devastating disease affecting livestock worldwide. Here, using structural and biochemical analyses, we have identified FMDV 3D(pol) mutations that affect polymerase fidelity. Recombinant FMDVs containing substitutions at 3D(pol) tryptophan residue 237 were genetically stable and displayed plaque phenotypes and growth kinetics similar to those of the wild-type virus in cell culture. We further demonstrate that viruses harboring either a W237F(HF) substitution or W237I(LF) and W237L(LF) mutations were highly attenuated in animals. Our study shows that obtaining 3D(pol) fidelity variants by protein engineering based on polymerase structure and function could be exploited for the development of attenuated FMDV vaccine candidates that are safer and more stable than strains obtained by selective pressure via mutagenic nucleotides or adaptation approaches.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14183188800000002,-0.060825282,-0.036343182,0.04704974,-0.044371545,0.032129531,0.082882259,-0.005792778,-0.019597714,0.072028115,0.091754321,0.09363706699999999,-0.10169210699999999,-0.028201133,0.002614795,-0.0027409820000000003,-0.034832648,-0.063590811,-0.116996444,-0.013702888,0.182387663,-0.10871034,0.087749597,0.17023619199999998,-0.02660223,0.090471136,0.050594812999999995,-0.052845315,-0.113978413,-0.136370133
1324,Atypical RNA Elements Modulate Translational Readthrough in Tobacco Necrosis Virus D,"Tobacco necrosis virus, strain D (TNV-D), is a positive-strand RNA virus in the genus Betanecrovirus and family Tombusviridae. The production of its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, p82, is achieved by translational readthrough. This process is stimulated by an RNA structure that is positioned immediately downstream of the recoding site, termed the readthrough stem-loop (RTSL), and a sequence in the 3′ untranslated region of the TNV-D genome, called the distal readthrough element (DRTE). Notably, a base pairing interaction between the RTSL and the DRTE, spanning ∼3,000 nucleotides, is required for enhancement of readthrough. Here, some of the structural features of the RTSL, as well as RNA sequences and structures that flank either the RTSL or DRTE, were investigated for their involvement in translational readthrough and virus infectivity. The results revealed that (i) the RTSL-DRTE interaction cannot be functionally replaced by stabilizing the RTSL structure, (ii) a novel tertiary RNA structure positioned just 3′ to the RTSL is required for optimal translational readthrough and virus infectivity, and (iii) these same activities also rely on an RNA stem-loop located immediately upstream of the DRTE. Functional counterparts for the RTSL-proximal structure may also be present in other tombusvirids. The identification of additional distinct RNA structures that modulate readthrough suggests that regulation of this process by genomic features may be more complex than previously appreciated. Possible roles for these novel RNA elements are discussed. IMPORTANCE The analysis of factors that affect recoding events in viruses is leading to an ever more complex picture of this important process. In this study, two new atypical RNA elements were shown to contribute to efficient translational readthrough of the TNV-D polymerase and to mediate robust viral genome accumulation in infections. One of the structures, located close to the recoding site, could have functional equivalents in related genera, while the other structure, positioned 3′ proximally in the viral genome, is likely limited to betanecroviruses. Irrespective of their prevalence, the identification of these novel RNA elements adds to the current repertoire of viral genome-based modulators of translational readthrough and provides a notable example of the complexity of regulation of this process.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.188623118,-0.056437114000000003,-0.054544644,0.083978173,0.017944356,-0.084230709,-0.016854518,0.05042574,-0.055182097,0.004489853,0.018002471000000003,0.009932418,-0.001124197,-0.051396138,-0.007458032,0.005788479,0.003486955,0.001345161,-0.055514985,-0.020264484,-0.028278769,-0.0018506629999999998,-0.094608375,-0.007285039,-0.056997745999999995,-0.102911103,-0.007384366999999999,0.039003289,0.08558426,-0.037819142
1325,Mutagen resistance and mutation restriction of St. Louis encephalitis virus,"The error rate of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of RNA viruses is important in maintaining genetic diversity for viral adaptation and fitness. Numerous studies have shown that mutagen-resistant RNA virus variants display amino acid mutations in the RdRp and other replicase subunits, which in turn exhibit an altered fidelity phenotype affecting viral fitness, adaptability and pathogenicity. St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), like its close relative West Nile virus, is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has the ability to cause neuroinvasive disease in humans. Here, we describe the successful generation of multiple ribavirin-resistant populations containing a shared amino acid mutation in the SLEV RdRp (E416K). These E416K mutants also displayed resistance to the antiviral T-1106, an RNA mutagen similar to ribavirin. Structural modelling of the E416K polymerase mutation indicated its location in the pinky finger domain of the RdRp, distant from the active site. Deep sequencing of the E416K mutant revealed lower genetic diversity than wild-type SLEV after growth in both vertebrate and invertebrate cells. Phenotypic characterization showed that E416K mutants displayed similar or increased replication in mammalian cells, as well as modest attenuation in mosquito cells, consistent with previous work with West Nile virus high-fidelity variants. In addition, attenuation was limited to mosquito cells with a functional RNA interference response, suggesting an impaired capacity to escape RNA interference could contribute to attenuation of high-fidelity variants. Our results provide increased evidence that RNA mutagen resistance arises through modulation of the RdRp and give further insight into the consequences of altered fidelity of flaviviruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.218633435,-0.060582698,-0.08667175099999999,0.11952949199999999,-0.0350672,0.0053643480000000006,0.102810615,0.025781953,-0.060221487000000004,0.091409163,0.134850302,0.11781334800000001,-0.103947458,-0.018260748,-0.015093022,4.22e-05,-0.02801272,-0.045006197000000005,-0.09321418599999999,-0.010548139,0.1470389,-0.085833378,0.085619461,0.073474921,-0.052280024,0.09140394800000001,0.08357617,-0.035582293,-0.107164384,-0.051585833
1326,The uncoupling of catalysis and translocation in the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,"The nucleotide addition cycle of nucleic acid polymerases includes 2 major events: the pre-chemistry active site closure leading to the addition of one nucleotide to the product chain; the post-chemistry translocation step moving the polymerase active site one position downstream on its template. In viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs), structural and biochemical evidences suggest that these 2 events are not tightly coupled, unlike the situation observed in A-family polymerases such as the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. Recently, an RdRP translocation intermediate crystal structure of enterovirus 71 shed light on how translocation may be controlled by elements within RdRP catalytic motifs, and a series of poliovirus apo RdRP crystal structures explicitly suggest that a motif B loop may assist the movement of the template strand in late stages of transcription. Implications of RdRP catalysis-translocation uncoupling and the remaining challenges to further elucidate RdRP translocation mechanism are also discussed.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.183219532,-0.033563452,-0.059408398,0.075492399,-0.041397273,-0.05635331,0.065600796,0.030240365,-0.070582269,0.021626495,0.098947865,0.156246245,-0.096479149,-0.09782912099999999,-0.048884554000000004,-0.004471884000000001,0.035505356,-0.028397781,-0.066928505,-0.08415005199999999,0.039971422,-0.065642336,0.023693019,-0.043390944,0.013351548000000001,0.016591183,-0.021535011,0.058912275,0.075482498,0.01420822
1340,Viral Macro Domains Reverse Protein ADP-Ribosylation,"ADP-ribosylation is a posttranslational protein modification in which ADP-ribose is transferred from NAD(+) to specific acceptors to regulate a wide variety of cellular processes. The macro domain is an ancient and highly evolutionarily conserved protein domain widely distributed throughout all kingdoms of life, including viruses. The human TARG1/C6orf130, MacroD1, and MacroD2 proteins can reverse ADP-ribosylation by acting on ADP-ribosylated substrates through the hydrolytic activity of their macro domains. Here, we report that the macro domain from hepatitis E virus (HEV) serves as an ADP-ribose-protein hydrolase for mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) and poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) chain removal (de-MARylation and de-PARylation, respectively) from mono- and poly(ADP)-ribosylated proteins, respectively. The presence of the HEV helicase in cis dramatically increases the binding of the macro domain to poly(ADP-ribose) and stimulates the de-PARylation activity. Abrogation of the latter dramatically decreases replication of an HEV subgenomic replicon. The de-MARylation activity is present in all three pathogenic positive-sense, single-stranded RNA [(+)ssRNA] virus families which carry a macro domain: Coronaviridae (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E), Togaviridae (Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus), and Hepeviridae (HEV), indicating that it might be a significant tropism and/or pathogenic determinant. IMPORTANCE Protein ADP-ribosylation is a covalent posttranslational modification regulating cellular protein activities in a dynamic fashion to modulate and coordinate a variety of cellular processes. Three viral families, Coronaviridae, Togaviridae, and Hepeviridae, possess macro domains embedded in their polyproteins. Here, we show that viral macro domains reverse cellular ADP-ribosylation, potentially cutting the signal of a viral infection in the cell. Various poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases which are notorious guardians of cellular integrity are demodified by macro domains from members of these virus families. In the case of hepatitis E virus, the adjacent viral helicase domain dramatically increases the binding of the macro domain to PAR and simulates the demodification activity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.11547785099999999,-0.041068416,-0.053313345,-0.017322933999999998,-0.055289645,0.018264815,0.041304471,-0.035653113,0.048791967,-0.008492486,-0.046914988,0.026467835,0.020288325,-0.01585921,-0.031782608999999996,-0.042617057,0.09866300199999999,-0.037364735,-0.011919006000000001,0.04506799400000001,-0.036980444,0.029612795,-0.031432486,-0.068895283,0.08857695300000001,0.082866654,-0.053718426,0.019743988,0.023325352999999997,-0.074349981
1344,Homology-Based Identification of a Mutation in the Coronavirus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase That Confers Resistance to Multiple Mutagens,"Positive-sense RNA viruses encode RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) essential for genomic replication. With the exception of the large nidoviruses, such as coronaviruses (CoVs), RNA viruses lack proofreading and thus are dependent on RdRps to control nucleotide selectivity and fidelity. CoVs encode a proofreading exonuclease in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN), which confers a greater-than-10-fold increase in fidelity compared to other RNA viruses. It is unknown to what extent the CoV polymerase (nsp12-RdRp) participates in replication fidelity. We sought to determine whether homology modeling could identify putative determinants of nucleotide selectivity and fidelity in CoV RdRps. We modeled the CoV murine hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp12-RdRp structure and superimposed it on solved picornaviral RdRp structures. Fidelity-altering mutations previously identified in coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3) were mapped onto the nsp12-RdRp model structure and then engineered into the MHV genome with [nsp14-ExoN(+)] or without [nsp14-ExoN(−)] ExoN activity. Using this method, we identified two mutations conferring resistance to the mutagen 5-fluorouracil (5-FU): nsp12-M611F and nsp12-V553I. For nsp12-V553I, we also demonstrate resistance to the mutagen 5-azacytidine (5-AZC) and decreased accumulation of mutations. Resistance to 5-FU, and a decreased number of genomic mutations, was effectively masked by nsp14-ExoN proofreading activity. These results indicate that nsp12-RdRp likely functions in fidelity regulation and that, despite low sequence conservation, some determinants of RdRp nucleotide selectivity are conserved across RNA viruses. The results also indicate that, with regard to nucleotide selectivity, nsp14-ExoN is epistatic to nsp12-RdRp, consistent with its proposed role in a multiprotein replicase-proofreading complex. IMPORTANCE RNA viruses have evolutionarily fine-tuned replication fidelity to balance requirements for genetic stability and diversity. Responsibility for replication fidelity in RNA viruses has been attributed to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, with mutations in RdRps for multiple RNA viruses shown to alter fidelity and attenuate virus replication and virulence. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are the only known RNA viruses to encode a proofreading exonuclease (nsp14-ExoN), as well as other replicase proteins involved in regulation of fidelity. This report shows that the CoV RdRp (nsp12) likely functions in replication fidelity; that residue determinants of CoV RdRp nucleotide selectivity map to similar structural regions of other, unrelated RNA viral polymerases; and that for CoVs, the proofreading activity of the nsp14-ExoN is epistatic to the function of the RdRp in fidelity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.229478055,0.036196423,-0.159066152,0.18799818199999999,0.011418073999999999,-0.051604089000000006,0.122931431,0.063374603,-0.075687374,0.062767449,0.17077833899999997,0.13958836800000002,-0.146473628,-0.049761661,-0.035167875,0.018863626,0.017530707,-0.08469845,-0.09121421199999999,-0.039413988999999996,0.122055335,-0.10721815900000001,0.169646545,0.078682638,0.011043293000000001,0.12604595400000002,-0.001654197,-0.056089991,-0.061777569000000004,-0.113035761
1346,Structural basis of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalysis and translocation,"Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) play essential roles in viral genome replication and transcription. We previously reported several structural states of the poliovirus RdRP nucleotide addition cycle (NAC) that revealed a unique palm domain-based active site closure mechanism and proposed a six-state NAC model including a hypothetical state representing translocation intermediates. Using the RdRP from another human enterovirus, enterovirus 71, here we report seven RdRP elongation complex structures derived from a crystal lattice that allows three NAC events. These structures suggested a key order of events in initial NTP binding and NTP-induced active site closure and revealed a bona fide translocation intermediate featuring asymmetric movement of the template–product duplex. Our work provides essential missing links in understanding NTP recognition and translocation mechanisms in viral RdRPs and emphasizes the uniqueness of the viral RdRPs compared with other processive polymerases.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.167130315,-0.042970287999999995,-0.074150078,0.07096833,-0.049365424000000005,-0.033664561,0.08780041699999999,0.018246274,-0.043295455999999996,0.037274495,0.076777865,0.115412396,-0.070297967,-0.049952567999999996,-0.047762054000000005,-0.022449514,0.036603368,-0.051946624000000004,-0.063666547,-0.052806547999999995,0.026719722,-0.024677242000000002,-0.004951295,-0.032666441000000004,0.010677663,0.013387496,0.004056297,0.045006647999999996,0.061119257999999996,0.024214825
1351,Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus Nucleocapsid Protein Interacts with Nsp9 and Cellular DHX9 To Regulate Viral RNA Synthesis,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) nucleocapsid (N) protein is the main component of the viral capsid to encapsulate viral RNA, and it is also a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of host cell processes. Nonstructural protein 9 (Nsp9) is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that plays a critical role in viral RNA transcription and replication. In this study, we demonstrate that PRRSV N protein is bound to Nsp9 by protein-protein interaction and that the contacting surface on Nsp9 is located in the two predicted α-helixes formed by 48 residues at the C-terminal end of the protein. Mutagenesis analyses identified E646, E608, and E611 on Nsp9 and Q85 on the N protein as the pivotal residues participating in the N-Nsp9 interaction. By overexpressing the N protein binding fragment of Nsp9 in infected Marc-145 cells, the synthesis of viral RNAs, as well as the production of infectious progeny viruses, was dramatically inhibited, suggesting that Nsp9-N protein association is involved in the process of viral RNA production. In addition, we show that PRRSV N interacts with cellular RNA helicase DHX9 and redistributes the protein into the cytoplasm. Knockdown of DHX9 increased the ratio of short subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs); in contrast, DHX9 overexpression benefited the synthesis of longer sgmRNAs and the viral genomic RNA (gRNA). These results imply that DHX9 is recruited by the N protein in PRRSV infection to regulate viral RNA synthesis. We postulate that N and DHX9 may act as antiattenuation factors for the continuous elongation of nascent transcript during negative-strand RNA synthesis. IMPORTANCE It is unclear whether the N protein of PRRSV is involved in regulation of the viral RNA production process. In this report, we demonstrate that the N protein of the arterivirus PRRSV participates in viral RNA replication and transcription through interacting with Nsp9 and its RdRp and recruiting cellular RNA helicase to promote the production of longer viral sgmRNAs and gRNA. Our data here provide some new insights into the discontinuous to continuous extension of PRRSV RNA synthesis and also offer a new potential anti-PRRSV strategy targeting the N-Nsp9 and/or N-DHX9 interaction.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.240536792,-0.077640079,-0.10356838199999999,0.083317847,-0.081090803,-0.084580503,-0.019188373,-0.010832484,0.014341833,0.020335096,-0.006115886,-0.044379361,-0.011290918999999998,0.08376624,0.008879004,-0.089599655,0.088588056,-0.08599956800000001,-0.006328131,0.099368712,-0.108745486,0.061886765,-0.011618399,-0.126013996,0.047198538,0.055704852,0.030802813999999998,-0.054668010999999996,-0.06736409900000001,0.13836058699999998
1362,Biochemical Evaluation of the Inhibition Properties of Favipiravir and 2′-C-Methyl-Cytidine Triphosphates against Human and Mouse Norovirus RNA Polymerases,"Norovirus (NoV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that causes acute gastroenteritis and is responsible for 200,000 deaths per year worldwide. No effective vaccine or treatment is available. Recent studies have shown that the nucleoside analogs favipiravir (T-705) and 2′-C-methyl-cytidine (2CM-C) inhibit NoV replication in vitro and in animal models, but their precise mechanism of action is unknown. We evaluated the molecular interactions between nucleoside triphosphates and NoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NoVpol), the enzyme responsible for replication and transcription of NoV genomic RNA. We found that T-705 ribonucleoside triphosphate (RTP) and 2CM-C triphosphate (2CM-CTP) equally inhibited human and mouse NoVpol activities at concentrations resulting in 50% of maximum inhibition (IC(50)s) in the low micromolar range. 2CM-CTP inhibited the viral polymerases by competing directly with natural CTP during primer elongation, whereas T-705 RTP competed mostly with ATP and GTP at the initiation and elongation steps. Incorporation of 2CM-CTP into viral RNA blocked subsequent RNA synthesis, whereas T-705 RTP did not cause immediate chain termination of NoVpol. 2CM-CTP and T-705 RTP displayed low levels of enzyme selectivity, as they were both recognized as substrates by human mitochondrial RNA polymerase. The level of discrimination by the human enzyme was increased with a novel analog of T-705 RTP containing a 2′-C-methyl substitution. Collectively, our data suggest that 2CM-C inhibits replication of NoV by acting as a classic chain terminator, while T-705 may inhibit the virus by multiple mechanisms of action. Understanding the precise mechanism of action of anti-NoV compounds could provide a rational basis for optimizing their inhibition potencies and selectivities.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.13652948,-0.042184346,-0.04383313900000001,0.046156789000000004,-0.065508191,-0.000781528,0.061411223,0.012660107,-0.00145767,0.020616172,0.07015672099999999,0.047979347,-0.026588083999999998,0.01354408,0.018097613000000002,0.00835549,-0.032921358,0.052490719000000005,0.032519353,-0.008010194,0.014111273999999998,0.027031825,-0.040746907,0.037557684,0.014911151000000001,-0.040113342,-0.01303227,0.007578233,0.026367263,0.004015456
1367,Translational readthrough-promoting drugs enhance pseudoknot-mediated suppression of the stop codon at the Moloney murine leukemia virus gag–pol junction,"Translational readthrough-promoting drugs enhance the incorporation of amino acids at stop codons and can thus bypass premature termination during protein synthesis. The polymerase (Pol) proteins of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) are synthesized as a large Gag–Pol fusion protein, formed by the readthrough of a stop codon at the end of the gag ORF. The downstream pol ORF lacks its own start codon, and Pol protein synthesis is wholly dependent on translation of the upstream gag gene and the readthrough event for expression. Here, we explored the effects of readthrough-promoting drugs – aminoglycoside antibiotics and the small molecule ataluren – on the efficiency of readthrough of the stop codon in the context of the MoMLV genome. We showed that these compounds increased readthrough of the stop codon at the MoMLV gag–pol junction in vivo above the already high basal level and that the resulting elevated gag–pol readthrough had deleterious effects on virus replication. We also showed that readthrough efficiency could be driven to even higher levels in vitro, and that the combination of the small molecules and the RNA structure at the MoMLV stop codon could achieve extremely high readthrough efficiencies.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.136385393,-0.05420758,-0.023425879,-0.042353812000000005,-0.032243841,-0.01342674,-0.030204486000000003,0.00663343,0.018614804,-0.050210432,-0.048196802999999996,-0.005228513,-0.000309345,-0.0423652,-0.037267509,-0.016560737,0.036817352000000005,-0.014052367,-0.036029129,-0.016748775,-0.011468216000000002,-0.002883169,-0.063779746,0.023203191,-0.021616958,-0.038118102,0.009569625,-0.016892914,0.049906338,-0.07632512
1370,Therapeutic Interventions to Disrupt the Protein Synthetic Machinery in Melanoma,"Control of the protein synthetic machinery is deregulated in many cancers, including melanoma, in order to increase protein production. Tumor suppressors and oncogenes play key roles in protein synthesis from the transcription of rRNA and ribosome biogenesis to mRNA translation initiation and protein synthesis. Major signaling pathways are altered in melanoma to modulate the protein synthetic machinery thereby promoting tumor development. However, despite the importance of this process in melanoma development, involvement of the protein synthetic machinery in this cancer type is an underdeveloped area of study. Here, we review the coupling of melanoma development to deregulation of the protein synthetic machinery. We examine existing knowledge regarding RNA Polymerase I inhibition and mRNA translation focusing on their inhibition for therapeutic applications in melanoma.

1384,Mutations in Coronavirus Nonstructural Protein 10 Decrease Virus Replication Fidelity,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are unique in encoding a 3′→5′ exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is required for high-fidelity replication, likely via proofreading. nsp14 associates with the CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12-RdRp), and nsp14-ExoN activity is enhanced by binding nsp10, a small nonenzymatic protein. However, it is not known whether nsp10 functions in the regulation of CoV replication fidelity. To test this, we engineered single and double alanine substitution mutations into the genome of murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) containing ExoN activity [ExoN(+)] at positions within nsp10 known to disrupt the nsp10-nsp14 interaction in vitro. We show that an nsp10 mutant, R80A/E82A-ExoN(+), was five to ten times more sensitive to treatment with the RNA mutagen 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) than wild-type (WT)-ExoN(+), suggestive of decreased replication fidelity. This decreased-fidelity phenotype was confirmed using two additional nucleoside analogs, 5-azacytidine and ribavirin. R80A/E82A-ExoN(+) reached a peak titer similar to and demonstrated RNA synthesis kinetics comparable to those seen with WT-ExoN(+). No change in 5-FU sensitivity was observed for R80A/E82A-ExoN(−) relative to MHV-ExoN(−), indicating that the decreased-fidelity phenotype of R80A/E82A-ExoN(−) is linked to the presence of ExoN activity. Our results demonstrate that nsp10 is important for CoV replication fidelity and support the hypothesis that nsp10 functions to regulate nsp14-ExoN activity during virus replication. IMPORTANCE The adaptive capacity of CoVs, as well as all other RNA viruses, is partially attributed to the presence of extensive population genetic diversity. However, decreased fidelity is detrimental to CoV replication and virulence; mutant CoVs with decreased replication fidelity are attenuated and more sensitive to inhibition by RNA mutagens. Thus, identifying the viral protein determinants of CoV fidelity is important for understanding CoV replication, pathogenesis, and virulence. In this report, we show that nsp10, a small, nonenzymatic viral protein, contributes to CoV replication fidelity. Our data support the hypothesis that CoVs have evolved multiple proteins, in addition to nsp14-ExoN, that are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the largest known RNA genomes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.169908869,0.06684718,-0.124738016,0.081579928,-0.022852574,-0.007947901,0.09000458800000001,0.047146537,0.005029324,0.014852158,0.09267343800000001,0.047101328,-0.10170579,0.001784789,-0.006262579,0.056845920999999994,-0.019579445,-0.051676568,-0.068468693,-0.000196619,0.08992199099999999,-0.081688763,0.15408250699999998,0.09041840699999999,0.052718056,0.135214958,-0.027019783999999998,-0.091688862,-0.099488696,-0.11770940699999999
1400,Perturbation in the Conserved Methyltransferase-Polymerase Interface of Flavivirus NS5 Differentially Affects Polymerase Initiation and Elongation,"The flavivirus NS5 is a natural fusion of a methyltransferase (MTase) and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). Analogous to DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, the NS5 polymerase initiates RNA synthesis through a de novo mechanism and then makes a transition to a processive elongation phase. However, whether and how the MTase affects polymerase activities through intramolecular interactions remain elusive. By solving the crystal structure of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) NS5, we recently identified an MTase-RdRP interface containing a set of six hydrophobic residues highly conserved among flaviviruses. To dissect the functional relevance of this interface, we made a series of JEV NS5 constructs with mutations of these hydrophobic residues and/or with the N-terminal first 261 residues and other residues up to the first 303 residues deleted. Compared to the wild-type (WT) NS5, full-length NS5 variants exhibited consistent up- or downregulation of the initiation activities in two types of polymerase assays. Five representative full-length NS5 constructs were then tested in an elongation assay, from which the apparent single-nucleotide incorporation rate constant was estimated. Interestingly, two constructs exhibited different elongation kinetics from the WT NS5, with an effect rather opposite to what was observed at initiation. Moreover, constructs with MTase and/or the linker region (residues 266 to 275) removed still retained polymerase activities, albeit at overall lower levels. However, further removal of the N-terminal extension (residues 276 to 303) abolished regular template-directed synthesis. Together, our data showed that the MTase-RdRP interface is relevant in both polymerase initiation and elongation, likely with different regulation mechanisms in these two major phases of RNA synthesis. IMPORTANCE The flavivirus NS5 is very unique in having a methyltransferase (MTase) placed on the immediate N terminus of its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). We recently solved the crystal structure of the full-length NS5, which revealed a conserved interface between MTase and RdRP. Building on this discovery, here we carried out in vitro polymerase assays to address the functional relevance of the interface interactions. By explicitly probing polymerase initiation and elongation activities, we found that perturbation in the MTase-RdRP interface had different impacts on different phases of synthesis, suggesting that the roles and contribution of the interface interactions may change upon phase transitions. By comparing the N-terminal-truncated enzymes with the full-length NS5, we collected data to indicate the indispensability to regular polymerase activities of a region that was functionally unclarified previously. Taken together, we provide biochemical evidence and mechanistic insights for the cross talk between the two enzyme modules of flavivirus NS5.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.16944324600000002,-0.037778122000000004,-0.053222237,0.055098247999999996,-0.037611576,-0.043608222,0.053369478,0.017046329,-0.045075489,0.006460202,0.068072515,0.12274887599999999,-0.088555635,-0.060928017,-0.056434076,-0.018986076,0.050740373,-0.044067625,-0.042456337999999996,-0.045379672999999995,0.032021886,-0.036194176,0.028330876,-0.057630817,0.051299014000000004,0.068615206,-0.016621458000000002,0.020112576,0.060832265,0.049114593
1404,Structural Dynamics as a Contributor to Error-prone Replication by an RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase,"RNA viruses encoding high- or low-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) are attenuated. The ability to predict residues of the RdRp required for faithful incorporation of nucleotides represents an essential step in any pipeline intended to exploit perturbed fidelity as the basis for rational design of vaccine candidates. We used x-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, NMR spectroscopy, and pre-steady-state kinetics to compare a mutator (H273R) RdRp from poliovirus to the wild-type (WT) enzyme. We show that the nucleotide-binding site toggles between the nucleotide binding-occluded and nucleotide binding-competent states. The conformational dynamics between these states were enhanced by binding to primed template RNA. For the WT, the occluded conformation was favored; for H273R, the competent conformation was favored. The resonance for Met-187 in our NMR spectra reported on the ability of the enzyme to check the correctness of the bound nucleotide. Kinetic experiments were consistent with the conformational dynamics contributing to the established pre-incorporation conformational change and fidelity checkpoint. For H273R, residues comprising the active site spent more time in the catalytically competent conformation and were more positively correlated than the WT. We propose that by linking the equilibrium between the binding-occluded and binding-competent conformations of the nucleotide-binding pocket and other active-site dynamics to the correctness of the bound nucleotide, faithful nucleotide incorporation is achieved. These studies underscore the need to apply multiple biophysical and biochemical approaches to the elucidation of the physical basis for polymerase fidelity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.156390056,-0.034500955,-0.046028262,0.043975585,-0.039359264,-0.015496146,0.060810614000000006,0.01657569,-0.040771952,0.027241317,0.09506673199999999,0.15735369400000002,-0.106428909,-0.093954475,-0.036628298,-0.004369291,0.002226617,-0.050114679,-0.089645529,-0.08567982199999999,0.125432602,-0.088577959,0.094703964,0.037081081,0.006377746,0.057501435999999996,0.016799374,0.00033975199999999997,-0.001577018,-0.053917445999999994
1409,Interactome Analysis of the Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus RNA Polymerase Complex Identifies Protein Chaperones as Important Cofactors That Promote L-Protein Stability and RNA Synthesis,"The human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) core viral RNA polymerase comprises the large polymerase protein (L) and its cofactor, the phosphoprotein (P), which associate with the viral ribonucleoprotein complex to replicate the genome and, together with the M2-1 protein, transcribe viral mRNAs. While cellular proteins have long been proposed to be involved in the synthesis of HRSV RNA by associating with the polymerase complex, their characterization has been hindered by the difficulty of purifying the viral polymerase from mammalian cell culture. In this study, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged L- and P-protein expression was coupled with high-affinity anti-GFP antibody-based immunoprecipitation and quantitative proteomics to identify cellular proteins that interacted with either the L- or the P-proteins when expressed as part of a biologically active viral RNP. Several core groups of cellular proteins were identified that interacted with each viral protein including, in both cases, protein chaperones. Ablation of chaperone activity by using small-molecule inhibitors confirmed previously reported studies which suggested that this class of proteins acted as positive viral factors. Inhibition of HSP90 chaperone function in the current study showed that HSP90 is critical for L-protein function and stability, whether in the presence or absence of the P-protein. Inhibition studies suggested that HSP70 also disrupts virus biology and might help the polymerase remodel the nucleocapsid to allow RNA synthesis to occur efficiently. This indicated a proviral role for protein chaperones in HRSV replication and demonstrates that the function of cellular proteins can be targeted as potential therapeutics to disrupt virus replication. IMPORTANCE Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) represents a major health care and economic burden, being the main cause of severe respiratory infections in infants worldwide. No vaccine or effective therapy is available. This study focused on identifying those cellular proteins that potentially interact specifically with the viral proteins that are central to virus replication and transcription, with a view to providing potential targets for the development of a specific, transient therapeutic which disrupts virus biology but prevents the emergence of resistance, while maintaining cell viability. In particular, protein chaperones (heat shock proteins 70 and 90), which aid protein folding and function, were identified. The mechanism by which these chaperones contribute to virus biology was tested, and this study demonstrates to the field that cellular protein chaperones may be required for maintaining the correct folding and therefore functionality of specific proteins within the virus replication complex.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14837030699999998,-0.085851748,-0.09412561,0.07026062799999999,-0.11041815,0.00121047,0.031039115,-0.051576290999999996,0.086578825,0.04339002,-0.059195447000000005,-0.064239927,0.041276976,0.058379742000000005,-0.023602537000000003,-0.10295181099999999,0.099399221,-0.057095308,0.015287676000000002,0.115859381,-0.066444894,0.073406616,-0.048974402,-0.051835041,0.098102097,0.078851956,0.030530556,-0.056250204000000005,-0.047535927,0.046596027000000005
1415,"RNA Virus Population Diversity, an Optimum for Maximal Fitness and Virulence","The ability of an RNA virus to exist as a population of genetically distinct variants permits the virus to overcome events during infections that would otherwise limit virus multiplication or drive the population to extinction. Viral genetic diversity is created by the ribonucleotide misincorporation frequency of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We have identified a poliovirus (PV) RdRp derivative (H273R) possessing a mutator phenotype. GMP misincorporation efficiency for H273R RdRp in vitro was increased by 2–3-fold that manifested in a 2–3-fold increase in the diversity of the H273R PV population in cells. Circular sequencing analysis indicated that some mutations were RdRp-independent. Consistent with the population genetics theory, H273R PV was driven to extinction more easily than WT in cell culture. Furthermore, we observed a substantial reduction in H273R PV virulence, measured as the ability to cause paralysis in the cPVR mouse model. Reduced virulence correlated with the inability of H273R PV to sustain replication in tissues/organs in which WT persists. Despite the attenuated phenotype, H273R PV was capable of replicating in mice to levels sufficient to induce a protective immune response, even when the infecting dose used was insufficient to elicit any visual signs of infection. We conclude that optimal RdRp fidelity is a virulence determinant that can be targeted for viral attenuation or antiviral therapies, and we suggest that the RdRp may not be the only source of mutations in a RNA virus genome.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.12998042099999998,-0.04504309,-0.050585482,0.030415096000000003,-0.038760896,0.011981647,0.081109245,0.005016162,-0.033975011,0.044307698,0.096519317,0.08290437,-0.08232748299999999,-0.015964663,0.003290789,0.008401216999999999,-0.011605608,-0.04479869400000001,-0.063340966,-0.044806936,0.104693501,-0.069762742,0.078529251,0.030577744,-0.020904289,0.051139987000000005,0.048999179000000004,-0.008619588000000001,-0.021364536,-0.006499606999999999
1417,One severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus protein complex integrates processive RNA polymerase and exonuclease activities,"In addition to members causing milder human infections, the Coronaviridae family includes potentially lethal zoonotic agents causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the recently emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome. The ∼30-kb positive-stranded RNA genome of coronaviruses encodes a replication/transcription machinery that is unusually complex and composed of 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). SARS-CoV nsp12, the canonical RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), exhibits poorly processive RNA synthesis in vitro, at odds with the efficient replication of a very large RNA genome in vivo. Here, we report that SARS-CoV nsp7 and nsp8 activate and confer processivity to the RNA-synthesizing activity of nsp12. Using biochemical assays and reverse genetics, the importance of conserved nsp7 and nsp8 residues was probed. Whereas several nsp7 mutations affected virus replication to a limited extent, the replacement of two nsp8 residues (P183 and R190) essential for interaction with nsp12 and a third (K58) critical for the interaction of the polymerase complex with RNA were all lethal to the virus. Without a loss of processivity, the nsp7/nsp8/nsp12 complex can associate with nsp14, a bifunctional enzyme bearing 3′-5′ exoribonuclease and RNA cap N7-guanine methyltransferase activities involved in replication fidelity and 5′-RNA capping, respectively. The identification of this tripartite polymerase complex that in turn associates with the nsp14 proofreading enzyme sheds light on how coronaviruses assemble an RNA-synthesizing machinery to replicate the largest known RNA genomes. This protein complex is a fascinating example of the functional integration of RNA polymerase, capping, and proofreading activities.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.21478002399999999,0.114440845,-0.19855269600000003,0.19800784899999999,-0.029095887999999997,-0.107673911,0.021578782999999997,-0.015085128,-0.055971894,0.038015489,0.11767642,0.063142579,-0.03801323,0.005767054000000001,-0.018522407,0.0032539279999999997,0.044550180999999994,-0.075104908,-0.01732872,0.04478499,-0.027680591,0.002042633,0.050244488,-0.058590895,0.026686286,-0.011390352,-0.087213876,0.025951147,0.000653088,-0.018461795
1427,Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Host-virus Interactions Reveals a Role for Golgi Brefeldin A Resistance Factor 1 (GBF1) in Dengue Infection,"Dengue virus is considered to be the most important mosquito-borne virus worldwide and poses formidable economic and health care burdens on many tropical and subtropical countries. Dengue infection induces drastic rearrangement of host endoplasmic reticulum membranes into complex membranous structures housing replication complexes; the contribution(s) of host proteins and pathways to this process is poorly understood but is likely to be mediated by protein-protein interactions. We have developed an approach for obtaining high confidence protein-protein interaction data by employing affinity tags and quantitative proteomics, in the context of viral infection, followed by robust statistical analysis. Using this approach, we identified high confidence interactors of NS5, the viral polymerase, and NS3, the helicase/protease. Quantitative proteomics allowed us to exclude a large number of presumably nonspecific interactors from our data sets and imparted a high level of confidence to our resulting data sets. We identified 53 host proteins reproducibly associated with NS5 and 41 with NS3, with 13 of these candidates present in both data sets. The host factors identified have diverse functions, including retrograde Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum transport, biosynthesis of long-chain fatty-acyl-coenzyme As, and in the unfolded protein response. We selected GBF1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor responsible for ARF activation, from the NS5 data set for follow up and functional validation. We show that GBF1 plays a critical role early in dengue infection that is independent of its role in the maintenance of Golgi structure. Importantly, the approach described here can be applied to virtually any organism/system as a tool for better understanding its molecular interactions.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.103361873,-0.045455217,-0.040069601,-0.00757668,-0.077655815,0.032272231,0.06110428,-0.013657585,0.034160984,0.010608973,-0.051834425,-0.008139278,-0.00198211,0.006013831999999999,-0.062818134,-0.038280239,0.05383476,-0.059933361,-0.027832929,0.04799553,-0.06282516,0.047954317999999996,-0.07284110099999999,-0.025678415,0.059808268,0.039193843,0.042456423,-0.047311597999999996,-0.048759624,0.032412132
1442,Vaccine-derived Mutation in Motif D of Poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase Lowers Nucleotide Incorporation Fidelity,"All viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) have a conserved structural element termed motif D. Studies of the RdRp from poliovirus (PV) have shown that a conformational change of motif D leads to efficient and faithful nucleotide addition by bringing Lys-359 into the active site where it serves as a general acid. The RdRp of the Sabin I vaccine strain has Thr-362 changed to Ile. Such a drastic change so close to Lys-359 might alter RdRp function and contribute in some way to the attenuated phenotype of Sabin type I. Here we present our characterization of the T362I RdRp. We find that the T362I RdRp exhibits a mutator phenotype in biochemical experiments in vitro. Using NMR, we show that this change in nucleotide incorporation fidelity correlates with a change in the structural dynamics of motif D. A recombinant PV expressing the T362I RdRp exhibits normal growth properties in cell culture but expresses a mutator phenotype in cells. For example, the T362I-containing PV is more sensitive to the mutagenic activity of ribavirin than wild-type PV. Interestingly, the T362I change was sufficient to cause a statistically significant reduction in viral virulence. Collectively, these studies suggest that residues of motif D can be targeted when changes in nucleotide incorporation fidelity are desired. Given the observation that fidelity mutants can serve as vaccine candidates, it may be possible to use engineering of motif D for this purpose.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.170558193,-0.040210155,-0.060701778,0.045370605999999994,-0.051337861,-0.007716115999999999,0.077959289,0.0037701270000000003,-0.052256857999999996,0.050733760999999995,0.118738925,0.184995013,-0.132315516,-0.095077278,-0.046866637999999995,-0.024589653,0.017401525,-0.06432177,-0.100921388,-0.085981306,0.16648732,-0.112355212,0.12492771,0.040062541,0.00585622,0.106045504,0.03951559,-0.0017856670000000001,-0.022159516,-0.033214971
1447,The Endosomal Pathway and the Golgi Complex Are Involved in the Infectious Bursal Disease Virus Life Cycle,"Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), a double-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Birnaviridae family, causes immunosuppression in chickens. In this study, we defined the localization of IBDV replication complexes based on colocalization analysis of VP3, the major protein component of IBDV ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). Our results indicate that VP3 localizes to vesicular structures bearing features of early and late endocytic compartments located in the juxtanuclear region. Interfering with the endocytic pathway with a dominant negative version of Rab5 after the internalization step leads to a reduction in virus titer. Triple-immunostaining studies between VP3, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase VP1, and viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) showed a well-defined colocalization, indicating that the three critical components of the RNPs colocalize in the same structure, likely representing replication complexes. Interestingly, recombinant expressed VP3 also localizes to endosomes. Employing Golgi markers, we found that VP3-containing vesicles were closely associated with this organelle. Depolymerization of microtubules with nocodazole caused a profound change in VP3 localization, showing a punctate distribution scattered throughout the cytoplasm. However, these VP3-positive structures remained associated with Golgi ministacks. Similarly, brefeldin A (BFA) treatment led to a punctate distribution of VP3, scattered throughout the cytoplasm of infected cells. In addition, analysis of intra- and extracellular viral infective particles after BFA treatment of avian cells suggested a role for the Golgi complex in viral assembly. These results constitute the first study elucidating the localization of IBDV replication complexes (i.e., in endocytic compartments) and establishing a role for the Golgi apparatus in the assembly step of a birnavirus.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.117402773,-0.049041277,-0.033586318,-0.0032369990000000004,-0.048655809,-0.003968574,0.015058682,-0.004068256,0.003361344,0.018686703,0.021921247999999997,-0.014467391000000001,-0.018538092,0.045662685,0.013474501000000002,0.016228189,-0.002889058,-0.024876787,-0.015612812,0.025030278,-0.022481435,0.032988499,-0.038722832,-0.035837605,0.005973649,0.002712915,-0.006728209000000001,-0.002211559,-0.037819554,0.026244786000000003
1452,The Unexpected Roles of Eukaryotic Translation Elongation Factors in RNA Virus Replication and Pathogenesis,"SUMMARY: The prokaryotic translation elongation factors were identified as essential cofactors for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of the bacteriophage Qβ more than 40 years ago. A growing body of evidence now shows that eukaryotic translation elongation factors (eEFs), predominantly eEF1A, acting in partially characterized complexes sometimes involving additional eEFs, facilitate virus replication. The functions of eEF1A as a protein chaperone and an RNA- and actin-binding protein enable its “moonlighting” roles as a virus replication cofactor. A diverse group of viruses, from human immunodeficiency type 1 and West Nile virus to tomato bushy stunt virus, have adapted to use eEFs as cofactors for viral transcription, translation, assembly, and pathogenesis.

1458,ADP Ribosylation Factor 1 Plays an Essential Role in the Replication of a Plant RNA Virus,"Eukaryotic positive-strand RNA viruses replicate using the membrane-bound replicase complexes, which contain multiple viral and host components. Virus infection induces the remodeling of intracellular membranes. Virus-induced membrane structures are thought to increase the local concentration of the components that are required for replication and provide a scaffold for tethering the replicase complexes. However, the mechanisms underlying virus-induced membrane remodeling are poorly understood. RNA replication of red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV), a positive-strand RNA plant virus, is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, and ER morphology is perturbed in RCNMV-infected cells. Here, we identified ADP ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) in the affinity-purified RCNMV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase fraction. Arf1 is a highly conserved, ubiquitous, small GTPase that is implicated in the formation of the coat protein complex I (COPI) vesicles on Golgi membranes. Using in vitro pulldown and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses, we showed that Arf1 interacted with the viral p27 replication protein within the virus-induced large punctate structures of the ER membrane. We found that inhibition of the nucleotide exchange activity of Arf1 using the inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA) disrupted the assembly of the viral replicase complex and p27-mediated ER remodeling. We also showed that BFA treatment and the expression of dominant negative Arf1 mutants compromised RCNMV RNA replication in protoplasts. Interestingly, the expression of a dominant negative mutant of Sar1, a key regulator of the biogenesis of COPII vesicles at ER exit sites, also compromised RCNMV RNA replication. These results suggest that the replication of RCNMV depends on the host membrane traffic machinery.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.18887722,-0.07201181,-0.078093408,0.064409689,-0.08474960599999999,-0.032649459,0.022639151,0.007799844,0.0030825320000000002,0.004406137,0.032739673999999996,-0.021502603999999998,-0.037072956000000004,0.125702236,0.000912873,0.014667416,0.041007234,-0.07313193700000001,0.0055887409999999995,0.048773909000000004,-0.055097252,0.047762105,-0.056867577,-0.076916467,0.022517157000000003,-0.009840649,-0.040308472000000005,0.009072931,-0.070011775,-0.002865291
1462,p33-Independent Activation of a Truncated p92 RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase of Tomato Bushy Stunt Virus in Yeast Cell-Free Extract,"Plus-stranded RNA viruses replicate in membrane-bound structures containing the viral replicase complex (VRC). A key component of the VRC is the virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which should be activated and incorporated into the VRC after its translation. To study the activation of the RdRp of Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV), a small tombusvirus of plants, we used N-terminal truncated recombinant RdRp, which supported RNA synthesis in a cell-free yeast extract-based assay. The truncated RdRp required a cis-acting RNA replication element and soluble host factors, while unlike the full-length TBSV RdRp, the truncated RdRp did not need the viral p33 replication cofactor or cellular membranes for RNA synthesis. Interestingly, the truncated RdRp used 3′-terminal extension for initiation and terminated prematurely at an internal cis-acting element. However, the truncated RdRp could perform de novo initiation on a TBSV plus-strand RNA template in the presence of the p33 replication cofactor, cellular membranes, and soluble host proteins. Altogether, the data obtained with the truncated RdRp indicate that this RdRp still requires activation, but with the participation of fewer components than with the full-length RdRp, making it suitable for future studies on dissection of the RdRp activation mechanism.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.248077925,-0.047648977,-0.110768691,0.157405038,-0.069563357,-0.091307885,0.07907001599999999,0.029058617999999998,-0.081593255,0.041847736,0.14233341800000002,0.146278593,-0.131910755,0.000294715,-0.057705372000000005,-0.006735953,0.070822211,-0.08527737199999999,-0.029537631,-0.058285314000000005,0.038943303,-0.023361695,0.058963602000000004,-0.106477098,0.015548309,0.031945646,-0.00261196,0.044415577000000005,0.053516369,0.078942889
1463,Inclusion Bodies Are a Site of Ebolavirus Replication,"Inclusion bodies are a characteristic feature of ebolavirus infections in cells. They contain large numbers of preformed nucleocapsids, but their biological significance has been debated, and they have been suggested to be aggregates of viral proteins without any further biological function. However, recent data for other viruses that produce similar structures have suggested that inclusion bodies might be involved in genome replication and transcription. In order to study filovirus inclusion bodies, we fused mCherry to the ebolavirus polymerase L, which is found in inclusion bodies. The resulting L-mCherry fusion protein was functional in minigenome assays and incorporated into virus-like particles. Importantly, L-mCherry fluorescence in transfected cells was readily detectable and distributed in a punctate pattern characteristic for inclusion bodies. A recombinant ebolavirus encoding L-mCherry instead of L was rescued and showed virtually identical growth kinetics and endpoint titers to those for wild-type virus. Using this virus, we showed that the onset of inclusion body formation corresponds to the onset of viral genome replication, but that viral transcription occurs prior to inclusion body formation. Live-cell imaging further showed that inclusion bodies are highly dynamic structures and that they can undergo dramatic reorganization during cell division. Finally, by labeling nascent RNAs using click technology we showed that inclusion bodies are indeed the site of viral RNA synthesis. Based on these data we conclude that, rather than being inert aggregates of nucleocapsids, ebolavirus inclusion bodies are in fact complex and dynamic structures and an important site at which viral RNA replication takes place.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.10739303,-0.049852394,-0.01959288,-0.001663725,-0.046728470999999994,-0.000460935,0.011681239,-0.008671241,0.012283023,0.004708142,-0.006536175,-0.023578031,0.003152258,0.026785972,0.020663035,0.008797626999999999,-0.000913403,-0.030291564,-0.018637042,0.016020132,-0.002863418,0.018976606,-0.024299783999999998,-0.017748747,0.014840188,0.005801126,-0.000921345,0.007040457,-0.040086013999999996,-0.0015784710000000001
1470,Large-scale sequencing and the natural history of model human RNA viruses,"RNA virus exploration within the field of medical virology has greatly benefited from technological developments in genomics, deepening our understanding of viral dynamics and emergence. Large-scale first-generation technology sequencing projects have expedited molecular epidemiology studies at an unprecedented scale for two pathogenic RNA viruses chosen as models: influenza A virus and dengue. Next-generation sequencing approaches are now leading to a more in-depth analysis of virus genetic diversity, which is greater for RNA than DNA viruses because of high replication rates and the absence of proofreading activity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.

1473,Visualizing Coronavirus RNA Synthesis in Time by Using Click Chemistry,"Coronaviruses induce in infected cells the formation of replicative structures, consisting of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes, where viral RNA synthesis supposedly takes place and to which the nonstructural proteins (nsp's) localize. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), the presumed intermediate in RNA synthesis, is localized to the DMV interior. However, as pores connecting the DMV interior with the cytoplasm have not been detected, it is unclear whether RNA synthesis occurs at these same sites. Here, we studied coronavirus RNA synthesis by feeding cells with a uridine analogue, after which nascent RNAs were detected using click chemistry. Early in infection, nascent viral RNA and nsp's colocalized with or occurred adjacent to dsRNA foci. Late in infection, the correlation between dsRNA dots, then found dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, and nsp's and nascent RNAs was less obvious. However, foci of nascent RNAs were always found to colocalize with the nsp12-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. These results demonstrate the feasibility of detecting viral RNA synthesis by using click chemistry and indicate that dsRNA dots do not necessarily correspond with sites of active viral RNA synthesis. Rather, late in infection many DMVs may harbor dsRNA molecules that are no longer functioning as intermediates in RNA synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.211393489,-0.05469078,-0.09389467,0.117205991,-0.036520343,-0.128163205,-0.007549472,0.04529374,-0.045233200999999994,0.0053952919999999994,0.08619204400000001,-0.029986385,-0.019156942,0.097723129,0.042611062000000005,0.065319438,-0.014627831,-0.03371315,0.009499933,0.025927006000000002,-0.066298757,0.049869948,-0.04641678,-0.089730504,0.022501427,-0.042408720999999996,-0.044190531,0.025283122999999998,-0.031901437000000005,0.069895275
1476,Nonstructural Proteins 7 and 8 of Feline Coronavirus Form a 2:1 Heterotrimer That Exhibits Primer-Independent RNA Polymerase Activity,"Nonstructural proteins 7 and 8 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have previously been shown by X-ray crystallography to form an 8:8 hexadecamer. In addition, it has been demonstrated that N-terminally His(6)-tagged SARS-CoV Nsp8 is a primase able to synthesize RNA oligonucleotides with a length of up to 6 nucleotides. We present here the 2.6-Å crystal structure of the feline coronavirus (FCoV) Nsp7:Nsp8 complex, which is a 2:1 heterotrimer containing two copies of the α-helical Nsp7 with conformational differences between them, and one copy of Nsp8 that consists of an α/β domain and a long-α-helix domain. The same stoichiometry is found for the Nsp7:Nsp8 complex in solution, as demonstrated by chemical cross-linking, size exclusion chromatography, and small-angle X-ray scattering. Furthermore, we show that FCoV Nsp8, like its SARS-CoV counterpart, is able to synthesize short oligoribonucleotides of up to 6 nucleotides in length when carrying an N-terminal His(6) tag. Remarkably, the same protein harboring the sequence GPLG instead of the His(6) tag at its N terminus exhibits a substantially increased, primer-independent RNA polymerase activity. Upon addition of Nsp7, the RNA polymerase activity is further enhanced so that RNA up to template length (67 nucleotides) can be synthesized. Further, we show that the unprocessed intermediate polyprotein Nsp7-10 of human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E is also capable of synthesizing oligoribonucleotides up to a chain length of six. These results indicate that in case of FCoV as well as of HCoV 229E, the formation of a hexadecameric Nsp7:Nsp8 complex is not necessary for RNA polymerase activity. Further, the FCoV Nsp7:Nsp8 complex functions as a noncanonical RNA polymerase capable of synthesizing RNA of up to template length.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.142010909,0.121742455,-0.128463178,0.051911587,0.009511636,-0.082601147,-0.020614373000000002,-0.045821075999999995,-0.001093252,-0.07366227,0.112509388,0.10129722599999999,0.08928435900000001,-0.005042576,-0.039438235,0.016043138000000002,0.034999179,-0.041661801,-0.0026125429999999997,0.033176528999999996,-0.044547102000000005,-0.007423319,0.054251535,-0.065846958,0.02478121,0.0007117769999999999,-0.050979219000000006,0.04584546,0.012140338999999998,0.027810107999999997
1479,In vitro Transcription and Capping of Gaussia Luciferase mRNA Followed by HeLa Cell Transfection,"In vitro transcription is the synthesis of RNA transcripts by RNA polymerase from a linear DNA template containing the corresponding promoter sequence (T7, T3, SP6) and the gene to be transcribed (Figure 1A). A typical transcription reaction consists of the template DNA, RNA polymerase, ribonucleotide triphosphates, RNase inhibitor and buffer containing Mg(2+) ions. Large amounts of high quality RNA are often required for a variety of applications. Use of in vitro transcription has been reported for RNA structure and function studies such as splicing(1), RNAi experiments in mammalian cells(2), antisense RNA amplification by the ""Eberwine method""(3), microarray analysis(4) and for RNA vaccine studies(5). The technique can also be used for producing radiolabeled and dye labeled probes(6). Warren, et al. recently reported reprogramming of human cells by transfection with in vitro transcribed capped RNA(7). The T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit from New England Biolabs has been designed to synthesize up to 180 μg RNA per 20 μl reaction. RNA of length up to 10kb has been successfully transcribed using this kit. Linearized plasmid DNA, PCR products and synthetic DNA oligonucleotides can be used as templates for transcription as long as they have the T7 promoter sequence upstream of the gene to be transcribed. Addition of a 5' end cap structure to the RNA is an important process in eukaryotes. It is essential for RNA stability(8), efficient translation(9), nuclear transport(10) and splicing(11). The process involves addition of a 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5' triphosphate end of the RNA. RNA capping can be carried out post-transcriptionally using capping enzymes or co-transcriptionally using cap analogs. In the enzymatic method, the mRNA is capped using the Vaccinia virus capping enzyme(12,13). The enzyme adds on a 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5' end of the RNA using GTP and S-adenosyl methionine as donors (cap 0 structure). Both methods yield functionally active capped RNA suitable for transfection or other applications(14) such as generating viral genomic RNA for reverse-genetic systems(15) and crystallographic studies of cap binding proteins such as eIF4E(16). In the method described below, the T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit from NEB is used to synthesize capped and uncapped RNA transcripts of Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) and Cypridina luciferase (CLuc). A portion of the uncapped GLuc RNA is capped using the Vaccinia Capping System (NEB). A linearized plasmid containing the GLuc or CLuc gene and T7 promoter is used as the template DNA. The transcribed RNA is transfected into HeLa cells and cell culture supernatants are assayed for luciferase activity. Capped CLuc RNA is used as the internal control to normalize GLuc expression.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.23751766300000002,-0.050512334000000006,-0.014730107,0.14079480800000002,-0.04344659,-0.150405255,-0.067831273,0.05668109599999999,-0.082591588,0.024652788999999998,0.008580893000000001,-0.043838133,0.00838305,0.050448230999999996,-0.022149027999999998,0.044554925999999995,-0.04868322,-0.020106617,-0.017611923999999998,0.0013606360000000001,-0.053649049000000004,0.062304736,0.10859507,-0.024359419,-0.011674219,-0.136423042,-0.065509682,0.082445904,0.074048422,0.07960402400000001
1480,"Natural Occurrence and Characterization of Two Internal Ribosome Entry Site Elements in a Novel Virus, Canine Picodicistrovirus, in the Picornavirus-Like Superfamily","Dicistroviridae and Picornaviridae are two phylogenetically related families of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses in the picornavirus-like superfamily with similar gene contents but different genome organizations and hosts. In a surveillance study involving 1,472 samples from 368 dogs over a 22-month period, we identified a novel picornavirus-like virus from 47 fecal and urine samples by the use of reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of three complete genomes revealed that, although it seemed that the virus was most closely related to other picornaviruses, P1, P2, and P3 of the virus possessed very low amino acid identities of <30% to those of all other known picornaviruses and that the amino acid identities between the 3D(pol) and 2C of the virus and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and helicases of all other picornaviruses were <35%. Distinct from other picornaviruses, the genomes of the virus contain two putative internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) and two open reading frames, encoding two polyprotein precursors (844 and 1,406 amino acids), separated by an intergenic region (IGR) of 588 bases. A dual-luciferase activity assay using DNA and RNA transfection revealed that both IRESs were functional. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that numbers of viral RNAs ranged from 7.55 × 10(6) to 1.26 × 10(9) copies/ml of urine and 1.82 × 10(6) to 4.97 × 10(10) copies/ml of fecal sample. This is the first report of the natural occurrence of two functional IRESs in nondicistroviruses.

Molecular studies of both proteins have revealed how they interact with the cellular machinery to control transcription from the viral LTR and regulate the levels of spliced and unspliced mRNAs.

1484,A viral deubiquitylating enzyme targets viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and affects viral infectivity,"Selective protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays an essential role in many major cellular processes, including host–pathogen interactions. We previously reported that the tightly regulated viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the positive-strand RNA virus Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) is degraded by the UPS in infected cells, a process that affects viral infectivity. Here, we show that the TYMV 98K replication protein can counteract this degradation process thanks to its proteinase domain. In-vitro assays revealed that the recombinant proteinase domain is a functional ovarian tumour (OTU)-like deubiquitylating enzyme (DUB), as is the 98K produced during viral infection. We also demonstrate that 98K mediates in-vivo deubiquitylation of TYMV RdRp protein—its binding partner within replication complexes—leading to its stabilization. Finally, we show that this DUB activity contributes to viral infectivity in plant cells. The identification of viral RdRp as a specific substrate of the viral DUB enzyme thus reveals the intricate interplay between ubiquitylation, deubiquitylation and the interaction between viral proteins in controlling levels of RdRp and viral infectivity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.228116686,-0.075801705,-0.110202834,0.115980943,-0.127997774,-0.044191059000000005,0.08415139099999999,-0.013729865,-0.00634976,0.067064443,0.056275683,0.029102611,-0.053409276,0.07787689099999999,-0.044425440999999996,-0.067828467,0.08465787400000001,-0.087166038,-0.026322339,0.022686328,-0.017950017,0.044929658,0.010189142,-0.078824773,0.035630043,0.073368664,0.048428225,-0.002777955,-0.013902646999999999,0.093304192
1486,Replication of the Rotavirus Genome Requires an Active Ubiquitin-Proteasome System,"Here we show that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is required for the efficient replication of rotavirus RRV in MA104 cells. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 decreased the yield of infectious virus under conditions where it severely reduces the synthesis of not only viral but also cellular proteins. Addition of nonessential amino acids to the cell medium restored both viral protein synthesis and cellular protein synthesis, but the production of progeny viruses was still inhibited. In medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids, we showed that MG132 does not affect rotavirus entry but inhibits the replication of the viral genome. It was also shown that it prevents the efficient incorporation into viroplasms of viral polymerase VP1 and the capsid proteins VP2 and VP6, which could explain the inhibitory effect of MG132 on genome replication and infectious virus yield. We also showed that ubiquitination is relevant for rotavirus replication since the yield of rotavirus progeny in cells carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme was reduced at the restrictive temperature. In addition, overexpression of ubiquitin in MG132-treated MA104 cells partially reversed the effect of the inhibitor on virus yield. Altogether, these data suggest that the ubiquitin-proteasome (UP) system has a very complex interaction with the rotavirus life cycle, with both the ubiquitination and proteolytic activities of the system being relevant for virus replication.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.15194947,-0.074393666,-0.033721585,-0.00092914,-0.100279701,0.018896523999999998,0.021287722000000002,-0.031374096000000004,0.040024916,0.030637017000000002,-0.002464487,-0.031689909,-0.019013327,0.084954269,0.020785351,-0.019057029,0.023131923999999998,-0.053440481,0.011204087,0.056303339,-0.032787732,0.058922722000000004,-0.029060272,-0.025115093999999998,0.05720829,0.045001035999999994,-0.008183709,-0.045221218,-0.09234423300000001,0.031971584
1496,Assembly of Alphavirus Replication Complexes from RNA and Protein Components in a Novel trans-Replication System in Mammalian Cells,"For positive-strand RNA viruses, the viral genomic RNA also acts as an mRNA directing the translation of the replicase proteins of the virus. Replication takes place in association with cytoplasmic membranes, which are heavily modified to create specific replication compartments. Here we have expressed by plasmid DNA transfection the large replicase polyprotein of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) in mammalian cells from a nonreplicating mRNA and provided a separate RNA containing the replication signals. The replicase proteins were able to efficiently and specifically replicate the template in trans, leading to accumulation of RNA and marker gene products expressed from the template RNA. The replicase proteins and double-stranded RNA replication intermediates localized to structures similar to those seen in SFV-infected cells. Using correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) with fluorescent marker proteins to relocate those transfected cells, in which active replication was ongoing, abundant membrane modifications, representing the replication complex spherules, were observed both at the plasma membrane and in intracellular endolysosomes. Thus, replication complexes are faithfully assembled and localized in the trans-replication system. We demonstrated, using CLEM, that the replication proteins alone or a polymerase-negative polyprotein mutant together with the template did not give rise to spherule formation. Thus, the trans-replication system is suitable for cell biological dissection and examination in a mammalian cell environment, and similar systems may be possible for other positive-strand RNA viruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.260772026,-0.086090338,-0.08479822699999999,0.108417289,-0.09912060800000001,-0.078516554,-0.014315423,0.008412299,0.000377309,-0.009131434,0.040660298,-0.050941339,-0.016958293,0.16069072,0.014985455,0.039538288,0.025770074,-0.09104692699999999,0.03527845,0.057765805999999996,-0.067831669,0.082030432,-0.043301461,-0.108123691,0.019665624,-0.022337342000000003,-0.091386757,0.022484087000000003,-0.113485746,-0.0029884440000000003
1499,Functional Analysis of Two Cavities in Flavivirus NS5 Polymerase,"Flavivirus NS5 protein encodes methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activities. Structural analysis of flavivirus RdRp domains uncovered two conserved cavities (A and B). Both cavities are located in the thumb subdomains and represent potential targets for development of allosteric inhibitors. In this study, we used dengue virus as a model to analyze the function of the two RdRp cavities. Amino acids from both cavities were subjected to mutagenesis analysis in the context of genome-length RNA and recombinant NS5 protein; residues critical for viral replication were subjected to revertant analysis. For cavity A, we found that only one (Lys-756) of the seven selected amino acids is critical for viral replication. Alanine substitution of Lys-756 did not affect the RdRp activity, suggesting that this residue functions through a nonenzymatic mechanism. For cavity B, all four selected amino acids (Leu-328, Lys-330, Trp-859, and Ile-863) are critical for viral replication. Biochemical and revertant analyses showed that three of the four mutated residues (Leu-328, Trp-859, and Ile-863) function at the step of initiation of RNA synthesis, whereas the fourth residue (Lys-330) functions by interacting with the viral NS3 helicase domain. Collectively, our results have provided direct evidence for the hypothesis that cavity B, but not cavity A, from dengue virus NS5 polymerase could be a target for rational drug design.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.207052182,-0.054248942,-0.080836176,0.078662241,-0.055721683,-0.029847497999999997,0.051422162,0.003590564,-0.032766506,0.034728932000000004,0.049680049000000004,0.10870924,-0.06229327,-0.058149520999999996,-0.06948555299999999,-0.081154604,0.079634064,-0.025988206,-0.019417987,-0.004291145,-0.003084147,-0.006527369,0.015027644,-0.046201099999999995,0.047729734,0.11190702599999999,0.038216779,-0.019430987,0.014766703999999999,0.076988031
1503,Long range interaction networks in the function and fidelity of poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase studied by nuclear magnetic resonance,"The fidelity of the poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3D(pol)) plays a direct role in the genomic evolution and pathogenesis of the virus. A single site mutation (Gly64Ser) that is remote from the catalytic center results in a higher fidelity polymerase. NMR studies with [methyl-(13)C]methionine-labeled protein were used to compare the solution structure and dynamics of wild-type and Gly64Ser 3D(pol). The chemical shifts for the Met6 resonance were significantly different between wild-type and Gly64Ser 3D(pol) when bound in ternary complexes with RNA and incorrect, but not with correct, nucleotide, suggesting that the Gly64Ser mutation induces structural changes in the N-terminal β-strand when the enzyme is bound to incorrect, but not correct nucleotide. We also observe changes in the transverse relaxation times for methionines near regions important for nucleotide and RNA binding, and catalysis. Our strategy to assign the [methyl-(13)C]methionine resonances involved separately mutating each of the seventeen methionines. Several substitutions produced additional resonances for both Met6 and Met187, a reporter for RNA binding and conformational changes in the highly conserved motif B loop, even though these methionines are greater than 20 Å apart. The results for Gly64Ser and the other mutants are intriguing considering that they can result in structural and/or dynamic changes to methionines distant from the site of mutation. We propose that there is a long-distance network operating throughout 3D(pol) that coordinates ligand binding, conformational changes and catalysis. Mutation of Gly64 results in structural and/or dynamic changes to the network that may affect polymerase fidelity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.1749785,-0.047862842999999995,-0.047242535999999995,0.041523267999999995,-0.034645802,-0.029003762000000002,0.030560347999999998,0.015410933,-0.044536687,0.010204358,0.059072169,0.086788264,-0.081290186,-0.047682040999999994,-0.038488978,0.009938875,0.003699452,-0.06589434599999999,-0.10812466300000001,-0.052434035999999996,0.087599325,-0.06258446299999999,0.02400839,0.07223294,-0.026938754,0.007728075,0.005835956,-0.009368449000000001,-0.031816823,-0.10035658900000001
1504,PNRC accumulates in the nucleolus by interaction with B23/nucleophosmin via its nucleolar localization sequence,"PNRC (proline-rich nuclear receptor coregulatory protein) was primarily identified as a coactivator of nuclear receptors (NRs) by our laboratory, which enhances NR-mediated transcription by RNA polymerase II. Recent study has shown that PNRC also stimulates RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription through interaction with the subunit RPC39 of RNA polymerase III. Here, we report that PNRC accumulates in the nucleolus and its depletion by small interfering RNA (siRNA) impairs pre-rRNA transcription by RNA polymerase I. We identified the sequence at position 94–101 ((94)PKKRRKKK(101)) of PNRC as its nucleolar localization sequence (NoLS). Fusion of this sequence to GFP directed GFP to the nucleolus. Characterization of the NoLS revealed that the stretches of six successive basic residues are sufficient to function as a NoLS. Through co-immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrated that the NoLS is necessary and sufficient to mediate the association of PNRC with B23/nucleophosmin. Moreover, B23 depletion by siRNA disrupted the accumulation of PNRC in the nucleolus. Together, our study indicates that PNRC is a novel nucleolar protein that might be involved in regulation of pre-rRNA synthesis, and it localizes to the nucleolus by interaction with B23 via its NoLS. Our study also suggests that the stretches of six successive basic residues (lysine and/or arginine) function as NoLS.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.158510843,-0.041034392,-0.027435023,0.0053622719999999995,-0.021157267999999996,-0.040636354,-0.022473731,0.016079789,-0.005742786999999999,-0.035926162000000005,-0.012358925,0.010748738,-0.020894031,0.001230647,-0.013415015,-0.001655409,0.019878811,-0.024085965,-0.041621449,-0.018503319,-0.019281303,0.013395316,-0.036816,-0.033558115,0.020536887,-0.022855046,-0.016835343,0.022436332000000003,0.044319539000000005,-0.008750765
1505,Nuclear Import of Cytoplasmic Poly(A) Binding Protein Restricts Gene Expression via Hyperadenylation and Nuclear Retention of mRNA,"Poly(A) tail length is emerging as an important marker of mRNA fate, where deviations from the canonical length can signal degradation or nuclear retention of transcripts. Pathways regulating polyadenylation thus have the potential to broadly influence gene expression. Here we demonstrate that accumulation of cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein (PABPC) in the nucleus, which can occur during viral infection or other forms of cellular stress, causes mRNA hyperadenylation and nuclear accumulation of poly(A) RNA. This inhibits gene expression but does not affect mRNA stability. Unexpectedly, PABPC-induced hyperadenylation can occur independently of mRNA 3′-end processing yet requires the canonical mRNA poly(A) polymerase II. We find that nuclear PABPC-induced hyperadenylation is triggered by multiple divergent viral factors, suggesting that altering the subcellular localization of PABPC may be a commonly used mechanism to regulate cellular gene expression in a polyadenylation-linked manner.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.147048594,-0.059657814,-0.028349218,-0.08663915400000001,-0.076377578,0.0015398270000000001,-0.019416983999999998,-0.03353256,0.057677805,-0.055252783,-0.095322634,-0.073031086,0.01353838,0.06863810099999999,-0.04527509,0.01437859,0.013500546,-0.09019228300000001,-0.077473371,-0.025720574,0.011935876000000002,0.031676249,-0.01040803,-0.008103261,0.0035693879999999997,-0.108126418,-0.029890536000000002,0.02674119,0.140979461,-0.005853059

Given its essential function in viral replication, understanding the regulation of RdRp is of great importance. Here, we show that Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) RdRp (termed 66K) is degraded by the proteasome at late time points during viral infection and that the accumulation level of 66K affects viral RNA replication in infected Arabidopsis thaliana cells. We mapped the cis-determinants responsible for 66K degradation within its N-terminal noncatalytic domain, but we conclude that 66K is not a natural N-end rule substrate. Instead, we show that a proposed PEST sequence within 66K functions as a transferable degradation motif. In addition, several Lys residues that constitute target sites for ubiquitylation were mapped; mutation of these Lys residues leads to stabilization of 66K. Altogether, these results demonstrate that TYMV RdRp is a target of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in plant cells and support the idea that proteasomal degradation may constitute yet another fundamental level of regulation of viral replication.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.20879915699999999,-0.06883231599999999,-0.097421715,0.117978005,-0.074542304,-0.06280927900000001,0.071044631,0.017489394,-0.052746258,0.048629145,0.090524391,0.057256743,-0.080582923,0.043075128,-0.020719779,-0.010348877,0.030173526000000003,-0.07157877900000001,-0.027516557,0.000597753,0.018896053,0.006659127,-0.0016034460000000001,-0.051353697999999996,-0.01164309,0.025594176,0.016346479,0.006957784,0.014056282,0.032626439
1507,Membrane-shaping host reticulon proteins play crucial roles in viral RNA replication compartment formation and function,"Positive-strand RNA viruses replicate their genomes on membranes with virus-induced rearrangements such as single- or double-membrane vesicles, but the mechanisms of such rearrangements, including the role of host proteins, are poorly understood. Brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNA synthesis occurs in ≈70 nm, negatively curved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane invaginations induced by multifunctional BMV protein 1a. We show that BMV RNA replication is inhibited 80–90% by deleting the reticulon homology proteins (RHPs), a family of membrane-shaping proteins that normally induce and stabilize positively curved peripheral ER membrane tubules. In RHP-depleted cells, 1a localized normally to perinuclear ER membranes and recruited the BMV 2a(pol) polymerase. However, 1a failed to induce ER replication compartments or to recruit viral RNA templates. Partial RHP depletion allowed formation of functional replication vesicles but reduced their diameter by 30–50%. RHPs coimmunoprecipitated with 1a and 1a expression redirected >50% of RHPs from peripheral ER tubules to the interior of BMV-induced RNA replication compartments on perinuclear ER. Moreover, RHP-GFP fusions retained 1a interaction but shifted 1a-induced membrane rearrangements from normal vesicles to double membrane layers, a phenotype also induced by excess 1a-interacting 2a(pol). Thus, RHPs interact with 1a, are incorporated into RNA replication compartments, and are required for multiple 1a functions in replication compartment formation and function. The results suggest possible RHP roles in the bodies and necks of replication vesicles.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.17578570899999998,-0.067801828,-0.066949673,0.024028483,-0.08718086800000001,-0.043913129,0.009985358,0.01605369,0.00534784,-0.017482396,0.031692658,-0.009835901999999999,-0.052979989000000005,0.10963506599999999,-0.007949467,0.037941552,0.043076954,-0.076623792,0.016979544,0.020090669,-0.06553848799999999,0.044036497,-0.072480043,-0.094816321,0.023525755,-0.054053794,-0.087594277,0.027035985,-0.057366415999999996,-0.040369366000000004
1513,Sequence-Function Analysis of the Sendai virus L protein domain VI,"The large (about 2200 amino acids) L polymerase protein of nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses (order Mononegavirales) has six conserved sequence regions (“domains”) postulated to constitute the specific enzymatic activities involved in viral mRNA synthesis, 5′-end capping, cap methylation, 3′ polyadenylation, and genomic RNA replication. Previous studies with vesicular stomatitis virus identified amino acid residues within the L protein domain VI required for mRNA cap methylation. In our recent study we analyzed four amino acid residues within domain VI of the Sendai virus L protein and our data indicated that there could be differences in L protein sequence requirements for cap methylation in two different families of Mononegavirales - rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses. In this study, we conducted a more comprehensive mutational analysis by targeting the entire SeV L protein domain VI, creating twenty-four L mutants, and testing these mutations for their effects on viral mRNA synthesis, cap methylation, viral genome replication and virus growth kinetics. Our analysis identified several residues required for successful cap methylation and virus replication and clearly showed the importance of the K-D-K-E tetrad and glycine-rich motif in the SeV cap methylation. This study is the first extensive sequence analysis of the L protein domain VI in the family Paramyxoviridae, and it confirms structural and functional similarity of this domain across different families of the order Mononegavirales.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.160076983,-0.08455708199999999,-0.069460591,0.012268807,-0.012738506,-0.049376297,-0.041938314,0.020557686000000002,-0.064858131,0.028130835,-0.087442831,-0.0060977159999999996,0.023257938,-0.052943072,-0.09111771800000001,-0.11086779199999999,0.065682916,-0.048004778,-0.072012082,0.099084973,-0.014144038000000001,0.085848072,0.12163787699999999,0.027066802999999997,0.11567052300000001,-0.019146723,-0.009774805,0.025525282000000003,0.117872996,0.043832257
1517,Subgenomic messenger RNA amplification in coronaviruses,"Coronaviruses possess the largest known RNA genome, a 27- to 32-kb (+)-strand molecule that replicates in the cytoplasm. During virus replication, a 3′ coterminal nested set of five to eight subgenomic (sg) mRNAs are made that are also 5′ coterminal with the genome, because they carry the genomic leader as the result of discontinuous transcription at intergenic donor signals during (−)-strand synthesis when templates for sgmRNA synthesis are made. An unanswered question is whether the sgmRNAs, which appear rapidly and abundantly, undergo posttranscriptional amplification. Here, using RT-PCR and sequence analyses of head-to-tail–ligated (−) strands, we show that after transfection of an in vitro–generated marked sgmRNA into virus-infected cells, the sgmRNA, like the genome, can function as a template for (−)-strand synthesis. Furthermore, when the transfected sgmRNA contains an internally placed RNA-dependent RNA polymerase template-switching donor signal, discontinuous transcription occurs at this site, and a shorter, 3′ terminally nested leader-containing sgmRNA is made, as evidenced by its leader–body junction and by the expression of a GFP gene. Thus, in principle, the longer-nested sgmRNAs in a natural infection, all of which contain potential internal template-switching donor signals, can function to increase the number of the shorter 3′-nested sgmRNAs. One predicted advantage of this behavior for coronavirus survivability is an increased chance of maintaining genome fitness in the 3′ one-third of the genome via a homologous recombination between the (now independently abundant) WT sgmRNA and a defective genome.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.167035414,-0.036001603,-0.007160524000000001,0.035515046,0.031196272,-0.092886113,-0.080348787,0.035471751,-0.024360756,-0.052489164000000005,-0.003436095,-0.036009746,0.016921622,0.018742603,0.046253842999999996,0.07867,-0.042201199,0.018571793,-0.022860064,-0.019249155,-0.007588753,-0.006117933000000001,-0.034580691000000004,-0.019227609,-0.006462135,-0.070920813,-0.04152528,0.026865417000000003,0.066915671,-0.01529231
1525,Enzymatic and nonenzymatic functions of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases within oligomeric arrays,"Few antivirals are effective against positive-strand RNA viruses, primarily because the high error rate during replication of these viruses leads to the rapid development of drug resistance. One of the favored current targets for the development of antiviral compounds is the active site of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. However, like many subcellular processes, replication of the genomes of all positive-strand RNA viruses occurs in highly oligomeric complexes on the cytosolic surfaces of the intracellular membranes of infected host cells. In this study, catalytically inactive polymerases were shown to participate productively in functional oligomer formation and catalysis, as assayed by RNA template elongation. Direct protein transduction to introduce either active or inactive polymerases into cells infected with mutant virus confirmed the structural role for polymerase molecules during infection. Therefore, we suggest that targeting the active sites of polymerase molecules is not likely to be the best antiviral strategy, as inactivated polymerases do not inhibit replication of other viruses in the same cell and can, in fact, be useful in RNA replication complexes. On the other hand, polymerases that could not participate in functional RNA replication complexes were those that contained mutations in the amino terminus, leading to altered contacts in the folded polymerase and mutations in a known polymerase–polymerase interaction in the two-dimensional protein lattice. Thus, the functional nature of multimeric arrays of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase supplies a novel target for antiviral compounds and provides a new appreciation for enzymatic catalysis on membranous surfaces within cells.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.253903555,-0.07371185799999999,-0.10093862199999999,0.176116615,-0.109718045,-0.017346586,0.069339213,0.039182695,-0.012681943000000001,0.063974888,0.086338938,0.019099055,-0.022244155,0.08718401099999999,0.022055101,0.001224253,-0.017176746,0.027108686,0.044505000999999995,0.045990940999999994,-0.035473698,0.046107367,-0.048990273,-0.001615608,-0.009415094,-0.003816441,0.015024842,-0.019226297,-0.033610616,-0.010330352
1526,NTPase and 5′ to 3′ RNA Duplex-Unwinding Activities of the Hepatitis E Virus Helicase Domain,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a causative agent of acute hepatitis, and it is the sole member of the genus Hepevirus in the family Hepeviridae. The open reading frame 1 (ORF1) protein of HEV encodes nonstructural polyprotein with putative domains for methyltransferase, cysteine protease, helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. It is not yet known whether ORF1 functions as a single protein with multiple domains or is processed to form separate functional units. On the basis of amino acid conserved motifs, HEV helicase has been grouped into helicase superfamily 1 (SF-1). In order to examine the RNA helicase activity of the NTPase/helicase domain of HEV, the region (amino acids 960 to 1204) was cloned and expressed as histidine-tagged protein in Escherichia coli (HEV Hel) and purified. HEV Hel exhibited NTPase and RNA unwinding activities. Enzyme hydrolyzed all rNTPs efficiently, dATP and dCTP with moderate efficiency, while it showed less hydrolysis of dGTP and dTTP. Enzyme showed unwinding of only RNA duplexes with 5′ overhangs showing 5′-to-3′ polarity. We also expressed and purified two HEV Hel mutants. Helicase mutant I, with substitution in the nucleotide-binding motif I (GKS to GAS), showed 30% ATPase activity. Helicase mutant II, with substitutions in the Mg(2+) binding motif II (DEAP to AAAP), showed 50% ATPase activity. Both mutants completely lost ability to unwind RNA duplexes with 5′ overhangs. These findings represent the first report demonstrating NTPase/RNA helicase activity of the helicase domain of HEV ORF1.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.190368112,-0.044243215999999995,-0.057535912,0.017322841000000002,-0.008492403,-0.040198216,-0.014899326999999999,-0.00191397,-0.000612704,-0.027139737,-0.017000896,0.061738296,-0.029076288999999998,-0.063039169,-0.055700895,-0.081159331,0.080399756,0.022804817999999998,0.055421425,-0.007566956999999999,-0.003767022,-0.014137692,-0.004897797,-0.056625703,0.027192157999999998,0.088608966,-0.025008053,-0.004580628,0.003457533,-0.039439378
1529,An N-Terminal Region of Lassa Virus L Protein Plays a Critical Role in Transcription but Not Replication of the Virus Genome,"The central domain of the 200-kDa Lassa virus L protein is a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. N- and C-terminal domains may harbor enzymatic functions important for viral mRNA synthesis, including capping enzymes or cap-snatching endoribonucleases. In the present study, we have employed a large-scale mutagenesis approach to map functionally relevant residues in these regions. The main targets were acidic (Asp and Glu) and basic residues (Lys and Arg) known to form catalytic and binding sites of capping enzymes and endoribonucleases. A total of 149 different mutants were generated and tested in the Lassa virus replicon system. Nearly 25% of evolutionarily highly conserved acidic and basic side chains were dispensable for function of L protein in the replicon context. The vast majority of the remaining mutants had defects in both transcription and replication. Seven residues (Asp-89, Glu-102, Asp-119, Lys-122, Asp-129, Glu-180, and Arg-185) were selectively important for mRNA synthesis. The phenotype was particularly pronounced for Asp-89, Glu-102, and Asp-129, which were indispensable for transcription but could be replaced by a variety of amino acid residues without affecting genome replication. Bioinformatics disclosed the remote similarity of this region to type IIs endonucleases. The mutagenesis was complemented by experiments with the RNA polymerase II inhibitor α-amanitin, demonstrating dependence of viral transcription from the cellular mRNA pool. In conclusion, this paper describes an N-terminal region in L protein being important for mRNA, but not genome synthesis. Bioinformatics and cell biological experiments lend support to the hypothesis that this region could be part of a cap-snatching enzyme.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.164238059,-0.059783935999999996,-0.048888522999999996,0.013169842,-0.036465547,-0.040453128,-0.022103216000000002,0.010648188000000001,-0.017700596000000002,-0.013046142,-0.028707839,0.015133035,-0.002579646,-0.031485722,-0.057808381,-0.047597047,0.054373934000000006,-0.039647892000000004,-0.042892883,0.021022223,-0.016832819,0.027326546,0.032465941,-0.016760381,0.072162982,-0.013714083,-0.025706236,0.020895537,0.060755865,0.014102308000000001
1534,The 3′ end of Turnip crinkle virus contains a highly interactive structure including a translational enhancer that is disrupted by binding to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,"Precise temporal control is needed for RNA viral genomes to translate sufficient replication-required products before clearing ribosomes and initiating replication. A 3′ translational enhancer in Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) overlaps an internal T-shaped structure (TSS) that binds to 60S ribosomal subunits. The higher-order structure in the region was examined through alteration of critical sequences revealing novel interactions between an H-type pseudoknot and upstream residues, and between the TSS and internal and terminal loops of an upstream hairpin. Our results suggest that the TSS forms a stable scaffold that allows for simultaneous interactions with external sequences through base pairings on both sides of its large internal symmetrical loop. Binding of TCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to the region potentiates a widespread conformational shift with substantial rearrangement of the TSS region, including the element required for efficient ribosome binding. Degrading the RdRp caused the RNA to resume its original conformation, suggesting that the initial conformation is thermodynamically favored. These results suggest that the 3′ end of TCV folds into a compact, highly interactive structure allowing RdRp access to multiple elements including the 3′ end, which causes structural changes that potentiate the shift between translation and replication.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.20596825800000002,-0.051446652999999995,-0.066390533,0.07815573,-0.011265546999999999,-0.073060542,-0.012371151,0.038818066,-0.050413102,0.008540876,0.04837261599999999,0.079692891,-0.058570357999999996,-0.063614294,-0.055542687,-0.008971225,0.030752866,-0.028001294,-0.050159835,-0.058947143,0.013972601000000001,-0.031704327000000004,-0.014204163999999998,-0.019756656,-0.028399987999999998,-0.054976592000000005,-0.015748283999999998,0.04688283099999999,0.09994356199999999,-0.0079258
1537,"Turnip Mosaic Virus RNA Replication Complex Vesicles Are Mobile, Align with Microfilaments, and Are Each Derived from a Single Viral Genome","Nicotiana benthamiana plants were agroinoculated with an infectious cDNA clone of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) that was engineered to express a fluorescent protein (green fluorescent protein [GFP] or mCherry) fused to the viral 6K(2) protein known to induce vesicle formation. Cytoplasmic fluorescent discrete protein structures were observed in infected cells, corresponding to the vesicles containing the viral RNA replication complex. The vesicles were motile and aligned with microfilaments. Intracellular movement of the vesicles was inhibited when cells were infiltrated with latrunculin B, an inhibitor of microfilament polymerization. It was also observed that viral accumulation in the presence of this drug was reduced. These data indicate that microfilaments are used for vesicle movement and are necessary for virus production. Biogenesis of the vesicles was further investigated by infecting cells with two recombinant TuMV strains: one expressed 6K(2)GFP and the other expressed 6K(2)mCherry. Green- and red-only vesicles were observed within the same cell, suggesting that each vesicle originated from a single viral genome. There were also vesicles that exhibited sectors of green, red, or yellow fluorescence, an indication that fusion among individual vesicles is possible. Protoplasts derived from TuMV-infected N. benthamiana leaves were isolated. Using immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy, viral RNA synthesis sites were visualized as punctate structures distributed throughout the cytoplasm. The viral proteins VPg-Pro, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and cytoplasmic inclusion protein (helicase) and host translation factors were found to be associated with these structures. A single-genome origin and presence of protein synthetic machinery components suggest that translation of viral RNA is taking place within the vesicle.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.19069181100000002,-0.06873494299999999,-0.052213800000000005,0.031680428999999996,-0.070145475,-0.037296509,-0.010532706999999999,-0.030061187000000003,0.027032256,0.009304726,-0.019490149,-0.069515322,0.011288059,0.08877163800000001,0.000182383,-0.028033717000000003,0.037839564,-0.05821153,0.008773935,0.057110967,-0.055305402000000004,0.072783761,-0.042694354000000004,-0.040154877,0.021560437000000002,0.018487433,0.018728618,-0.020673903,-0.068580285,0.08390421699999999
1541,Biochemical Characterization of Arterivirus Nonstructural Protein 11 Reveals the Nidovirus-Wide Conservation of a Replicative Endoribonuclease,"Nidoviruses (arteriviruses, coronaviruses, and roniviruses) are a phylogenetically compact but diverse group of positive-strand RNA viruses that includes important human and animal pathogens. Nidovirus RNA synthesis is mediated by a cytoplasmic membrane-associated replication/transcription complex that includes up to 16 viral nonstructural proteins (nsps), which carry common enzymatic activities, like the viral RNA polymerase, but also unusual and poorly understood RNA-processing functions. Of these, a conserved endoribonuclease (NendoU) is a major genetic marker that is unique to nidoviruses. NendoU activity was previously verified in vitro for the coronavirus nsp15, but not for any of its distantly related orthologs from other nidovirus lineages, like the arterivirus nsp11. Here, we show that the bacterially expressed nsp11 proteins of two arteriviruses, equine arteritis virus and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus, possess pyrimidine-specific endoribonuclease activity. RNA cleavage was independent of divalent cations in vitro and was greatly reduced by replacement of residues previously implicated in catalysis. Comparative characterization of the NendoU activity in arteriviruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus revealed common and distinct features of their substrate requirements and reaction mechanism. Our data provide the first biochemical evidence of endoribonuclease activity associated with arterivirus nsp11 and support the conclusion that this remarkable RNA-processing enzyme, whose substrate in the infected cell remains to be identified, distinguishes nidoviruses from all other RNA viruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.15934538199999998,-0.037596492,-0.11070099,0.126770242,0.001909539,-0.074638697,0.034204859,0.00963976,-0.021770027,0.021548199,0.041336267,0.016071597,0.00664512,0.04116426,-0.0055263709999999995,-0.043407725,0.061881245,-0.055191842000000005,0.01421348,0.045528462,-0.048060715,-0.0068814290000000005,-0.024004182000000002,-0.07321227400000001,0.038614493,0.010845347,-0.081268855,0.027550368,-0.032646299,-0.049205657
1554,The role of programmed-1 ribosomal frameshifting in coronavirus propagation,"Coronaviruses have the potential to cause significant economic, agricultural and health problems. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus outbreak in late 2002, early 2003 called attention to the potential damage that coronaviruses could cause in the human population. The ensuing research has enlightened many to the molecular biology of coronaviruses. A programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift is required by coronaviruses for the production of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase which in turn is essential for viral replication. The frameshifting signal encoded in the viral genome has additional features that are not essential for frameshifting. Elucidation of the differences between coronavirus frameshift signals and signals from other viruses may help our understanding of these features.

1557,Uncoupling RNA virus replication from transcription via the polymerase: functional and evolutionary insights,"Many eukaryotic positive-strand RNA viruses transcribe subgenomic (sg) mRNAs that are virus-derived messages that template the translation of a subset of viral proteins. Currently, the premature termination (PT) mechanism of sg mRNA transcription, a process thought to operate in a variety of viruses, is best understood in tombusviruses. The viral RNA elements involved in regulating this mechanism have been well characterized in several systems; however, no corresponding protein factors have been identified yet. Here we show that tombusvirus genome replication can be effectively uncoupled from sg mRNA transcription in vivo by C-terminal modifications in its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Systematic analysis of the PT transcriptional pathway using viral genomes harboring mutant RdRps revealed that the C-terminus functions primarily at an early step in this mechanism by mediating both efficient and accurate production of minus-strand templates for sg mRNA transcription. Our results also suggest a simple evolutionary scheme by which the virus could gain or enhance its transcriptional activity, and define global folding of the viral RNA genome as a previously unappreciated determinant of RdRp evolution.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.217240259,-0.069839992,-0.073135072,0.120682316,-0.035154148999999996,-0.086474964,0.0031771,0.033445228,-0.044844728,0.014879548000000001,0.043421113,-0.0026175120000000002,-0.010343799999999998,0.045408030999999995,-0.010499186,0.009126229,0.015784858,-0.071041955,-0.058941670999999994,-0.009504646,-0.028775216,0.023322323,-0.050845104,-0.020745905,-0.036628816,-0.10218431300000001,-0.012682045,0.037426453,0.090168388,0.02115472
1559,A Highly Divergent Picornavirus in a Marine Mammal,"Nucleic acids from an unidentified virus from ringed seals (Phoca hispida) were amplified using sequence-independent PCR, subcloned, and then sequenced. The full genome of a novel RNA virus was derived, identifying the first sequence-confirmed picornavirus in a marine mammal. The phylogenetic position of the tentatively named seal picornavirus 1 (SePV-1) as an outlier to the grouping of parechoviruses was found consistently in alignable regions of the genome. A mean protein sequence identity of only 19.3 to 30.0% was found between the 3D polymerase gene sequence of SePV-1 and those of other picornaviruses. The predicted secondary structure of the short 506-base 5′-untranslated region showed some attributes of a type IVB internal ribosome entry site, and the polyprotein lacked an apparent L peptide, both properties associated with the Parechovirus genus. The presence of two SePV-1 2A genes and of the canonical sequence required for cotranslational cleavage resembled the genetic organization of Ljungan virus. Minor genetic variants were detected in culture supernatants derived from 8 of 108 (7.4%) seals collected in 2000 to 2002, indicating a high prevalence of SePV-1 in this hunted seal population. The high level of genetic divergence of SePV-1 compared to other picornaviruses and its mix of characteristics relative to its closest relatives support the provisional classification of SePV-1 as the prototype for a new genus in the family Picornaviridae.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.122004809,-0.04020945,0.009005421,-0.024556812999999997,0.127893334,-0.022558571,-0.067907025,0.012162369,-0.026996394,-0.017361842,-0.053562425,0.0014009720000000001,0.031756473,-0.100187446,-0.019257083,-0.067513016,0.009138326,0.013113521999999999,-0.023826319,-0.032697389,0.039278395,-0.001256896,-0.031574223,0.044330735,-0.053697179000000005,0.006129061999999999,0.041992974,0.005515997,-0.02543958,-0.00047667900000000003
1560,Influenza Virus mRNA Translation Revisited: Is the eIF4E Cap-Binding Factor Required for Viral mRNA Translation?,"Influenza virus mRNAs bear a short capped oligonucleotide sequence at their 5′ ends derived from the host cell pre-mRNAs by a “cap-snatching” mechanism, followed immediately by a common viral sequence. At their 3′ ends, they contain a poly(A) tail. Although cellular and viral mRNAs are structurally similar, influenza virus promotes the selective translation of its mRNAs despite the inhibition of host cell protein synthesis. The viral polymerase performs the cap snatching and binds selectively to the 5′ common viral sequence. As viral mRNAs are recognized by their own cap-binding complex, we tested whether viral mRNA translation occurs without the contribution of the eIF4E protein, the cellular factor required for cap-dependent translation. Here, we show that influenza virus infection proceeds normally in different situations of functional impairment of the eIF4E factor. In addition, influenza virus polymerase binds to translation preinitiation complexes, and furthermore, under conditions of decreased eIF4GI association to cap structures, an increase in eIF4GI binding to these structures was found upon influenza virus infection. This is the first report providing evidence that influenza virus mRNA translation proceeds independently of a fully active translation initiation factor (eIF4E). The data reported are in agreement with a role of viral polymerase as a substitute for the eIF4E factor for viral mRNA translation.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.07593238299999999,-0.14779898800000002,-0.092116571,0.090317774,-0.077869703,0.111654666,-0.10474376099999999,0.014080978999999999,-0.040414728,-0.033213547,-0.097522314,-0.10388150300000001,0.05950113,0.047594291,-0.07730222,-0.046366814000000006,0.0426055,-0.07896922599999999,-0.07139641299999999,0.11315770300000001,-0.051658195999999997,0.12396420699999999,0.05186002,0.04656497,0.07632643900000001,-0.144769495,-0.018559615,0.025653462000000002,0.171805552,0.099943572
1564,De Novo Initiation of RNA Synthesis by the Arterivirus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase,"All plus-strand RNA viruses encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that functions as the catalytic subunit of the viral replication/transcription complex, directing viral RNA synthesis in concert with other viral proteins and, sometimes, host proteins. RNA synthesis essentially can be initiated by two different mechanisms, de novo initiation and primer-dependent initiation. Most viral RdRps have been identified solely on the basis of comparative sequence analysis, and for many viruses the mechanism of initiation is unknown. In this study, using the family prototype equine arteritis virus (EAV), we address the mechanism of initiation of RNA synthesis in arteriviruses. The RdRp domains of the members of the arterivirus family, which are part of replicase subunit nsp9, were compared to coronavirus RdRps that belong to the same order of Nidovirales, as well as to other RdRps with known initiation mechanisms and three-dimensional structures. We report here the first successful expression and purification of an arterivirus RdRp that is catalytically active in the absence of other viral or cellular proteins. The EAV nsp9/RdRp initiates RNA synthesis by a de novo mechanism on homopolymeric templates in a template-specific manner. In addition, the requirements for initiation of RNA synthesis from the 3′ end of the viral genome were studied in vivo using a reverse genetics approach. These studies suggest that the 3′-terminal nucleotides of the EAV genome play a critical role in viral RNA synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.276934643,-0.072072862,-0.125220699,0.19105295600000002,-0.039543128999999996,-0.13224619699999998,0.026356217,0.044158441,-0.08023390700000001,0.045574607,0.091260404,0.055642906,-0.048878738,0.022886193,-0.033701442000000005,-0.036730137999999996,0.072757038,-0.077696967,-0.026883907999999998,-0.006139718000000001,-0.043423777000000004,0.036965516000000004,-0.033842172000000004,-0.088630485,-0.0017117970000000001,-0.019378475,-0.014385717,0.022576296000000003,0.02600464,0.078288758
1568,"Structure-Function Relationships of the Viral RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase: FIDELITY, REPLICATION SPEED, AND INITIATION MECHANISM DETERMINED BY A RESIDUE IN THE RIBOSE-BINDING POCKET","Studies of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from poliovirus (PV), 3Dpol, have shown that Asn-297 permits this enzyme to distinguish ribose from 2′-deoxyribose. All animal RNA viruses have Asn at the structurally homologous position of their polymerases, suggesting a conserved function for this residue. However, all prokaryotic RNA viruses have Glu at this position. In the presence of Mg(2+), the apparent affinity of Glu-297 3Dpol for 2′-deoxyribonucleotides was decreased by 6-fold relative to wild type without a substantial difference in the fidelity of 2′-dNMP incorporation. The fidelity of ribonucleotide misincorporation for Glu-297 3Dpol was reduced by 14-fold relative to wild type. A 4- to 11-fold reduction in the rate of ribonucleotide incorporation was observed. Glu-297 PV was unable to grow in HeLa cells due to a replication defect equivalent to that observed for a mutant PV encoding an inactive polymerase. Evaluation of the protein-(VPg)-primed initiation reaction showed that only half of the Glu-297 3Dpol initiation complexes were capable of producing VPg-pUpU product and that the overall yield of uridylylated VPg products was reduced by 20-fold relative to wild-type enzyme, a circumstance attributable to a reduced affinity for UTP. These studies identify the first RdRp derivative with a mutator phenotype and provide a mechanistic basis for the elevated mutation frequency of RNA phage relative to animal RNA viruses observed in culture. Although protein-primed initiation and RNA-primed elongation complexes employ the same polymerase active site, the functional differences reported here imply significant structural differences between these complexes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.15390627,-0.052374356,-0.050640987,0.053564640999999996,-0.038069867,-0.031936191,0.038614477,0.015856603,-0.044070229,0.015742117,0.07480277,0.083064359,-0.078721865,-0.020211125,-0.015177101,-0.005674285,0.013303663,-0.055788868,-0.037598135,-0.04481743,0.066276745,-0.03427906,0.04514988599999999,0.012736731000000001,0.001568822,0.045868087,-0.012542504,0.000475586,-0.03746071,-0.035492591000000004
1569,Long-distance RNA–RNA interactions between terminal elements and the same subset of internal elements on the potato virus X genome mediate minus- and plus-strand RNA synthesis,"Potexvirus genomes contain conserved terminal elements that are complementary to multiple internal octanucleotide elements. Both local sequences and structures at the 5′ terminus and long-distance interactions between this region and internal elements are important for accumulation of potato virus X (PVX) plus-strand RNA in vivo. In this study, the role of the conserved hexanucleotide motif within SL3 of the 3′ NTR and internal conserved octanucleotide elements in minus-strand RNA synthesis was analyzed using both a template-dependent, PVX RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) extract and a protoplast replication system. Template analyses in vitro indicated that 3′ terminal templates of 850 nucleotides (nt), but not 200 nt, supported efficient, minus-strand RNA synthesis. Mutational analyses of the longer templates indicated that optimal transcription requires the hexanucleotide motif in SL3 within the 3′ NTR and the complementary CP octanucleotide element 747 nt upstream. Additional experiments to disrupt interactions between one or more internal conserved elements and the 3′ hexanucleotide element showed that long-distance interactions were necessary for minus-strand RNA synthesis both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, multiple internal octanucleotide elements could serve as pairing partners with the hexanucleotide element in vivo. These cis-acting elements and interactions correlate in several ways to those previously observed for plus-strand RNA accumulation in vivo, suggesting that dynamic interactions between elements at both termini and the same subset of internal octanucleotide elements are required for both minus- and plus-strand RNA synthesis and potentially other aspects of PVX replication.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.216932297,-0.06694233299999999,-0.062116305999999996,0.086961157,-0.0034565140000000004,-0.116456959,-0.032244971000000004,0.062108221,-0.069209643,-0.024923702000000002,0.061184382999999995,0.042173084000000007,-0.047012782,-0.010311510999999999,-0.003708226,0.051016625,0.003270731,-0.005688769000000001,-0.00986889,-0.073172324,-0.026154757999999997,-0.007882461,-0.04549669,-0.069753261,-0.056843662,-0.12102997300000001,-0.091211526,0.066326052,0.107632379,-0.005350143000000001
1570,Antiviral Activity and RNA Polymerase Degradation Following Hsp90 Inhibition in a Range of Negative Strand Viruses,"We have analyzed the effectiveness of Hsp90 inhibitors in blocking the replication of negative-strand RNA viruses. In cells infected with the prototype negative strand virus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), inhibiting Hsp90 activity reduced viral replication in cells infected at both high and low multiplicities of infection. This inhibition was observed using two Hsp90 inhibitors geldanamycin and radicicol. Silencing of Hsp90 expression using siRNA also reduced viral replication. Hsp90 inhibition changed the half-life of newly synthesized L protein (the large subunit of the VSV polymerase) from >1 hour to less than 15 minutes without affecting the stability of other VSV proteins. Both the inhibition of viral replication and the destabilization of the viral L protein were seen when either geldanamycin or radicicol was added to cells infected with paramyxoviruses SV5, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, or SV41, or to cells infected with the La Crosse bunyavirus. Based these results we propose that Hsp90 is a host factor that is important for the replication of many negative strand viruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14904598900000002,-0.08395055800000001,-0.065233421,0.035559803,-0.134978889,0.020071419,0.038383559,-0.017403448999999998,0.048954906,0.016417655,0.013521492,-0.060561570999999995,-0.012737163999999999,0.159885367,0.048515104,0.03955501,0.029471297,-0.019472423,0.041950367,0.073730213,-0.03366761,0.08804636,-0.022232895,-0.020281206,0.005723631999999999,0.006256241,-0.009299456999999999,-0.016545524,-0.053675112000000004,0.041733625
1574,"A second, non-canonical RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in SARS Coronavirus","In (+) RNA coronaviruses, replication and transcription of the giant ∼30 kb genome to produce genome- and subgenome-size RNAs of both polarities are mediated by a cognate membrane-bound enzymatic complex. Its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity appears to be supplied by non-structural protein 12 (nsp12) that includes an RdRp domain conserved in all RNA viruses. Using SARS coronavirus, we now show that coronaviruses uniquely encode a second RdRp residing in nsp8. This protein strongly prefers the internal 5′-(G/U)CC-3′ trinucleotides on RNA templates to initiate the synthesis of complementary oligonucleotides of <6 residues in a reaction whose fidelity is relatively low. Distant structural homology between the C-terminal domain of nsp8 and the catalytic palm subdomain of RdRps of RNA viruses suggests a common origin of the two coronavirus RdRps, which however may have evolved different sets of catalytic residues. A parallel between the nsp8 RdRp and cellular DNA-dependent RNA primases is drawn to propose that the nsp8 RdRp produces primers utilized by the primer-dependent nsp12 RdRp.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.274490012,0.02447619,-0.14856667099999998,0.204118062,0.002916062,-0.127938255,0.046135449,-0.002634713,-0.117368926,0.034369345,0.15650761400000002,0.17649500899999998,-0.09287099,-0.059629010999999996,-0.075960842,-0.032733057999999995,0.104526221,-0.09506082199999999,-0.038700961,-0.046854942000000004,0.027554721,-0.041880345,0.08087120099999999,-0.08153148,0.03565726,0.063727267,-0.029347641,0.05986199,0.024872456,0.043638987000000004
1575,Characterization of White Bream Virus Reveals a Novel Genetic Cluster of Nidoviruses,"The order Nidovirales comprises viruses from the families Coronaviridae (genera Coronavirus and Torovirus), Roniviridae (genus Okavirus), and Arteriviridae (genus Arterivirus). In this study, we characterized White bream virus (WBV), a bacilliform plus-strand RNA virus isolated from fish. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence, organization, and expression of the 26.6-kb genome provided conclusive evidence for a phylogenetic relationship between WBV and nidoviruses. The polycistronic genome of WBV contains five open reading frames (ORFs), called ORF1a, -1b, -2, -3, and -4. In WBV-infected cells, three subgenomic RNAs expressing the structural proteins S, M, and N were identified. The subgenomic RNAs were revealed to share a 42-nucleotide, 5′ leader sequence that is identical to the 5′-terminal genome sequence. The data suggest that a conserved nonanucleotide sequence, CA(G/A)CACUAC, located downstream of the leader and upstream of the structural protein genes acts as the core transcription-regulating sequence element in WBV. Like other nidoviruses with large genomes (>26 kb), WBV encodes in its ORF1b an extensive set of enzymes, including putative polymerase, helicase, ribose methyltransferase, exoribonuclease, and endoribonuclease activities. ORF1a encodes several membrane domains, a putative ADP-ribose 1""-phosphatase, and a chymotrypsin-like serine protease whose activity was established in this study. Comparative sequence analysis revealed that WBV represents a separate cluster of nidoviruses that significantly diverged from toroviruses and, even more, from coronaviruses, roniviruses, and arteriviruses. The study adds to the amazing diversity of nidoviruses and appeals for a more extensive characterization of nonmammalian nidoviruses to better understand the evolution of these largest known RNA viruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.203959969,-0.054425926,-0.060751703,0.023371728999999997,0.137162783,-0.06579952,-0.095594304,0.031167741000000002,-0.016778461,-0.045730415,-0.080609685,-0.009384916,0.056432273,-0.091103158,-0.027476155,-0.066774157,0.052391892,0.001207797,-0.000486151,0.016915523000000002,-0.00311283,-0.011648253999999999,-0.047956164,-0.009987234000000001,-0.037953147,0.005793726,-0.000683525,0.021337491,0.024409292000000003,-0.085990402
1576,Structural and Functional Basis for ADP-Ribose and Poly(ADP-Ribose) Binding by Viral Macro Domains,"Macro domains constitute a protein module family found associated with specific histones and proteins involved in chromatin metabolism. In addition, a small number of animal RNA viruses, such as corona- and toroviruses, alphaviruses, and hepatitis E virus, encode macro domains for which, however, structural and functional information is extremely limited. Here, we characterized the macro domains from hepatitis E virus, Semliki Forest virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV macro domain was determined at 1.8-Å resolution in complex with ADP-ribose. Information derived from structural, mutational, and sequence analyses suggests a close phylogenetic and, most probably, functional relationship between viral and cellular macro domain homologs. The data revealed that viral macro domains have relatively poor ADP-ribose 1""-phosphohydrolase activities (which were previously proposed to be their biologically relevant function) but bind efficiently free and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1-bound poly(ADP-ribose) in vitro.

1579,A cis-replication element functions in both orientations to enhance replication of Turnip crinkle virus,"Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) (family Tombusviridae, genus Carmovirus) is a positive-sense RNA virus containing a 4054-base genome. Previous results indicated that insertion of Hairpin 4 (H4) into a TCV-associated satellite RNA enhanced replication 6-fold in vivo (P. Nagy, J. Pogany, and A. E. Simon, EMBO J. 18:5653–5665, 1999). A detailed structural and functional analysis of H4 has now been performed to investigate its role in TCV replication. RNA structural probing of H4 in full-length TCV supported the sequence forming hairpin structures in both orientations in vitro. Deletion and mutational analyses determined that H4 is important for efficient accumulation of TCV in protoplasts, with a 98% reduction of genomic RNA levels when H4 was deleted. In vitro transcription using p88 [the TCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase] demonstrated that H4 in its plus-sense orientation [H4(+)] caused a nearly 2-fold increase in RNA synthesis from a core hairpin promoter located on TCV plus-strands. H4 in its minus-sense orientation [H4(−)] stimulated RNA synthesis by 100-fold from a linear minus-strand promoter. Gel mobility shift assays indicated that p88 binds H4(+) and H4(−) with equal affinity, which was substantially greater than the binding affinity to the core promoters. These results support roles for H4(+) and H4(−) in TCV replication by enhancing syntheses of both strands through attracting the RdRp to the template.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.123389085,-0.035991266,-0.025705715,0.009160708,-0.020940793,-0.040344582000000004,-0.0005636080000000001,0.020330838,-0.025915032999999997,-0.021660682,0.032838271,0.032641272,-0.041957625,-0.002934313,0.003728402,0.037127009,0.0013616079999999998,-0.008639818,-0.010016266,-0.032649046,-0.00713615,-0.003066713,-0.011925206,-0.032527935,-0.017387365,-0.036655618,-0.039709207,0.016892848999999998,0.032220938,-0.0052349020000000005
1580,Nuclear Localization of Flavivirus RNA Synthesis in Infected Cells,"Flaviviral replication is believed to be exclusively cytoplasmic, occurring within virus-induced membrane-bound replication complexes in the host cytoplasm. Here we show that a significant proportion (20%) of the total RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity from cells infected with West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and dengue virus is resident within the nucleus. Consistent with this, the major replicase proteins NS3 and NS5 of JEV also localized within the nucleus. NS5 was found distributed throughout the nucleoplasm, but NS3 was present at sites of active flaviviral RNA synthesis, colocalizing with NS5, and visible as distinct foci along the inner periphery of the nucleus by confocal and immunoelectron microscopy. Both these viral replicase proteins were also present in the nuclear matrix, colocalizing with the peripheral lamina, and revealed a well-entrenched nuclear location for the viral replication complex. In keeping with this observation, antibodies to either NS3 or NS5 coimmunoprecipitated the other protein from isolated nuclei along with newly synthesized viral RNA. Taken together these data suggest an absolute requirement for both of the replicase proteins for nucleus-localized synthesis of flavivirus RNA. Thus, we conclusively demonstrate for the first time that the host cell nucleus functions as an additional site for the presence of functionally active flaviviral replicase complex.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.202464499,-0.074337427,-0.084791962,0.076668138,-0.093736347,-0.029632274,0.043788847,0.000831878,-0.001488486,0.011813035,0.044409217,0.007285483000000001,-0.043282481,0.09454676099999999,-0.011726621999999999,0.007345955,0.059282840999999996,-0.068158044,0.00972409,0.05134343,-0.049342492,0.055269495999999994,-0.042073270999999995,-0.09828827,0.074989746,0.05721316,-0.015644256000000002,0.00085938,-0.066163477,0.057160410999999994
1581,Restoration in vivo of defective hepatitis delta virus RNA genomes,"The 1679-nt single-stranded RNA genome of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is circular in conformation. It is able to fold into an unbranched rodlike structure via intramolecular base-pairing. This RNA is replicated by host RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Such transcription is unique, because Pol II is known only for its ability to act on DNA templates. The present study addressed the ability of the HDV RNA replication to tolerate insertions of up to 1000 nt of non-HDV sequence either at an end of the rodlike RNA structure or at a site embedded within the rod. The insertions did not interfere with the ability of primary transcripts to be processed in vivo by ribozyme cleavage and ligation. The insertions greatly reduced the ability of genomes to replicate. However, when total RNA from such transfected cells was used to transfect new recipient cells, replicating HDV RNAs could be detected by Northern analyses. The size of the emerged RNAs was consistent with loss of the inserted sequences. RT-PCR, cloning, and sequencing showed that recovery involved removal of inserted sequences with or without small deletions of adjacent RNA sequences. Such restoration of the RNA genome is consistent with a model requiring intramolecular template-switching (RNA recombination) during RNA-directed transcription, in combination with biological selection for maintenance of the rodlike structure of the template.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.257659784,-0.049233172,-0.036748729,0.12230582300000001,0.027790186,-0.12763738300000002,-0.064775738,0.054009308,-0.055777552,-0.007736862,0.049277167999999996,-0.029383531,-0.008109399,0.053886658,0.042720649000000006,0.068819428,-0.061171175,0.005398268,-0.051669087999999995,-0.034969488,0.009932922,0.022336977999999997,-0.040880122000000005,0.010656118000000001,-0.060377917999999996,-0.102385479,-0.005277715,0.047544044,0.039268205,-0.023720176000000003
1583,Bovine Coronavirus 5′-Proximal Genomic Acceptor Hotspot for Discontinuous Transcription Is 65 Nucleotides Wide,"Coronaviruses are positive-strand, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-utilizing viruses that require a polymerase template switch, characterized as discontinuous transcription, to place a 5′-terminal genomic leader onto subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs). The usually precise switch is thought to occur during the synthesis of negative-strand templates for sgmRNA production and to be directed by heptameric core donor sequences within the genome that match an acceptor core (UCUAAAC in the case of bovine coronavirus) near the 3′ end of the 5′-terminal genomic leader. Here it is shown that a 22-nucleotide (nt) donor sequence engineered into a packageable bovine coronavirus defective interfering (DI) RNA and made to match a sequence within the 65-nt virus genomic leader caused a template switch yielding an sgmRNA with only a 33-nt minileader. By changing the donor sequence, acceptor sites between genomic nt 33 and 97 (identical between the DI RNA and the viral genome) could be used to generate sgmRNAs detectable by Northern analysis (∼2 to 32 molecules per cell) by 24 h postinfection. Whether the switch was intramolecular only was not determined since a potentially distinguishing acceptor region in the DI RNA rapidly conformed to that in the helper virus genome through a previously described template switch known as leader switching. These results show that crossover acceptor sites for discontinuous transcription (i) need not include the UCUAAAC core and (ii) rest within a surprisingly wide 5′-proximal “hotspot.” Overlap of this hotspot with that for leader switching and with elements required for RNA replication suggests that it is part of a larger 5′-proximal multifunctional structure.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.196498392,-0.058292529,-0.044451378,0.056268557999999996,0.071986722,-0.13836552400000002,-0.14002252699999998,0.073486681,-0.048843976,-0.06871287400000001,0.007317796,-0.062025112,0.038603253,-0.022979329,0.107087545,0.11784519,-0.12183487300000001,0.075131297,-0.008280222,-0.027203619,0.017568801999999998,-0.013046708999999998,-0.018441815,-0.008061928000000001,0.010361081999999999,-0.061744350999999996,-0.030259542,0.013292917,0.127593264,-0.019901994
1586,Identification of 5′ and 3′ cis-Acting Elements of the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus: Acquisition of Novel 5′ AU-Rich Sequences Restored Replication of a 5′-Proximal 7-Nucleotide Deletion Mutant,"We here demonstrate the successful engineering of the RNA genome of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) by using an infectious cDNA as a bacterial artificial chromosome. Runoff transcription from this cDNA by SP6 polymerase resulted in capped synthetic RNAs bearing authentic 5′ and 3′ ends of the viral genome that had specific infectivities of >5 × 10(5) PFU/μg of RNA. The synthetic viruses recovered from the transfected cells were genotypically and phenotypically indistinguishable from the parental virus. Using our system, a series of genomic RNAs with nucleotide deletions in their 5′ ends produced viruses with decreased or no infectivity. Various pseudorevertants were isolated, and acquisition of novel 5′ sequences of various sizes, composed predominantly of A and U bases, restored their infectivities, providing a novel insight into functional elements of the 5′ end of the PRRSV genome. In addition, our system was further engineered to generate a panel of self-replicating, self-limiting, luciferase-expressing PRRSV viral replicons bearing various deletions. Analysis of these replicons revealed the presence and location of a 3′ cis-acting element in the genome that was required for replication. Moreover, we produced enhanced green fluorescent protein-expressing infectious viruses, which indicates that the PRRSV cDNA/viral replicon/recombinant virus can be developed as a vector for the expression of a variety of heterologous genes. Thus, our PRRSV reverse genetics system not only offers a means of directly investigating the molecular mechanisms of PRRSV replication and pathogenesis but also can be used to generate new heterologous gene expression vectors and genetically defined antiviral vaccines.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.146099442,-0.05471723,-0.007347905,0.024462122000000003,-0.010161954,-0.015808449,-0.04787266900000001,-0.01916504,0.03502721,0.044561368,-0.042060065,-0.089144797,0.041405156,0.061429747,0.09408035,-0.046640645999999994,-0.026831759,-0.030535466,-0.002667552,0.054277396,-0.035410113,0.014497956999999999,0.035472804,-0.023375359,-0.030122881,0.029648945,0.051639133,-0.02718259,-0.084440486,0.061593447999999995
1592,"ADP-Ribose-1""-Monophosphatase: a Conserved Coronavirus Enzyme That Is Dispensable for Viral Replication in Tissue Culture","Replication of the ∼30-kb plus-strand RNA genome of coronaviruses and synthesis of an extensive set of subgenome-length RNAs are mediated by the replicase-transcriptase, a membrane-bound protein complex containing several cellular proteins and up to 16 viral nonstructural proteins (nsps) with multiple enzymatic activities, including protease, polymerase, helicase, methyltransferase, and RNase activities. To get further insight into the replicase gene-encoded functions, we characterized the coronavirus X domain, which is part of nsp3 and has been predicted to be an ADP-ribose-1""-monophosphate (Appr-1""-p) processing enzyme. Bacterially expressed forms of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus X domains were shown to dephosphorylate Appr-1""-p, a side product of cellular tRNA splicing, to ADP-ribose in a highly specific manner. The enzyme had no detectable activity on several other nucleoside phosphates. Guided by the crystal structure of AF1521, an X domain homolog from Archaeoglobus fulgidus, potential active-site residues of the HCoV-229E X domain were targeted by site-directed mutagenesis. The data suggest that the HCoV-229E replicase polyprotein residues, Asn 1302, Asn 1305, His 1310, Gly 1312, and Gly 1313, are part of the enzyme's active site. Characterization of an Appr-1""-pase-deficient HCoV-229E mutant revealed no significant effects on viral RNA synthesis and virus titer, and no reversion to the wild-type sequence was observed when the mutant virus was passaged in cell culture. The apparent dispensability of the conserved X domain activity in vitro indicates that coronavirus replicase polyproteins have evolved to include nonessential functions. The biological significance of the novel enzymatic activity in vivo remains to be investigated.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.179920893,-0.040024207,-0.118932336,0.060825001,0.029447742000000002,-0.07611506400000001,0.024821852999999998,-0.044617963,0.08476977599999999,-0.055078772000000005,-0.04540747,0.245840132,0.19218607399999998,0.08500595400000001,-0.058790918,-0.016209085,0.07421697599999999,-0.056002515,-0.021343933,0.052485097,-0.056647699999999995,-0.0092081,0.019162956999999998,-0.10140455599999999,0.113855593,0.062189697,-0.024054447000000003,0.038328121,-0.017744468,-0.042082500999999994
1594,A loop 2 cytidine-stem 1 minor groove interaction as a positive determinant for pseudoknot-stimulated –1 ribosomal frameshifting,"The molecular determinants of stimulation of –1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (–1 PRF) by RNA pseudoknots are poorly understood. Sugarcane yellow leaf virus (ScYLV) encodes a 28-nt mRNA pseudoknot that promotes –1 PRF between the P1 (protease) and P2 (polymerase) genes in plant luteoviruses. The solution structure of the ScYLV pseudoknot reveals a well ordered loop 2 (L2) that exhibits continuous stacking of A20 through C27 in the minor groove of the upper stem 1 (S1), with C25 flipped out of the triple-stranded stack. Five consecutive triple base pairs flank the helical junction where the 3′ nucleotide of L2, C27, adopts a cytidine 27 N3-cytidine 14 2′-OH hydrogen bonding interaction with the C14-G7 base pair. This interaction is isosteric with the adenosine N1–2′-OH interaction in the related mRNA from beet western yellows virus (BWYV); however, the ScYLV and BWYV mRNA structures differ in their detailed L2–S1 hydrogen bonding and L2 stacking interactions. Functional analyses of ScYLV/BWYV chimeric pseudoknots reveal that the ScYLV RNA stimulates a higher level of –1 PRF (15 ± 2%) relative to the BWYV pseudoknot (6 ± 1%), a difference traced largely to the identity of the 3′ nucleotide of L2 (C27 vs. A25 in BWYV). Strikingly, C27A ScYLV RNA is a poor frameshift stimulator (2.0%) and is destabilized by ≈1.5 kcal·mol(–1) (pH 7.0, 37°C) with respect to the wild-type pseudoknot. These studies establish that the precise network of weak interactions nearest the helical junction in structurally similar pseudoknots make an important contribution to setting the frameshift efficiency in mRNAs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.125494044,-0.054076529000000005,-0.022524867,-0.030753236,0.013846252,-0.029618729,-0.038740579,0.017476127,-0.008910676,-0.03162779,-0.029028145,0.012004221,-0.026624121,-0.056146622,-0.03089413,-0.0005342330000000001,0.00652933,-0.013377093999999999,-0.033167544,-0.039047003999999996,-0.00039334900000000003,-0.029551123999999998,-0.03862803,0.020370014,-0.036956347,-0.089028447,-0.025915422,0.02571166,0.099025535,-0.063402935
1597,Exploiting cis-Acting Replication Elements To Direct Hepatitis C Virus-Dependent Transgene Expression,"We describe here a novel targeting gene therapy strategy to direct gene expression responsive to hepatitis C virus (HCV). The goal was approached by engineering a construct containing the antisense sequence of the transgene and internal ribosome entry site of encephalomyocarditis virus flanked by 5′- and 3′-end sequences of HCV cDNA that contain cis-acting replication elements. Thus, expression of the transgene is only promoted when the minus-strand RNA has been synthesized by the functional replication machinery present in infected cells. Reporter assay and strand-specific reverse transcription-PCR showed selective transgene expression in Huh-7 cells harboring an autonomously replicating HCV subgenome but remaining silent in uninfected cells. Furthermore, using the cytosine deaminase suicide gene as a transgene coupled with recombinant adenovirus delivery, we demonstrated that cytosine deaminase was specifically expressed in replicon cells, resulting in marked chemosensitization of replicon cells to the cytotoxic effects of flucytosine. This new targeting strategy could be extended to other single-stranded RNA viruses encoding the unique RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that has no parallel in mammalian cells.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.23810195399999998,-0.064363748,-0.015900367,0.049946827,-0.057491734,-0.048755058,-0.051261444,-0.015868515,0.043825696,-0.022496343999999998,-0.035491637,-0.04494391,0.017612393,0.164314589,0.002742387,-0.00073083,-0.011108171000000002,0.116146864,0.209656053,-0.09654176099999999,-0.01252646,0.037727682,0.080006543,0.038706408,-0.108466832,-0.072698654,-0.029187456,0.08943253699999999,-0.057228817,-0.031181188
1600,Role of Nucleotides Immediately Flanking the Transcription-Regulating Sequence Core in Coronavirus Subgenomic mRNA Synthesis,"The generation of subgenomic mRNAs in coronavirus involves a discontinuous mechanism of transcription by which the common leader sequence, derived from the genome 5′ terminus, is fused to the 5′ end of the mRNA coding sequence (body). Transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) precede each gene and include a conserved core sequence (CS) surrounded by relatively variable sequences (5′ TRS and 3′ TRS). Regulation of transcription in coronaviruses has been studied by reverse-genetics analysis of the sequences immediately flanking a unique CS in the Transmissible gastroenteritis virus genome (CS-S2), located inside the S gene, that does not lead to detectable amounts of the corresponding mRNA, in spite of its canonical sequence. The transcriptional inactivity of CS-S2 was genome position independent. The presence of a canonical CS was not sufficient to drive transcription, but subgenomic synthesis requires a minimum base pairing between the leader TRS (TRS-L) and the complement of the body TRS (cTRS-B) provided by the CS and its adjacent nucleotides. A good correlation was observed between the free energy of TRS-L and cTRS-B duplex formation and the levels of subgenomic mRNA S2, demonstrating that base pairing between the leader and body beyond the CS is a determinant regulation factor in coronavirus transcription. In TRS mutants with increasing complementarity between TRS-L and cTRS-B, a tendency to reach a plateau in ΔG values was observed, suggesting that a more precise definition of the TRS limits might be proposed, specifically that it consists of the central CS and around 4 nucleotides flanking 5′ and 3′ the CS. Sequences downstream of the CS exert a stronger influence on the template-switching decision according to a model of polymerase strand transfer and template switching during minus-strand synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.11521354,-0.034637812999999996,-0.002986219,-0.046983323,0.033787088,-0.034474381,-0.067293383,0.016620374,-0.003255905,-0.060136777,-0.031755614,-0.017410617,0.014447865,-0.038624346000000004,0.015179294,0.039884105,-0.02645281,0.008764131999999999,-0.033731238,-0.031293765,0.011290551000000001,-0.01423164,-0.024246832000000003,0.01021454,-0.004866238,-0.062388883,-0.033420205,0.026679922999999998,0.091420476,-0.007997865
1602,Short Internal Sequences Involved in Replication and Virion Accumulation in a Subviral RNA of Turnip Crinkle Virus,"cis-acting sequences and structural elements in untranslated regions of viral genomes allow viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases to correctly initiate and transcribe asymmetric levels of plus and minus strands during replication of plus-sense RNA viruses. Such elements include promoters, enhancers, and transcriptional repressors that may require interactions with distal RNA sequences for function. We previously determined that a non-sequence-specific hairpin (M1H) in the interior of a subviral RNA (satC) associated with Turnip crinkle virus is required for fitness and that its function might be to bridge flanking sequences (X. Sun and A. E. Simon, J. Virol. 77:7880-7889, 2003). To establish the importance of the flanking sequences in replication and satC-specific virion repression, segments on both sides of M1H were randomized and subjected to in vivo functional selection (in vivo SELEX). Analyses of winning (functional) sequences revealed three different conserved elements within the segments that could be specifically assigned roles in replication, virion repression, or both. One of these elements was also implicated in the molecular switch that releases the 3′ end from its interaction with the repressor hairpin H5, which is possibly involved in controlling the level of minus-strand synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.208808075,-0.06790588,-0.059796485,0.075621167,0.012088217,-0.078054238,-0.018528084,0.037583225,-0.054318977000000004,0.014188125,0.041995767,-0.003313093,-0.010289054,0.003819758,0.005107911,0.032404196,-0.009433931999999999,-0.018549937,-0.034540912,-0.029137307,-0.023516826,0.007089265,-0.063629064,-0.019243518,-0.072199399,-0.11960498300000001,-0.043936157,0.023399367,0.066679234,0.010110621
1608,cis-Acting RNA Signals in the NS5B C-Terminal Coding Sequence of the Hepatitis C Virus Genome,"The cis-replicating RNA elements in the 5′ and 3′ nontranslated regions (NTRs) of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome have been thoroughly studied before. However, no cis-replicating elements have been identified in the coding sequences of the HCV polyprotein until very recently. The existence of highly conserved and stable stem-loop structures in the RNA polymerase NS5B coding sequence, however, has been previously predicted (A. Tuplin, J. Wood, D. J. Evans, A. H. Patel, and P. Simmonds, RNA 8:824-841, 2002). We have selected for our studies a 249-nt-long RNA segment in the C-terminal NS5B coding region (NS5BCR), which is predicted to form four stable stem-loop structures (SL-IV to SL-VII). By deletion and mutational analyses of the RNA structures, we have determined that two of the stem-loops (SL-V and SL-VI) are essential for replication of the HCV subgenomic replicon in Huh-7 cells. Mutations in the loop and the top of the stem of these RNA elements abolished replicon RNA synthesis but had no effect on translation. In vitro gel shift and filter-binding assays revealed that purified NS5B specifically binds to SL-V. The NS5B-RNA complexes were specifically competed away by unlabeled homologous RNA, to a small extent by 3′ NTR RNA, and only poorly by 5′ NTR RNA. The other two stem-loops (SL-IV and SL-VII) of the NS5BCR domain were found to be important but not essential for colony formation by the subgenomic replicon.

1610,"Alternate, virus-induced membrane rearrangements support positive-strand RNA virus genome replication","All positive-strand RNA [(+)RNA] viruses replicate their RNA on intracellular membranes, often in association with spherular invaginations of the target membrane. For brome mosaic virus, we previously showed that such spherules serve as compartments or mini-organelles for RNA replication and that their assembly, structure, and function have similarities to the replicative cores of retrovirus and double-stranded RNA virus virions. Some other (+)RNA viruses conduct RNA replication in association with individual or clustered double-membrane vesicles, appressed double membranes, or other structures whose possible relationships to the spherular invaginations are unclear. Here we show that modulating the relative levels and interactions of brome mosaic virus replication factors 1a and 2a polymerase (2a(pol)) shifted the membrane rearrangements associated with RNA replication from small invaginated spherules to large, karmellae-like, multilayer stacks of appressed double membranes that supported RNA replication as efficiently as spherules. Spherules were induced by expressing 1a, which has functional similarities to retrovirus virion protein Gag, or 1a plus low levels of 2a(pol). Double-membrane layers were induced by 1a plus higher levels of 2a(pol) and were suppressed by deleting the major 1a-interacting domain from 2a(pol). The stacked, double-membrane layers alternated with spaces that, like spherule interiors, were 50–60 nm wide, connected to the cytoplasm, and contained 1a and 2a(pol). These and other results suggest that seemingly diverse membrane rearrangements associated with RNA replication by varied (+)RNA viruses may represent topologically and functionally related structures formed by similar protein–protein and protein–membrane interactions and interconverted by altering the balances among those interactions.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.210552286,-0.07535145,-0.085446954,0.08308286200000001,-0.055508854,-0.077067405,0.005264296,0.027748995,-0.023526664,-0.007245304,0.050177915999999996,-0.004902549,-0.047863449,0.088992722,-0.010853947,0.023552688,0.046845849,-0.080145035,0.013988469,0.020550474,-0.065200831,0.048779832999999995,-0.077718886,-0.07703501,0.003174759,-0.061456200999999995,-0.080335905,0.005330866,-0.064887418,-0.042891942999999995
1618,Presence of an Encephalomyocarditis Virus Internal Ribosome Entry Site Sequence in Avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus Defective RNAs Abolishes Rescue by Helper Virus,"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) defective RNAs (D-RNAs) have been used for the expression of heterologous genes in a helper-virus-dependent expression system. The heterologous genes were expressed under the control of an IBV transcription-associated sequence (TAS) derived from gene 5 of IBV Beaudette. However, coronavirus D-RNA expression vectors display an inherent instability following serial passage with helper virus, resulting in the eventual loss of the heterologous genes. The use of the picornavirus encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence to initiate gene translation was investigated as an alternative method to the coronavirus-mediated TAS-controlled heterologous gene expression system. IBV D-RNAs containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene, under EMCV IRES control, were assessed for IRES-mediated CAT protein translation. CAT protein was detected from T7-derived IBV D-RNA transcripts in a cell-free protein synthesis system and in situ in avian chick kidney (CK) cells following T7-derived D-RNA synthesis from a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing the bacteriophage T7 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. However, CAT protein was not detected in CK cells from IRES-containing IBV D-RNAs, in which the IRES-CAT construct was inserted at two different positions within the D-RNA, in the presence of helper IBV. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the IRES-containing D-RNAs were not rescued on serial passage with helper virus, indicating that the EMCV IRES sequence had a detrimental effect on IBV D-RNA rescue.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.182738946,-0.058190905999999994,0.02991234,-0.04865191,0.102205479,-0.001776125,-0.195147784,-0.060100308,0.09336087900000001,0.176160703,0.023338745,-0.085784938,-0.011197434,0.08001884599999999,-0.082607961,0.14039629,-0.026282338,-0.009557908,0.014641778000000001,0.022705541,-0.036484221000000004,-0.012870474,0.039456454,-0.032610484,-0.019018776,0.026116237999999996,0.006938073,0.038419037999999996,0.052367862,0.007944704
1621,"Characterization of the Expression, Intracellular Localization, and Replication Complex Association of the Putative Mouse Hepatitis Virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase","Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) RNA synthesis is mediated by a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) on membrane-bound replication complexes in the host cell cytoplasm. However, it is not known how the putative MHV RdRp (Pol) is targeted to and retained on cellular membranes. In this report, we show that a 100-kDa protein was stably detected by an anti-Pol antiserum as a mature product throughout the virus life cycle. Gradient fractionation and biochemical extraction experiments demonstrated that Pol was not an integral membrane protein but was tightly associated with membranes and coimmunoprecipitated with the replicase proteins 3CLpro, p22, and p12. By immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, Pol colocalized with viral proteins at replication complexes, distinct from sites of virion assembly, over the entire course of infection. To determine if Pol associated with cellular membranes in the absence of other viral factors, the pol domain of gene 1 was cloned and expressed in cells as a fusion with green fluorescent protein, termed Gpol. In Gpol-expressing cells that were infected with MHV, but not in mock-infected cells, Gpol relocalized from a diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm to punctate foci that colocalized with markers for replication complexes. Expression of Gpol deletion mutants established that the conserved enzymatic domains of Pol were dispensable for replication complex association, but a 38-amino-acid domain in the RdRp unique region of Pol was required. This study demonstrates that viral or virus-induced factors are necessary for Pol to associate with membranes of replication complexes, and it identifies a defined region of Pol that may mediate its interactions with those factors.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.229668362,-0.083175412,-0.086642676,0.039027975,-0.092671266,-0.054595948,0.002394003,-0.0260476,0.027358537000000002,-0.025113847,-0.009859408,-0.018902121,-0.030582692999999998,0.10163164599999999,-0.029983877000000003,0.00131253,0.062540926,-0.09928858,-0.048477567,0.038372968,-0.013828687,0.046242044,-0.016622805,-0.021924917000000002,0.11380306300000001,0.060098415,-0.009538706999999999,-0.012318856999999999,-0.08675144,-0.023050797
1622,Functional Analysis of Mosquito-Borne Flavivirus Conserved Sequence Elements within 3′ Untranslated Region of West Nile Virus by Use of a Reporting Replicon That Differentiates between Viral Translation and RNA Replication,"We have developed a reporting replicon of West Nile virus (WNV) that could be used to quantitatively distinguish viral translation and RNA replication. A Renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene was fused in-frame with the open reading frame of a subgenomic replicon in the position where the viral structural region was deleted, resulting in RlucRep. Transfection of BHK cells with RlucRep RNA yielded two distinctive Rluc signal peaks, one between 2 and 10 h and the other after 26 h posttransfection. By contrast, only the 2- to 10-h Rluc signal peak was observed in cells transfected with a mutant replicon containing an inactivated viral polymerase NS5 (RlucRep-NS5mt). Immunofluorescence and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assays showed that the levels of viral protein expression and RNA replication increased in cells transfected with the RlucRep but not in those transfected with the RlucRep-NS5mt. These results suggest that the Rluc signal that occurred at 2 to 10 h posttransfection reflects viral translation of the input replicon, while the Rluc activity after 26 h posttransfection represents RNA replication. Using this system, we showed that mutations of conserved sequence (CS) elements within the 3′ untranslated region of the mosquito-borne flaviviruses did not significantly affect WNV translation but severely diminished or completely abolished RNA replication. Mutations of CS1 that blocked the potential base pairing with a conserved sequence in the 5′ region of the capsid gene (5′CS) abolished RNA replication. Restoration of the 5′CS-CS1 interaction rescued viral replication. Replicons containing individual deletions of CS2, repeated CS2 (RCS2), CS3, or RCS3 were viable, but their RNA replication was dramatically compromised. These results demonstrate that genome cyclization through the 5′CS-CS1 interaction is essential for WNV RNA replication, whereas CS2, RCS2, CS3, and RCS3 facilitate, but are dispensable for, WNV replication.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.221442303,-0.067452017,-0.050168665,0.081788715,-0.048848221,-0.08455544699999999,-0.044386227,0.014361645,-0.003571135,-0.006257875,0.016034388,-0.040908263,-0.018203511000000002,0.08696207800000001,-0.00041847,-0.0007766510000000001,-0.006209142,-0.006786004,0.02941836,0.009520461,-0.015430677,0.033914091,-0.012002275,-0.001417531,-0.060259688,-0.022566761,0.024034927999999997,-0.009200293,-0.023121537999999997,0.012757865
1624,An Alternate Pathway for Recruiting Template RNA to the Brome Mosaic Virus RNA Replication Complex,"The multidomain RNA replication protein 1a of brome mosaic virus (BMV), a positive-strand RNA virus in the alphavirus-like superfamily, plays key roles in assembly and function of the viral RNA replication complex. 1a, which encodes RNA capping and helicase-like domains, localizes to endoplasmic reticulum membranes, recruits BMV 2a polymerase and viral RNA templates, and forms membrane-bound, capsid-like spherules in which RNA replication occurs. cis-acting signals necessary and sufficient for RNA recruitment by 1a have been mapped in BMV genomic RNA2 and RNA3. Both signals comprise an extended stem-loop whose apex matches the conserved sequence and structure of the TΨC stem-loop in tRNAs (box B). Mutations show that this box B motif is crucial to 1a responsiveness of wild-type RNA2 and RNA3. We report here that, unexpectedly, some chimeric mRNAs expressing the 2a polymerase open reading frame from RNA2 were recruited by 1a to the replication complex and served as templates for negative-strand RNA synthesis, despite lacking the normally essential, box B-containing 5′ signal. Further studies showed that this template recruitment required high-efficiency translation of the RNA templates. Moreover, multiple small frameshifting insertion or deletion mutations throughout the N-terminal region of the open reading frame inhibited this template recruitment, while an in-frame insertion did not. Providing 2a in trans did not restore template recruitment of RNAs with frameshift mutations. Only those deletions in the N-terminal region of 2a that abolished 2a interaction with 1a abolished template recruitment of the RNA. These and other results indicate that this alternate pathway for 1a-dependent RNA recruitment involves 1a interaction with the translating mRNA via the 1a-interactive N-terminal region of the nascent 2a polypeptide. Interaction with nascent 2a also may be involved in 1a recruitment of 2a polymerase to membranes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.232184473,-0.073016075,-0.07069084,0.0833141,-0.024682066000000003,-0.11606809,-0.062397474,0.061398932,-0.02705955,-0.044181085,0.030981692,0.014555216000000001,-0.04179171,0.019486588,-0.019874824,0.018192498,0.033549639,-0.028913971,0.021861042999999997,-0.008600453000000001,-0.06632959299999999,0.015465365,-0.077296934,-0.083932375,-0.012332763,-0.114071533,-0.10770391900000001,0.036627559,0.019051197,-0.050096287
1626,Coronaviruses Maintain Viability despite Dramatic Rearrangements of the Strictly Conserved Genome Organization,"Despite their high frequency of RNA recombination, the plus-strand coronaviruses have a characteristic, strictly conserved genome organization with the essential genes occurring in the order 5′-polymerase (pol)-S-E-M-N-3′. We have investigated the significance of this remarkable conservation by rearrangement of the murine coronavirus genome through targeted recombination. Thus, viruses were prepared with the following gene order: 5′-pol-S-M-E-N-3′, 5′-pol-S-N-E-M-3′, 5′-pol-M-S-E-N-3′, and 5′-pol-E-M-S-N-3′. All of these viruses were surprisingly viable, and most viruses replicated in cell culture with growth characteristics similar to those of the parental virus. The recombinant virus with the gene order 5′-pol-E-M-S-N-3′ was also tested for the ability to replicate in the natural host, the mouse. The results indicate that the canonical coronavirus genome organization is not essential for replication in vitro and in vivo. Deliberate rearrangement of the viral genes may be useful in the generation of attenuated coronaviruses, which due to their reduced risk of generating viable viruses by recombination with circulating field viruses, would make safer vaccines.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.132870411,-0.052427104,-0.031847781,0.039120132,0.054477766,0.0018047229999999998,0.01424374,-0.00014205200000000001,-0.00739832,0.031308879,-0.008558086,-0.032414799,0.030276357,0.024524143999999998,0.009924628000000001,0.014966905,-0.019726412,-0.066321806,-0.076375759,0.011397127,0.052704102999999995,-0.0032332359999999996,-0.02916571,0.102544684,-0.057783925,-0.048519469,0.027088392000000003,-0.008871156,-0.059745190999999996,-0.137621295
1629,The Synthesis of Minus-Strand RNA of Bamboo Mosaic Potexvirus Initiates from Multiple Sites within the Poly(A) Tail,"The 3′ terminus of the bamboo mosaic potexvirus (BaMV) contains a poly(A) tail, the 5′ portion of which participates in the formation of an RNA pseudoknot required for BaMV RNA replication. Recombinant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of BaMV binds to the pseudoknot poly(A) tail in gel mobility shift assays (C.-Y. Huang, Y.-L. Huang, M. Meng, Y.-H. Hsu, and C.-H. Tsai, J. Virol. 75:2818-2824, 2001). Approximately 20 nucleotides of the poly(A) tail adjacent to the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) are protected from diethylpyrocarbonate modification, suggesting that this region may be used to initiate minus-strand RNA synthesis. The 5′ terminus of the minus-strand RNA synthesized by the RdRp in vitro was examined using 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and DNA sequencing. Minus-strand RNA synthesis was found to initiate from several positions within the poly(A) tail, with the highest frequency of initiation being from the 7th to the 10th adenylates counted from the 5′-most adenylate of the poly(A) tail. Sequence analyses of BaMV progeny RNAs recovered from Nicotiana benthamiana protoplasts which were inoculated with mutants containing a mutation at the 1st, 4th, 7th, or 16th position of the poly(A) tail suggested the existence of variable initiation sites, similar to those found in 5′ RACE experiments. We deduce that the initiation site for minus-strand RNA synthesis is not fixed at one position but resides opposite one of the 15 adenylates of the poly(A) tail immediately downstream of the 3′ UTR of BaMV genomic RNA.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.20414866,-0.055341790999999994,-0.037731516,0.062318091,-0.00824689,-0.109459535,-0.050317754000000006,0.04606429,-0.047327855,-0.032506105,0.042896008,0.031314457999999996,-0.035457602000000005,-0.019526522,-0.0062890459999999995,0.05365067,-0.005946754,-0.0026483759999999996,-0.010871515,-0.041164794,-0.032281999,-0.009744196,-0.016393952,-0.064054504,-0.021904122999999998,-0.078363697,-0.08860262099999999,0.060429329000000004,0.074176557,0.023529371
1632,The Brome mosaic virus subgenomic promoter hairpin is structurally similar to the iron-responsive element and functionally equivalent to the minus-strand core promoter stem-loop C.,"In the Bromoviridae family of plant viruses, trinucleotide hairpin loops play an important role in RNA transcription. Recently, we reported that Brome mosaic virus (BMV) subgenomic (sg) transcription depended on the formation of an unusual triloop hairpin. By native gel electrophoresis, enzymatic structure probing, and NMR spectroscopy it is shown here that in the absence of viral replicase the hexanucleotide loop 5'C1AUAG5A3' of this RNA structure can adopt a pseudo trinucleotide loop conformation by transloop base pairing between C1 and G5. By means of in vitro replication assays using partially purified BMV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) it was found that other base pairs contribute to sg transcription, probably by stabilizing the formation of this pseudo triloop, which is proposed to be the primary element recognized by the viral replicase. The BMV pseudo triloop structure strongly resembles iron-responsive elements (IREs) in cellular messenger RNAs and may represent a general protein-binding motif. In addition, in vitro replication assays showed that the BMV sg hairpin is functionally equivalent to the minus-strand core promoter hairpin stem-loop C at the 3' end of BMV RNAs. Replacement of the sg hairpin by stem-loop C yielded increased sg promoter activity whereas replacement of stem-loop C by the sg hairpin resulted in reduced minus-strand promoter activity. We conclude that AUA triloops represent the common motif in the BMV sg and minus-strand promoters required for recruitment of the viral replicase. Additional sequence elements of the minus-strand promoter are proposed to direct the RdRp to the initiation site at the 3' end of the genomic RNA.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.184213447,-0.059289225,-0.044644869000000004,0.071189556,-0.037939291,-0.095609482,-0.020511952,0.035144468,-0.040171089,-0.02846136,0.026435377000000003,0.046891472000000003,-0.039777315,-0.0048153729999999995,-0.025337642999999997,0.033099027,0.023949835,-0.023685326,-0.047362052,-0.046502802,-0.033705949,-0.014805301000000002,-0.052675436,-0.0349019,-0.0077697109999999995,-0.084898339,-0.083215306,0.06881061200000001,0.092222518,-0.026497851
1633,Reverse Genetics System for the Avian Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus,"Major advances in the study of the molecular biology of RNA viruses have resulted from the ability to generate and manipulate full-length genomic cDNAs of the viral genomes with the subsequent synthesis of infectious RNA for the generation of recombinant viruses. Coronaviruses have the largest RNA virus genomes and, together with genetic instability of some cDNA sequences in Escherichia coli, this has hampered the generation of a reverse-genetics system for this group of viruses. In this report, we describe the assembly of a full-length cDNA from the positive-sense genomic RNA of the avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an important poultry pathogen. The IBV genomic cDNA was assembled immediately downstream of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter by in vitro ligation and cloned directly into the vaccinia virus genome. Infectious IBV RNA was generated in situ after the transfection of restricted recombinant vaccinia virus DNA into primary chick kidney cells previously infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase. Recombinant IBV, containing two marker mutations, was recovered from the transfected cells.

1635,Structural Analysis of the −1 Ribosomal Frameshift Elements in Giardiavirus mRNA,"The RNA polymerase of giardiavirus (GLV) is synthesized as a fusion protein through a −1 ribosomal frameshift in a region where gag and pol open reading frames (ORFs) overlap. A heptamer, CCCUUUA, and a potential pseudoknot found in the overlap were predicted to be required for the frameshift. A 68-nucleotide (nt) cDNA fragment containing these elements was inserted between the GLV 5′ 631-nt cDNA and the out-of-frame luciferase gene that required a −1 frameshift within the 68-nt fragment for expression. Giardia lamblia trophozoites transfected with the transcript of this construct showed a frameshift frequency at 1.7%, coinciding with the polymerase-to-capsid protein ratio in GLV. The heptamer is required for the frameshift but can be replaced with other sequences of the same motif. Mutations placing stop codons in the 0 or −1 frame, located directly before or after the heptamer, implicated the latter as the site for the −1 frameshift. Shortening or destroying the putative stem decreased the frameshift efficiency threefold; the efficiency was fully recovered by mutations to restore the stem. Deleting 18 nt from the 3′ end of the 68-nt fragment, which formed the second stem in the putative pseudoknot, had no effect on the frequency of the frameshift. Chemical probing of the RNA secondary structure in the frameshift region showed that bases resistant to chemical modification were clustered in the putative stem structures, thus confirming the presence of the postulated stem-loop, while all the bases in the loop were chemically modified, thus ruling out their capability of forming a pseudoknot. These results confirmed the conclusion based on data from the mutation study that there is but a simple stem-loop downstream from the heptamer. Together, they constitute the structural elements for a −1 ribosomal frameshift in the GLV transcript.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.147671768,-0.049799234000000005,-0.012639186,-0.044564211,0.046861238,-0.060914752,-0.10208658300000001,0.027765125,-0.00389873,-0.076422317,-0.087161819,0.001255798,0.005994793000000001,-0.113799256,-0.051610737999999996,-0.028222847000000002,0.038271265,0.018755606,-0.017826945,-0.058986957,-0.012139038999999999,-0.054926250999999995,-0.072567822,0.038667124,-0.063815139,-0.080185498,-0.037491991,0.01977972,0.106182786,-0.100415394
1637,Downstream Sequences Influence the Choice between a Naturally Occurring Noncanonical and Closely Positioned Upstream Canonical Heptameric Fusion Motif during Bovine Coronavirus Subgenomic mRNA Synthesis,"Mechanisms leading to subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) synthesis in coronaviruses are poorly understood but are known to involve a heptameric signaling motif, originally called the intergenic sequence. The intergenic sequence is the presumed crossover region (fusion site) for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) during discontinuous transcription, a process leading to sgmRNAs that are both 5′ and 3′ coterminal. In the bovine coronavirus, the major fusion site for synthesis of mRNA 5 (GGUAGAC) does not conform to the canonical motif (UC[U,C]AAAC) at three positions (underlined), yet it lies just 14 nucleotides downstream from such a sequence (UCCAAAC). The infrequently used canonical sequence, by computer prediction, is buried within the stem of a stable hairpin (−17.2 kcal/mol). Here we document the existence of this stem by enzyme probing and examine its influence and that of neighboring sequences on the unusual choice of fusion sites by analyzing transcripts made in vivo from mutated defective interfering RNA constructs. We learned that (i) mutations that were predicted to unfold the stem-loop in various ways did not switch RdRp crossover to the upstream canonical site, (ii) a totally nonconforming downstream motif resulted in no measurable transcription from either site, (iii) the canonical upstream site does not function ectopically to lend competence to the downstream noncanonical site, and (iv) altering flanking sequences downstream of the downstream noncanonical motif in ways that diminish sequence similarity with the virus genome 5′ end caused a dramatic switch to the upstream canonical site. These results show that sequence elements downstream of the noncanonical site can dramatically influence the choice of fusion sites for synthesis of mRNA 5 and are interpreted as being most consistent with a mechanism of similarity-assisted RdRp strand switching during minus-strand synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.19484513,-0.055823522,-0.044526511,0.017574521,0.040833057,-0.08649273,-0.084016552,0.043092644000000006,-0.034769652000000005,-0.0635149,-0.015464428,0.034430492,-0.010180764,-0.08410831,-0.018238828000000002,0.014762147,-0.0014524579999999998,0.000743972,-0.047275089000000006,-0.065340171,0.033319645,-0.046516592999999995,-0.01045415,0.00487529,-0.006691609,-0.057463028,-0.053217652000000004,0.046956705999999994,0.146440969,-0.039065775
1639,The packaging signal of influenza viral RNA molecules.,"The packaging signal present in influenza viral RNA molecules is shown not to constitute a separate structural element, but to reside within the 5'-bulged promoter structure, as caused by the central unpaired residue A10 in its 5' branch. Upon insertion of two uridine residues in the 3' branch opposite A10, the minus-strand viral RNA (vRNA) promoter is converted into a 3'-bulged structure, whereas the plus-strand cRNA promoter instead adopts the 5'-bulged conformation. In this promoter variant it is exclusively the cRNA that is found packaged in the progeny virions. Upon insertion of only a single uridine nucleotide opposite 5'A10, the two debulged structures of the vRNA and cRNA promoters are rendered identical, and both vRNA and cRNA molecules are packaged indiscriminately, in a 1:1 ratio, but at lower rates. We propose that the binding interactions of viral polymerase with either of the two differently bulged vRNA and cRNA promoter structures result in two different conformations of the enzyme protein. Only the 5' bulged RNA-associated polymerase conformation appears to be recognized for nuclear export, which depends on nuclear matrix protein M1 and nonstructural protein NS2. And the respective wild-type vRNP- or insertion mutant cRNP complex is observed to enter the cytoplasm and hence is included in the viral encapsidation process, which takes place at the plasma membrane.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.129165529,-0.06002742900000001,-0.045730665,0.021705882000000003,-0.049360679000000005,-0.016909188999999998,-0.009922553,0.0053671000000000005,-0.015366228000000001,-0.025503603,0.007425845,0.019987932,-0.033020889,-0.00997383,-0.012239083999999999,0.00888191,0.021177151,-0.038775752000000004,-0.040666461,-0.002651837,-0.008692146,0.01844775,-0.035624658999999996,-0.028394982000000003,0.013959813,-0.026168706,-0.022692853,-0.0043630990000000005,0.027211634,0.026721215
1640,Biogenesis of the Semliki Forest Virus RNA Replication Complex,"The nonstructural (ns) proteins nsP1 to -4, the components of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) RNA polymerase, were localized in infected cells by confocal microscopy using double labeling with specific antisera against the individual ns proteins. All ns proteins were associated with large cytoplasmic vacuoles (CPV), the inner surfaces of which were covered by small invaginations, or spherules, typical of alphavirus infection. All ns proteins were localized by immuno-electron microscopy (EM) to the limiting membranes of CPV and to the spherules, together with newly labeled viral RNA. Along with earlier observations by EM-autoradiography (P. M. Grimley, I. K. Berezesky, and R. M. Friedman, J. Virol. 2:326–338, 1968), these results suggest that individual spherules represent template-associated RNA polymerase complexes. Immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled ns proteins showed that each antiserum precipitated the other three ns proteins, implying that they functioned as a complex. Double labeling with organelle-specific and anti-ns-protein antisera showed that CPV were derivatives of late endosomes and lysosomes. Indeed, CPV frequently contained endocytosed bovine serum albumin-coated gold particles, introduced into the medium at different times after infection. With time, increasing numbers of spherules were also observed on the cell surfaces; they were occasionally released into the medium, probably by secretory lysosomes. We suggest that the spherules arise by primary assembly of the RNA replication complexes at the plasma membrane, guided there by nsP1, which has affinity to lipids specific for the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Endosomal recycling and fusion of CPV with the plasma membrane can circulate spherules between the plasma membrane and the endosomal-lysosomal compartment.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.117163241,-0.038284466,-0.010710055,-0.02515891,-0.058700962999999995,-0.017960468,0.013205865,-0.004575013,0.007012961999999999,-0.034842792000000004,0.006965872,-0.007381389,-0.024486567,0.034836426000000004,0.02197704,0.008736914,0.018762854,-0.07284471099999999,0.047791592,0.034590813,0.003994617,0.064205736,-0.057295433,-0.096028389,0.079051539,-0.015441491000000002,-0.070500395,-0.001932172,-0.104635356,0.047866698
1641,Sequences at the 3′ Untranslated Region of Bamboo Mosaic Potexvirus RNA Interact with the Viral RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase,"The 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of bamboo mosaic potexvirus (BaMV) genomic RNA was found to fold into a series of stem-loop structures including a pseudoknot structure. These structures were demonstrated to be important for viral RNA replication and were believed to be recognized by the replicase (C.-P. Cheng and C.-H. Tsai, J. Mol. Biol. 288:555–565, 1999). Electrophoretic mobility shift and competition assays have now been used to demonstrate that the Escherichia coli-expressed RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain (Δ893) derived from BaMV open reading frame 1 could specifically bind to the 3′ UTR of BaMV RNA. No competition was observed when bovine liver tRNAs or poly(I)(C) double-stranded homopolymers were used as competitors, and the cucumber mosaic virus 3′ UTR was a less efficient competitor. Competition analysis with different regions of the BaMV 3′ UTR showed that Δ893 binds to at least two independent RNA binding sites, stem-loop D and the poly(A) tail. Footprinting analysis revealed that Δ893 could protect the sequences at loop D containing the potexviral conserved hexamer motif and part of the stem of domain D from chemical cleavage.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.190535502,-0.042451789000000004,-0.028867102999999998,0.041594342,0.007855278,-0.076268292,-0.046357527999999995,0.027079678,-0.021426068,-0.034647587,-0.005914231999999999,0.02270973,-0.021610597999999998,-0.032972432,-0.034953417,-0.002950366,0.036952759,0.004744362,-0.016274741000000002,-0.037417995,-0.039979354,-0.011232223000000001,-0.050384715999999996,-0.013895712,-0.01599395,-0.06530373099999999,-0.058701667,0.040507464,0.07652047299999999,-0.015755461999999998
1642,Mutation of Host Δ9 Fatty Acid Desaturase Inhibits Brome Mosaic Virus RNA Replication between Template Recognition and RNA Synthesis,"All positive-strand RNA viruses assemble their RNA replication complexes on intracellular membranes. Brome mosaic virus (BMV) replicates its RNA in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated complexes in plant cells and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. BMV encodes RNA replication factors 1a, with domains implicated in RNA capping and helicase functions, and 2a, with a central polymerase-like domain. Factor 1a interacts independently with the ER membrane, viral RNA templates, and factor 2a to form RNA replication complexes on the perinuclear ER. We show that BMV RNA replication is severely inhibited by a mutation in OLE1, an essential yeast chromosomal gene encoding Δ9 fatty acid desaturase, an integral ER membrane protein and the first enzyme in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. OLE1 deletion and medium supplementation show that BMV RNA replication requires unsaturated fatty acids, not the Ole1 protein, and that viral RNA replication is much more sensitive than yeast growth to reduced unsaturated fatty acid levels. In ole1 mutant yeast, 1a still becomes membrane associated, recruits 2a to the membrane, and recognizes and stabilizes viral RNA templates normally. However, RNA replication is blocked prior to initiation of negative-strand RNA synthesis. The results show that viral RNA synthesis is highly sensitive to lipid composition and suggest that proper membrane fluidity or plasticity is essential for an early step in RNA replication. The strong unsaturated fatty acid dependence also demonstrates that modulating fatty acid balance can be an effective antiviral strategy.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.24986571,-0.070092025,-0.090103929,0.130000631,-0.088374001,-0.105677923,-0.001930499,0.041573104,-0.034174284,0.01485245,0.077211743,0.000808824,-0.046827622,0.09441150599999999,0.000939342,0.030323213999999998,0.01787762,-0.05303833,0.021441197000000002,0.036490471000000003,-0.08964289199999999,0.042041208,-0.057555909,-0.120340895,0.005706045,-0.05916963,-0.079265973,0.000939576,-0.066537122,0.021876026
1643,Efficacy of a transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus with an altered ORF-3 gene.,Serial passage of virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus through cell culture reduced its virulence in 3-day-old piglets. Intramuscular inoculation of pregnant gilts with 2 doses of this modified-live virus elicited a level of lactogenic immunity that protected their nursing piglets against a lethal dose of challenge virus. Sequence analysis of a 637-bp fragment of the spike gene containing most of the aminopeptidase receptor and the 4 major antigenic sites from the original and the serially passed viruses were nearly identical. Gel analysis revealed that the fragment from the ORF-3 gene of virulent virus was smaller than the corresponding fragment from the serially passed virus. Sequence analysis of the fragment from the passed virus revealed that the sequence between nt 5310 and nt 5434 was replaced by a 636-bp fragment from the polymerase 1A gene. This replacement resulted in the loss of the CTAAACTT leader RNA-binding site and ATG start codon for the ORF-3A gene but it did not affect the ORF-3B gene.,0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.130524533,-0.049651594,0.017404643,-0.05362997,0.107440597,0.003622222,-0.123797603,-0.012612672,0.030835827000000003,-0.019775308000000002,-0.06645566900000001,-0.045506609,0.002608942,-0.060324722000000004,0.019314633,-0.051488467,0.00602936,0.009313248,0.010777771,0.008371488,0.036973982,-0.024835755,0.01600884,0.054876999999999995,-0.036226371,-0.013129825,0.029008349,-0.049038970999999994,0.000648839,-0.008920083
1644,"DNA-Directed Expression of Functional Flock House Virus RNA1 Derivatives in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Heterologous Gene Expression, and Selective Effects on Subgenomic mRNA Synthesis","Flock house virus (FHV), a positive-strand RNA animal virus, is the only higher eukaryotic virus shown to undergo complete replication in yeast, culminating in production of infectious virions. To facilitate studies of viral and host functions in FHV replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, yeast DNA plasmids were constructed to inducibly express wild-type FHV RNA1 in vivo. Subsequent translation of FHV replicase protein A initiated robust RNA1 replication, amplifying RNA1 to levels approaching those of rRNA, as in FHV-infected animal cells. The RNA1-derived subgenomic mRNA, RNA3, accumulated to even higher levels of >100,000 copies per yeast cell, compared to 10 copies or less per cell for 95% of yeast mRNAs. The time course of RNA1 replication and RNA3 synthesis in induced yeast paralleled that in yeast transfected with natural FHV virion RNA. As in animal cells, RNA1 replication and RNA3 synthesis depended on FHV RNA replicase protein A and 3′-terminal RNA1 sequences but not viral protein B2. Additional plasmids were engineered to inducibly express RNA1 derivatives with insertions of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene in subgenomic RNA3. These RNA1 derivatives were replicated, synthesized RNA3, and expressed GFP when provided FHV polymerase in either cis or trans, providing the first demonstration of reporter gene expression from FHV subgenomic RNA. Unexpectedly, fusing GFP to the protein A C terminus selectively inhibited production of positive- and negative-strand subgenomic RNA3 but not genomic RNA1 replication. Moreover, changing the first nucleotide of the subgenomic mRNA from G to T selectively inhibited production of positive-strand but not negative-strand RNA3, suggesting that synthesis of negative-strand subgenomic RNA3 may precede synthesis of positive-strand RNA3.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.138851187,-0.053108497000000005,-0.021895576,-0.011720409,-0.054074902,-0.036171277,-0.027483886000000003,0.009339701,0.001874875,-0.043935335,0.017580998,-0.024982817,-0.020949473,0.056163794,0.003773102,0.037054692,0.001351027,-0.039911437,0.019861168000000002,0.0073261640000000005,-0.031249172999999998,0.032687586,-0.017066124,-0.064911973,-0.003379768,-0.031099086,-0.054600505,0.0027115840000000004,0.013176578000000001,0.01168202
1645,Alphavirus RNA Genome Repair and Evolution: Molecular Characterization of Infectious Sindbis Virus Isolates Lacking a Known Conserved Motif at the 3′ End of the Genome,"The 3′ nontranslated region of the genomes of Sindbis virus (SIN) and other alphaviruses carries several repeat sequence elements (RSEs) as well as a 19-nucleotide (nt) conserved sequence element (3′CSE). The 3′CSE and the adjoining poly(A) tail of the SIN genome are thought to act as viral promoters for negative-sense RNA synthesis and genome replication. Eight different SIN isolates that carry altered 3′CSEs were studied in detail to evaluate the role of the 3′CSE in genome replication. The salient findings of this study as it applies to SIN infection of BHK cells are as follows: i) the classical 19-nt 3′CSE of the SIN genome is not essential for genome replication, long-term stability, or packaging; ii) compensatory amino acid or nucleotide changes within the SIN genomes are not required to counteract base changes in the 3′ terminal motifs of the SIN genome; iii) the 5′ 1-kb regions of all SIN genomes, regardless of the differences in 3′ terminal motifs, do not undergo any base changes even after 18 passages; iv) although extensive addition of AU-rich motifs occurs in the SIN genomes carrying defective 3′CSE, these are not essential for genome viability or function; and v) the newly added AU-rich motifs are composed predominantly of RSEs. These findings are consistent with the idea that the 3′ terminal AU-rich motifs of the SIN genomes do not bind directly to the viral polymerase and that cellular proteins with broad AU-rich binding specificity may mediate this interaction. In addition to the classical 3′CSE, other RNA motifs located elsewhere in the SIN genome must play a major role in template selection by the SIN RNA polymerase.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.144322168,-0.049542876,-0.033016009,-0.003447833,0.010341899,-0.045907087,-0.034439497,0.025125717000000002,-0.024829277,-0.015012066999999999,0.006156459,0.012286658999999998,-0.004185495,-0.042162935,0.017979158000000002,0.023046819,-0.000141686,0.004020851,-0.042642509,-0.007525749,0.0028770040000000003,0.0055384219999999994,-0.044884811,-0.010205385,-0.039268800000000006,-0.036096134,-0.003189726,0.02159134,0.015962969,-0.014760399999999998
1646,"Helicase and Capping Enzyme Active Site Mutations in Brome Mosaic Virus Protein 1a Cause Defects in Template Recruitment, Negative-Strand RNA Synthesis, and Viral RNA Capping","Brome mosaic virus (BMV) encodes two RNA replication proteins: 1a, which contains RNA capping and helicase-like domains, and 2a, which is related to polymerases. BMV 1a and 2a can direct virus-specific RNA replication in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which reproduces the known features of BMV replication in plant cells. We constructed single amino acid point mutations at the predicted capping and helicase active sites of 1a and analyzed their effects on BMV RNA3 replication in yeast. The helicase mutants showed no function in any assays used: they were strongly defective in template recruitment for RNA replication, as measured by 1a-induced stabilization of RNA3, and they synthesized no detectable negative-strand or subgenomic RNA. Capping domain mutants divided into two groups. The first exhibited increased template recruitment but nevertheless allowed only low levels of negative-strand and subgenomic mRNA synthesis. The second was strongly defective in template recruitment, made very low levels of negative strands, and made no detectable subgenomes. To distinguish between RNA synthesis and capping defects, we deleted chromosomal gene XRN1, encoding the major exonuclease that degrades uncapped mRNAs. XRN1 deletion suppressed the second but not the first group of capping mutants, allowing synthesis and accumulation of large amounts of uncapped subgenomic mRNAs, thus providing direct evidence for the importance of the viral RNA capping function. The helicase and capping enzyme mutants showed no complementation. Instead, at high levels of expression, a helicase mutant dominantly interfered with the function of the wild-type protein.

1647,Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 regulates RNA synthesis of a cytoplasmic virus,"Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP A1) is involved in pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus and translational regulation in the cytoplasm. In the present study, we demonstrate that hnRNP A1 also participates in the transcription and replication of a cytoplasmic RNA virus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Overexpression of hnRNP A1 accelerated the kinetics of viral RNA synthesis, whereas the expression in the cytoplasm of a dominant-negative hnRNP A1 mutant that lacks the nuclear transport domain significantly delayed it. The hnRNP A1 mutant caused a global inhibition of viral mRNA transcription and genomic replication, and also a preferential inhibition of the replication of defective-interfering RNAs. Similar to the wild-type hnRNP A1, the hnRNP A1 mutant complexed with an MHV polymerase gene product, the nucleocapsid protein and the viral RNA. However, in contrast to the wild-type hnRNP A1, the mutant protein failed to bind a 250 kDa cellular protein, suggesting that the recruitment of cellular proteins by hnRNP A1 is important for MHV RNA synthesis.

1648,Avian Nephritis Virus (ANV) as a New Member of the Family Astroviridae and Construction of Infectious ANV cDNA,"The complete RNA genome of the avian nephritis virus (ANV) associated with acute nephritis in chickens has been molecularly cloned and sequenced. Excluding the poly(A) tail, the genome comprises 6,927 nucleotides and contains three sequential open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF (ORF 1a) contains a sequence encoding a serine protease motif, and the second ORF (ORF 1b) has a sequence encoding an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. ORF 1a may be linked to the second ORF by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. The third ORF (ORF 2) may encode the virion structural proteins as a polyprotein precursor. Two RNAs, probably genonic and subgenonic RNA (7.5 and 3.0 kb), were detected in the cytoplasm of ANV-infected cells. ANV and human astroviruses have the same genonic organization, and both are characterized by the presence of two RNA bands. The amino acid homologies of the products of ORF 1a, 1b, and 2 were 20.3, 41.9, and 25.8% to products of the corresponding ORFs of human astrovirus serotype 1 (A/88 Newcastle strain). We have constructed a genonic-length cDNA clone of ANV to test whether the in vitro transcript is infectious. When a chicken kidney cell culture was transfected with RNA transcribed in vitro and the cDNA clone, infectious virus was produced with cytopathic effects in the absence of trypsin. These observations suggested that the ANV (G-4260 strain) is a new genus of the family Astroviridae.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.211293969,-0.064662398,-0.033513193,0.01129357,0.119541644,-0.090876296,-0.17609552,0.018976846000000002,0.020586026,-0.011210597,-0.080263702,-0.049675508,0.065237396,-0.09239424199999999,-0.015412002,-0.080378913,0.047140897,0.034969079,0.058344357,0.032087484,-0.033600572,-0.012643669,-0.043403138,-0.013177201000000001,-0.080385684,0.005162499,0.026541776,-0.047553585,-0.073965983,-0.040055344
1649,Identification of Mouse Hepatitis Virus Papain-Like Proteinase 2 Activity,"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a 31-kb positive-strand RNA virus that is replicated in the cytoplasm of infected cells by a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, termed the replicase. The replicase is encoded in the 5′-most 22 kb of the genomic RNA, which is translated to produce a polyprotein of >800 kDa. The replicase polyprotein is extensively processed by viral and perhaps cellular proteinases to give rise to a functional replicase complex. To date, two of the MHV replicase-encoded proteinases, papain-like proteinase 1 (PLP1) and the poliovirus 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro), have been shown to process the replicase polyprotein. In this report, we describe the cloning, expression, and activity of the third MHV proteinase domain, PLP2. We show that PLP2 cleaves a substrate encoding the first predicted membrane-spanning domain (MP1) of the replicase polyprotein. Cleavage of MP1 and release of a 150-kDa intermediate, p150, are likely to be important for embedding the replicase complex in cellular membranes. Using an antiserum (anti-D11) directed against the C terminus of the MP1 domain, we verified that p150 encompasses the MP1 domain and identified a 44-kDa protein (p44) as a processed product of p150. Pulse-chase experiments showed that p150 is rapidly generated in MHV-infected cells and that p44 is processed from the p150 precursor. Protease inhibitor studies revealed that unlike 3CLpro activity, PLP2 activity is not sensitive to cysteine protease inhibitor E64d. Furthermore, coexpression studies using the PLP2 domain and a substrate encoding the MP1 cleavage site showed that PLP2 acts efficiently in trans. Site-directed mutagenesis studies confirmed the identification of cysteine 1715 as a catalytic residue of PLP2. This study is the first to report enzymatic activity of the PLP2 domain and to demonstrate that three distinct viral proteinase activities process the MHV replicase polyprotein.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.18434468699999998,-0.054987151,-0.061424047999999995,0.021461998,-0.035382305,-0.051286958,-0.052999844000000004,-0.008749126999999999,0.019197333,-0.049058300000000006,-0.035906739,0.018683621,0.006109113,-0.004983668,-0.023802164,-0.020762719,0.063278579,-0.010124286,0.032630689,0.018505011000000002,-0.036533047,0.010387384,0.01543416,-0.071918977,0.13345872,0.144020288,-0.035312908,-0.000302917,-0.065066732,-0.038944763
1650,Primary Structure of the Sialodacryoadenitis Virus Genome: Sequence of the Structural-Protein Region and Its Application for Differential Diagnosis,"Sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) is a coronavirus that is commonly found in laboratory rats and that causes sialodacryoadenitis and respiratory illness. We cloned and sequenced the 3′ terminal 9.8 kb of the genomic RNA and analyzed the structure of the viral genome. As with mouse hepatitis coronaviruses (MHVs), the SDAV genome was able to code for a spike protein, a small membrane protein, a membrane-associated protein, and a nucleocapsid protein. In addition, the hemagglutinin-esterase gene capable of encoding a protein of 439 amino acids (aa) was identified. The putative functional site for acetylesterase activity was present in the HE protein as Phe-Gly-Asp-Ser (FGDS), suggesting that the SDAV HE protein might have retained the esterase activity. Immediately upstream of the HE gene and downstream of the polymerase 1b gene, the NS2 nonstructural-protein gene was identified with a coding capacity of 274 aa. A motif of UCUAAAC was identified as a potential transcription signal for subgenomic mRNA synthesis. Large insertions of 172, 127, and 44 aa were detected in the N-terminal half of the predicted S protein of SDAV when its sequence was compared to the sequences of MHV 2, MHV JHM, and MHV A59, respectively. The sequence information on the SDAV S-protein gene was applied to a differential diagnostic PCR to detect and distinguish the rat coronavirus from mouse coronaviruses. This is the first report on the comprehensive genetic information of any rat coronavirus.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.202324695,-0.040049856,-0.042127467,-0.005007491,0.092506225,-0.08395752199999999,-0.16707814699999998,-0.024362351,0.047599653,-0.074074152,-0.147771425,-0.062690516,0.09282588,-0.065396811,-0.049127374,-0.11813346699999999,0.078644477,-0.004676065,0.020658499,0.026249935,0.00439057,0.001403559,0.039705522,0.014503532,0.12244627599999999,0.145038097,0.039812801,-0.078636133,-0.038903975,0.04485878
1651,Identification of a cis-Acting Replication Element within the Poliovirus Coding Region,"The replication of poliovirus, a positive-stranded RNA virus, requires translation of the infecting genome followed by virus-encoded VPg and 3D polymerase-primed synthesis of a negative-stranded template. RNA sequences involved in the latter process are poorly defined. Since many sequences involved in picornavirus replication form RNA structures, we searched the genome, other than the untranslated regions, for predicted local secondary structural elements and identified a 61-nucleotide (nt) stem-loop in the region encoding the 2C protein. Covariance analysis suggested the structure was well conserved in the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae. Site-directed mutagenesis, disrupting the structure without affecting the 2C product, destroyed genome viability and suggested that the structure was required in the positive sense for function. Recovery of revertant viruses suggested that integrity of the structure was critical for function, and analysis of replication demonstrated that nonviable mutants did not synthesize negative strands. Our conclusion, that this RNA secondary structure constitutes a novel poliovirus cis-acting replication element (CRE), is supported by the demonstration that subgenomic replicons bearing lethal mutations in the native structure can be restored to replication competence by the addition of a second copy of the 61-nt wild-type sequence at another location within the genome. This poliovirus CRE functionally resembles an element identified in rhinovirus type 14 (K. L. McKnight and S. M. Lemon, RNA 4:1569–1584, 1998) and the cardioviruses (P. E. Lobert, N. Escriou, J. Ruelle, and T. Michiels, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96:11560–11565, 1999) but differs in sequence, structure, and location.

1652,A conserved hairpin structure in Alfamovirus and Bromovirus subgenomic promoters is required for efficient RNA synthesis in vitro.,"The coat protein gene in RNA 3 of alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV; genus Alfamovirus, family Bromoviridae) is translated from the subgenomic RNA 4. Analysis of the subgenomic promoter (sgp) in minus-strand RNA 3 showed that a sequence of 37 nt upstream of the RNA 4 start site (nt +1) was sufficient for full sgp activity in an in vitro assay with the purified viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp). The sequence of nt -6 to -29 could be folded into a potential hairpin structure with a loop represented by nt -16, -17, and -18, and a bulge involving nt -23. By introducing mutations that disrupted base pairing and compensatory mutations that restored base pairing, it was shown that base pairing in the top half of the putative stem (between the loop and bulge) was essential for sgp activity, whereas base pairing in the bottom half of the stem was less stringently required. Deletion of the bulged residue A-23 or mutation of this residue into a C strongly reduced sgp activity, but mutation of A-23 into U or G had little effect on sgp activity. Mutation of loop residues A-16 and A-17 affected sgp activity, whereas mutation of U-18 did not. Using RNA templates corresponding to the sgp of brome mosaic virus (BMV; genus Bromovirus, family Bromoviridae) and purified BMV RdRp, evidence was obtained indicating that also in BMV RNA a triloop hairpin structure is required for sgp activity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.215315633,-0.063183458,-0.06200169999999999,0.090030452,0.008314079,-0.100469751,-0.037263627,0.049143032,-0.065542732,-0.03618046,0.045092062,0.06647663200000001,-0.06736978099999999,-0.032746912,-0.041536152,-0.0017848970000000001,0.030351354,0.004351827,-0.002204915,-0.056272922999999996,0.013531582,-0.033133783,-0.014219737,-0.00132169,-0.046463895,-0.051116718,-0.042980103,0.051490419,0.075858198,-0.019290543
1653,cis- and trans-Acting Elements in Flavivirus RNA Replication,"Most of the seven flavivirus nonstructural proteins (NS1 to NS5) encoded in the distal two-thirds of the RNA positive-sense genome are believed to be essential components of RNA replication complexes. To explore the functional relationships of these components in RNA replication, we used trans-complementation analysis of full-length infectious RNAs of Kunjin (KUN) virus with a range of lethal in-frame deletions in the nonstructural coding region, using as helper a repBHK cell line stably producing functional replication complexes from KUN replicon RNA. Recently we showed that replication of KUN RNAs with large carboxy-terminal deletions including the entire RNA polymerase region in the NS5 gene, representing 34 to 75% of the NS5 coding content, could be complemented after transfection into repBHK cells. In this study we have demonstrated that KUN RNAs with deletions of 84 to 97% of the NS1 gene, or of 13 to 63% of the NS3 gene including the entire helicase region, were also complemented in repBHK cells with variable efficiencies. In contrast, KUN RNAs with deletions in any of the other four nonstructural genes NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, and NS4B were not complemented. We have also demonstrated successful trans complementation of KUN RNAs containing either combined double deletions in the NS1 and NS5 genes or triple deletions in the NS1, NS3, and NS5 genes comprising as much as 38% of the entire nonstructural coding content. Based on these and our previous complementation results, we have generated a map of cis- and trans-acting elements in RNA replication for the nonstructural coding region of the flavivirus genome. These results are discussed in the context of our model on formation and composition of the flavivirus replication complex, and we suggest molecular mechanisms by which functions of some defective components of the replication complex can be complemented by their wild-type counterparts expressed from another (helper) RNA molecule.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.212064736,-0.064190476,-0.04743454,0.045529865999999995,-0.018096738,-0.056380898,-0.044835982999999996,0.021470141,-0.004328563,-0.012056128000000001,0.019231711000000002,-0.012368258,-0.013460794,0.044086642,0.01869876,0.030952667000000003,-0.026648305,-0.006390013000000001,0.007932816,0.002121369,-0.003628508,0.021013061,-0.005383535,-0.042280640999999994,-0.001707208,0.011795651,0.008788606,0.00489181,-0.027319915,0.014981426
1654,"Translation from the 5′ Untranslated Region (UTR) of mRNA 1 Is Repressed, but That from the 5′ UTR of mRNA 7 Is Stimulated in Coronavirus-Infected Cells","Viral gene products are generally required in widely differing amounts for successful virus growth and assembly. For coronaviruses, regulation of transcription is a major contributor to these differences, but regulation of translation may also be important. Here, we examine the possibility that the 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs), unique for each of the nine species of mRNA in the bovine coronavirus and ranging in length from 70 nucleotides (nt) to 210 nt (inclusive of the common 5′-terminal 65-nt leader), can differentially affect the rate of protein accumulation. When the natural 77-nt 5′ UTR on synthetic transcripts of mRNA 7 (mRNA for N and I proteins) was replaced with the 210-nt 5′ UTR from mRNA 1 (genomic RNA, mRNA for viral polymerase), approximately twofold-less N, or (N) CAT fusion reporter protein, was made in vitro. Twofold less was also made in vivo in uninfected cells when a T7 RNA polymerase-driven transient-transfection system was used. In coronavirus-infected cells, this difference surprisingly became 12-fold as the result of both a stimulated translation from the 77-nt 5′ UTR and a repression of translation from the 210-nt 5′ UTR. These results reveal that a differential 5′ UTR-directed regulation of translation can occur in coronavirus-infected cells and lead us to postulate that the direction and degree of regulation is carried out by viral or virally induced cellular factors acting in trans on cis-acting elements within the 5′ UTR.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.165634717,-0.061762819000000004,-0.041688828,-0.035132295,-0.002469833,-0.055510171,-0.081450103,-0.003669973,0.022247534,-0.067473126,-0.055391235,-0.090600105,0.040700468999999996,0.03981513,-0.008101753,0.021278681,-0.001525463,-0.021464742000000002,-0.015201915,-0.005949096,-0.003315498,0.030119162999999997,-0.03619075,0.007249394,-0.000377445,-0.09126758900000001,-0.029342017,0.009803755,0.12666381599999998,0.027871575
1655,A Recombinant Hepatitis C Virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Capable of Copying the Full-Length Viral RNA,"All of the previously reported recombinant RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp), the NS5B enzymes, of hepatitis C virus (HCV) could function only in a primer-dependent and template-nonspecific manner, which is different from the expected properties of the functional viral enzymes in the cells. We have now expressed a recombinant NS5B that is able to synthesize a full-length HCV genome in a template-dependent and primer-independent manner. The kinetics of RNA synthesis showed that this RdRp can initiate RNA synthesis de novo and yield a full-length RNA product of genomic size (9.5 kb), indicating that it did not use the copy-back RNA as a primer. This RdRp was also able to accept heterologous viral RNA templates, including poly(A)- and non-poly(A)-tailed RNA, in a primer-independent manner, but the products in these cases were heterogeneous. The RdRp used some homopolymeric RNA templates only in the presence of a primer. By using the 3′-end 98 nucleotides (nt) of HCV RNA, which is conserved in all genotypes of HCV, as a template, a distinct RNA product was generated. Truncation of 21 nt from the 5′ end or 45 nt from the 3′ end of the 98-nt RNA abolished almost completely its ability to serve as a template. Inclusion of the 3′-end variable sequence region and the U-rich tract upstream of the X region in the template significantly enhanced RNA synthesis. The 3′ end of minus-strand RNA of HCV genome also served as a template, and it required a minimum of 239 nt from the 3′ end. These data defined the cis-acting sequences for HCV RNA synthesis at the 3′ end of HCV RNA in both the plus and minus senses. This is the first recombinant HCV RdRp capable of copying the full-length HCV RNA in the primer-independent manner expected of the functional HCV RNA polymerase.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.285949763,-0.065585546,-0.087241124,0.15243393800000002,-0.02014733,-0.165327367,-0.035351167999999995,0.062979882,-0.066021984,0.006887452,0.08634530300000001,0.11616400699999999,-0.023766918999999997,0.025484516000000002,-0.02996597,-0.004152421,0.019865638,0.207203345,0.259707583,-0.16082351,-0.065462146,-0.010210452,0.08385519400000001,-0.001966612,-0.091190219,-0.133682733,-0.098781516,0.11234135699999999,-0.011013681,0.018814261999999998
1656,Localization of Mouse Hepatitis Virus Nonstructural Proteins and RNA Synthesis Indicates a Role for Late Endosomes in Viral Replication,"The aim of the present study was to define the site of replication of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Antibodies directed against several proteins derived from the gene 1 polyprotein, including the 3C-like protease (3CLpro), the putative polymerase (POL), helicase, and a recently described protein (p22) derived from the C terminus of the open reading frame 1a protein (CT1a), were used to probe MHV-infected cells by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) and electron microscopy (EM). At early times of infection, all of these proteins showed a distinct punctate labeling by IF. Antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein also displayed a punctate labeling that largely colocalized with the replicase proteins. When infected cells were metabolically labeled with 5-bromouridine 5′-triphosphate (BrUTP), the site of viral RNA synthesis was shown by IF to colocalize with CT1a and the 3CLpro. As shown by EM, CT1a localized to LAMP-1 positive late endosomes/lysosomes while POL accumulated predominantly in multilayered structures with the appearance of endocytic carrier vesicles. These latter structures were also labeled to some extent with both anti-CT1a and LAMP-1 antibodies and could be filled with fluid phase endocytic tracers. When EM was used to determine sites of BrUTP incorporation into viral RNA at early times of infection, the viral RNA localized to late endosomal membranes as well. These results demonstrate that MHV replication occurs on late endosomal membranes and that several nonstructural proteins derived from the gene 1 polyprotein may participate in the formation and function of the viral replication complexes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.207464436,-0.051618072,-0.039624772999999995,0.03591974,-0.060054927,-0.073015953,-0.0674784,-0.017847711000000002,0.042135131,-0.049132197999999995,-0.054945715,-0.058874250999999996,0.025914445,0.07646539,-0.011131493000000001,-0.004593465,0.056029457000000005,2.24e-05,-0.015191369,0.058281212,-0.071438349,0.034826899,-0.053923435,0.012763877,0.16947049100000003,0.111539721,-0.040042207999999996,-0.009274974,-0.137206912,0.011142131999999999
1657,Specific Interaction between the Hepatitis C Virus NS5B RNA Polymerase and the 3′ End of the Viral RNA,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B protein is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase capable of directing RNA synthesis. In this study, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated the interaction between a partially purified recombinant NS5B protein and a 3′ viral genomic RNA with or without the conserved 98-nucleotide tail. The NS5B-RNA complexes were specifically competed away by the unlabeled homologous RNA but not by the viral 5′ noncoding region and very poorly by the 3′ conserved 98-nucleotide tail. A 3′ coding region with conserved stem-loop structures rather than the 3′ noncoding region of the HCV genome is critical for the specific binding of NS5B. Nevertheless, no direct interaction between the 3′ coding region and the HCV NS5A protein was detected. Furthermore, two independent RNA-binding domains (RBDs) of NS5B were identified, RBD1, from amino acid residues 83 to 194, and RBD2, from residues 196 to 298. Interestingly, the conserved motifs of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for putative RNA binding (220-DxxxxD-225) and template/primer position (282-S/TGxxxTxxxNS/T-292) are present in the RBD2. Nevertheless, the RNA-binding activity of RBD2 was abolished when it was linked to the carboxy-terminal half of the NS5B. These results provide some clues to understanding the initiation of HCV replication.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.26776588,-0.06984317400000001,-0.069582323,0.119504641,-0.031541861000000004,-0.119793184,-0.025044512999999997,0.033482474,-0.028315527000000004,0.000336518,0.036469602999999996,0.09391076699999999,-0.015080847,0.0058304609999999995,-0.073201607,-0.075372039,0.079306421,0.162214448,0.22408920100000002,-0.09846227800000001,-0.08426658599999999,0.001828706,0.061070770999999996,0.01316707,-0.043158933,-0.0596159,-0.067562069,0.062402636,-0.040661317,0.0071608190000000006
1658,Colocalization and Membrane Association of Murine Hepatitis Virus Gene 1 Products and De Novo-Synthesized Viral RNA in Infected Cells,"Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) gene 1, the 22-kb polymerase (pol) gene, is first translated into a polyprotein and subsequently processed into multiple proteins by viral autoproteases. Genetic complementation analyses suggest that the majority of the gene 1 products are required for viral RNA synthesis. However, there is no physical evidence supporting the association of any of these products with viral RNA synthesis. We have now performed immunofluorescent-staining studies with four polyclonal antisera to localize various MHV-A59 gene 1 products in virus-infected cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that these antisera detected proteins representing the two papain-like proteases and the 3C-like protease encoded by open reading frame (ORF) 1a, the putative polymerase (p100) and a p35 encoded by ORF 1b, and their precursors. De novo-synthesized viral RNA was labeled with bromouridine triphosphate in lysolecithin-permeabilized MHV-infected cells. Confocal microscopy revealed that all of the viral proteins detected by these antisera colocalized with newly synthesized viral RNA in the cytoplasm, particularly in the perinuclear region of infected cells. Several cysteine and serine protease inhibitors, i.e., E64d, leupeptin, and zinc chloride, inhibited viral RNA synthesis without affecting the localization of viral proteins, suggesting that the processing of the MHV gene 1 polyprotein is tightly associated with viral RNA synthesis. Dual labeling with antibodies specific for cytoplasmic membrane structures showed that MHV gene 1 products and RNA colocalized with the Golgi apparatus in HeLa cells. However, in murine 17CL-1 cells, the viral proteins and viral RNA did not colocalize with the Golgi apparatus but, instead, partially colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum. Our results provide clear physical evidence that several MHV gene 1 products, including the proteases and the polymerase, are associated with the viral RNA replication-transcription machinery, which may localize to different membrane structures in different cell lines.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.251738996,-0.085974245,-0.078324897,0.073960727,-0.007898188,-0.10898632400000001,-0.10337289699999999,-0.001249584,0.02750463,-0.016731582,-0.055363212,-0.124362846,0.052557817,0.087534499,0.011578845,-0.005349483,0.004910595,-0.003130758,0.041146432000000004,0.066019148,-0.062024481,0.060799372000000004,-0.031412723999999996,-0.0038586009999999997,0.080270092,0.069971715,0.013506038,-0.050956004000000006,-0.109749043,0.045848819000000006
1659,The Versatility of Paramyxovirus RNA Polymerase Stuttering,"Paramyxoviruses cotranscriptionally edit their P gene mRNAs by expanding the number of Gs of a conserved A(n)G(n) run. Different viruses insert different distributions of guanylates, e.g., Sendai virus inserts a single G, whereas parainfluenza virus type 3 inserts one to six Gs. The sequences conserved at the editing site, as well as the experimental evidence, suggest that the insertions occur by a stuttering process, i.e., by pseudotemplated transcription. The number of times the polymerase “stutters” at the editing site before continuing strictly templated elongation is directed by a cis-acting sequence found upstream of the insertions. We have examined the stuttering process during natural virus infections by constructing recombinant Sendai viruses with mutations in their cis-acting sequences. We found that the template stutter site is precisely determined (C(1052)) and that a relatively short region (∼6 nucleotides) just upstream of the A(n)G(n) run can modulate the overall frequency of mRNA editing as well as the distribution of the nucleotide insertions. The positions more proximal to the 5′ A(n)G(n) run are the most important in this respect. We also provide evidence that the stability of the mRNA/template hybrid plays a determining role in the overall frequency and range of mRNA editing. When the template U run is extended all the way to the stutter site, adenylates rather than guanylates are added at the editing site and their distribution begins to resemble the polyadenylation associated with mRNA 3′ end formation by the viral polymerase. Our data suggest how paramyxovirus mRNA editing and polyadenylation are related mechanistically and how editing sites may have evolved from poly(A)-termination sites or vice versa.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.099303695,-0.05495350400000001,-0.011311898,-0.029875592000000003,0.019897283,-0.00882601,-0.016390815,0.0053533999999999995,-0.000293556,-0.035040845,-0.03078399,-0.011916556000000002,0.01278229,-0.042089571,-0.003978807,0.013381248,-0.011156428999999999,-0.018836733,-0.033831594,-0.031297434,0.019032846000000003,-0.008831238,-0.015923936,0.05164771,-0.00555752,-0.061830405,-0.031844969,0.02290453,0.087660544,-0.032604851000000004
1660,Expression of Murine Coronavirus Recombinant Papain-Like Proteinase: Efficient Cleavage Is Dependent on the Lengths of both the Substrate and the Proteinase Polypeptides,"Proteolytic processing of the replicase gene product of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is essential for viral replication. In MHV strain A59 (MHV-A59), the replicase gene encodes two predicted papain-like proteinase (PLP) domains, PLP-1 and PLP-2. Previous work using viral polypeptide substrates synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation from the replicase gene demonstrated both cis and trans cleavage activities for PLP-1. We have cloned and overexpressed the PLP-1 domain in Escherichia coli by using a T7 RNA polymerase promoter system or as a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion protein. With both overexpression systems, the recombinant PLP-1 exhibited trans cleavage activity when incubated with in vitro-synthesized viral polypeptide substrates. Subsequent characterization of the recombinant PLP-1 revealed that in vitro trans cleavage is more efficient at 22°C than at higher temperatures. Using substrates of increasing lengths, we observed efficient cleavage by PLP-1 requires a substrate greater than 69 kDa. In addition, when PLP-1 was expressed as a polypeptide that included additional viral sequences at the carboxyl terminus of the predicted PLP-1 domain, a fivefold increase in proteolytic activity was observed. The data presented here support previous data suggesting that in vitro and in vivo cleavage of the ORF 1a polyprotein by PLP-1 can occur in both in cis and in trans. In contrast to the cleavage activity demonstrated for PLP-1, no in vitro cleavage in cis or in trans could be detected with PLP-2 expressed either as a polypeptide, including flanking viral sequences, or as an MBP fusion enzyme.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.126390927,-0.051312245,-0.021554467999999997,-0.037579642999999996,-0.016658974,-0.023180596,-0.05217196,-0.009406007,0.02903291,-0.048958932000000004,-0.057550187,-0.002336776,0.00827338,-0.028283036,-0.021488925,-0.017820664,0.037610286,-0.002138617,0.026373318,-0.012171528000000001,-0.015659656,-0.00116944,0.009564221,-0.018510093999999998,0.069541478,0.080048623,-0.026447977999999997,-0.013001416000000002,-0.02611061,-0.017179327
1661,Molecular Characterization of a Bovine Enteric Calicivirus: Relationship to the Norwalk-Like Viruses,"Jena virus (JV) is a noncultivatable bovine enteric calicivirus associated with diarrhea in calves and was first described in Jena, Germany. The virus was serially passaged 11 times in colostrum-deprived newborn calves and caused diarrheal disease symptoms at each passage. The complete JV genome sequence was determined by using cDNA made from partially purified virus obtained from a single stool sample. JV has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome which is 7,338 nucleotides in length, excluding the poly(A) tail. JV genome organization is similar to that of the human Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs), with three separate open reading frames (ORFs) and a 24-nucleotide sequence motif located at the 5′ terminus of the genome and at the start of ORF 2. The polyprotein (ORF 1) consists of 1,680 amino acids and has the characteristic 2C helicase, 3C protease, and 3D RNA polymerase motifs also found in the NLVs. However, comparison of the N-terminal 100 amino acids of the JV polyprotein with those of the group 1 and group 2 NLVs showed a considerable divergence in sequence. The capsid protein (ORF 2) at 519 amino acids is smaller than that of all other caliciviruses. JV ORF 2 was translated in vitro to produce a 55-kDa protein that reacted with postinfection serum but not preinfection serum. Phylogenetic studies based on partial RNA polymerase sequences indicate that within the Caliciviridae JV is most closely related to the group 1 NLVs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.164215945,-0.04889214099999999,-0.018959188000000002,-0.030185912000000002,0.142900224,-0.07348635099999999,-0.12342114800000001,0.010768376000000001,-0.012483962,-0.047559780999999995,-0.073911883,-0.00107987,0.025658389,-0.131232612,-0.013876783,-0.14222198,0.064065398,0.020970115,0.043201033,0.023754331,-0.022299595,-0.027912699,-0.071165718,0.016403828999999998,-0.045948802000000004,0.020066105,0.038008784,-0.10083602900000001,-0.06820992099999999,-0.033056187
1662,Two Nucleotides Immediately Upstream of the Essential A(6)G(3) Slippery Sequence Modulate the Pattern of G Insertions during Sendai Virus mRNA Editing,"Editing of paramyxovirus P gene mRNAs occurs cotranscriptionally and functions to fuse an alternate downstream open reading frame to the N-terminal half of the P protein. G residues are inserted into a short G run contained within a larger purine run (A(n)G(n)) in this process, by a mechanism whereby the transcribing polymerase stutters (i.e., reads the same template cytosine more than once). Although Sendai virus (SeV) and bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (bPIV3) are closely related, the G insertions in their P mRNAs are distributed differently. SeV predominantly inserts a single G residue within the G run of the sequence 5′ AACAAAAAAGGG, whereas bPIV3 inserts one to six G’s at roughly equal frequency within the sequence 5′ AUUAAAAAAGGGG (differences are underlined). We have examined how the cis-acting editing sequence determines the number of G’s inserted, both in a transfected cell system using minigenome analogues and by generating recombinant viruses. We found that the presence of four rather than three G’s in the purine run did not affect the distribution of G insertions. However, when the underlined AC of the SeV sequence was replaced by the UU found in bPIV3, the editing phenotype from both the minigenome and the recombinant virus resembled that found in natural bPIV3 infections (i.e., a significant fraction of the mRNAs contained two to six G insertions). The two nucleotides located just upstream of the polypurine tract are thus key determinants of the editing phenotype of these viruses. Moreover, the minimum number of A residues that will promote SeV editing phenotype is six but can be reduced to five when the upstream AC is replaced by UU. A model for how the upstream dinucleotide controls the insertion phenotype is presented.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.095344947,-0.059923198,-0.011915126000000002,-0.034542458,0.034626615,-0.015907807,-0.041539606,0.003214051,0.015822288,-0.034653817,-0.05204607,-0.012236733,0.019163288,-0.062413570999999994,0.012317048999999998,-0.010730015,-0.001029047,-0.014608408,-0.014547606999999999,-0.020694191,0.032649014,-0.02151167,-0.008287982,0.050670427999999997,-0.005753876,-0.00228419,-0.005737142,-0.01484525,0.038728184,-0.034661553
1663,Antigenic Structure of the Nucleocapsid Protein of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus,"A collection of 12 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus was used to study the antigenic structure of the virus nucleocapsid protein (N). The full-length N gene, encoded by open reading frame 7, was cloned from the Canadian PRRS virus, PA-8. Deletions were introduced into the N gene to produce a series of nine overlapping protein fragments ranging in length from 25 to 112 amino acids. The individual truncated genes were cloned as glutathione S-transferase fusions into a eukaryotic expression vector downstream of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. HeLa cells infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding the N protein fragments, and the antigenicity of the synthesized proteins was analyzed by immunoprecipitation. Based on the immunoreactivities of the N protein deletion mutants with the panel of N-specific MAbs, five domains of antigenic importance were identified. MAbs SDOW17, SR30, and 5H2.3B12.1C9 each identified independent domains defined by amino acids 30 to 52, 69 to 123, and 37 to 52, respectively. Seven of the MAbs tested specifically recognized the local protein conformation formed in part by the amino acid residues 52 to 69. Furthermore, deletion of 11 amino acids from the carboxy terminus of the nucleocapsid protein disrupted the epitope configuration recognized by all of the conformation-dependent MAbs, suggesting that the carboxy-terminal region plays an important role in maintaining local protein conformation.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.157716814,-0.055943559000000004,-0.023220301000000002,-0.034010096000000004,0.029425531,-0.030821345,-0.097674485,-0.033597902,0.050928429000000004,-0.039847481000000004,-0.10352057099999999,-0.020765772,0.013801476000000002,-0.052689489000000006,-0.030932697000000002,-0.116953239,0.085022297,-0.045731956,0.016535971,0.029793648,-0.014328261,-0.018414265,0.047663076,-0.037116712999999996,0.052106385,0.10252817300000001,0.035968263,-0.040896142,-0.081730044,0.061435258
1664,Mutations in the N Terminus of the Brome Mosaic Virus Polymerase Affect Genetic RNA-RNA Recombination,"Previously, we have observed that mutations in proteins 1a and 2a, the two virally encoded components of the brome mosaic virus (BMV) replicase, can affect the frequency of recombination and the locations of RNA recombination sites (P. D. Nagy, A. Dzianott, P. Ahlquist, and J. J. Bujarski, J. Virol. 69:2547–2556, 1995; M. Figlerowicz, P. D. Nagy, and J. J. Bujarski, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:2073–2078, 1997). Also, it was found before that the N-terminal domain of 2a, the putative RNA polymerase protein, participates in the interactions between 1a and 2a (C. C. Kao, R. Quadt, R. P. Hershberger, and P. Ahlquist, J. Virol. 66:6322–6329, 1992; E. O’Reilly, J. Paul, and C. C. Kao, J. Virol. 71:7526–7532, 1997). In this work, we examine how mutations within the N terminus of 2a influence RNA recombination in BMV. Because of the likely electrostatic character of 1a-2a interactions, five 2a mutants, MF1 to MF5, were generated by replacing clusters of acidic amino acids with their neutral counterparts. MF2 and MF5 retained nearly wild-type levels of 1a-2a interaction and were infectious in Chenopodium quinoa. However, compared to that in wild-type virus, the frequency of nonhomologous recombination in both MF2 and MF5 was markedly decreased. Only in MF2 was the frequency of homologous recombination reduced and the occurrence of imprecise homologous recombination increased. In MF5 there was also a 3′ shift in the positions of homologous crossovers. The observed effects of MF2 and MF5 reveal that the 2a N-terminal domain participates in different ways in homologous and in nonhomologous BMV RNA recombination. This work maps specific locations within the N terminus involved in 1a-2a interaction and in recombination and further suggests that the mechanisms of the two types of crossovers in BMV are different.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14504320099999998,-0.058106026,-0.032535106,-0.006469152,0.013663656000000001,-0.036614102,-0.013820471,0.027717653999999998,-0.025127451000000002,-0.005066744000000001,0.04226219,0.044839032,-0.047855990999999994,-0.024355797999999998,0.001730965,0.038627661,-0.015974363000000002,-0.029104542,-0.008294886,-0.014826723,0.031525767999999996,-0.039773516,-0.009388376,-0.0071506,0.0070962840000000004,-0.018783712,-0.028796022,0.009331866999999999,-0.064071784,-0.044798684000000005
1665,ORF1a-Encoded Replicase Subunits Are Involved in the Membrane Association of the Arterivirus Replication Complex,"Among the functions of the replicase of equine arteritis virus (EAV; family Arteriviridae, order Nidovirales) are important viral enzyme activities such as proteases and the putative RNA polymerase and RNA helicase functions. The replicase is expressed in the form of two polyproteins (open reading frame 1a [ORF1a] and ORF1ab), which are processed into 12 nonstructural proteins by three viral proteases. In immunofluorescence assays, the majority of these cleavage products localized to the perinuclear region of the cell. A dense granular and vesicular staining was observed, which strongly suggested membrane association. By using confocal microscopy and double-label immunofluorescence, the distribution of the EAV replicase was shown to overlap with that of PDI, a resident protein of the endoplasmic reticulum and intermediate compartment. An in situ labeling of nascent viral RNA with bromo-UTP demonstrated that the membrane-bound complex in which the replicase subunits accumulate is indeed the site of viral RNA synthesis. A number of ORF1a-encoded hydrophobic domains were postulated to be involved in the membrane association of the arterivirus replication complex. By using various biochemical methods (Triton X-114 extraction, membrane purification, and sodium carbonate treatment), replicase subunits containing these domains were shown to behave as integral membrane proteins and to be membrane associated in infected cells. Thus, contribution to the formation of a membrane-bound scaffold for the viral replication-transcription complex appears to be an important novel function for the arterivirus ORF1a replicase polyprotein.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.196404047,-0.057301187,-0.077441779,0.05293946099999999,-0.05786067,-0.067409517,-0.011939986999999999,-1.39e-05,0.015679252,-0.009358497,-0.016525971,0.0020781379999999998,0.0059339069999999995,0.028985133,-0.047564005,-0.056842709000000005,0.11352114,-0.08192067900000001,0.012144537,0.054488114000000004,-0.099981559,0.050197856,-0.068545994,-0.12440833400000001,0.058708497000000005,0.032637405,-0.052647808,-0.011067353,-0.086035654,-0.010545728999999998
1666,Genes Required for Replication of the 15.5-Kilobase RNA Genome of a Plant Closterovirus,"A full-length cDNA clone of beet yellows closterovirus (BYV) was engineered and used to map functions involved in the replication of the viral RNA genome and subgenomic RNA formation. Among 10 open reading frames (ORFs) present in BYV, ORFs 1a and 1b suffice for RNA replication and transcription. The proteins encoded in these ORFs harbor putative methyltransferase, RNA helicase, and RNA polymerase domains common to Sindbis virus-like viruses and a large interdomain region that is unique to closteroviruses. The papain-like leader proteinase (L-Pro) encoded in the 5′-proximal region of ORF 1a was found to have a dual function in genome amplification. First, the autocatalytic cleavage between L-Pro and the remainder of the ORF 1a product was essential for replication of RNA. Second, an additional L-Pro function that was separable from proteolytic activity was required for efficient RNA accumulation. The deletion of a large, ∼5.6-kb, 3′-terminal region coding for a 6-kDa hydrophobic protein, an HSP70 homolog, a 64-kDa protein, minor and major capsid proteins, a 20-kDa protein, and a 21-kDa protein (p21) resulted in replication-competent RNA. However, examination of mutants with replacements of start codons in each of these seven 3′-terminal ORFs revealed that p21 functions as an enhancer of genome amplification. The intriguing analogies between the genome organization and replicational requirements of plant closteroviruses and animal coronavirus-like viruses are discussed.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.283260076,-0.07602453599999999,-0.083648398,0.111654725,0.038033489,-0.132319033,-0.118801771,0.034068962,-0.010353336999999999,-0.039236686,-0.06110387,-0.029026021000000003,0.047823614,-0.060227493,-0.048910902,-0.082278904,0.086211216,-0.016861968999999997,0.057243163,0.069937319,-0.073597686,0.009413595,-0.070085377,-0.072348603,-0.027005211,0.017463201,0.00036648800000000005,-0.028929327,-0.070980815,-0.041388505
1668,Brome mosaic virus RNA replication protein 1a dramatically increases in vivo stability but not translation of viral genomic RNA3,"Brome mosaic virus (BMV), a positive-strand RNA virus in the alphavirus-like superfamily, encodes two RNA replication proteins: 1a, which contains a helicase-like domain and a domain implicated in RNA capping, and 2a, which contains a polymerase-like domain. To further explore their functions, we expressed 1a and 2a individually and together in yeast also expressing replicatable transcripts of BMV genomic RNA3. Complementing prior results that 1a and 2a are required jointly for positive-strand RNA synthesis, both also were required for negative-strand RNA synthesis. Nevertheless, in the absence of 2a, 1a expression increased the accumulation of DNA-derived RNA3 transcripts 8-fold. Increased accumulation was specific for RNA3: none of a diverse set of yeast mRNAs tested showed increased accumulation in the presence of 1a. Increased RNA3 accumulation was not due to increased DNA transcription, but to a 20- to 40-fold increase in the in vivo half-life of RNA3 from 5–10 min in the absence of 1a to more than 3 hr in the presence of 1a. Although (1a+2a)-dependent RNA replication selectively amplified the natural viral 5′ end from among multiple transcription starts of DNA-derived RNA3 transcripts, 1a-induced stabilization affected all RNA3 transcripts, without specificity for the precise viral 5′ end. Increased RNA3 accumulation did not increase expression of a directly translatable, 5′-proximal gene in RNA3, implying that 1a-induced stabilization blocked rather than facilitated RNA3 translation. These and other results suggest that the striking, 1a-induced stabilization of RNA3 may reflect an interaction involved in recruiting viral RNA templates into RNA replication while diverting them from the competing processes of translation and degradation.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.1609024,-0.055944689000000006,-0.036572739,0.026864267,-0.052714227999999995,-0.068739772,-0.02064316,0.032351631,-0.014245036,-0.035605233,0.025187367000000002,-0.003224039,-0.045854716,0.058054725999999994,-0.009506721999999999,0.047653232000000004,0.011062763,-0.045558652000000005,0.01908389,-0.011890764,-0.052035842,0.015905208,-0.037543275,-0.083408574,-0.010254223,-0.085740383,-0.094288964,0.038348595,0.009534882,-0.026065402
1669,Mouse Hepatitis Virus 3C-Like Protease Cleaves a 22-Kilodalton Protein from the Open Reading Frame 1a Polyprotein in Virus-Infected Cells and In Vitro,"The 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is predicted to cleave at least 11 sites in the 803-kDa gene 1 polyprotein, resulting in maturation of proteinase, polymerase, and helicase proteins. However, most of these cleavage sites have not been experimentally confirmed and the proteins have not been identified in vitro or in virus-infected cells. We used specific antibodies to identify and characterize a 22-kDa protein (p1a-22) expressed from gene 1 in MHV A59-infected DBT cells. Processing of p1a-22 from the polyprotein began immediately after translation, but some processing continued for several hours. Amino-terminal sequencing of p1a-22 purified from MHV-infected cells showed that it was cleaved at a putative 3CLpro cleavage site, Gln_Ser(4014) (where the underscore indicates the site of cleavage), that is located between the 3CLpro domain and the end of open reading frame (ORF) 1a. Subclones of this region of gene 1 were used to express polypeptides in vitro that contained one or more 3CLpro cleavage sites, and cleavage of these substrates by recombinant 3CLpro in vitro confirmed that amino-terminal cleavage of p1a-22 occurred at Gln_Ser(4014). We demonstrated that the carboxy-terminal cleavage of the p1a-22 protein occurred at Gln_Asn(4208), a sequence that had not been predicted as a site for cleavage by MHV 3CLpro. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of recombinant MHV 3CLpro in identifying and confirming cleavage sites within the gene 1 polyprotein. Based on our results, we predict that at least seven mature proteins are processed from the ORF 1a polyprotein by 3CLpro and suggest that additional noncanonical cleavage sites may be used by 3CLpro during processing of the gene 1 polyprotein.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.15834963400000002,-0.05040023,-0.022399026000000002,-0.064355566,0.026642272999999998,-0.034980167,-0.13840791,-0.015200601999999999,0.050094951,-0.09061652199999999,-0.12820303800000002,-0.035024709,0.034517215,-0.061160402,-0.027990896,-0.048194706,0.055123264000000005,0.005759798000000001,0.037979293,0.007892099,-0.010758331000000001,-0.006984587,0.023132511,-0.019840454,0.11325711699999999,0.15919957199999998,-0.007100204000000001,-0.022834645,-0.081485091,-0.044331706
1671,Hygromycin B resistance mediates elimination of Leishmania virus from persistently infected parasites.,"A series of pX63-HYG derivatives encoding Leishmania RNA virus 1-4 (LRV1-4) sequences were electroporated into cells of Leishmania strain M4147, a virus-infected strain of L. guyanensis. After 6 weeks of drug selection (hygromycin B), transfected parasites lacked detectable quantities of viral genomic double-stranded RNA, viral capsid protein, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) activity. Evidence of viral infection was not recovered upon removal of the drug. While viral RNA transcripts were produced from electroporated expression vectors, as determined by reverse transcription-PCR, viral antigens were not detected, suggesting that the antiviral effects of hygromycin B are mediated through translation inhibition. A short-term selection study suggests that the LRV1-4 elimination may not only be a function of hygromycin B as a protein synthesis inhibitor but also possibly related to the mechanism of hygromycin B resistance in Leishmania strains.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.206426131,-0.059938405,-0.062569289,0.078436424,-0.045878262999999996,-0.040322167,0.002293257,-0.009680753,0.000691601,0.049659352999999996,0.063922045,-0.016422584,-0.006726564,0.078655888,0.011884269,-0.03940735,0.007254504,0.013820695,0.025867197,0.025378458,-0.01474362,0.060949854000000005,-0.034217876,0.027265897,0.025360897,-0.017295805,0.050593222,-0.024590893,-0.010633347,0.130843981
1673,Transcriptional strategy of closteroviruses: mapping the 5' termini of the citrus tristeza virus subgenomic RNAs.,"Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) induces formation of a nested set of at least nine 3' coterminal subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) in infected tissue. The organization and expression of the 19,296-nucleotide (nt) CTV genome resembles that of coronaviruses, with polyprotein processing, translational frameshifting, and multiple sgRNA formation, but phylogenetically the CTV polymerase, like polymerases of other closteroviruses, belongs to the Sindbis virus-like lineage of RNA virus polymerases. Both positive-strand RNA virus supergroups, coronaviruses and Sindbis-like viruses, utilize different mechanisms of transcription. To address the mechanism of CTV transcription, 5' termini for the two most abundant sgRNAs, 1.5 and 0.9 kb, respectively, were mapped by runoff reverse transcription. The two sgRNAs were demonstrated to have 48- and 38-nt 5' untranslated regions (5'-UTRs), respectively. The 5'-UTR for the 1.5-kb RNA was cloned, sequenced, and demonstrated to be colinear with the 48-nt genomic sequence upstream of the initiator codon of the respective open reading frame 10, i.e., to be of continuous template origin. The data obtained suggest that the sgRNA transcription of CTV is dissimilar from the coronavirus transcription and consistent with the transcriptional mechanism of other Sindbis-like viruses. Thus, the Sindbis virus-like mechanism of transcription of the positive-strand RNA genomes might be successfully utilized by the closterovirus genome of up to 19.3 kb with multiple sgRNAs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.16915966300000002,-0.049639314000000004,-0.035305757,0.070742456,0.09343047300000001,-0.080158897,-0.095674922,0.032499564,-0.03042573,-0.043184013,-0.011245033,-0.035385071000000004,0.028504038,0.002731141,0.023238505,0.005131784,0.005609901,0.0018371560000000002,0.001000639,-0.011133961000000001,-0.024626205,-0.007598321999999999,-0.08262879299999999,-0.001354175,-0.05439080599999999,-0.063406306,0.0037565790000000003,0.0383288,0.035986746,-0.072528959
1674,A retention signal necessary and sufficient for Golgi localization maps to the cytoplasmic tail of a Bunyaviridae (Uukuniemi virus) membrane glycoprotein.,"Members of the Bunyaviridae family mature by a budding process in the Golgi complex. The site of maturation is thought to be largely determined by the accumulation of the two spike glycoproteins, G1 and G2, in this organelle. Here we show that the signal for localizing the Uukuniemi virus (a phlebovirus) spike protein complex to the Golgi complex resides in the cytoplasmic tail of G1. We constructed chimeric proteins in which the ectodomain, transmembrane domain (TMD), and cytoplasmic tail (CT) of Uukuniemi virus G1 were exchanged with the corresponding domains of either vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV G), chicken lysozyme, or CD4, all proteins readily transported to the plasma membrane. The chimeras were expressed in HeLa or BHK-21 cells by using either the T7 RNA polymerase-driven vaccinia virus system or the Semliki Forest virus system. The fate of the chimeric proteins was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence, and their localizations were compared by double labeling with markers specific for the Golgi complex. The results showed that the ectodomain and TMD (including the 10 flanking residues on either side of the membrane) of G1 played no apparent role in targeting chimeric proteins to the Golgi complex. Instead, all chimeras containing the CT of G1 were efficiently targeted to the Golgi complex and colocalized with mannosidase II, a Golgi-specific enzyme. Conversely, replacing the CT of G1 with that from VSV G resulted in the efficient transport of the chimeric protein to the cell surface. Progressive deletions of the G1 tail suggested that the Golgi retention signal maps to a region encompassing approximately residues 10 to 50, counting from the proposed border between the TMD and the tail. Both G1 and G2 were found to be acylated, as shown by incorporation of [3H]palmitate into the viral proteins. By mutational analyses of CD4-G1 chimeras, the sites for palmitylation were mapped to two closely spaced cysteine residues in the G1 tail. Changing either or both of these cysteines to alanine had no effect on the targeting of the chimeric protein to the Golgi complex.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.116254031,-0.043791298,-0.016235697,-0.049691808,-0.04450558599999999,0.011327905,-0.007207366999999999,-0.020318596,0.029923084,-0.032702089,-0.042706455,-0.001624385,-0.018594929,0.011935321,-0.015438357,-0.018725117,0.055890122,-0.04680075400000001,-0.008295867,0.026826227999999997,-0.026729702999999997,0.016242755,-0.016189491,-0.050153324000000006,0.051462558,0.053365728,-0.007454919,0.007938736,-0.043972662,0.004600187
1675,Assembled coronavirus from complementation of two defective interfering RNAs.,"In the presence of an RNA- temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant helper virus, two coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) defective interfering (DI) RNAs complemented each other, resulting in the assembly of MHV particles; we used this ability to complement as a means to study coronavirus assembly. One of the two DI RNAs was DIssA, a naturally occurring self-replicating DI RNA encoding N protein and the gene 1 proteins that encode RNA polymerase function; DIssA supports the replication and transcription of other non-self-replicating DI RNAs. The other DI was a genetically engineered DI RNA that encoded sM and M proteins. Coinfection of these two DIs at the nonpermissive temperature for the ts helper virus resulted in replication and transcription of both DI RNAs but not in synthesis of the helper virus RNAs. MHV particles containing DI RNAs, N protein, and M protein, all of which were exclusively derived from the two DI RNAs, were released from the coinfected cells; the amount of sM protein was below the limits of detection. Analyses of DI RNAs with mutations in the two envelope protein genes demonstrated that M and sM proteins appeared to be required for assembly and release of MHV particles that contained DI RNAs and N protein, while S protein was not required for assembly and release of MHV particles.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.208147731,-0.079750688,-0.044102835,0.04330509,0.007542518000000001,-0.13694441599999999,-0.1981846,0.050516589,-0.002119466,-0.101062951,-0.03273097,-0.160442518,0.065885261,0.053921265999999995,0.229111129,0.229362265,-0.239125585,0.11706619900000001,-0.003603194,0.014913003999999999,0.066108954,-0.028949075,0.118761672,-0.00292127,0.189830222,0.204371015,0.044533474,-0.057385961,0.029590797999999998,-0.015544118
1676,"RNA-RNA recombination in Sindbis virus: roles of the 3' conserved motif, poly(A) tail, and nonviral sequences of template RNAs in polymerase recognition and template switching.","Sindbis virus (SIN), a mosquito-transmitted animal RNA virus, carries a 11.7-kb positive-sense RNA genome which is capped and polyadenylated. We recently reported that the SIN RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) could initiate negative-strand RNA synthesis from a 0.3-kb 3'-coterminal SIN RNA fragment and undergo template switching in vivo (M. Hajjou, K. R. Hill, S. V. Subramaniam, J. Y. Hu, and R. Raju, J. Virol. 70:5153-5164, 1996). To identify and characterize the viral and nonviral sequences which regulate SIN RNA synthesis and recombination, a series of SIN RNAs carrying altered 3' ends were tested for the ability to produce infectious virus or to support recombination in BHK cells. The major findings of this report are as follows: (i) the 3'-terminal 20-nucleotides (nt) sequence along with the abutting poly(A) tail of the SIN genome fully supports negative-strand synthesis, genome replication, and template switching; (ii) a full-length SIN RNA carrying the 3'-terminal 24 nt but lacking the poly(A) tail is noninfectious; (iii) SIN RNAs which carry 3' 64 nt or more without the poly(A) tail are infectious and regain their poly(A) tail in vivo; (iv) donor templates lacking the poly(A) tail do not support template switching; (v) full-length SIN RNAs lacking the poly(A) tail but carrying 3' nonviral extensions, although debilitated to begin with, evolve into rapidly growing poly(A)-carrying mutants; (vi) poly(A) or poly(U) motifs positioned internally within the acceptor templates, in the absence of other promoter elements within the vicinity, do not induce the jumping polymerase to reinitiate at these sites; and (vii) the junction site selection on donor templates occurs independently of the sequences around the acceptor sites. In addition to furthering our understanding of RNA recombination, these studies give interesting clues as to how the alphavirus polymerase interacts with its 3' promoter elements of genomic RNA and nonreplicative RNAs. This is the first report that an in vitro-synthesized alphavirus RNA lacking a poly(A) tail can initiate infection and produce 3' polyadenylated viral genome in vivo.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.19948513399999998,-0.061658312,-0.05549474099999999,0.056951722,0.013197811,-0.103539008,-0.063962674,0.052748479,-0.04497014,-0.016893428000000002,0.051668037,-0.003180778,-0.013513147,-0.004736778,0.041919237000000005,0.08161667,-0.044668515,0.009012888,-0.035526298,-0.022624064,-0.002544092,-0.005280701,-0.031501815,-0.045431555,-0.02610075,-0.073893559,-0.043992086,0.045823409,0.049336468,-0.001053923
1677,Processing of the equine arteritis virus replicase ORF1b protein: identification of cleavage products containing the putative viral polymerase and helicase domains.,"The replicase open reading frame lb (ORF1b) protein of equine arteritis virus (EAV) is expressed from the viral genome as an ORF1ab fusion protein (345 kDa) by ribosomal frameshifting. Processing of the ORF1b polyprotein was predicted to be mediated by the nsp4 serine protease, the main EAV protease. Several putative cleavage sites for this protease were detected in the ORF1b polyprotein. On the basis of this tentative processing scheme, peptides were selected to raise rabbit antisera that were used to study the processing of the EAV replicase ORF1b polyprotein (158 kDa). In immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments, processing products of 80, 50, 26, and 12 kDa were detected. Of these, the 80-kDa and the 50-kDa proteins contain the putative viral polymerase and helicase domains, respectively. Together, the four cleavage products probably cover the entire ORF1b-encoded region of the EAV replicase, thereby representing the first complete processing scheme of a coronaviruslike ORF1b polyprotein. Pulse-chase analysis revealed that processing of the ORF1b polyprotein is slow and that several large precursor proteins containing both ORF1a- and ORF1b-encoded regions are generated.

1679,Replication of murine coronavirus defective interfering RNA from negative-strand transcripts.,"The positive-strand defective interfering (DI) RNA of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), when introduced into MHV-infected cells, results in DI RNA replication and accumulation. We studied whether the introduction of negative-strand transcripts of MHV DI RNA would also result in replication. At a location downstream of the T7 promoter and upstream of the human hepatitis delta virus ribozyme domain, we inserted a complete cDNA clone of MHV DI RNA in reverse orientation; in vitro-synthesized RNA from this plasmid yielded a negative-strand RNA copy of the MHV DI RNA. When the negative-strand transcripts of the DI RNA were expressed in MHV-infected cells by a vaccinia virus T7 expression system, positive-strand DI RNAs accumulated in the plasmid-transfected cells. DI RNA replication depended on the expression of T7 polymerase and on the presence of the T7 promoter. Transfection of in vitro-synthesized negative-strand transcripts into MHV-infected cells and serial passage of virus samples from RNA-transfected cells also resulted in accumulation of the DI RNA. Positive-strand DI RNA transcripts were undetectable in sample preparations of the in vitro-synthesized negative-strand DI RNA transcripts, and DI RNA did not accumulate after cotransfection of a small amount of positive-strand DI RNA and truncated-replication-disabled negative-strand transcripts; clearly, the DI RNA replicated from the transfected negative-strand transcripts and not from minute amounts of positive-strand DI RNAs that might be envisioned as artifacts of T7 transcription. Sequence analysis of positive-strand DI RNAs in the cells transfected with negative-strand transcripts showed that DI RNAs maintained the DI-specific unique sequences introduced within the leader sequence. These data indicated that positive-strand DI RNA synthesis occurred from introduced negative-strand transcripts in the MHV-infected cells; this demonstration, using MHV, of DI RNA replication from transfected negative-strand DI RNA transcripts is the first such demonstration among all positive-stranded RNA viruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.23273443600000002,-0.079279781,-0.058026385,0.087048834,0.012074936999999999,-0.187419953,-0.20681682899999998,0.09407419800000001,-0.045761473,-0.10276854199999999,0.047541043,-0.143554293,0.030409911,0.11473397,0.248925531,0.265625531,-0.261819758,0.12443666099999999,0.018804484,-0.038550434,0.048213465999999996,-0.019559174,0.09290895,-0.045406268,0.10393910599999999,0.097378014,-0.028521737999999998,-0.007247666999999999,0.063632299,-0.02772993
1680,Nonhomologous RNA-RNA recombination events at the 3' nontranslated region of the Sindbis virus genome: hot spots and utilization of nonviral sequences.,"The mechanism of RNA-RNA recombination at the 3' nontranslated region (3'NTR) of the Sindbis virus (SIN) genome was studied by using nonreplicative RNA precursors. The 11.7-kb SIN genome was transcribed in vitro as two nonoverlapping RNA fragments. RNA-1 contained the entire 11.4-kb protein coding sequence of SIN and also carried an additional 1.8-kb nonviral sequence at its 3' end. RNA-2 carried the remaining 0.26 or 0.3 kb of the SIN genome containing the 3'NTR. Transfection of these two fragments into BHK cells resulted in vivo RNA-RNA recombination and release of infectious SIN recombinants. Eighteen plaque-purified recombinant viruses were sequenced to precisely map the RNA-RNA crossover sites at the 3'NTR. Sixteen of the 18 recombinants were found to be genetically heterogeneous at the 3'NTR. Two major clustered sites within the 3'NTR of RNA-2 were found to be fused to multiple locations on the nonviral sequence of RNA-1, resulting in insertions of 10 to 1,085 nucleotides at the 3'NTR. Sequence analysis of crossover sites suggested only limited homology and heteroduplex-forming capability between substrate RNAs. Analysis of additional 23 recombinant viruses generated by mutagenized donor and acceptor templates supports the occurrence of recombination hot spots on donor templates. Introduction of a 17-nucleotide rudimentary replicase recognition signal in the acceptor template alone did not induce the polymerase to reinitiate at the 17-nucleotide signal. Interestingly, deletion of a 24-nucleotide hot spot locus on the donor template abolished crossover events at one of the two sites and allowed the polymerase to reinitiate at the 17-nucleotide replicase recognition signal inserted at the acceptor template. The possible roles of RNA-protein and RNA-RNA interactions in the differential regulation of apparent pausing, template selection, and reinitiation are discussed.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.22320697399999997,-0.061982899,-0.055175034000000005,0.08660432900000001,0.065851408,-0.11935523,-0.08078081200000001,0.051688396,-0.063080437,-0.001712421,0.049604092,0.004629964,-0.005571989,-0.022461207,0.033454388,0.044537728,-0.050453264000000005,0.014214131000000001,-0.005735915,-0.020775158999999998,0.012559303,-0.013599409,0.001946969,-0.009319345,-0.05247894400000001,-0.034528021,0.011997322,0.032900232,-0.015271083999999999,0.017777291
1681,Astrovirus ribosomal frameshifting in an infection-transfection transient expression system.,"Different regions of the human astrovirus frameshift signal were cloned into the rhesus rotavirus VP4 gene and evaluated in an infection-transfection transient expression cell culture system. BHK-21 cells, infected with a vaccinia virus that expresses T7 RNA polymerase (vTF7-3), were transfected with the various astrovirus-VP4 constructs. All constructs were driven by a T7 promoter and contained an internal ribosome entry site. Frameshifted and nonframeshifted protein products were immunoprecipitated with VP4 amino- and carboxy-terminal-specific monoclonal antibodies, and their ratios were determined by PhosphorImager analysis. The efficiency of frameshifting was 25 to 28%, significantly greater than the 5 to 7% efficiency reported previously in a cell-free translation system. Coupling of transcription and translation in a cell-free system yielded frameshifting efficiencies threefold greater than that of the uncoupled in vitro system. The presence of the shifty heptamer was an absolute requirement for frameshifting in both cell-free and intact-cell systems, while deletion of the potential downstream pseudoknot region did not affect the efficiency of frameshifting.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.128732668,-0.052486280999999996,0.001603877,-0.07101753,-0.0070127359999999994,-0.008877981,-0.057412766,-0.019986823,0.045740693,-0.04800237,-0.089401539,-0.055213047,0.024992372000000002,-0.004986089,0.004290023,-0.022756053,0.019834856,-0.017354155,0.00657835,-0.034240957,0.008032056,-0.031282636,0.0017202979999999999,0.006181417,-0.012986824,0.005174939,-0.025404095,0.0046064520000000005,-5.0600000000000003e-05,-0.030659339
1682,cis Requirement for N-specific protein sequence in bovine coronavirus defective interfering RNA replication.,"A naturally occurring 2.2-kb defective interfering (DI) RNA of the bovine coronavirus, structurally a simple fusion of the genomic termini, contains a single contiguous open reading frame (ORF) or 1.7 kb composed of the 5'-terminal 288 nucleotides of polymerase gene 1a and all 1,344 nucleotides of the nucleocapsid protein (N) gene. The ORF must remain open throughout most of its sequence for replication to occur. To determine the qualitative importance of the N portion of the chimeric ORF in DI RNA replication, transcripts of mutated reporter-containing constructs were tested for replication in helper virus-infected cells. It was determined that the N ORF could not be replaced by the naturally occurring internal I protein ORF, accomplished by deleting the first base in the N start codon which leads to a +1 frameshift, nor could it be replaced by the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ORF. Furthermore, 3'-terminal truncations of the N gene leaving less than 85% of its total length were likewise not tolerated. Small in-frame deletions and in-frame foreign sequence insertions of up to 99 nucleotides within certain regions of the N ORF were tolerated, however, but the rate of DI RNA accumulation in these cases was lower. These results indicate that there is a requirement for translation of most if not all of the N protein in cis for optimal replication of the bovine coronavirus DI RNA and suggest that a similar requirement may exist for viral genome replication.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.232530436,-0.071674128,-0.054755402,0.020377832,0.075583562,-0.144638042,-0.22960951899999998,0.045658468,0.020542261000000003,-0.095423231,-0.077610132,-0.10283527599999999,0.06441547,-0.052133692999999995,0.070034598,0.024403069,-0.065664033,0.066403262,0.044145664,0.025586372000000003,0.017979133,-0.019593349,0.008524933,0.005588003,-0.0018333289999999999,0.06411449400000001,0.049278255,-0.087413155,0.025850477,-0.048652858
1683,Saccharomyces cerevisiae L-BC double-stranded RNA virus replicase recognizes the L-A positive-strand RNA 3' end.,"L-A and L-BC are two double-stranded RNA viruses present in almost all strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. L-A, the major species, has been extensively characterized with in vitro systems established, but little is known about L-BC. Here we report in vitro template-dependent transcription, replication, and RNA recognition activities of L-BC. The L-BC replicase activity converts positive, single-stranded RNA to double-stranded RNA by synthesis of the complementary RNA strand. Although L-A and L-BC do not interact in vivo, in vitro L-BC virions can replicate the positive, single-stranded RNA of L-A and its satellite, M1, with the same 3' end sequence and stem-loop requirements shown by L-A virions for its own template. However, the L-BC virions do not recognize the internal replication enhancer of the L-A positive strand. In a direct comparison of L-A and L-BC virions, each preferentially recognizes its own RNA for binding, replication, and transcription. These results suggest a close evolutionary relation of these two viruses, consistent with their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence similarities.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.17848756600000001,-0.043826005,-0.048200382,0.079010597,0.006925914,-0.080759561,-0.010335549,0.046848684,-0.051425525,-0.004278266,0.065056204,0.025509242999999997,-0.035151238,0.028994823,0.016959425,0.037407403,-0.007466711,-0.0024783120000000003,0.005867544000000001,-0.015917034,-0.030962142999999998,0.015482136,-0.043825369,-0.042737447000000005,-0.033346304,-0.060169192,-0.06398469799999999,0.031995736000000004,0.00547137,-0.003135905
1684,Genesis of Sindbis virus by in vivo recombination of nonreplicative RNA precursors.,"Genetically engineered RNA transcripts coding for various Sindbis virus (SIN) genes were used to study structure and sequence requirements of RNA recombination in BHK cells. Three different groups of RNA transcripts were made: (i) RNAs which retain the ability to replicate and which carry sequences coding for either viral polymerase or viral structural proteins; (ii) RNAs which lack the complete 3' end of the SIN genome and thus are incapable of replicating; and (iii) RNAs which lack the complete 5' end of the SIN genome and also are incapable of replicating. BHK cells were transfected with specific combinations of these precursor RNAs, and virus production and RNA synthetic abilities of the released virus were determined. We demonstrate in vivo generation of infectious SIN by fusion of (i) replicative RNAs to nonreplicative RNAs and (ii) two nonreplicative RNA precursors. Both homologous and nonhomologous types of recombinations were observed. In the homologous type of recombination, a 694-nucleotide overlap at the crossover region of the first pair of precursors resulted in the addition of an A residue converting the UAG stop codon of nonstructural protein P4 to a UAA stop codon. In the nonhomologous type of recombination, the crossover sites contained deletion of up to 76 nucleotides from one of the precursors and complete preservation of junction sequence from the other precursor. This is also the first report that a cytoplasmic RNA virus can be generated from biologically nonreplicative RNA precursors. These results have implications for initiation of viral RNA synthesis and recombination between RNA viral genomes in general. We favor template switching as a mechanism for the fusion events described here and suggest inclusion of polymerase scanning of diverse nonreplicative RNAs as an inherent feature of the copy choice model of RNA recombination. Very importantly, the facile nature of RNA recombination occurring between nonreplicative RNA precursors should speed up the production and analysis of targeted mutants of SIN and possibly other RNA viruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.24340166100000002,-0.075949935,-0.061887713,0.10368186800000001,0.053613500999999994,-0.118816849,-0.08456662599999999,0.053840057999999996,-0.056298847,0.017414225,0.051231542000000005,-0.040515962999999995,0.01421467,0.009978615,0.070390432,0.077625594,-0.099773203,0.01552151,-0.04056322,0.001091383,0.03940671,-0.019392911999999998,-0.0035151609999999997,0.022406619,-0.054318905,-0.041781259,0.046709649000000006,0.01132059,-0.029736602,0.007475290999999999
1685,3C-like protease of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus: identification of cleavage sites in the ORF1 polyprotein and analysis of cleavage specificity.,"Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, a positive-stranded RNA virus of the family Caliciviridae, encodes a trypsin-like cysteine protease as part of a large polyprotein. Upon expression in Escherichia coli, the protease releases itself from larger precursors by proteolytic cleavages at its N and C termini. Both cleavage sites were determined by N-terminal sequence analysis of the cleavage products. Cleavage at the N terminus of the protease occurred with high efficiency at an EG dipeptide at positions 1108 and 1109. Cleavage at the C terminus of the protease occurred with low efficiency at an ET dipeptide at positions 1251 and 1252. To study the cleavage specificity of the protease, amino acid substitutions were introduced at the P2, P1, and P1' positions at the cleavage site at the N-terminal boundary of the protease. This analysis showed that the amino acid at the P1 position is the most important determinant for substrate recognition. Only glutamic acid, glutamine, and aspartic acid were tolerated at this position. At the P1' position, glycine, serine, and alanine were the preferred substrates of the protease, but a number of amino acids with larger side chains were also tolerated. Substitutions at the P2 position had only little effect on the cleavage efficiency. Cell-free expression of the C-terminal half of the ORF1 polyprotein showed that the protease catalyzes cleavage at the junction of the RNA polymerase and the capsid protein. An EG dipeptide at positions 1767 and 1768 was identified as the putative cleavage site.

1686,Investigation of the control of coronavirus subgenomic mRNA transcription by using T7-generated negative-sense RNA transcripts.,"The subgenomic mRNAs of the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) are not produced in equimolar amounts. We have developed a reporter gene system to investigate the control of this differential subgenomic mRNA synthesis. Transcription of mRNAs by the TGEV polymerase was obtained from negative-sense RNA templates generated in situ from DNA containing a T7 promoter. A series of gene cassettes was produced; these cassettes comprised the reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene downstream of transcription-associated sequences (TASs) (also referred to as intergenic sequences and promoters) believed to be involved in the synthesis of TGEV subgenomic mRNAs 6 and 7. The gene cassettes were designed so that negative-sense RNA copies of the CAT gene with sequences complementary to the TGEV TASs, or modified versions, at the 3' end would be synthesized in situ by T7 RNA polymerase. Using this system, we have demonstrated that CAT was expressed from mRNAs derived from the T7-generated negative-sense RNA transcripts only in TGEV-infected cells and only from transcripts possessing a TGEV negative-sense TAS. Analysis of the CAT mRNAs showed the presence of the TGEV leader RNA sequence at the 5' end, in keeping with observations that all coronavirus mRNAs have a 5' leader sequence corresponding to the 5' end of the genomic RNA. Our results indicated that the CAT mRNAs were transcribed from the in situ-synthesized negative-sense RNA templates without the requirement of TGEV genomic 5' or 3' sequences on the T7-generated negative-sense transcripts (3'-TAS-CAT-5'). Modification of the TGEV TASs indicated (i) that the degree of potential base pairing between the 3' end of the leader RNA and the TGEV negative-sense TAS was not the sole determinant of the amount of subgenomic mRNA transcribed and (ii) that other factors, including nucleotides flanking the TAS, are involved in the regulation of transcription of TGEV subgenomic mRNAs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.183576462,-0.041431842999999996,0.003706518,-0.018463893000000002,0.048790783,-0.09311571699999999,-0.147040753,0.037715257,-0.010783214,-0.089175115,-0.007647551,-0.060196067,0.017324298999999998,0.017208898,0.056902367,0.03077372,-0.04658297,0.008731748000000001,-0.003117787,0.016087575,-0.008066689,0.014240345,-0.0033508970000000003,-0.000807036,0.011897005,-0.079498681,-0.027951676,-0.003308625,0.092192582,0.045591803
1687,Characterization of a human coronavirus (strain 229E) 3C-like proteinase activity.,"The RNA polymerase gene of human coronavirus (HCV) 229E encodes a large polyprotein that contains domains with motifs characteristic of both papain-like cysteine proteinases and proteinases with homology to the 3C proteinase of picornaviruses. In this study, we have, first, expressed the putative HCV 229E 3C-like proteinase domain as part of a beta-galactosidase fusion protein in Escherichia coli and have shown that the expressed protein has proteolytic activity. The substitution of one amino acid within the predicted proteinase domain (His-3006-->Asp-3006) abolishes, or at least significantly reduces, this activity. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of a purified, 34-kDa cleavage product shows that the bacterial fusion protein is cleaved at the dipeptide Gln-2965-Ala-2966, which is the predicted amino-terminal end of the putative 3C-like proteinase domain. Second, we have confirmed the proteolytic activity of a bacterially expressed polypeptide with the amino acid sequence of the predicted HCV 229E 3C-like proteinase by trans cleavage of an in vitro translated polypeptide encoded within open reading frame 1b of the RNA polymerase gene. Finally, using fusion protein-specific antiserum, we have identified a 34-kDa, 3C-like proteinase polypeptide in HCV 229E-infected MRC-5 cells.

1688,Formation of brome mosaic virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in yeast requires coexpression of viral proteins and viral RNA.,"In this report we show that yeast expressing brome mosaic virus (BMV) replication proteins 1a and 2a and replicating a BMV RNA3 derivative can be extracted to yield a template-dependent BMV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) able to synthesize (-)-strand RNA from BMV (+)-strand RNA templates added in vitro. This virus-specific yeast-derived RdRp mirrored the template selectivity and other characteristics of RdRp from BMV-infected plants. Equivalent extracts from yeast expressing 1a and 2a but lacking RNA3 contained normal amounts of 1a and 2a but had no RdRp activity on BMV RNAs added in vitro. To determine which RNA3 sequences were required in vivo to yield RdRp activity, we tested deletions throughout RNA3, including the 5',3', and intercistronic noncoding regions, which contain the cis-acting elements required for RNA3 replication in vivo. RdRp activity was obtained only from cells expressing 1a, 2a, and RNA3 derivatives retaining both 3' and intercistronic noncoding sequences. Strong correlation between extracted RdRp activity and BMV (-)-strand RNA accumulation in vivo was found for all RNA3 derivatives tested. Thus, extractable in vitro RdRp activity paralleled formation of a complex capable of viral RNA synthesis in vivo. The results suggest that assembly of active RdRp requires not only viral proteins but also viral RNA, either to directly contribute some nontemplate function or to recruit essential host factors into the RdRp complex and that sequences at both the 3'-terminal initiation site and distant internal sites of RNA3 templates may participate in RdRp assembly and initiation of (-)-strand synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.224257688,-0.058568404000000004,-0.091453761,0.113120413,-0.064180862,-0.08809458199999999,0.036995635,0.044855695999999994,-0.064625502,0.004366177,0.126422939,0.118566615,-0.117294847,0.019907166,-0.035157996000000004,0.023450457,0.046075917,-0.049953999000000006,0.009363923,-0.067048421,0.004222395,-0.010153179,0.024438092,-0.11426320300000001,0.015849455,-0.021599412999999998,-0.069568849,0.060962067,0.050088832,0.049649372000000004
1690,A cis-acting function for the coronavirus leader in defective interfering RNA replication.,"To test the hypothesis that the 65-nucleotide (nt) leader on subgenomic mRNAs suffices as a 5'-terminal cis-acting signal for RNA replication, a corollary to the notion that coronavirus mRNAs behave as replicons, synthetic RNA transcripts of a cloned, reporter-containing N mRNA (mRNA 7) of the bovine coronavirus with a precise 5' terminus and a 3' poly(A) of 68 nt were tested for replication after being transfected into helper virus-infected cells. No replication was observed, but synthetic transcripts of a cloned reporter-containing defective interfering (DI) RNA differing from the N mRNA construct by 433 nt of continuous 5'-proximal genomic sequence between the leader and the N open reading frame did replicate and become packaged, indicating the insufficiency of the leader alone as a 5' signal for replication of transfected RNA molecules. The leader was shown to be a necessary part of the cis-acting signal for DI RNA replication, however, since removal of terminal bases that destroyed a predicted intraleader stem-loop also destroyed replicating ability. Surprisingly, when the same stem-loop was disrupted by base substitutions, replication appeared only minimally impaired and the leader was found to have rapidly reverted to wild type during DI RNA replication, a phenomenon reminiscent of high-frequency leader switching in the mouse hepatitis coronavirus. These results suggest that once a minimal structural requirement for leader is fulfilled for initiation of DI RNA replication, the wild-type leader is strongly preferred for subsequent replication. They also demonstrate that, in contrast to reported natural mouse hepatitis coronavirus DI RNAs, the DI RNA of the bovine coronavirus does not require sequence elements originating from discontinuous downstream regions within the polymerase gene for replication or for packaging.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.266819136,-0.077163688,-0.071823919,0.072136807,0.024796701,-0.171353901,-0.203003264,0.071950746,-0.023655632000000003,-0.108360267,0.0011981539999999999,-0.11795411900000001,0.048356160999999995,0.038184234,0.159056464,0.191363032,-0.19919964899999998,0.111329305,0.011483821000000002,-0.01916207,0.065825062,-0.017522842,0.039304619,0.021242639,0.083889196,0.002928195,-0.03029884,-0.008224457,0.132095105,-0.047867283
1691,Genetics of mouse hepatitis virus transcription: evidence that subgenomic negative strands are functional templates.,"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants belonging to complementation group C were characterized and mapped by standard genetic recombination techniques. Temperature shift experiments early in infection suggested that the group C allele can be divided into two phenotypically distinct subgroups, designated C1 and C2. Since previous data indicated that the group C1 mutants probably contained an early defect which affects negative-strand synthesis, RNA synthesis was further examined by analyzing replicative-form (RF) RNA. Full-length as well as subgenomic-length RF RNAs were radiolabeled from 3 to 12 h postinfection (p.i.) and labeled late in infection after shift to the nonpermissive temperature (39.5 degrees C). The relative percent molar ratios of each mRNA and corresponding RF RNA were roughly equivalent throughout infection. Temperature shift experiments at 5.5 or 6.0 h p.i. resulted in an 83 to 92% reduction in the amount of total RF RNA at 39.5 degrees C. Radiolabeling time course experiments after temperature shift to 39.5 degrees C also demonstrated incorporation (6 to 9 h p.i.) into both subgenomic-length and full-length RF RNAs, suggesting that previously transcribed negative strands were functional templates throughout infection. To determine if the reduction in RF RNA was due to a decrease in positive- or negative-strand RNA synthesis, rates of mRNA synthesis were calculated from both full-length and subgenomic-length templates. The rate of mRNA synthesis after the shift was increased at 39.5 degrees C compared with that at 32 degrees C regardless of the template used; however, transcription rates calculated from subgenomic-length templates were similar to those of other viral and eukaryotic polymerases. These findings support the notion that the group C1 allele regulates negative-strand RNA synthesis and strongly suggest that the subgenomic negative-strand RNAs are probably the predominant functional templates for the synthesis of positive-strand RNAs late in infection.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14309318599999998,-0.054607733,-0.051919377,0.030899757000000003,-0.008169109,-0.10864751,-0.063194975,0.058767084000000004,-0.062178204,-0.044265025,0.052967349000000004,-0.016636492,-0.018523177,0.042199412,0.04525524400000001,0.099612319,-0.06383201,0.007246014,-0.010386988,-0.019039571,-0.028486047,-0.03032542,-0.018094601000000002,-0.053954502,-0.0018485860000000002,-0.063555363,-0.050253202999999996,0.00332215,0.008730135,0.022465226
1692,Map locations of mouse hepatitis virus temperature-sensitive mutants: confirmation of variable rates of recombination.,"Using standard genetic recombination techniques, studies in our laboratory suggest that recombination rates are very high and vary in different portions of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genome. To determine the actual recombination frequencies in the MHV genome and localize the nucleotide boundaries of individual viral genes, we have sequenced temperature-sensitive and revertant viruses to identify the location of specific mutant alleles. Complementation group F RNA+ ts mutants (LA7, NC6, and NC16) each contained a unique mutation which was tightly linked to the ts phenotype and resulted in a conservative or nonconservative amino acid change in the MHV S glycoprotein gene. In agreement with previous recombination mapping studies, the mutation in LA7 and NC6 mapped within the S1 domain while NC16 mapped within the S2 domain. To determine the map coordinates of the MHV polymerase genes, several RNA- mutants and their revertants belonging to complementation groups C (NC3 and LA9) and E (LA18 and NC4) were also sequenced. Mutations were identified in each virus that were tightly linked to the ts phenotype and resulted in either a conservative or nonconservative amino acid change. The group C allele spanned the ORF 1a/ORF 1b junction, while the group E mutants mapped at the C terminus of ORF 1b about 20 to 22 kb from the 5' end of the genome. Mutation rates, calculated from the reversion frequencies of plaque-purified ts viruses requiring a single nucleotide alteration for reversion, approached 1.32 (+/- 0.89) x 10(-4) substitutions per nucleotide site per round of template copying. Detailed recombination mapping studies across known distances between these different ts alleles has confirmed that homologous recombination rates approached 25% and varied within different portions of the MHV genome.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14220369,-0.054340357,-0.016869177,-0.004365181,0.089880015,-0.050985748,-0.074685537,0.02446635,-0.030873203,-0.005158586,-0.018040679,-0.003701662,0.006142039,-0.074739019,0.038634219,0.028746597999999998,-0.080166026,0.017762,-0.040274831000000004,-0.002834016,0.074766051,-0.106925091,0.048915297999999996,0.111583512,-0.020191445,0.070287408,0.07004588,-0.059593731,-0.13513646199999998,-0.075446001
1693,"Analysis of astrovirus serotype 1 RNA, identification of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase motif, and expression of a viral structural protein.","We report the results from sequence analysis and expression studies of the gastroenteritis agent astrovirus serotype 1. We have cloned and sequenced 5,944 nucleotides (nt) of the estimated 7.2-kb RNA genome and have identified three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF-3, at the 3' end, is 2,361 nt in length and is fully encoded in both the genomic and subgenomic viral RNAs. Expression of ORF-3 in vitro yields an 87-kDa protein that is immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody specific for viral capsids. This protein comigrates with an authentic 87-kDa astrovirus protein immunoprecipitated from infected cells, indicating that this region encodes a viral structural protein. The adjacent upstream ORF (ORF-2) is 1,557 nt in length and contains a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase motif. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase motifs from four astrovirus serotypes are compared. Partial sequence (2,018 nt) of the most 5' ORF (ORF-1) reveals a 3C-like serine protease motif. The ORF-1 sequence is incomplete. These results indicate that the astrovirus genome is organized with nonstructural proteins encoded at the 5' end and structural proteins at the 3' end. ORF-2 has no start methionine and is in the -1 frame compared with ORF-1.

1694,An 'elaborated' pseudoknot is required for high frequency frameshifting during translation of HCV 229E polymerase mRNA.,"The RNA polymerase gene (gene 1) of the human coronavirus 229E is approximately 20 kb in length and is located at the 5' end of the positive-strand genomic RNA. The coding sequence of gene 1 is divided into two large open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, that overlap by 43 nucleotides. In the region of the ORF1a/ORF1b overlap, the genomic RNA displays two elements that are known to mediate (-1) ribosomal frameshifting. These are the slippery sequence, UUUAAAC, and a 3' pseudoknot structure. By introducing site-specific mutations into synthetic mRNAs, we have analysed the predicted structure of the HCV 229E pseudoknot and shown that besides the well-known stem structures, S1 and S2, a third stem structure, S3, is required for a high frequency of frameshifting.

1695,A translation-attenuating intraleader open reading frame is selected on coronavirus mRNAs during persistent infection.,"Short open reading frames within the 5' leader of some eukaryotic mRNAs are known to regulate the rate of translation initiation on the downstream open reading frame. By employing the polymerase chain reaction, we learned that the 5'-terminal 5 nt on the common leader sequence of bovine coronavirus subgenomic mRNAs were heterogeneous and hypervariable throughout early infection in cell culture and that as a persistent infection became established, termini giving rise to a common 33-nt intraleader open reading frame were selected. Since the common leader is derived from the genomic 5' end during transcription, a common focus of origin for the heterogeneity is expected. The intraleader open reading frame was shown by in vitro translation studies to attenuate translation of downstream open reading frames in a cloned bovine coronavirus mRNA molecule. Selection of an intraleader open reading frame resulting in a general attenuation of mRNA translation and a consequent attenuation of virus replication may, therefore, be a mechanism by which coronaviruses and possibly other RNA viruses with a similar transcriptional strategy maintain a persistent infection.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.147249359,-0.059962351,-0.039939393999999996,-0.021991706,0.07719931299999999,-0.091059733,-0.141232819,0.044889645,0.022484812000000003,-0.083137088,-0.103334996,-0.08399601699999999,0.087244334,-0.068701119,0.006591699,-0.03143363,0.017977168999999998,0.026730572,0.010833123,0.007322624,0.010923896,-0.009733181,-0.060380564000000005,0.037751728,-0.029226656,-0.07403478200000001,-0.010841805,-0.022633871,0.111185545,-0.059076885
1696,Deletion mapping of a mouse hepatitis virus defective interfering RNA reveals the requirement of an internal and discontiguous sequence for replication.,"All of the defective interfering (DI) RNAs of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) contain both the 5' and 3' ends of the viral genomic RNA, which presumably include the cis sequences required for RNA replication. To define the replication signal of MHV RNA, we have used a vaccinia virus-T7 polymerase-transcribed MHV DI RNA to study the effects of sequence deletion on DI RNA replication. Following infection of susceptible cells with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase, various cDNA clones derived from a DI RNA (DIssF) of the JHM strain of MHV, which is a 3.5-kb naturally occurring DI RNA, behind a T7 promoter were transfected. On superinfection with a helper MHV, the ability of various DI RNAs to replicate was determined. Serial deletions from the middle of the RNA toward both the 5' and 3' ends demonstrated that 859 nucleotides from the 5' end and 436 nucleotides from the 3' end of the MHV RNA genome were necessary for RNA replication. Surprisingly, an additional stretch of 135 nucleotides located at 3.1 to 3.3 kb from the 5' end of the genome was also required. This stretch is discontiguous from the 5'-end cis replication signal and is present in all of the naturally occurring DI RNAs studied so far. The requirement for a long stretch of 5'- and 3'-end sequences predicts that the subgenomic MHV mRNAs cannot replicate. The efficiency of RNA replication varied with different cDNA constructs, suggesting possible interaction between different regions of DI RNA. The identification of MHV RNA replication signals allowed the construction of an MHV DI-based expression vector, which can express foreign genes, such as the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.283019139,-0.087558897,-0.072349515,0.10527345699999999,0.041032447,-0.197910435,-0.227424094,0.079367433,-0.030683841,-0.078801835,0.011846154,-0.16261373199999998,0.062810253,0.062880174,0.22831899600000002,0.23853624699999998,-0.266341217,0.14159915,0.013185168999999998,-0.008023055,0.069086815,-0.036075739,0.118685506,0.020021352,0.130718249,0.123152069,0.019442774,-0.040348352000000004,0.032741608,-0.0052282809999999996
1697,Spontaneous mutagenesis of a plant potyvirus genome after insertion of a foreign gene.,"The RNA genome of tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) was engineered to express bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) fused to the virus helper component proteinase (HC-Pro). It was shown previously that prolonged periods (approximately 1 month) of TEV-GUS propagation in plants resulted in the appearance of spontaneous deletion variants. Nine deletion mutants were identified by nucleotide sequence analysis of 40 cDNA clones obtained after polymerase chain reaction amplification. The mutants were missing between 1,741 and 2,074 nucleotides from TEV-GUS, including the sequences coding for most of GUS and the N-terminal region of HC-Pro. This region of HC-Pro contains determinants involved in helper component activity during aphid transmission, as well as a highly conserved series of cysteine residues. The deletion variants were shown to replicate and move systemically without the aid of a helper virus. Infectious viruses harboring the two largest HC-Pro deletions (termed TEV-2del and TEV-7del) were reconstructed by subcloning the corresponding mutated regions into full-length DNA copies of the TEV genome. Characterization of these and additional variants derived by site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that deletion of sequences coding for the HC-Pro N-terminal domain had a negative effect on accumulation of viral RNA and coat protein. The TEV-2del variant possessed an aphid-nontransmissible phenotype that could be rescued partially by prefeeding of aphids on active HC-Pro from another potyvirus. These data suggest that the N-terminal domain of HC-Pro or its coding sequence enhances virus replication or genome expression but does not provide an activity essential for these processes. The function of this domain, as well as a proposed deletion mechanism involving nonhomologous recombination, is discussed.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.130615168,-0.041218629,-0.0164002,-0.022297222999999998,0.006535669,-0.015123542,-0.035129139,0.000126179,-0.003130082,-0.018620108,-0.018514982,0.015989734,-0.0013891779999999998,-0.055067408,-0.0027360220000000003,-0.001562216,-0.005458047,0.00036718199999999997,-0.011324072,-0.007658401,0.020778783999999998,-0.028392202999999998,0.016591378,0.011610098999999999,-0.004487250999999999,0.02844286,0.0052715309999999994,0.0017535089999999999,-0.009767076,-0.013668056000000001
1699,The signal for translational readthrough of a UGA codon in Sindbis virus RNA involves a single cytidine residue immediately downstream of the termination codon.,"The nucleotide sequences surrounding termination codons influence the efficiency of translational readthrough. In this report, we examined the sequence requirement for efficient readthrough of the UGA codon in the Sindbis virus genomic RNA which regulates production of the putative viral RNA polymerase, nsP4. The UGA codon and its neighboring nucleotide sequences were subcloned into a heterologous coding context, and readthrough efficiency was measured by cell-free translation of RNA transcripts in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The CUA codon immediately downstream of the UGA codon was found to be sufficient for efficient translational readthrough. Further mutagenesis of residues in the CUA triplet demonstrated that mutations at the second or third residues following the UGA codon (U and A, respectively) had little effect on readthrough efficiency. In contrast, replacement of the cytidine residue immediately downstream of the UGA codon with any of the other three nucleotides (U, A, or G) dramatically reduced the readthrough efficiency from approximately 10% to less than 1%. These results show that a simple sequence context can allow efficient readthrough of UGA codons in a mammalian translation system. Interestingly, compilation studies of nucleotide sequences surrounding eukaryotic termination codons indicate a strong bias against cytidine residues immediately 3' to UGA termination codons.

1701,Structural requirements for efficient translational frameshifting in the synthesis of the putative viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of potato leafroll virus.,"The putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of potato leafroll luteovirus (PLRV) is expressed by -1 ribosomal frameshifting in the region where the open reading frames (ORF) of proteins 2a and 2b overlap. The signal responsible for efficient frameshift is composed of the slippery site UUUAAAU followed by a sequence that has the potential to adopt two alternative folding patterns, either a structure involving a pseudoknot, or a simple stem-loop structure. To investigate the structure requirements for efficient frameshifting, mutants in the stem-loop or in the potential pseudoknot regions of a Polish isolate of PLRV (PLRV-P) have been analyzed. Mutations that are located in the second stem (S2) of the potential pseudoknot structure, but are located in unpaired regions of the alternative stem-loop structure, reduce frameshift efficiency. Deletion of the 3' end sequence of the alternative stem-loop structure does not reduce frameshift efficiency. Our results confirm that -1 frameshift in the overlap region depends on the slippery site and on the downstream positioned sequence, and propose that in PLRV-P a pseudoknot is required for efficient frameshifting. These results are in agreement with those recently published for the closely related beet western yellows luteovirus (BWYV).",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.155819603,-0.045070915999999996,-0.008578684,-0.017385261000000003,0.05313183900000001,-0.067876601,-0.08599101,0.03462285,-0.009223099,-0.075896691,-0.092199639,0.028284976,0.009290853,-0.147324865,-0.064977037,-0.040556585,0.047233338,0.028368622000000003,-0.036416082999999995,-0.048114098,-0.018476647,-0.075533861,-0.08412653699999999,0.044196559,-0.052454354,-0.082671958,-0.048696733,0.045375099,0.12353837,-0.128612863
1703,Mutagenic analysis of the coronavirus intergenic consensus sequence.,"Previously, a system in which an intergenic region from mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) inserted into an MHV defective interfering (DI) RNA led to transcription of a subgenomic DI RNA in helper virus-infected cells was established. In the present study, a DI cDNA containing one UCUAAAC consensus sequence in the middle of the 0.3-kb-long intergenic region located between genes 6 and 7 was constructed. From this DI cDNA clone, 21 mutant DI RNAs were constructed so that each of the seven consensus sequence nucleotides was changed individually to the three alternative bases. These mutants were used to define how changes in the integrity of MHV transcription consensus sequence UCUAAAC affected mRNA transcription. Except for two mutants with the sequences UGUAAAC and UCGAAAC, all of the mutants supported efficient subgenomic DI RNA transcription. This indicated that MHV transcription regulation was sufficiently flexible to recognize altered consensus sequences. Next, these and other mutants were used to examine the leader-body fusion site on the subgenomic DI RNAs. Sequence analysis demonstrated that all subgenomic DI RNAs analyzed contained two pentanucleotide sequences; the first sequence seemed to be contributed by the leader, and the leader-body fusion most likely took place at either the first or the second nucleotide of the second sequence. This observation was not consistent with the proposed coronavirus transcription model (S. C. Baker and M. M. C. Lai, EMBO J. 9:4173-4179, 1990) which states that nucleotide mismatch can be corrected by RNA polymerase proofreading activity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.216971047,-0.07426532799999999,-0.03062815,0.022631834,0.094302174,-0.156659991,-0.249285457,0.073316941,-0.018387953999999998,-0.1175271,-0.033086563,-0.13339674599999998,0.071467726,-0.013908166999999999,0.205218082,0.20877918199999998,-0.251630327,0.14745487300000001,-0.028589222999999997,-0.03651068,0.108184404,-0.06486015099999999,0.10477001400000001,0.060741897999999996,0.12599073800000002,0.1028012,0.031564438,-0.018098391999999998,0.103834606,-0.033282308999999996
1705,RNA recombination in a coronavirus: recombination between viral genomic RNA and transfected RNA fragments.,"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus, has been shown to undergo a high frequency of RNA recombination both in tissue culture and in animal infection. So far, RNA recombination has been demonstrated only between genomic RNAs of two coinfecting viruses. To understand the mechanism of RNA recombination and to further explore the potential of RNA recombination, we studied whether recombination could occur between a replicating MHV RNA and transfected RNA fragments. We first used RNA fragments which represented the 5' end of genomic-sense sequences of MHV RNA for transfection. By using polymerase chain reaction amplification with two specific primers, we were able to detect recombinant RNAs which incorporated the transfected fragment into the 5' end of the viral RNA in the infected cells. Surprisingly, even the anti-genomic-sense RNA fragments complementary to the 5' end of MHV genomic RNA could also recombine with the MHV genomic RNAs. This observation suggests that RNA recombination can occur during both positive- and negative-strand RNA synthesis. Furthermore, the recombinant RNAs could be detected in the virion released from the infected cells even after several passages of virus in tissue culture cells, indicating that these recombinant RNAs represented functional virion RNAs. The crossover sites of these recombinants were detected throughout the transfected RNA fragments. However, when an RNA fragment with a nine-nucleotide (CUUUAUAAA) deletion immediately downstream of a pentanucleotide (UCUAA) repeat sequence in the leader RNA was transfected into MHV-infected cells, most of the recombinants between this RNA and the MHV genome contained crossover sites near this pentanucleotide repeat sequence. In contrast, when exogenous RNAs with the intact nine-nucleotide sequence were used in similar experiments, the crossover sites of recombinants in viral genomic RNA could be detected at more-downstream sites. This study demonstrated that recombination can occur between replicating MHV RNAs and RNA fragments which do not replicate, suggesting the potential of RNA recombination for genetic engineering.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.277760285,-0.066310151,-0.05820013,0.129974428,0.076906613,-0.188592825,-0.151440186,0.061471937000000004,-0.061813278,-0.009965349,0.063777534,-0.084132724,0.036529039,0.053866751,0.13229801800000002,0.148170165,-0.173774271,0.065734928,-0.011852713999999999,-0.012714851999999999,0.046263069000000004,-0.020857733,0.06718532,0.03640641,0.021989057000000003,0.036514675,0.026472445,-0.00907564,-0.075238365,0.042735604
1706,Coronavirus mRNA transcription: UV light transcriptional mapping studies suggest an early requirement for a genomic-length template.,"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) synthesizes seven to eight mRNAs, each of which contains a leader RNA derived from the 5' end of the genome. To understand the mechanism of synthesis of these mRNAs, we studied how the synthesis of each mRNA was affected by UV irradiation at different time points after infection. When MHV-infected cells were UV irradiated at a late time in infection (5 h postinfection), the syntheses of the various mRNAs were inhibited to different extents in proportion to the sizes of the mRNAs. Analysis of the UV inactivation kinetics revealed that the UV target size of each mRNA was equivalent to its own physical size. In contrast, when cells were irradiated at 2.5 or 3 h postinfection, there appeared to be two different kinetics of inhibition of mRNA synthesis: the synthesis of every mRNA was inhibited to the same extent by a small UV dose, but the remaining mRNA synthesis was inhibited by additional UV doses at different rates for different mRNAs in proportion to RNA size. The analysis of the UV inactivation kinetics indicated that the UV target sizes for the majority of mRNAs were equivalent to that of the genomic-size RNA early in the infection. These results suggest that MHV mRNA synthesis requires the presence of a genomic-length RNA template at least early in the infection. In contrast, later in the infection, the sizes of the templates used for mRNA synthesis were equivalent to the physical sizes of each mRNA. The possibility that the genomic-length RNA required early in the infection was used only for the synthesis of a polymerase rather than as a template for mRNA synthesis was ruled out by examining the UV sensitivity of a defective interfering (DI) RNA. We found that the UV target size for the DI RNA early in infection was much smaller than that for mRNAs 6 and 7, which are approximately equal to or smaller in size than the DI RNA. This result indicates that even though DI RNA and viral mRNAs are synthesized by the same polymerase, mRNAs are synthesized from a larger (genomic-length) template. We conclude that a genomic-length RNA template is required for MHV subgenomic mRNA synthesis at least early in infection.

1707,Identification and characterization of a coronavirus packaging signal.,"Previously, a mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genomic sequence necessary for defective interfering (DI) RNA packaging into MHV particles (packaging signal) was mapped to within a region of 1,480 nucleotides in the MHV polymerase gene by comparison of two DI RNAs. One of these, DIssF, is 3.6 kb in size and exhibits efficient packaging, whereas the other, DIssE, which is 2.3 kb, does not. For more precise mapping, a series of mutant DIssF RNAs with deletions within this 1,480-nucleotide region were constructed. After transfection of in vitro-synthesized mutant DI RNA in MHV-infected cells, the virus product was passaged several times. The efficiency of DI RNA packaging into MHV virions was then estimated by viral homologous interference activity and by analysis of intracellular virus-specific RNAs and virion RNA. The results indicated that an area of 190 nucleotides was necessary for packaging. A computer-generated secondary structural analysis of the A59 and JHM strains of MHV demonstrated that within this 190-nucleotide region a stable stem-loop of 69 nucleotides was common between the two viruses. A DIssE-derived DI DNA which had these 69 nucleotides inserted into the DIssE sequence demonstrated efficient DI RNA packaging. Site-directed mutagenic analysis showed that of these 69 nucleotides, the minimum sequence of the packaging signal was 61 nucleotides and that destruction of the secondary structure abolished packaging ability. These studies demonstrated that an MHV packaging signal was present within the 61 nucleotides, which are located on MHV genomic RNA 1,381 to 1,441 nucleotides upstream of the 3' end of gene 1.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.198952045,-0.073538545,-0.025143485,0.024539428999999998,0.063384916,-0.134022965,-0.19560702100000002,0.054522149000000006,-0.014704651000000001,-0.088929471,-0.036471325,-0.10124753,0.054202652999999996,-0.02645595,0.156314647,0.162147004,-0.194396354,0.124845502,-0.0016442689999999999,-0.020949628999999997,0.075176075,-0.057123256,0.098335685,0.064395156,0.130214831,0.134409003,0.00955907,-0.032201053,0.035319681,-0.019485597
1708,Repair and mutagenesis of the genome of a deletion mutant of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus by targeted RNA recombination.,"The genetic characterization of a nucleocapsid (N) protein mutant of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is described. The mutant, Albany 4 (Alb4), is both temperature sensitive and thermolabile. Analysis of the progeny of a mixed infection showed that the defective Alb4 allele is recessive to wild type, and its gene product is diffusible. The N protein of Alb4 was found to be smaller than its wild-type counterpart, and sequence analysis of the Alb4 N gene revealed that it contains an internal deletion of 87 nucleotides, producing an in-frame deletion of 29 amino acids. All of these properties of Alb4 made it ideal for use as a recipient in a targeted RNA recombination experiment in which the deletion in Alb4 was repaired by recombination with synthetic RNA7, the smallest MHV subgenomic mRNA. Progeny from a cotransfection of Alb4 genomic RNA and synthetic RNA7 were selected for thermal stability. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of candidate recombinants showed that they had regained the material that is deleted in the Alb4 mutant. They also had acquired a five-nucleotide insertion in the 3' untranslated region, which had been incorporated into the synthetic RNA7 as a molecular tag. The presence of the tag was directly verified, as well, by sequencing the genomic RNA of purified recombinant viruses. This provided a clear genetic proof that the Alb4 phenotype was due to the observed deletion in the N gene. In addition, these results demonstrated that it is possible to obtain stable, independently replicating progeny from recombination between coronavirus genomic RNA and a tailored, synthetic RNA species.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.190461973,-0.041372736,-0.009476948,0.007611252,0.088373428,-0.07053250700000001,-0.101052567,0.025939381,-0.013128701999999999,-0.018198947,-0.023676493,-0.028561423,0.028179041000000002,-0.036357008999999996,0.018829376000000002,0.021635872999999996,-0.070850888,0.019504665,-0.028584184,0.004132688,0.068626689,-0.037121289,0.051277357999999995,0.06813894200000001,0.006194814,0.038177108,0.035608142,-0.032536602000000005,-0.068255213,0.016384008999999998
1709,Translational frameshifting mediated by a viral sequence in plant cells.,"It has been proposed that the polymerase gene of barley yellow dwarf virus and related viruses is expressed by a ribosomal frameshift event during translation. The 5' end of this gene overlaps with the 3' end of an upstream gene that is in a different reading frame. The region of overlap is similar to sequences in retro- and coronaviruses that are known to express their polymerase genes by frameshifting. This overlap region includes a ""shifty"" heptanucleotide, followed by a highly structured region that may contain a pseudoknot. Sequences of 115 or 144 base pairs that span this region from barley yellow dwarf virus (PAV serotype) genomic RNA were introduced into a plasmid, so that a reporter gene could be expressed in plant cells only if a minus one (-1) frameshift event occurred. Frameshifting was detected at a rate of approximately 1%. This frameshifting was abolished when the stop codon at the 3' end of the upstream open reading frame was deleted. A sequence expected to form a strong stem-loop immediately upstream of the frameshift site was unnecessary for frameshifting, and initiation at AUG codons within the stem-loop appeared to be inhibited. Like viruses that infect hosts in other kingdoms, plant viruses also can induce frameshifting in translation of their genes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.160862602,-0.060120122000000005,-0.0029241370000000003,-0.019102252,0.121114885,-0.055841468,-0.12974138,0.024916812000000003,0.014464296000000001,-0.07102776599999999,-0.133739608,-0.046791735999999994,0.047531277999999996,-0.104521542,-0.060958095999999996,-0.066924394,0.047353518,-0.001856465,-0.00036928199999999997,-0.034151493,-0.004885101,-0.038736869,-0.081797909,0.085493082,-0.11722028699999999,-0.101201002,-0.019429188,0.033912572,0.10628207099999999,-0.120103269
1710,Ribosomal frameshifting in plants: a novel signal directs the -1 frameshift in the synthesis of the putative viral replicase of potato leafroll luteovirus.,"The 5.8 kb RNA genome of potato leafroll luteovirus (PLRV) contains two overlapping open reading frames, ORF2a and ORF2b, which are characterized by helicase and RNA polymerase motifs, respectively, and possibly represent the viral replicase. Within the overlap, ORF2b lacks an AUG translational start codon and is therefore presumably translated by -1 ribosomal frameshifting as a transframe protein with ORF2a. This hypothesis was studied by introducing the putative frameshift region into an internal position of the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene and testing for the occurrence of frameshifting in vivo by transient expression of GUS activity in potato protoplasts as well as in vitro by translation in the reticulocyte system. Both experimental approaches demonstrate that a -1 frameshift occurs at a frequency of approximately 1%. Site-directed mutagenesis identified the frameshift region and the involvement of the novel heptanucleotide motif UUUAAAU in conjunction with an adjacent stem-loop structure. Part of this stem-loop encodes a basic region in the ORF2b moiety of the transframe protein which was shown by binding experiments with PLRV RNA to represent a nucleic acid-binding domain. These data support a possible biological significance of the frameshift to occur at this position of the large overlap by including the putative RNA template-binding site of the PLRV replicase in the ORF2a/ORF2b transframe protein.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.221158508,-0.05528757,-0.046626402000000004,0.02232349,0.021854941,-0.09065648400000001,-0.091201769,0.026570247,0.000814189,-0.061513769,-0.092301398,0.019320846000000003,0.026943321,-0.124928082,-0.102727375,-0.088075691,0.093645799,-0.005786843000000001,-0.020662824,-0.029884607999999997,-0.05204542,-0.043820747,-0.067021595,-0.015505676999999999,-0.034349565,-0.031153377000000003,-0.031533099,0.024625098999999998,0.078220415,-0.080381581

A complete cDNA copy of a 344-base DI RNA (DI RNA G) was cloned downstream from a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Transcripts synthesized in vitro were infectious when inoculated with helper virus on turnip plants. Studies of the infectivity of DI transcripts containing deletions, insertions, and single-base changes suggest that (i) in general, only the 5' two-thirds of the molecule can tolerate mutations; (ii) between 52 and 67 bases of terminal 5' sequence are required for infectivity; (iii) nucleotides in positions 68 to 138 are not specifically involved in RNA infectivity; (iv) DI RNA G molecules smaller than 327 bases are not amplified efficiently in plants.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.196079805,-0.07374560200000001,-0.043517470999999995,0.070789118,0.032566374,-0.135550626,-0.151312525,0.060560094,-0.039777141,-0.048960127,0.034243697000000003,-0.102138229,0.024564266,0.018354775,0.18071178699999998,0.189809013,-0.20480594100000002,0.099298766,-0.00855012,-0.024579637,0.05488419,-0.039437887000000005,0.07074267599999999,0.009821877,0.034742525,0.060179681,0.01230939,-0.012105828,0.079354957,-0.031119967999999998
1716,A domain at the 3' end of the polymerase gene is essential for encapsidation of coronavirus defective interfering RNAs.,"Two murine hepatitis virus strain A59 defective interfering (DI) RNAs were generated by undiluted virus passages. The DI RNAs were encapsidated efficiently. The smallest DI particle, DI-a, contained a 5.5-kb RNA consisting of the following three noncontiguous regions from the MHV-A59 genome, which were joined in frame: the 5'-terminal 3.9 kb, a 798-nucleotide fragment from the 3' end of the polymerase gene, and the 3'-terminal 805 nucleotides. A full-length cDNA clone of the DI-a genome was constructed and cloned downstream of the bacteriophage T7 promoter. Transcripts derived from this clone, pMIDI, were used for transfection of MHV-A59-infected cells and found to be amplified and packaged. Deletion analysis of pMIDI allowed us to identify a 650-nucleotide region derived from the 3' end of the second open reading frame of the polymerase gene that was required for efficient encapsidation.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.20698052,-0.075436362,-0.02058532,0.001609806,0.093279705,-0.139258826,-0.269961065,0.048830125,0.0076527140000000006,-0.104595433,-0.067506663,-0.149902407,0.081113241,-0.030956781000000003,0.196181081,0.177026073,-0.230805746,0.140721983,0.006728545,-0.014149943,0.097877625,-0.056069522000000004,0.12679925,0.04755452,0.116662984,0.144739215,0.037852627,-0.047098558,0.043269046,-0.005760259
1717,Identification of polypeptides encoded in open reading frame 1b of the putative polymerase gene of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus A59.,"The polypeptides encoded in open reading frame (ORF) 1b of the mouse hepatitis virus A59 putative polymerase gene of RNA 1 were identified in the products of in vitro translation of genome RNA. Two antisera directed against fusion proteins containing sequences encoded in portions of the 3'-terminal 2.0 kb of ORF 1b were used to immunoprecipitate p90, p74, p53, p44, and p32 polypeptides. These polypeptides were clearly different in electrophoretic mobility, antiserum reactivity, and partial protease digestion pattern from viral structural proteins and from polypeptides encoded in the 5' end of ORF 1a, previously identified by in vitro translation. The largest of these polypeptides had partial protease digestion patterns similar to those of polypeptides generated by in vitro translation of a synthetic mRNA derived from the 3' end of ORF 1b. The polypeptides encoded in ORF 1b accumulated more slowly during in vitro translation than polypeptides encoded in ORF 1a. This is consistent with the hypothesis that translation of gene A initiates at the 5' end of ORF 1a and that translation of ORF 1b occurs following a frameshift at the ORF 1a-ORF 1b junction. The use of in vitro translation of genome RNA and immunoprecipitation with antisera directed against various regions of the polypeptides encoded in gene A should make it possible to study synthesis and processing of the putative coronavirus polymerase.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.16679650599999998,-0.056569059000000005,-0.02826603,-0.022467475,0.053217837999999996,-0.068618946,-0.137184246,0.022308756000000003,0.028907796,-0.060124795999999994,-0.10824694300000001,-0.043792887999999995,0.050825535,-0.091454574,-0.040662329,-0.073791102,0.06936478,0.013212745,0.046620330999999994,0.018908952,-0.044834027,0.0072007419999999996,-0.048917515,-0.010963966,-0.025827877000000003,-0.006579301,0.011237698999999999,-0.052669923,-0.00436184,-0.037861964
1718,Equine arteritis virus is not a togavirus but belongs to the coronaviruslike superfamily.,"The nucleotide sequence of the genome of equine arteritis virus (EAV) was determined from a set of overlapping cDNA clones and was found to contain eight open reading frames (ORFs). ORFs 2 through 7 are expressed from six 3'-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs, which are transcribed from the 3'-terminal quarter of the viral genome. A number of these ORFs are predicted to encode structural EAV proteins. The organization and expression of the 3' part of the EAV genome are remarkably similar to those of coronaviruses and toroviruses. The 5'-terminal three-quarters of the genome contain the putative EAV polymerase gene, which also shares a number of features with the corresponding gene of corona- and toroviruses. The gene contains two large ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, with an overlap region of 19 nucleotides. The presence of a ""shifty"" heptanucleotide sequence in this region and a downstream RNA pseudoknot structure indicate that ORF1b is probably expressed by ribosomal frameshifting. The frameshift-directing potential of the ORF1a/ORF1b overlap region was demonstrated by using a reporter gene. Moreover, the predicted ORF1b product was found to contain four domains which have been identified in the same relative positions in coronavirus and torovirus ORF1b products. The sequences of the EAV and coronavirus ORF1a proteins were found to be much more diverged. The EAV ORF1a product contains a putative trypsinlike serine protease motif. Our data indicate that EAV, presently considered a togavirus, is evolutionarily related to viruses from the coronaviruslike superfamily.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.165039644,-0.03869445,-0.026880875,-0.030441465,0.11090716099999999,-0.060885199,-0.129746895,0.014964037,0.022713042000000003,-0.065750392,-0.13026862,-0.014334501999999999,0.07063182900000001,-0.138790016,-0.074092016,-0.115508594,0.10881430800000001,0.000583278,0.019976284,-0.00786572,-0.034339744,-0.018053907,-0.062297017999999996,-0.00069343,-0.056846347,-0.008748808,0.01428831,-0.010247331,0.024264717999999998,-0.078284428
1719,Translational frameshifting in the Escherichia coli dnaX gene in vitro.,"Production of the gamma subunit of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is dependent on a very efficient translational frameshif in the dnaX gene. I used an E. coli in vitro translation system to analyze the mechanism of this frameshifting event. In this system, gamma was produced almost to the same extent as the inframe translation product, tau, suggesting that efficient frameshifting was reproduced in vitro. Coupling with transcription was not necessary for frameshifting. Addition of purified tau or gamma had no effect on the frameshifting process suggesting the absence of direct feedback regulation. By use of mutant genes, a strong pausing site was identified at or very close to the frameshift site. This pausing was apparently caused by a potential stem-loop structure which was previously shown to enhance frameshifting. Thus, enhancement of frameshifting by this putative stem-loop seems to be mediated by the translation pausing at the frameshift site. Despite the apparent structural similarity of the dnaX frameshift site to that of the eukaryotic retroviral genes, dnaX mRNA synthesized in vitro failed to direct the production of gamma in eukaryotic translation systems. This suggests that frameshifting in the dnaX gene depends on components specific to the E. coli translation system.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14041030699999998,-0.048489193,0.006344258,-0.057950417000000004,-0.009296648000000001,-0.018463593,-0.057430695,0.0032830890000000003,0.031326174,-0.06562962900000001,-0.110965017,-0.0054526390000000004,0.012721327,-0.087349829,-0.074313079,-0.033449912000000005,0.050479897999999995,-0.012920598,-0.040096616,-0.040370073,-0.021650129,-0.039258065,-0.06498689099999999,0.030736017999999997,-0.042491454000000005,-0.08111595,-0.056387115,0.036984302999999996,0.12095776300000001,-0.103979758
1720,Analysis of efficiently packaged defective interfering RNAs of murine coronavirus: localization of a possible RNA-packaging signal.,"We have previously shown that most of the defective interfering (DI) RNA of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) are not packaged into virions. We have now identified, after 21 serial undiluted passages of MHV, a small DI RNA, DIssF, which is efficiently packaged into virions. The DIssF RNA replicated at a high efficiency on its transfection into the helper virus-infected cells. The virus released from the transfected cells interfered strongly with mRNA synthesis and growth of helper virus. cDNA cloning and sequence analysis of DIssF RNA revealed that it is 3.6 kb and consists of sequences derived from five discontinuous regions of the genome of the nondefective virus. The first four regions (domains I to IV) from the 5' end are derived from gene 1, which presumably encodes the RNA polymerase of the nondefective virus. The entire domain I (859 nucleotides) and the first 750 nucleotides of domain II are also present in a previously characterized DI RNA, DIssE, which is not efficiently packaged into virions. Furthermore, the junction between these two domains is identical between the two DI RNAs. The remaining 77 nucleotides at the 3' end of domain II and all of domains III (655 nucleotides) and IV (770 nucleotides) are not present in DIssE RNA. These four domains are derived from gene 1. In contrast, the 3'-most domain (domain V, 447 nucleotides) is derived from the 3' end of the genomic RNA and is also present in DIssE. The comparison of primary sequences and packaging properties between DIsse and DIssF RNAs suggested that domains III and IV and part of the 3' end of domain II contain the packaging signal for MHV RNA. This conclusion was confirmed by inserting these DIssF-unique sequences into a DIssE cDNA construct; the in vitro-transcribed RNA from this hybrid construct was efficiently packaged into virion particles. DIssF RNA also contains an open reading frame, which begins from domain I and ends at the 5'-end 20 bases of domain III. In vitro translation of DIssF RNA and metabolic labeling of the virus-infected cells showed that this open reading frame is indeed translated into a 75-kDa protein. The structures of both DIssE and DIssF RNAs suggest that a protein-encoding capability is a common characteristic of MHV DI RNA.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.24313660899999998,-0.074696137,-0.058111780999999994,0.057305855999999995,0.058935804,-0.140529722,-0.19028209100000001,0.048237629000000004,-0.011537363,-0.07538668,-0.030169475,-0.09776393300000001,0.046232975999999995,-0.0036293090000000003,0.11023575699999999,0.11005962,-0.11697583,0.080548614,0.011698525,-0.003981387,0.041284437,-0.023738085,0.072353885,-0.004245518,0.088738555,0.09798853800000001,0.015432163,-0.009443617,0.036131115,-0.012397766999999999
1721,"In vitro processing of dengue virus type 2 nonstructural proteins NS2A, NS2B, and NS3.","We have tested the hypothesis that the flavivirus nonstructural protein NS3 is a viral proteinase that generates the termini of several nonstructural proteins by using an efficient in vitro expression system and monospecific antisera directed against the nonstructural proteins NS2B and NS3. A series of cDNA constructs was transcribed by using T7 RNA polymerase, and the RNA was translated in reticulocyte lysates. The resulting protein patterns indicated that proteolytic processing occurred in vitro to generate NS2B and NS3. The amino termini of NS2B and NS3 produced in vitro were found to be the same as the termini of NS2B and NS3 isolated from infected cells. Deletion analysis of cDNA constructs localized the protease domain within NS3 to the first 184 amino acids but did not eliminate the possibility that sequences within NS2B were also required for proper cleavage. Kinetic analysis of processing events in vitro and experiments to examine the sensitivity of processing to dilution suggested that an intramolecular cleavage between NS2A and NS2B preceded an intramolecular cleavage between NS2B and NS3. The data from these expression experiments confirm that NS3 is the viral proteinase responsible for cleavage events generating the amino termini of NS2B and NS3 and presumably for cleavages generating the termini of NS4A and NS5 as well.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.116704524,-0.044195144000000006,-0.013828093999999999,-0.047375188,-0.031595327,-0.005140546,-0.017405808000000002,-0.011174215,0.024145174,-0.03330389,-0.041355868999999996,0.015836531,-0.00426202,-0.019607718,-0.01920927,-0.026396719,0.041383922000000004,0.0038654809999999996,0.032016201,-0.007897259,-0.020718168000000002,0.00731325,-0.00394394,-0.033370124,0.042162529000000004,0.06511524099999999,-0.002504456,-0.009052361,-0.03358768,0.009280315
1722,The carboxyl-terminal part of the putative Berne virus polymerase is expressed by ribosomal frameshifting and contains sequence motifs which indicate that toro- and coronaviruses are evolutionarily related.,"Sequence analysis of the 3' part (8 kb) of the polymerase gene of the torovirus prototype Berne virus (BEV) revealed that this area contains at least two open reading frames (provisionally designated ORF1a and ORF1b) which overlap by 12 nucleotides. The complete sequence of ORF1b (6873 nucleotides) was determined. Like the coronaviruses, BEV was shown to express its ORF1b by ribosomal frameshifting during translation of the genomic RNA. The predicted tertiary RNA structure (a pseudoknot) in the toro- and coronaviral frameshift-directing region is similar. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of the predicted BEV ORF1b translation product revealed homology with the ORF1b product of coronaviruses. Four conserved domains were identified: the putative polymerase domain, an area containing conserved cysteine and histidine residues, a putative helicase motif, and a domain which seems to be unique for toro- and coronaviruses. The data on the 3' part of the polymerase gene of BEV supplement previously observed similarities between toro- and coronaviruses at the level of genome organization and expression.

1724,The primary structure and expression of the second open reading frame of the polymerase gene of the coronavirus MHV-A59; a highly conserved polymerase is expressed by an efficient ribosomal frameshifting mechanism.,Sequence analysis of a substantial part of the polymerase gene of the murine coronavirus MHV-A59 revealed the 3' end of an open reading frame (ORF1a) overlapping with a large ORF (ORF1b; 2733 amino acids) which covers the 3' half of the polymerase gene. The expression of ORF1b occurs by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism since the ORF1a/ORF1b overlapping nucleotide sequence is capable of inducing ribosomal frameshifting in vitro as well as in vivo. A stem-loop structure and a pseudoknot are predicted in the nucleotide sequence involved in ribosomal frameshifting. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of MHV ORF1b with the amino acid sequence deduced from the corresponding gene of the avian coronavirus IBV demonstrated that in contrast to the other viral genes this ORF is extremely conserved.

1726,Translational frameshifting generates the gamma subunit of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme.,"The dnaX gene (previously called dnaZX) of Escherichia coli has only one open reading frame for a 71-kDa polypeptide from which two distinct DNA polymerase III holoenzyme subunits, tau (71 kDa) and gamma (47 kDa), are produced. To determine how the gamma subunit is generated, we examined the influence of mutations in the dnaX gene on the pattern of tau and gamma production in overproducing cells. Important structural elements in dnaX mRNA include a stretch of six adenines (nucleotides 1425-1430), a stable hairpin structure (nucleotides 1437-1466), and a UGA stop codon in a -1 frame (nucleotides 1434-1436) between the stretch of adenines and the hairpin structure. Disruption of this stop codon generates a slightly larger gamma subunit, indicative of the use of a -1 stop codon farther downstream (nucleotides 1470-1472). These results suggest that a -1 frameshift during translation allows the use of this UGA codon to terminate translation of the gamma polypeptide. The amino acid composition, sequence, and mass spectra of a C-terminal peptide from mild digestion of the purified gamma protein with endoproteinase Lys-C confirms that this frameshift occurs at either of the two lysine codons in the region of the adenine stretch. Remarkable features of this frameshifting are its high frequency (i.e., about 80% in an overproducing cell) and the striking structural similarity to the frameshifting signal responsible for expression of the pol and pro genes in many retroviruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.142905005,-0.053465173,-0.010950521999999999,-0.076090945,0.020804543,-0.029005517999999997,-0.090537848,0.0049151870000000005,0.032057007,-0.077772438,-0.110892083,-0.016065985,0.02922724,-0.115121907,-0.066115413,-0.049558719,0.045222640999999994,-0.018351949,-0.024205179,-0.038719987000000004,0.002798428,-0.039506672,-0.040130235,0.022865647000000003,-0.045997236,-0.044266294000000005,-0.015047878999999998,-0.006598572,0.088942334,-0.084810985
1727,Specificities involved in the initiation of retroviral plus-strand DNA.,"Reverse transcription of the retroviral RNA genome begins with tRNA-primed synthesis of a minus-strand DNA, which subsequently acts as the template for the synthesis of plus-strand DNA. This plus-strand DNA is initiated at a unique location and makes use of a purine-rich RNA oligonucleotide derived by RNase H action on the viral RNA. To determine the variables that are relevant to successful specific initiation of plus-strand DNA synthesis, we have used nucleic acid sequences from the genome of Rous sarcoma virus along with three different sources of RNase H: avian myeloblastosis virus DNA polymerase, murine leukemia virus DNA polymerase, and the RNase H of Escherichia coli. Our findings include evidence that specificity is controlled not only by the nucleic acid sequences but also by the RNase H. For example, while the avian reverse transcriptase efficiently and specifically initiates on the sequences of the avian retrovirus, the murine reverse transcriptase initiates specifically but at a location 4 bases upstream of the correct site.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.148434722,-0.036096169,0.029455428999999998,0.061537554,-0.018195897,-0.041625415,-0.021291374,0.024638867000000002,-0.026227715,0.020780596999999998,0.016429827,-0.013753157,0.031129017000000002,-0.039236435,0.000475854,0.071890171,-0.03980451,0.00360735,-0.022258259,-0.005576433,-0.062309585,0.000888499,-0.049463744000000004,-0.041974139,-0.045202492000000004,-0.08435822400000001,-0.117502867,0.054885428,0.000879785,0.041739683
1728,High-frequency leader sequence switching during coronavirus defective interfering RNA replication.,"A system was developed that exploited defective interfering (DI) RNAs of coronavirus to study the role of free leader RNA in RNA replication. A cDNA copy of mouse hepatitis virus DI RNA was placed downstream of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter to generate DI RNAs capable of extremely efficient replication in the presence of a helper virus. We demonstrated that, in the DI RNA-transfected cells, the leader sequence of these DI RNAs was switched to that of the helper virus during one round of replication. This high-frequency leader sequence exchange was not observed if a nine-nucleotide stretch of sequence (UUUAUAAAC) at the junction between the leader and the remaining DI sequence was deleted. This observation suggests that a free leader RNA generated from the genomic RNA of mouse hepatitis virus may participate in the replication of DI RNA.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.246486272,-0.086795101,-0.061756125999999995,0.09813114099999999,0.048209169,-0.179972153,-0.21335648399999999,0.079524347,-0.041423584,-0.080987807,0.03016828,-0.151540084,0.054268779,0.039165454,0.24084834,0.260506205,-0.277035443,0.15145745,0.01808734,-0.007003706,0.080701144,-0.040926257,0.100677818,0.008963812,0.10737789800000001,0.090427354,0.017376048,-0.023226115,0.093910261,-0.018241181999999998
1730,Overlapping genes in a yeast double-stranded RNA virus.,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae viruses have a large viral double-stranded RNA which encodes the major viral capsid polypeptide. We have previously shown that this RNA (L1) also encodes a putative viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (D. F. Pietras, M. E. Diamond, and J. A. Bruenn, Nucleic Acids Res., 16:6226, 1988). The organization and expression of the viral genome is similar to that of the gag-pol region of the retroviruses. The complete sequence of L1 demonstrates two large open reading frames on the plus strand which overlap by 129 bases. The first is the gene for the capsid polypeptide, and the second is the gene for the putative RNA polymerase. One of the products of in vitro translation of the denatured viral double-stranded RNA is a polypeptide of the size expected of a capsid-polymerase fusion protein, resulting from a -1 frameshift within the overlapping region. A polypeptide of the size expected for a capsid-polymerase fusion product was found in virions, and it was recognized in Western blots (immunoblots) by antibodies to a synthetic peptide derived from the predicted polymerase sequence.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.224975728,-0.069749924,-0.053118244,0.066783707,0.053328716,-0.114759573,-0.097114536,0.032589232,-0.014947971000000001,-0.010699028000000001,-0.055129400999999995,-0.039519683,0.049315642,-0.066018614,-0.033893616,-0.083964328,0.051841406,0.000411422,0.013567787,0.006599428,-0.056107332999999995,0.025989127,-0.077343532,-0.008816395,-0.071955692,-0.049342604000000005,0.009573945,-0.028555895,-0.014858496,0.015247385
1731,Identification of a domain required for autoproteolytic cleavage of murine coronavirus gene A polyprotein.,"The 5'-most gene of the murine coronavirus genome, gene A, is presumed to encode viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. It has previously been shown that the N-terminal portion of this gene product is cleaved into a protein of 28 kilodaltons (p28). To further understand the mechanism of synthesis of the p28 protein, cDNA clones representing the 5'-most 5.3 kilobases of murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM were sequenced and subcloned into pT7 vectors from which RNAs were transcribed and translated in vitro. The sequence was found to encode a single long open reading frame continuing from near the 5' terminus of the genome. Although p28 is encoded from the first 1 kilobase at the 5' end of the genome, translation of in vitro-transcribed RNAs indicated that this protein was not detected unless the product of the entire 5.3-kilobase region was synthesized. Translation of RNAs of 3.9 kilobases or smaller yielded proteins which contained the p28 sequence, but p28 was not cleaved. This suggests that the sequence in the region between 3.9 and 5.3 kilobases from the 5' end of the genomic RNA is essential for proteolytic cleavage and contains autoproteolytic activity. The p28 protein could not be cleaved from the smaller primary translation products of gene A, even in the presence of the larger autocleaving protein. Cleavage of the p28 protein was inhibited by addition of the protease inhibitor ZnCl2. This study thus identified a protein domain essential for autoproteolytic cleavage of the gene A polyprotein.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.21959615300000002,-0.06535142299999999,-0.041408798,-0.007514501999999999,0.052889247,-0.08780215400000001,-0.15932105900000001,-0.00402543,0.037073509,-0.070178157,-0.11845951699999999,-0.048784072000000005,0.063128908,-0.062165655,-0.040308266,-0.07478045900000001,0.06465966,0.00088014,0.034005424,0.031627748,-0.024627582999999998,0.028424445,-0.00725017,-0.004768397,0.070878395,0.09624551,0.025814529,-0.040106653,-0.015301241,0.035320357000000004
1732,Coronavirus genome: prediction of putative functional domains in the non-structural polyprotein by comparative amino acid sequence analysis.,"Amino acid sequences of 2 giant non-structural polyproteins (F1 and F2) of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of Coronaviridae, were compared, by computer-assisted methods, to sequences of a number of other positive strand RNA viral and cellular proteins. By this approach, juxtaposed putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, nucleic acid binding (""finger""-like) and RNA helicase domains were identified in F2. Together, these domains might constitute the core of the protein complex involved in the primer-dependent transcription, replication and recombination of coronaviruses. In F1, two cysteine protease-like domains and a growth factor-like one were revealed. One of the putative proteases of IBV is similar to 3C proteases of picornaviruses and related enzymes of como- nepo- and potyviruses. Search of IBV F1 and F2 sequences for sites similar to those cleaved by the latter proteases and intercomparison of the surrounding sequence stretches revealed 13 dipeptides Q/S(G) which are probably cleaved by the coronavirus 3C-like protease. Based on these observations, a partial tentative scheme for the functional organization and expression strategy of the non-structural polyproteins of IBV was proposed. It implies that, despite the general similarity to other positive strand RNA viruses, and particularly to potyviruses, coronaviruses possess a number of unique structural and functional features.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.212422435,-0.043187165,-0.034754244,0.026819523999999997,0.13997531800000002,-0.009981937,-0.10971755,-0.032644586,0.032529296,0.183969966,0.016349697,0.029376792000000002,-0.011491048,-0.042386411,-0.147737994,0.022728294,0.08575955699999999,0.001034047,0.021425267999999997,0.031277122000000004,-0.08285313799999999,-0.011213242,-0.056133802000000003,-0.10626036400000001,0.008822589,0.012534664,-0.022291807,0.024316021,0.005788878000000001,-0.044275645
1733,Sequence and organization of barley yellow dwarf virus genomic RNA.,"The nucleotide sequence of the genomic RNA of barley yellow dwarf virus, PAV serotype was determined, except for the 5'-terminal base, and its genome organization deduced. The 5,677 nucleotide genome contains five large open reading frames (ORFs). The genes for the coat protein (1) and the putative viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were identified. The latter shows a striking degree of similarity to that of carnation mottle virus (CarMV). By comparison with corona- and retrovirus RNAs, it is proposed that a translational frameshift is involved in expression of the polymerase. An ORF encoding an Mr 49,797 protein (50K ORF) may be translated by in-frame readthrough of the coat protein stop codon.

1734,An efficient ribosomal frame-shifting signal in the polymerase-encoding region of the coronavirus IBV.,"The polymerase-encoding region of the genomic RNA of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) contains two very large, briefly overlapping open reading frames (ORF), F1 and F2, and it has been suggested on the basis of sequence analysis that expression of the downstream ORF, F2, might be mediated through ribosomal frame-shifting. To examine this possibility a cDNA fragment containing the F1/F2 overlap region was cloned within a marker gene and placed under the control of the bacteriophage SP6 promoter in a recombinant plasmid. Messenger RNA transcribed from this plasmid, when translated in cell-free systems, specified the synthesis of polypeptides whose size was entirely consistent with the products predicted by an efficient ribosomal frame-shifting event within the overlap region. The nature of the products was confirmed by their reactivity with antisera raised against defined portions of the flanking marker gene.

1735,Sequence and translation of the murine coronavirus 5'-end genomic RNA reveals the N-terminal structure of the putative RNA polymerase.,"A 28-kilodalton protein has been suggested to be the amino-terminal protein cleavage product of the putative coronavirus RNA polymerase (gene A) (M.R. Denison and S. Perlman, Virology 157:565-568, 1987). To elucidate the structure and mechanism of synthesis of this protein, the nucleotide sequence of the 5' 2.0 kilobases of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM genome was determined. This sequence contains a single, long open reading frame and predicts a highly basic amino-terminal region. Cell-free translation of RNAs transcribed in vitro from DNAs containing gene A sequences in pT7 vectors yielded proteins initiated from the 5'-most optimal initiation codon at position 215 from the 5' end of the genome. The sequence preceding this initiation codon predicts the presence of a stable hairpin loop structure. The presence of an RNA secondary structure at the 5' end of the RNA genome is supported by the observation that gene A sequences were more efficiently translated in vitro when upstream noncoding sequences were removed. By comparing the translation products of virion genomic RNA and in vitro transcribed RNAs, we established that our clones encompassing the 5'-end mouse hepatitis virus genomic RNA encode the 28-kilodalton N-terminal cleavage product of the gene A protein.

1736,Initiation and termination of duck hepatitis B virus DNA synthesis during virus maturation.,"We characterized a number of important features of the structure of the cohesive overlap region of the DNA genome of duck hepatitis B virus. The 5'-terminal nucleotide of minus-strand DNA was localized to nucleotide 2537, a G residue within the 12-base repeat sequence DR1. This G residue was shown to be the site of a covalent linkage to a protein, consistent with speculation that this protein is the primer of minus-strand synthesis, which occurs by reverse transcription. The 3' terminus of the minus strand was heterogeneous, being mapped to nucleotides 2530 and 2531, indicating that the minus strand is terminally redundant by seven or eight bases and ends at the putative 5' end of the transcribed RNA template (pregenome) for reverse transcription. We previously demonstrated that the presumptive RNA primer of plus-strand synthesis remains attached to plus-strand DNA during virus maturation; moreover, the sequence of this primer suggested an origin from the 5' end of the pregenome (J.-M. Lien, C. E. Aldrich, and W. S. Mason, J. Virol. 57:229-236, 1986). We show here that over 75% of plus-strand primers are capped, further supporting the idea that these primers are uniquely derived from the 5' end of the pregenome. Finally, we found that seemingly mature duck hepatitis B virus genomes are incomplete by at least 12 bases, in that the 12-base repeat sequence DR2 is not copied into plus-strand DNA during virus maturation. Since DR2 in virion DNA is duplexed with the RNA primer of plus-strand synthesis, it is possible that the failure to make complete plus strands is due to an inability of the viral DNA polymerase to carry out a displacement of the bound RNA primer.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.184970782,-0.057762002,-0.009354679,0.06468745099999999,0.008468154,-0.108134319,-0.075384849,0.0364736,-0.044653226,-0.031050547999999997,0.010685941000000001,0.004131386,0.005486358,-0.033421114,0.003732443,0.051052451,-0.0008092539999999999,0.014174185,-0.004317937,-0.023244165,-0.041912882,0.015357758999999999,-0.046009202,-0.028043158,-0.02561349,-0.097271662,-0.11899596800000001,0.067352245,0.034859605,0.029450287000000002
1737,Translation and processing of mouse hepatitis virus virion RNA in a cell-free system.,"The first event after infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) is presumed to be the synthesis of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from the input genomic RNA. The synthesis and processing of this putative polymerase protein was studied in a cell-free translation system utilizing 60S RNA from MHV-A59 virions. The polypeptide products of this reaction included two major species of 220 and 28 kilodaltons. Kinetics experiments indicated that both p220 and p28 appeared after 60 min of incubation and that protein p28 was synthesized initially as the N-terminal portion of a larger precursor protein. When the cell-free translation products were labeled with N-formyl[35S]methionyl-tRNAi, p28 was the predominant radioactive product, confirming its N-terminal location within a precursor protein. Translation in the presence of the protease inhibitors leupeptin and ZnCl2 resulted in the disappearance of p28 and p220 and the appearance of a new protein, p250. This product, which approached the maximal size predicted for a protein synthesized from genomic RNA, was not routinely detected in the absence of inhibitors even under conditions which optimized the translation reaction for elongation of proteins. Subsequent chelation of ZnCl2 resulted in the partial cleavage of the precursor protein and the reappearance of p28. One-dimensional peptide mapping with Staphylococcus aureus V-8 protease confirmed the precursor-product relationship of p250 and p28. The results show that MHV virion RNA, like many other viral RNAs, is translated into a large polyprotein, which is cleaved soon after synthesis into smaller, presumably functional proteins. This is in marked contrast to the synthesis of other MHV proteins, in which minimal proteolytic processing occurs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.216287216,-0.073382663,-0.056201601,0.0213588,-0.012166003,-0.082393528,-0.112797478,0.012974178999999999,0.021820832000000002,-0.063212824,-0.079511692,-0.058804772000000005,0.048235235999999994,-0.01623675,-0.001729203,-0.013542363,0.03293042,0.023195367,0.042315777,0.045154646,-0.049093301,0.027773804,0.002049489,-0.035894300000000004,0.151965336,0.140488645,-0.006604368,-0.04341437099999999,-0.054510125,0.045414474
1738,Recombination between nonsegmented RNA genomes of murine coronaviruses.,"We have isolated a recombinant virus between the A59 and JHM strains of mouse hepatitis virus, which contain a single species of nonsegmented RNA genome. This recombinant was derived by mixed infection of DBT cells with temperature-sensitive mutants of A59 and JHM at nonpermissive temperature. Viruses recovered at this temperature were screened by oligonucleotide fingerprinting of their genomic RNAs. One recombinant virus, B1, was found to contain mostly A59-derived sequences, but the 3 kilobases at the 5' end of the genomic RNA was derived from JHM. Thus, the crossover point in the B1 genome is located within gene A, which codes for the viral RNA polymerases. The study of the intracellular RNA species of B1 virus revealed that probably all of the virus-specific subgenomic mRNA species contained the body sequences of strain A59 but the leader sequences of JHM. This result indicates that the JHM leader RNA, which differs from the A59 leader RNA, could be fused to the mRNAs of a different virus strain during RNA transcription. Furthermore, B1 virus-infected cells contain an additional subgenomic mRNA species which is transcribed from a new initiation site within gene C, suggesting that the leader RNA could determine the site of initiation for coronavirus mRNAs. These data represent a first report of RNA recombination between viruses, other than picornaviruses, which contain nonsegmented RNA genomes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.214006525,-0.06954936099999999,-0.036168862,0.079793507,0.103665066,-0.09344183199999999,-0.111197911,0.041775306,-0.036823157,-0.031182067999999997,-0.006898527,-0.09364077300000001,0.038484507,0.023496255,0.07349357599999999,0.074110291,-0.091170327,0.037786451,0.0034922509999999996,0.014919356000000002,0.035286443,0.001406381,0.013224501000000001,0.040625572,0.00667272,-0.014407294,0.015465007,0.014638495,0.0045007020000000005,0.054377902

1740,Characterization of two RNA polymerase activities induced by mouse hepatitis virus.,"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity was found in mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59)-infected cells. The enzyme was induced in the infected cells and could not be detected in the MHV-A59 virion. Two peaks of RNA polymerase activity, one early and the other late in infection, were detected. These polymerase activities were in temporal sequence with early and late virus-specific RNA synthesis. Both of them were found to be associated with membrane fractions. There were significant differences in the enzymatic properties of the two polymerases. The early polymerase, but not the late polymerase, could be activated by potassium ions in the absence of magnesium ions and also had a lower optimum pH than the late polymerase. It was therefore probable that the enzymes represent two different species of RNA polymerase and perform different roles in virus-specific RNA synthesis. The effects of cycloheximide on MHV-specific RNA synthesis were determined. Continuous protein synthesis was required for both early and late RNA synthesis and might also be required for shutoff of early RNA synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.22466957,-0.063529523,-0.074008385,0.097104077,-0.025779382000000003,-0.112996199,-0.054268440999999994,0.022959357000000003,-0.026966295,-0.026663492999999996,0.040347188,-0.042737582999999996,0.000366559,0.08555549800000001,0.06505389,0.080852257,-0.054845274000000006,0.016531627,0.030903887999999997,0.016486755,-0.014883094,0.00025611,0.024794696,-0.037634709,0.09921072800000001,0.05456964,-0.04944133,0.011167672,-0.057988587,0.065605249
1741,"Sequence Relationships Between the Genome and the Intracellular RNA Species 1, 3, 6, and 7 of Mouse Hepatitis Virus Strain A59","We have shown by T(1) oligonucleotide fingerprinting that the genome of mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 and its intracellular RNA 1 have identical fingerprints and that RNA 1 and the subgenomic RNAs 3, 6, and 7 contain common sequences. To localize the homologous region between the RNAs, we compared fingerprints of the 3′ terminus of the genome with those of RNA 7. The genome was partially degraded with alkali, and polyadenylate-containing fragments were purified by oligodeoxythymidylate-cellulose chromatography. The fragments were size fractionated by agarose-urea gel electrophoresis, and two pools, x and z, containing 3′-derived fragments of the genome with apparent molecular weights of 0.1 × 10(6) to 0.14 × 10(6) and 0.6 × 10(6) to 0.8 × 10(6), respectively, were further analyzed by RNase T(1) oligonucleotide fingerprinting. Comparison of the fingerprints of RNAs 6 and 7 with those of pools x and z showed that these subgenomic RNAs extend inwards from the 3′ terminus of the genome. The RNA fragments present in pool z were on average slightly larger than RNA 7 as confirmed by the presence in pool z of T(1) oligonucleotide spots specific for RNA 6 but not present in RNA 7. However, two large oligonucleotide spots derived from RNA 7, which were also present in RNAs 1, 3, and 6 and in the virion RNA, were not found in the T(1) oligonucleotide map of pool z. A possible explanation is that the two spots were derived from a leader sequence. The results of UV transcription mapping experiments (L. Jacobs, W. J. M. Spaan, M. C. Horzinek, and B. A. M. van der Zeijst, J. Virol. 39:401-406, 1981) excluded the possibility that such a leader sequence arises by splicing from a larger precursor molecule, but either a virus-specific RNA primer molecule for the synthesis of mRNAs or an RNA polymerase jumping mechanism could explain the presence of a leader sequence.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.21764415,-0.050063909000000004,-0.027121102999999997,0.084598055,0.06440288599999999,-0.143925714,-0.133478428,0.057148385,-0.05139179,-0.037641537999999995,0.029798084,-0.047843647999999996,0.026040647000000004,0.001549676,0.0785753,0.075985385,-0.092284147,0.054571097,0.016362176000000003,-0.016751794,-0.009510985999999999,0.0056552,0.00907976,-0.004101305,-0.012484695,-0.042037266,0.003190217,0.029485921000000002,0.019385094,0.058737777000000005
1742,RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in coronavirus- infected cells.,"An enzymatic activity which incorporates [3H]UMP into acid-precipitable material in the presence of endogenous template was found in the cytoplasm of porcine cells infected with the transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine. This activity was not found in uninfected control cells, nor was it found in purified virus. The activity was associated with the mitochondrial fraction of infected cells, suggesting that the enzyme is membrane bound. The activity required the presence of all three ribonucleoside triphosphates in addition to [3H]UTP, and it was not inhibited by actinomycin D. The heated product was digested by RNase but not by DNase. Mg2+ was required for enzymatic activity, and its optimal concentration was approximately 5 mM. The size of the in vitro products was compared by electrophoresis with that of in vivo-synthesized virus-specified RNA to confirm the viral specificity of the polymerase activity. Virus-specified RNA from infected cells consisted of 10 species of single-stranded, polyadenylated RNA with molecular weights of 6.8 X 10(6), 6.2 X 10(6), 3.15 X 10(6), 1.40 X 10(6), 1.05 X 10(6), 0.94 X 10(6), 0.66 X 10(6), 0.39 X 10(6), 0.34 X 10(6), and 0.24 X 10(6).

1743,"Design, Synthesis, and Anti-RNA Virus Activity of 6′-Fluorinated-Aristeromycin Analogues","[Image: see text] The 6′-fluorinated aristeromycins were designed as dual-target antiviral compounds aimed at inhibiting both the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the host cell S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) hydrolase, which would indirectly target capping of viral RNA. The introduction of a fluorine at the 6′-position enhanced the inhibition of SAH hydrolase and the activity against RNA viruses. The adenosine and N(6)-methyladenosine analogues 2a–e showed potent inhibition against SAH hydrolase, while only the adenosine derivatives 2a–c exhibited potent antiviral activity against all tested RNA viruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, chikungunya virus, and/or Zika virus. 6′,6′-Difluoroaristeromycin (2c) showed the strongest antiviral effect for MERS-CoV, with a ∼2.5 log reduction in infectious progeny titer in viral load reduction assay. The phosphoramidate prodrug 3a also demonstrated potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity, possibly by inhibiting the viral RdRp.

1747,Identification of a novel base J binding protein complex involved in RNA polymerase II transcription termination in trypanosomes,"Base J, β-D-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil, is a modification of thymine DNA base involved in RNA Polymerase (Pol) II transcription termination in kinetoplastid protozoa. Little is understood regarding how specific thymine residues are targeted for J-modification or the mechanism of J regulated transcription termination. To identify proteins involved in J-synthesis, we expressed a tagged version of the J-glucosyltransferase (JGT) in Leishmania tarentolae, and identified four co-purified proteins by mass spectrometry: protein phosphatase (PP1), a homolog of Wdr82, a potential PP1 regulatory protein (PNUTS) and a protein containing a J-DNA binding domain (named JBP3). Gel shift studies indicate JBP3 is a J-DNA binding protein. Reciprocal tagging, co-IP and sucrose gradient analyses indicate PP1, JGT, JBP3, Wdr82 and PNUTS form a multimeric complex in kinetoplastids, similar to the mammalian PTW/PP1 complex involved in transcription termination via PP1 mediated dephosphorylation of Pol II. Using RNAi and analysis of Pol II termination by RNA-seq and RT-PCR, we demonstrate that ablation of PNUTS, JBP3 and Wdr82 lead to defects in Pol II termination at the 3’-end of polycistronic gene arrays in Trypanosoma brucei. Mutants also contain increased antisense RNA levels upstream of transcription start sites, suggesting an additional role of the complex in regulating termination of bi-directional transcription. In addition, PNUTS loss causes derepression of silent Variant Surface Glycoprotein genes involved in host immune evasion. Our results suggest a novel mechanistic link between base J and Pol II polycistronic transcription termination in kinetoplastids.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14529347,-0.033650001,0.0018501379999999999,-0.033103645,-0.046567467,-0.010549342,0.000146088,-0.009479858,0.021733945,-0.046390337000000004,-0.047903325,-0.0041361290000000005,-0.02072966,0.027896287000000002,-0.046207162,-0.002240447,0.043673513,-0.072717713,-0.08968623099999999,-0.022218609,-0.004023741,0.027976226,-0.041288226000000004,0.0065994090000000005,0.012840233999999999,-0.051453625999999995,-0.021032544,0.026891079,0.044594425,-0.053502583
1748,Evidence for Internal Initiation of RNA Synthesis by the Hepatitis C Virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase NS5B In Cellulo,"Initiation of RNA synthesis by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) NS5B has been extensively studied in vitro and in cellulo. Intracellular replication is thought to rely exclusively on terminal de novo initiation, as it conserves all genetic information of the genome. In vitro, however, additional modes of initiation have been observed. In this study, we aimed to clarify whether the intracellular environment allows for internal initiation of RNA replication by the HCV replicase. We used a dual luciferase replicon harboring a terminal and an internal copy of the viral genomic 5′ untranslated region, which was anticipated to support noncanonical initiation. Indeed, a shorter RNA species was detected by Northern blotting with low frequency, depending on the length and sequence composition upstream of the internal initiation site. By introducing mutations at either site, we furthermore established that internal and terminal initiation shared identical sequence requirements. Importantly, lethal point mutations at the terminal site resulted exclusively in truncated replicons. In contrast, the same mutations at the internal site abrogated internal initiation, suggesting a competitive selection of initiation sites, rather than recombination or template-switching events. In conclusion, our data indicate that the HCV replicase is capable of internal initiation in its natural environment, although functional replication likely requires only terminal initiation. Since many other positive-strand RNA viruses generate subgenomic messenger RNAs during their replication cycle, we surmise that their capability for internal initiation is a common and conserved feature of viral RdRps. IMPORTANCE Many aspects of viral RNA replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) are still poorly understood. The process of RNA synthesis is driven by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) NS5B. Most mechanistic studies on NS5B so far were performed with in vitro systems using isolated recombinant polymerase. In this study, we present a replicon model, which allows the intracellular assessment of noncanonical modes of initiation by the full HCV replicase. Our results add to the understanding of the biochemical processes underlying initiation of RNA synthesis by NS5B by the discovery of internal initiation in cellulo. Moreover, they validate observations made in vitro, showing that the viral polymerase acts very similarly in isolation and in complex with other viral and host proteins. Finally, these observations provide clues about the evolution of RdRps of positive-strand RNA viruses, which might contain the intrinsic ability to initiate internally.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.231305243,-0.078052939,-0.083703413,0.120702356,-0.035719617,-0.099671829,0.000410284,0.050545624000000004,-0.048948893,0.023199302999999998,0.0640493,0.059575558,-0.021058841000000002,0.021988978,-0.017916646,0.002124176,0.015579757,0.082969739,0.131703703,-0.077555586,-0.04461476599999999,-0.001076366,0.034358482999999995,-0.016220598,-0.051947547000000004,-0.057830350999999995,-0.062634898,0.056207256,-0.01639453,-0.005183269
1750,The translational landscape of Zika virus during infection of mammalian and insect cells,"Zika virus is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae, which has recently undergone a rapid expansion among humans in the Western Hemisphere. Here, we report a high-resolution map of ribosomal occupancy of the Zika virus genome during infection of mammalian and insect cells, obtained by ribosome profiling. In contrast to some other flaviviruses such as West Nile, we find no evidence for substantial frameshift-induced ribosomal drop-off during translation of the viral polyprotein, indicating that Zika virus must use alternative mechanisms to downregulate levels of catalytically active viral polymerase. We also show that high levels of ribosome-protected fragments map in-frame to two previously overlooked upstream open reading frames (uORFs) initiating at CUG and UUG codons, with likely consequences for the efficiency of polyprotein expression. Curiously, in African isolates of Zika virus, the two uORFs are fused in-frame into a single uORF. A parallel RNA-Seq analysis reveals the 5' end position of the subgenomic flavivirus RNA in mammalian and insect cells. Together, these provide the first analysis of flavivirus gene expression by ribosome profiling.\n\nAuthor SummaryRecent Zika virus outbreaks have been associated with congenital diseases and neurological complications. An enhanced understanding of the molecular biology of this pathogen may contribute towards the development of improved treatment and control methods. We present a single-codon resolution analysis of Zika virus translation in mammalian and mosquito cells using ribosome profiling. The analysis revealed two hitherto uncharacterized uORFs in the 5' leader of Zika virus Brazilian isolate PE243, both of which are occupied by ribosomes during infection. In contrast, these two uORFs are fused into a single uORF in African isolates.

1751,Proofreading-deficient coronaviruses adapt over long-term passage for increased fidelity and fitness without reversion of exoribonuclease-inactivating mutations,"The coronavirus (CoV) RNA genome is the largest among single-stranded positive sense RNA viruses. CoVs encode a proofreading 3'[-&gt;]5'exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV high-fidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold decreased fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogs. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in parallel with WT-MHV. Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated enhanced replication, reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and increased competitive fitness. However, passage did not select for complete or partial reversion at the ExoN-inactivating mutations. We identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12-RdRp) and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially account for the observed changes in replication, susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and competitive fitness observed in the passaged virus population, indicating that additional determinants can compensate for the activities of nsp14-ExoN. Our results suggest that while selection favors restoration of replication fidelity in ExoN(-) CoVs, there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) reversion. These results also support the hypothesis that high-fidelity replication is linked to CoV fitness and identify additional candidate proteins that may regulate CoV replication fidelity.\n\nIMPORTANCEUnique among RNA viruses, CoVs encode a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) in nsp14 that mediates high-fidelity RNA genome replication. Proofreading-deficient CoVs with disrupted ExoN activity [ExoN(-)] are either non-viable or have significant defects in replication, RNA synthesis, fidelity, fitness, and virulence. In this study, we show that ExoN(-) murine hepatitis virus can adapt over long-term passage for increased replication and fitness without reverting the ExoN-inactivating mutations. Passage-adapted ExoN(-) mutants also demonstrate increasing resistance to nucleoside analogs that is only partially explained by secondary mutations in nsp12 and nsp14. These data suggest that enhanced resistance to nucleoside analogs is mediated by the interplay of multiple replicase proteins and support the proposed link between CoV fidelity and fitness.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.157860318,0.050264628,-0.11488634199999999,0.065897844,-0.019612439,-0.010085965,0.06734683,0.032524111,-0.008070994,0.006989014,0.08246859,0.041770252,-0.082388193,-0.004214937,0.017508656,0.079371864,-0.04832111,-0.021987025,-0.049985279,-0.011859318,0.091207792,-0.08425223800000001,0.148832441,0.114256069,0.05430465,0.136417702,-0.022039378,-0.10100928199999999,-0.09762185699999999,-0.13911443099999998
1753,A speed-fidelity trade-off determines the mutation rate and virulence of an RNA virus,"Mutation rates can evolve through genetic drift, indirect selection due to genetic hitchhiking, or direct selection on the physicochemical cost of high fidelity. However, for many systems, it has been difficult to disentangle the relative impact of these forces empirically. In RNA viruses, an observed correlation between mutation rate and virulence has led many to argue that their extremely high mutation rates are advantageous, because they may allow for increased adaptability. This argument has profound implications, as it suggests that pathogenesis in many viral infections depends on rare or de novo mutations. Here we present data for an alternative model whereby RNA viruses evolve high mutation rates as a byproduct of selection for increased replicative speed. We find that a poliovirus antimutator, 3DG64S, has a significant replication defect and that wild type and 3DG64S populations have similar adaptability in two distinct cellular environments. Experimental evolution of 3DG64S under r-selection led to reversion and compensation of the fidelity phenotype. Mice infected with 3DG64S exhibited delayed morbidity at doses well above the LD50, consistent with attenuation by slower growth as opposed to reduced mutational supply. Furthermore, compensation of the 3DG64S growth defect restored virulence, while compensation of the fidelity phenotype did not. Our data are consistent with the kinetic proofreading model for biosynthetic reactions and suggest that speed is more important than accuracy. In contrast to what has been suggested for many RNA viruses, we find that within host spread is associated with viral replicative speed and not standing genetic diversity.\n\nAuthor SummaryMutation rate evolution has long been a fundamental problem in evolutionary biology. The polymerases of RNA viruses generally lack proofreading activity and exhibit extremely high mutation rates. Since most mutations are deleterious and mutation rates are tuned by natural selection, we asked why hasnt the virus evolved to have a lower mutation rate? We used experimental evolution and a murine infection model to show that RNA virus mutation rates may actually be too high and are not necessarily adaptive. Rather, our data indicate that viral mutation rates are driven higher as a result of selection for viruses with faster replication kinetics. We suggest that viruses have high mutation rates, not because they facilitate adaption, but because it is hard to be both fast and accurate.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.10658449800000001,-0.06210924,-0.049805511,0.07489501400000001,-0.019744809,0.022077312,0.102963052,0.018566304,-0.047568615,0.083052325,0.085738839,0.028171752999999997,-0.035042876,-0.00818961,0.029005782,0.03016836,-0.066871259,-0.07195057,-0.097041826,0.004471027,0.100793256,-0.06380954900000001,0.015910622,0.130064443,-0.110487389,0.014324635,0.069551396,-0.064836908,-0.123704964,-0.116707331
1755,"Changes in mRNA abundance drive differential shuttling of RNA binding proteins, linking cytoplasmic RNA degradation to transcription","Alterations in global mRNA decay broadly impact multiple stages of gene expression, although signals that connect these processes are incompletely defined. Here, we used tandem mass tag labeling coupled with mass spectrometry to reveal that changing the mRNA decay landscape, as frequently occurs during viral infection, results in subcellular redistribution of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in human cells. Accelerating Xrn1-dependent mRNA decay through expression of a gammaherpesviral endonuclease drove nuclear translocation of many RBPs, including poly(A) tail-associated proteins. Conversely, cells lacking Xrn1 exhibited changes in the localization or abundance of numerous factors linked to mRNA turnover. Using these data, we uncovered a new role for relocalized cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein in repressing recruitment of TATA binding protein and RNA polymerase II to promoters. Collectively, our results show that changes in cytoplasmic mRNA decay can directly impact protein localization, providing a mechanism to connect seemingly distal stages of gene expression.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.149893957,-0.060020812,-0.041584999,-0.071051698,-0.08473480000000001,0.004465871,-0.013844773999999999,-0.041125107,0.055970375999999995,-0.059598662000000004,-0.092537547,-0.059672867000000004,0.011991888000000001,0.08696087,-0.05455572400000001,-0.005372351,0.039365099,-0.116499655,-0.072475008,-0.027289643,0.009646099,0.04508565,-0.0069801559999999995,-0.02176382,0.013302745,-0.09435110599999999,-0.028555564,0.03311961,0.10652407400000001,0.0035688459999999997
1756,Origins and Evolution of the Global RNA Virome,"Viruses with RNA genomes dominate the eukaryotic virome, reaching enormous diversity in animals and plants. The recent advances of metaviromics prompted us to perform a detailed phylogenomic reconstruction of the evolution of the dramatically expanded global RNA virome. The only universal gene among RNA viruses is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed an iterative computational procedure that alternates the RdRp phylogenetic tree construction with refinement of the underlying multiple sequence alignments. The resulting tree encompasses 4,617 RNA virus RdRps and consists of 5 major branches, 2 of which include positive-sense RNA viruses, 1 is a mix of positive-sense (+) RNA and double-stranded (ds) RNA viruses, and 2 consist of dsRNA and negative-sense (-) RNA viruses, respectively. This tree topology implies that dsRNA viruses evolved from +RNA viruses on at least two independent occasions, whereas -RNA viruses evolved from dsRNA viruses. Reconstruction of RNA virus evolution using the RdRp tree as the scaffold suggests that the last common ancestors of the major branches of +RNA viruses encoded only the RdRp and a single jelly-roll capsid protein. Subsequent evolution involved independent capture of additional genes, particularly, those encoding distinct RNA helicases, enabling replication of larger RNA genomes and facilitating virus genome expression and virus-host interactions. Phylogenomic analysis reveals extensive gene module exchange among diverse viruses and horizontal virus transfer between distantly related hosts. Although the network of evolutionary relationships within the RNA virome is bound to further expand, the present results call for a thorough reevaluation of the RNA virus taxonomy.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe majority of the diverse viruses infecting eukaryotes have RNA genomes, including numerous human, animal, and plant pathogens. Recent advances of metagenomics have led to the discovery of many new groups of RNA viruses in a wide range of hosts. These findings enable a far more complete reconstruction of the evolution of RNA viruses than what was attainable previously. This reconstruction reveals the relationships between different Baltimore Classes of viruses and indicates extensive transfer of viruses between distantly related hosts, such as plants and animals.

1763,A case for a reverse-frame coding sequence in a group of positive-sense RNA viruses,"Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses form the largest and most diverse group of eukaryote-infecting viruses. Their genomes comprise one or more segments of coding-sense RNA that function directly as messenger RNAs upon release into the cytoplasm of infected cells. Positive-sense RNA viruses are generally accepted to encode proteins solely on the positive strand. However, we previously identified a surprisingly long (~1000 codons) open reading frame (ORF) on the negative strand of some members of the family Narnaviridae which, together with RNA bacteriophages of the family Leviviridae, form a sister group to all other positive-sense RNA viruses. Here, we completed the genomes of three mosquito-associated narnaviruses, all of which have the long reverse-frame ORF. We systematically identified narnaviral sequences in public data sets from a wide range of sources, including arthropod, fungi and plant transcriptomic datasets. Long reverse-frame ORFs are widespread in one clade of narnaviruses, where they frequently occupy >95% of the genome. The reverse-frame ORFs correspond to a specific avoidance of CUA, UUA and UCA codons (i.e. stop codon reverse complements) in the forward-frame RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ORF. However, absence of these codons cannot be explained by other factors such as inability to decode these codons or GC3 bias. Together with other analyses, we provide the strongest evidence yet of coding capacity on the negative strand of a positive-sense RNA virus. As these ORFs comprise some of the longest known overlapping genes, their study may be of broad relevance to understanding overlapping gene evolution and de novo origin of genes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.180878992,-0.051188077,-0.056233362,0.08780503,0.110457523,-0.105123959,-0.083541159,0.07664895099999999,-0.062384539,-0.03108074,-0.00528993,-0.041587399,0.01622959,-0.008328429,0.00853549,-0.03929659,0.021243400000000003,-0.020816198,0.015515956000000001,-0.005285204,-0.074848405,0.021107646,-0.122485321,0.003529915,-0.16140338,-0.100374702,0.029445502999999998,-0.04426695,-0.015785261000000002,-0.07296192900000001
1765,Direct RNA nanopore sequencing of full-length coronavirus genomes provides novel insights into structural variants and enables modification analysis,"Sequence analyses of RNA virus genomes remain challenging due to the exceptional genetic plasticity of these viruses. Because of high mutation and recombination rates, genome replication by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases leads to populations of closely related viruses, so-called quasispecies. Standard (short-read) sequencing technologies are ill-suited to reconstruct large numbers of full-length haplotypes of (i) RNA virus genomes and (ii) subgenome-length (sg) RNAs comprised of noncontiguous genome regions. Here, we used a full-length, direct RNA sequencing (DRS) approach based on nanopores to characterize viral RNAs produced in cells infected with a human coronavirus.\n\nUsing DRS, we were able to map the longest ([~]26 kb) contiguous read to the viral reference genome. By combining Illumina and nanopore sequencing, we reconstructed a highly accurate consensus sequence of the human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E genome (27.3 kb). Furthermore, using long reads that did not require an assembly step, we were able to identify, in infected cells, diverse and novel HCoV-229E sg RNAs that remain to be characterized. Also, the DRS approach, which circumvents reverse transcription and amplification of RNA, allowed us to detect methylation sites in viral RNAs. Our work paves the way for haplotype-based analyses of viral quasispecies by demonstrating the feasibility of intra-sample haplotype separation.\n\nEven though several technical challenges remain to be addressed to exploit the potential of the nanopore technology fully, our work illustrates that direct RNA sequencing may significantly advance genomic studies of complex virus populations, including predictions on long-range interactions in individual full-length viral RNA haplotypes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.18665703,-0.046711195999999996,-0.044810277999999995,0.14285836400000002,0.079766903,-0.105246724,0.013381597,0.036589154,-0.019822543,0.042554090999999995,0.015727959,0.044099239000000005,0.161758218,0.068312289,0.055674702,0.062592915,-0.11535328,-0.00627674,-0.078560113,0.041538622000000004,-0.020506202,0.013700045,-0.018972632,0.011737972,-0.08848579,-0.091838931,0.077039877,0.007968798000000001,-0.05688962,0.056811389000000004
1766,Identification of a Novel Base J Binding Protein Complex Involved in RNA Polymerase II Transcription Termination in Trypanosomes,"Base J, {beta}-D-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil, is a modification of thymine DNA base involved in RNA Polymerase (Pol) II transcription termination in kinetoplastid protozoa. Little is understood regarding how specific thymine residues are targeted for J-modification or the mechanism of J regulated transcription termination. To identify proteins involved in J-synthesis, we expressed a tagged version of the J-glucosyltransferase (JGT) in Leishmania tarentolae, and identified four co-purified proteins by mass spectrometry: protein phosphatase (PP1), a homolog of Wdr82, a potential PP1 regulatory protein (PNUTS) and a protein containing a J-DNA binding domain (named JBP3). Gel shift studies indicate JBP3 is a J-DNA binding protein. Reciprocal tagging, co-IP and sucrose gradient analyses indicate PP1, JGT, JBP3, Wdr82 and PNUTS form a multimeric complex in kinetoplastids, similar to the mammalian PTW/PP1 complex involved in transcription termination via PP1 mediated dephosphorylation of Pol II. Using RNAi and analysis of Pol II termination by RNA-seq and RT-PCR, we demonstrate that ablation of PNUTS, JBP3 and Wdr82 lead to defects in Pol II termination at the 3-end of polycistronic gene arrays in Trypanosoma brucei. Mutants also contain increased antisense RNA levels upstream of promoters, suggesting an additional role of the complex in regulating termination of bi-directional transcription. In addition, PNUTS loss causes derepression of silent Variant Surface Glycoprotein genes important for host immune evasion. Our results provide the first direct mechanistic link between base J and regulation of Pol II termination and suggest a novel molecular model for the role of the CTD of Pol II in terminating polycistronic transcription in trypanosomatids.\n\nAuthor SummaryTrypanosoma brucei is an early-diverged parasitic protozoan that causes African sleeping sickness in humans. The genome of T. brucei is organized into polycistronic gene clusters that contain multiple genes that are co-transcribed from a single promoter. We have recently described the presence of a modified DNA base J and variant of histone H3 (H3.V) at transcription termination sites within gene clusters where the loss of base J and H3.V leads to read-through transcription and the expression of downstream genes. We now identify a novel stable multimeric complex containing a J binding protein (JBP3), base J glucosyltransferase (JGT), PP1 phosphatase, PP1 interactive-regulatory protein (PNUTS) and Wdr82, which we refer to as PJW/PP1. A similar complex (PTW/PP1) has been shown to be involved in Pol II termination in humans and yeast. We demonstrate that PNUTS, JBP3 and Wdr82 mutants lead to read-through transcription in T. brucei. Our data suggest the PJW/PP1 complex regulates termination by recruitment to termination sites via JBP3-base J interactions and dephosphorylation of specific proteins (including Pol II and termination factors) by PP1. These findings significantly expand our understanding of mechanisms underlying transcription termination in eukaryotes, including divergent organisms that utilize polycistronic transcription and novel epigenetic marks such as base J and H3.V. The studies also provide the first direct mechanistic link between J modification of DNA at termination sites and regulated Pol II termination and gene expression in kinetoplastids.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.13319536199999998,-0.034118149,0.0032767679999999998,-0.046159822,-0.038073538999999997,0.003293517,0.004376813,-0.010340468,0.028335777000000003,-0.045394221,-0.060664247000000004,-0.00747191,-0.013100364,0.018180774,-0.045681633,0.003002248,0.029631334,-0.070251413,-0.09463656599999999,-0.025690748,0.006044099,0.02165049,-0.04337704,0.015093213999999999,-0.002147179,-0.059719325999999996,-0.016277327,0.025783167000000003,0.049464031,-0.060026283
1768,RNA-dependent RNA polymerase speed and fidelity are not the only determinants of the mechanism or efficiency of recombination.,"Using the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from poliovirus (PV) as our model system, we have shown that Lys-359 in motif-D functions as a general acid in the mechanism of nucleotidyl transfer. A K359H (KH) RdRp derivative is slow and faithful relative to wild-type enzyme. In the context of the virus, RdRp-coding sequence evolves, selecting for the following substitutions: I331F (IF, motif-C) and P356S (PS, motif-D). We have evaluated IF-KH, PS-KH, and IF-PS-KH viruses and enzymes. The speed and fidelity of each double mutant are equivalent. Each exhibits a unique recombination phenotype, with IF-KH being competent for copy-choice recombination and PS-KH being competent for forced-copy-choice recombination. Although the IF-PS-KH RdRp exhibits biochemical properties within twofold of wild type, the virus is impaired substantially for recombination in cells. We conclude that there are biochemical properties of the RdRp in addition to speed and fidelity that determine the mechanism and efficiency of recombination. The interwoven nature of speed, fidelity, the undefined property suggested here, and recombination makes it impossible to attribute a single property of the RdRp to fitness. However, the derivatives described here may permit elucidation of the importance of recombination on the fitness of the viral population in a background of constant polymerase speed and fidelity.\n\nSignificanceThe availability of a \""universal\"" method to create attenuated viruses for use as vaccine strains would permit a rapid response to outbreaks of newly emerging viruses. Targeting RdRp fidelity has emerged as such a universal approach. However, because polymerase fidelity and speed are inextricably linked, the effort to attribute the attenuated phenotype to a single biochemical property of the RdRp may be futile. Here, we show that this circumstance is even more complex. We provide evidence for the existence of a biochemical parameter that combines with fidelity and speed to govern the mechanism and/or efficiency of recombination. We conclude that the field will be served best by continued emphasis on discovery of manipulatable functions of the RdRp instead of debating the importance of individual properties.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.140980393,-0.036757498,-0.034301457,0.059608093,-0.012705457,-0.004310981,0.08988729599999999,0.017471045,-0.060542835,0.06775214,0.13008862,0.16510329999999998,-0.108819662,-0.09610095199999999,-0.014177551000000002,0.01864748,-0.026563016000000002,-0.07295363099999999,-0.128363654,-0.070940776,0.180048005,-0.132233932,0.115622443,0.07730071200000001,-0.029041797999999997,0.08712737699999999,0.068128714,-0.01527604,-0.071208618,-0.052943252999999996
1770,Herpesvirus infection reduces Pol II occupancy of host promoters but spares viral promoters,"In mammalian cells, widespread acceleration of cytoplasmic mRNA degradation is linked to impaired RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription. This mRNA decay-induced transcriptional repression occurs during infection with gammaherpesviruses including Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), which encode an mRNA endonuclease that initiates widespread RNA decay. Here, we show that MHV68-induced mRNA decay leads to a genome-wide reduction of Pol II occupancy at mammalian promoters. Viral genes, despite the fact that they require Pol II for transcription, escape this transcriptional repression. Protection is not governed by viral promoter sequences; instead, location on the viral genome is both necessary and sufficient to escape the transcriptional repression effects of mRNA decay. We hypothesize that the ability to escape from transcriptional repression is linked to the localization of viral DNA in replication compartments, providing a means for these viruses to counteract decay-induced viral transcript loss.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.123323746,-0.060011521,-0.024687147000000003,-0.05088289,-0.07521076,-0.00308738,0.018475024,-0.011795256,0.02599157,-0.035878314,-0.044218655,-0.073299784,0.01288354,0.086811758,-0.010701064,0.041867861,-0.012155131999999999,-0.10347973199999999,-0.10432172199999999,-0.016986201,0.009946145,0.042642558,-0.06145141,0.036109193,-0.020472087,-0.157576683,-0.031720418,0.039467606,0.107957846,-0.033447937999999997
1773,Rapid reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 using a synthetic genomics platform,"Reverse genetics has been an indispensable tool revolutionising our insights into viral pathogenesis and vaccine development. Large RNA virus genomes, such as from Coronaviruses, are cumbersome to clone and to manipulate in E. coli hosts due to size and occasional instability1-3. Therefore, an alternative rapid and robust reverse genetics platform for RNA viruses would benefit the research community. Here we show the full functionality of a yeast-based synthetic genomics platform for the genetic reconstruction of diverse RNA viruses, including members of the Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae and Paramyxoviridae families. Viral subgenomic fragments were generated using viral isolates, cloned viral DNA, clinical samples, or synthetic DNA, and reassembled in one step in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using transformation associated recombination (TAR) cloning to maintain the genome as a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC).

1774,Partial RdRp sequences offer a robust method for Coronavirus subgenus classification,"The recent reclassification of the Riboviria, and the introduction of multiple new taxonomic categories including both subfamilies and subgenera for coronaviruses (family Coronaviridae, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) represents a major shift in how official classifications are used to designate specific viral lineages. While the newly defined subgenera provide much-needed standardisation for commonly cited viruses of public health importance, no method has been proposed for the assignment of subgenus based on partial sequence data, or for sequences that are divergent from the designated holotype reference genomes. Here, we describe the genetic variation of a partial region of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is one of the most used partial sequence loci for both detection and classification of coronaviruses in molecular epidemiology. We infer Bayesian phylogenies from more than 7000 publicly available coronavirus sequences and examine clade groupings relative to all subgenus holotype sequences. Our phylogenetic analyses are largely coherent with genome-scale analyses based on designated holotype members for each subgenus. Distance measures between sequences form discrete clusters between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can attribute subgenus or indicate sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both accurately and robustly. We thus propose that partial RdRp sequence data of coronaviruses is sufficient for the attribution of subgenus-level taxonomic classifications and we supply the R package, ""MyCoV"", which provides a method for attributing subgenus and assessing the reliability of the attribution. Importance StatementThe analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplicons derived from biological samples is the most common modern method for detection and classification of infecting viral agents, such as Coronaviruses. Recent updates to the official standard for taxonomic classification of Coronaviruses, however, may leave researchers unsure as to whether the viral sequences they obtain by these methods can be classified into specific viral taxa due to variations in the sequences when compared to type strains. Here, we present a plausible method for defining genetic dissimilarity cut-offs that will allow researchers to state which taxon their virus belongs to and with what level of certainty. To assist in this, we also provide the R package MyCoV which classifies user generated sequences.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.109356809,0.014291333,0.02557558,0.047387605,0.145058601,0.0015865579999999998,0.041127983,0.022099717999999997,-0.050346577,0.056304444,-0.020364677,0.014741456000000002,0.060545395999999994,-0.095870916,-0.017393465,-0.046604043,-0.017798843999999998,-0.00012315200000000002,-0.050773970999999994,-0.018540896,0.011846975,-0.011192332,-0.015992999,0.027294081,-0.024720709,-0.057635980999999996,0.03892084,0.015334028000000001,0.011566473,0.057869585
1788,"Amodiaquine, an antimalarial drug, inhibits dengue virus type 2 replication and infectivity","Abstract Dengue virus serotypes 1–4 (DENV1–4) are transmitted by mosquitoes which cause most frequent arboviral infections in the world resulting in ∼390 million cases with ∼25,000 deaths annually. There is no vaccine or antiviral drug currently available for human use. Compounds containing quinoline scaffold were shown to inhibit flavivirus NS2B–NS3 protease (NS2B–NS3pro) with good potencies. In this study, we screened quinoline derivatives, which are known antimalarial drugs for inhibition of DENV2 and West Nile virus (WNV) replication using the corresponding replicon expressing cell-based assays. Amodiaquine (AQ), one of the 4-aminoquinoline drugs, inhibited DENV2 infectivity measured by plaque assays, with EC50 and EC90 values of 1.08±0.09μM and 2.69±0.47 μM, respectively, and DENV2 RNA replication measured by Renilla luciferase reporter assay, with EC50 value of 7.41±1.09μM in the replicon expressing cells. Cytotoxic concentration (CC50) in BHK-21 cells was 52.09±4.25μM. The replication inhibition was confirmed by plaque assay of the extracellular virions as well as by qRT-PCR of the intracellular and extracellular viral RNA levels. AQ was stable for at least 96h and had minor inhibitory effect on entry, translation, and post-replication stages in the viral life cycle. DENV protease, 5′-methyltransferase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase do not seem to be targets of AQ. Both p-hydroxyanilino and diethylaminomethyl moieties are important for AQ to inhibit DENV2 replication and infectivity. Our results support AQ as a promising candidate for anti-flaviviral therapy.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.129519379,-0.038378399,-0.023573725,0.057152259000000004,-0.13986890300000002,0.029221012,0.05887173,-0.014454291000000001,0.039977575,0.033245715,0.027368495,0.004279749,-0.023895542999999998,0.09442387,0.011058005,0.007270989,-0.018878497,0.08164199999999999,0.100852383,0.009868856,-0.022670767999999997,0.055260800000000006,-0.016171733,0.020548385,0.015868563999999998,0.051712834000000006,0.066439398,-0.042139293,0.022022793,0.018238692
1793,Human cytomegalovirus and Herpes Simplex type I virus can engage RNA polymerase I for transcription of immediate early genes,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) utilizes RNA polymerase II to transcribe viral genes and produce viral mRNAs. It can specifically target the nucleolus to facilitate viral transcription and translation. As RNA polymerase I (Pol I)-mediated transcription is active in the nucleolus, we investigated the role of Pol I, along with relative contributions of the human Pol II and Pol III, to early phases of viral transcription in HCMV infected cells, compared with Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) and Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Inhibition of Pol I with siRNA or the Pol I inhibitors CX-5461 or Actinomycin D (5nM) resulted in significantly decreased IE and pp65 mRNA and protein levels in human fibroblasts at early times post infection. This initially delayed replication was compensated for later during the replication process, at which stage it didn’t significantly affect virus production. Pol I inhibition also reduced HSV-1 ICP0 and gB transcripts, suggesting that some herpesviruses engage Pol I for their early transcription. In contrast, inhibition of Pol I failed to affect MCMV transcription. Collectively, our results contribute to better understanding of the functional interplay between RNA Pol I-mediated nucleolar events and the Herpes viruses, particularly HCMV whose pathogenic impact ranges from congenital malformations and potentially deadly infections among immunosuppressed patients, up to HCMV’s emerging oncomodulatory role in human tumors.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.11349680000000001,-0.060605717999999996,-0.037705692,-0.006202099,-0.09470129,0.0017424810000000002,0.043455400000000005,-0.007676223,0.03145343,-0.0031917559999999996,-0.026331858,-0.03589013,0.011220727,0.112709415,-0.013228057,0.020391567,0.010266924,-0.044388229,-0.08055720799999999,0.017592833000000002,0.00633762,0.037552497000000004,-0.073746391,0.064248024,0.015467567,-0.071300962,-0.014915244,0.012692113,0.023809302999999997,-0.065219502
1797,The SARS-coronavirus nsp7+nsp8 complex is a unique multimeric RNA polymerase capable of both de novo initiation and primer extension,"Uniquely among RNA viruses, replication of the ∼30-kb SARS-coronavirus genome is believed to involve two RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activities. The first is primer-dependent and associated with the 106-kDa non-structural protein 12 (nsp12), whereas the second is catalysed by the 22-kDa nsp8. This latter enzyme is capable of de novo initiation and has been proposed to operate as a primase. Interestingly, this protein has only been crystallized together with the 10-kDa nsp7, forming a hexadecameric, dsRNA-encircling ring structure [i.e. nsp(7+8), consisting of 8 copies of both nsps]. To better understand the implications of these structural characteristics for nsp8-driven RNA synthesis, we studied the prerequisites for the formation of the nsp(7+8) complex and its polymerase activity. We found that in particular the exposure of nsp8's natural N-terminal residue was paramount for both the protein's ability to associate with nsp7 and for boosting its RdRp activity. Moreover, this ‘improved’ recombinant nsp8 was capable of extending primed RNA templates, a property that had gone unnoticed thus far. The latter activity is, however, ∼20-fold weaker than that of the primer-dependent nsp12-RdRp at equal monomer concentrations. Finally, site-directed mutagenesis of conserved D/ExD/E motifs was employed to identify residues crucial for nsp(7+8) RdRp activity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.22899159100000002,0.010368475,-0.123970871,0.12616365599999999,-0.04755970599999999,-0.09042253900000001,0.020249165,-0.02058905,-0.072748719,-0.004444077,0.093776501,0.143922595,-0.081510489,-0.054707211,-0.078010652,-0.048159462,0.108036513,-0.066990877,0.008212204,-0.027844276,0.005164949,-0.016211518,0.073773509,-0.09070416199999999,0.035717929,0.070866713,-0.043119979,0.045507984,0.013580338999999999,0.058499439
1800,A barnavirus sequence mined from a transcriptome of the Antarctic pearlwort Colobanthus quitensis,"Because so few viruses in the family Barnaviridae have been reported, we searched for more of them in public sequence databases. Here, we report the complete coding sequence of Colobanthus quitensis associated barnavirus 1, mined from a transcriptome of the Antarctic pearlwort Colobanthus quitensis. The 4.2-kb plus-strand sequence of this virus encompasses four main open reading frames (ORFs), as expected for barnaviruses, including ORFs for a protease-containing polyprotein, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase whose translation appears to rely on − 1 ribosomal frameshifting, and a capsid protein that is likely to be translated from a subgenomic RNA. The possible derivation of this virus from a fungus associated with C. quitensis is discussed.

1802,Signatures of Nucleotide Analog Incorporation by an RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Revealed Using High-Throughput Magnetic Tweezers,"RNA viruses pose a threat to public health that is exacerbated by the dearth of antiviral therapeutics. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) holds promise as a broad-spectrum, therapeutic target because of the conserved nature of the nucleotide-substrate-binding and catalytic sites. Conventional, quantitative, kinetic analysis of antiviral ribonucleotides monitors one or a few incorporation events. Here, we use a high-throughput magnetic tweezers platform to monitor the elongation dynamics of a prototypical RdRp over thousands of nucleotide-addition cycles in the absence and presence of a suite of nucleotide analog inhibitors. We observe multiple RdRp-RNA elongation complexes; only a subset of which are competent for analog utilization. Incorporation of a pyrazine-carboxamide nucleotide analog, T-1106, leads to RdRp backtracking. This analysis reveals a mechanism of action for this antiviral ribonucleotide that is corroborated by cellular studies.

1807,Translesion polymerase kappa-dependent DNA synthesis underlies replication fork recovery,"DNA replication stress is often defined by the slowing or stalling of replication fork progression leading to local or global DNA synthesis inhibition. Failure to resolve replication stress in a timely manner contribute toward cell cycle defects, genome instability and human disease; however, the mechanism for fork recovery remains poorly defined. Here, we show that the translesion DNA polymerase (Pol) kappa, a DinB orthologue, has a unique role in both protecting and restarting stalled replication forks under conditions of nucleotide deprivation. Importantly, Pol kappa-mediated DNA synthesis during hydroxyurea (HU)-dependent fork restart is regulated by both the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway and PCNA polyubiquitination. Loss of Pol kappa prevents timely rescue of stalled replication forks, leading to replication-associated genomic instability, and a p53-dependent cell cycle defect. Taken together, our results identify a previously unanticipated role for Pol kappa in promoting DNA synthesis and replication stress recovery at sites of stalled forks.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14093223300000002,-0.05364229,-0.021772347,-0.014213672,-0.105983422,0.002943743,0.060135025999999994,-0.003604122,0.028654744,-0.00045771699999999995,-0.0016042810000000002,-0.004317245,-0.015802489,0.057255059000000004,-0.016685645,0.07138148799999999,-0.031205691,-0.054984146,-0.039788767999999995,0.010124763,-0.010943184,0.036452312,-0.025492336,-0.012887072,0.013313453000000001,-0.057218292999999996,-0.09031653199999999,0.041661792999999996,-0.033583893999999996,-0.052342195999999994
1808,Transcriptional slippage in the positive-sense RNA virus family Potyviridae,"The family Potyviridae encompasses ∼30% of plant viruses and is responsible for significant economic losses worldwide. Recently, a small overlapping coding sequence, termed pipo, was found to be conserved in the genomes of all potyvirids. PIPO is expressed as part of a frameshift protein, P3N-PIPO, which is essential for virus cell-to-cell movement. However, the frameshift expression mechanism has hitherto remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that transcriptional slippage, specific to the viral RNA polymerase, results in a population of transcripts with an additional “A” inserted within a highly conserved GAAAAAA sequence, thus enabling expression of P3N-PIPO. The slippage efficiency is ∼2% in Turnip mosaic virus and slippage is inhibited by mutations in the GAAAAAA sequence.

1816,Origins and Evolution of the Global RNA Virome,"Viruses with RNA genomes dominate the eukaryotic virome, reaching enormous diversity in animals and plants. The recent advances of metaviromics prompted us to perform a detailed phylogenomic reconstruction of the evolution of the dramatically expanded global RNA virome. The only universal gene among RNA viruses is the gene encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed an iterative computational procedure that alternates the RdRp phylogenetic tree construction with refinement of the underlying multiple-sequence alignments. The resulting tree encompasses 4,617 RNA virus RdRps and consists of 5 major branches; 2 of the branches include positive-sense RNA viruses, 1 is a mix of positive-sense (+) RNA and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses, and 2 consist of dsRNA and negative-sense (−) RNA viruses, respectively. This tree topology implies that dsRNA viruses evolved from +RNA viruses on at least two independent occasions, whereas −RNA viruses evolved from dsRNA viruses. Reconstruction of RNA virus evolution using the RdRp tree as the scaffold suggests that the last common ancestors of the major branches of +RNA viruses encoded only the RdRp and a single jelly-roll capsid protein. Subsequent evolution involved independent capture of additional genes, in particular, those encoding distinct RNA helicases, enabling replication of larger RNA genomes and facilitating virus genome expression and virus-host interactions. Phylogenomic analysis reveals extensive gene module exchange among diverse viruses and horizontal virus transfer between distantly related hosts. Although the network of evolutionary relationships within the RNA virome is bound to further expand, the present results call for a thorough reevaluation of the RNA virus taxonomy.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.247876216,-0.074960995,-0.098473375,0.252916994,0.090810377,-0.10441199699999999,0.042099480999999994,0.07705347900000001,-0.115050703,0.09807923699999999,0.125716944,0.016142661000000003,-0.034226865,0.046120024,0.024879397999999997,-0.033323768,0.013891407,-0.080743497,-0.007084403,-0.001532046,0.017364675,0.01538283,-0.040151121,0.013981882,-0.14643362099999999,-0.053397683,0.05346156,0.004825247,-0.035730735,-0.020281069

1823,Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Viral RNA Polymerases Link Conserved and Correlated Motions of Functional Elements to Fidelity,"Abstract The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is essential for multiplication of all RNA viruses. The sequence diversity of an RNA virus population contributes to its ability to infect the host. This diversity emanates from errors made by the RdRp during RNA synthesis. The physical basis for RdRp fidelity is unclear but is linked to conformational changes occurring during the nucleotide-addition cycle. To understand RdRp dynamics that might influence RdRp function, we have analyzed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations on the nanosecond timescale of four RdRps from the picornavirus family that exhibit 30–74% sequence identity. Principal component analysis showed that the major motions observed during the simulations derived from conserved structural motifs and regions of known function. The dynamics of residues participating in the same biochemical property, for example, RNA binding, nucleotide binding or catalysis, were correlated even when spatially distant on the RdRp structure. The conserved and correlated dynamics of functional structural elements suggest coevolution of dynamics with structure and function of the RdRp. Crystal structures of all picornavirus RdRps exhibit a template–nascent RNA duplex channel too small to fully accommodate duplex RNA. Simulations revealed opening and closing motions of the RNA and nucleoside triphosphate channels, which might be relevant to nucleoside triphosphate entry, inorganic pyrophosphate exit and translocation. A role for nanosecond timescale dynamics in RdRp fidelity is supported by the altered dynamics of the high-fidelity G64S derivative of PV RdRp relative to wild-type enzyme.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.24292803899999998,-0.044680382000000005,-0.101980679,0.14681401300000002,-0.006152174,-0.066380447,0.099009938,0.044580586,-0.10931912199999999,0.06311043,0.164717374,0.199071306,-0.139072529,-0.08215487099999999,-0.058026695999999996,-0.03093631,0.039776306000000004,-0.056132809000000006,-0.082494952,-0.098308384,0.117730733,-0.075182982,0.07815425299999999,-0.0030940720000000002,-0.023448796,0.045116613,0.04291596,0.024630496,0.04831777,0.007911582
1828,The methyltransferase domain of dengue virus protein NS5 ensures efficient RNA synthesis initiation and elongation by the polymerase domain,"Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) responsible for the replication of single-strand RNA virus genomes exert their function in the context of complex replication machineries. Within these replication complexes the polymerase activity is often highly regulated by RNA elements, proteins or other domains of multi-domain polymerases. Here, we present data of the influence of the methyltransferase domain (NS5-MTase) of dengue virus (DENV) protein NS5 on the RdRp activity of the polymerase domain (NS5-Pol). The steady-state polymerase activities of DENV-2 recombinant NS5 and NS5-Pol are compared using different biochemical assays allowing the dissection of the de novo initiation, transition and elongation steps of RNA synthesis. We show that NS5-MTase ensures efficient RdRp activity by stimulating the de novo initiation and the elongation phase. This stimulation is related to a higher affinity of NS5 toward the single-strand RNA template indicating NS5-MTase either completes a high-affinity RNA binding site and/or promotes the correct formation of the template tunnel. Furthermore, the NS5-MTase increases the affinity of the priming nucleotide ATP upon de novo initiation and causes a higher catalytic efficiency of the polymerase upon elongation. The complex stimulation pattern is discussed under the perspective that NS5 adopts several conformations during RNA synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.211356178,-0.055554648,-0.072339164,0.09942453400000001,-0.07509396900000001,-0.06811179099999999,0.053094685999999995,0.023999742999999997,-0.042162371,0.005266469,0.076523732,0.092569551,-0.08634218199999999,-0.000227719,-0.054192252,0.003860188,0.05371831,-0.054844211,-0.02573856,-0.020194823,-0.013505706000000001,0.002613882,-0.00041814,-0.081306214,0.053977557999999995,0.054892353,-0.031894347999999996,0.015396989,0.030492984,0.045262384
1833,Viral Macrodomains: Unique Mediators of Viral Replication and Pathogenesis,"Viruses from the Coronaviridae, Togaviridae, and Hepeviridae families ​all contain genes that encode a conserved protein domain, called a macrodomain; however, the role of this domain during infection has remained enigmatic. The recent discovery that mammalian macrodomain proteins enzymatically remove ADP-ribose, a common post-translation modification, from proteins has led to an outburst of studies describing both the enzymatic activity and function of viral macrodomains. These new studies have defined these domains as de-ADP-ribosylating enzymes, which indicates that these viruses have evolved to counteract antiviral ADP-ribosylation, likely mediated by poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs).

1845,"Fidelity Variants of RNA Dependent RNA Polymerases Uncover an Indirect, Mutagenic Activity of Amiloride Compounds","In a screen for RNA mutagen resistance, we isolated a high fidelity RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) variant of Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3). Curiously, this variant A372V is also resistant to amiloride. We hypothesize that amiloride has a previously undescribed mutagenic activity. Indeed, amiloride compounds increase the mutation frequencies of CVB3 and poliovirus and high fidelity variants of both viruses are more resistant to this effect. We hypothesize that this mutagenic activity is mediated through alterations in intracellular ions such as Mg(2+) and Mn(2+), which in turn increase virus mutation frequency by affecting RdRp fidelity. Furthermore, we show that another amiloride-resistant RdRp variant, S299T, is completely resistant to this mutagenic activity and unaffected by changes in ion concentrations. We show that RdRp variants resist the mutagenic activity of amiloride via two different mechanisms: 1) increased fidelity that generates virus populations presenting lower basal mutation frequencies or 2) resisting changes in divalent cation concentrations that affect polymerase fidelity.

1851,Alu RNA regulates the cellular pool of active ribosomes by targeted delivery of SRP9/14 to 40S subunits,"The human genome contains about 1.5 million Alu elements, which are transcribed into Alu RNAs by RNA polymerase III. Their expression is upregulated following stress and viral infection, and they associate with the SRP9/14 protein dimer in the cytoplasm forming Alu RNPs. Using cell-free translation, we have previously shown that Alu RNPs inhibit polysome formation. Here, we describe the mechanism of Alu RNP-mediated inhibition of translation initiation and demonstrate its effect on translation of cellular and viral RNAs. Both cap-dependent and IRES-mediated initiation is inhibited. Inhibition involves direct binding of SRP9/14 to 40S ribosomal subunits and requires Alu RNA as an assembly factor but its continuous association with 40S subunits is not required for inhibition. Binding of SRP9/14 to 40S prevents 48S complex formation by interfering with the recruitment of mRNA to 40S subunits. In cells, overexpression of Alu RNA decreases translation of reporter mRNAs and this effect is alleviated with a mutation that reduces its affinity for SRP9/14. Alu RNPs also inhibit the translation of cellular mRNAs resuming translation after stress and of viral mRNAs suggesting a role of Alu RNPs in adapting the translational output in response to stress and viral infection.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.12157518099999999,-0.059432469,-0.037835399,-0.027570296,-0.066035548,-0.01576545,-0.009645306,0.0058747930000000005,0.016004095,-0.025542923999999998,-0.036694516,-0.03402355,0.004946832,0.038753743,-0.014420711000000001,0.018235347,0.005182163,-0.029494921,-0.026263995,0.018466131,-0.02385413,0.045516937,-0.021701507999999998,-0.007598863000000001,0.020556359,-0.060141944,-0.023813291,0.01106094,0.067059735,0.015468638
1855,Influenza A Virus Polymerase Recruits the RNA Helicase DDX19 to Promote the Nuclear Export of Viral mRNAs,"Enhancing the knowledge of host factors that are required for efficient influenza A virus (IAV) replication is essential to address questions related to pathogenicity and to identify targets for antiviral drug development. Here we focused on the interplay between IAV and DExD-box RNA helicases (DDX), which play a key role in cellular RNA metabolism by remodeling RNA-RNA or RNA-protein complexes. We performed a targeted RNAi screen on 35 human DDX proteins to identify those involved in IAV life cycle. DDX19 was a major hit. In DDX19-depleted cells the accumulation of viral RNAs and proteins was delayed, and the production of infectious IAV particles was strongly reduced. We show that DDX19 associates with intronless, unspliced and spliced IAV mRNAs and promotes their nuclear export. In addition, we demonstrate an RNA-independent association between DDX19 and the viral polymerase, that is modulated by the ATPase activity of DDX19. Our results provide a model in which DDX19 is recruited to viral mRNAs in the nucleus of infected cells to enhance their nuclear export.

Here, we demonstrate that bats of the genus Eptesicus have preserved for more than 11.8 million years an EBLL element named eEBLL-1, which has an intact open reading frame of 1,718 codons. The eEBLL-1 coding sequence revealed that functional motifs essential for mononegaviral RdRp activity are well conserved in the EBLL-1 genes. Genetic analyses showed that natural selection operated on eEBLL-1 during the evolution of Eptesicus. Notably, we detected efficient transcription of eEBLL-1 in tissues from Eptesicus bats.

However, the precise mechanism by which the RdRP maintains its optimal fidelity level remains largely elusive. By solving 2.1–2.5 Å resolution crystal structures of the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) NS5B, an RdRP with a unique naturally fused N-terminal domain (NTD), we identified high-resolution intra-molecular interactions between the NTD and the RdRP palm domain. In order to dissect possible regulatory functions of NTD, we designed mutations at residues Y471 and E472 to perturb key interactions at the NTD–RdRP interface. When crystallized, some of these NS5B interface mutants maintained the interface, while the others adopted an ‘open’ conformation that no longer retained the intra-molecular interactions. Data from multiple in vitro RdRP assays indicated that the perturbation of the NTD–RdRP interactions clearly reduced the fidelity level of the RNA synthesis, while the processivity of the NS5B elongation complex was not affected.

1859,Selective Degradation of Host RNA Polymerase II Transcripts by Influenza A Virus PA-X Host Shutoff Protein,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) inhibit host gene expression by a process known as host shutoff. Host shutoff limits host innate immune responses and may also redirect the translation apparatus to the production of viral proteins. Multiple IAV proteins regulate host shutoff, including PA-X, a ribonuclease that remains incompletely characterized. We report that PA-X selectively targets host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcribed mRNAs, while sparing products of Pol I and Pol III. Interestingly, we show that PA-X can also target Pol II-transcribed RNAs in the nucleus, including non-coding RNAs that are not destined to be translated, and reporter transcripts with RNA hairpin structures that block ribosome loading. Transcript degradation likely occurs in the nucleus, as PA-X is enriched in the nucleus and its nuclear localization correlates with reduction in target RNA levels. Complete degradation of host mRNAs following PA-X-mediated endonucleolytic cleavage is dependent on the host 5’->3’-exonuclease Xrn1. IAV mRNAs are structurally similar to host mRNAs, but are synthesized and modified at the 3’ end by the action of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex. Infection of cells with wild-type IAV or a recombinant PA-X-deficient virus revealed that IAV mRNAs resist PA-X-mediated degradation during infection. At the same time, loss of PA-X resulted in changes in the synthesis of select viral mRNAs and a decrease in viral protein accumulation. Collectively, these results significantly advance our understanding of IAV host shutoff, and suggest that the PA-X causes selective degradation of host mRNAs by discriminating some aspect of Pol II-dependent RNA biogenesis in the nucleus.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.17346383699999998,-0.078291184,-0.056624645999999994,0.026377916,-0.080823955,0.060642932999999996,0.029865027000000002,0.002327344,0.024882707,-0.029419452000000002,-0.042054212,-0.072810942,-0.002069344,0.130104067,-0.009296723,0.039098519,-0.004158737,-0.07665459200000001,-0.066094372,0.031332676000000004,0.007427876999999999,0.075735254,-0.064304273,0.00545136,-0.013050141000000001,-0.084283365,0.020266211,0.01076164,0.047052872,0.008602799999999999

Mutational analysis of the predicted structure demonstrated that the stem–loop increases readthrough by up to 10-fold. The same computational analysis indicated that similar RNA structures are likely to be relevant to readthrough in certain plant virus genera, notably Furovirus, Pomovirus, Tobravirus, Pecluvirus and Benyvirus, as well as the Drosophilia gene kelch. These results suggest that 3′ RNA stimulatory structures feature in a much larger proportion of readthrough cases than previously anticipated, and provide a new criterion for assessing the large number of cellular readthrough candidates that are currently being revealed by comparative sequence analysis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.132622668,-0.035290102999999996,-0.01758355,-0.010745615,0.028480116,-0.026702879,-0.025100201000000003,0.024623334,-0.022548104,-0.039327297000000004,-0.031428978999999996,0.023444454,-0.008421726,-0.079129136,-0.03287358,-0.014427796000000001,0.019923708000000002,0.00493153,-0.048081784,-0.03229451,-0.00962518,-0.016597328999999997,-0.06959288400000001,0.019120648,-0.042013785,-0.054984118,-0.006691633000000001,0.035402937,0.073578034,-0.04983816
1875,Structural characterization of recombinant IAV polymerase reveals a stable complex between viral PA-PB1 heterodimer and host RanBP5,"The genome of influenza A virus (IAV) comprises eight RNA segments (vRNA) which are transcribed and replicated by the heterotrimeric IAV RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp). RdRp consists of three subunits (PA, PB1 and PB2) and binds both the highly conserved 3′- and 5′-ends of the vRNA segment. The IAV RdRp is an important antiviral target, but its structural mechanism has remained largely elusive to date. By applying a polyprotein strategy, we produced RdRp complexes and define a minimal human IAV RdRp core complex. We show that PA-PB1 forms a stable heterodimeric submodule that can strongly interact with 5′-vRNA. In contrast, 3′-vRNA recognition critically depends on the PB2 N-terminal domain. Moreover, we demonstrate that PA-PB1 forms a stable and stoichiometric complex with host nuclear import factor RanBP5 that can be modelled using SAXS and we show that the PA-PB1-RanPB5 complex is no longer capable of 5′-vRNA binding. Our results provide further evidence for a step-wise assembly of IAV structural components, regulated by nuclear transport mechanisms and host factor binding.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.150362875,-0.052987516,-0.06230104,0.06454702,-0.067352444,0.068010082,0.043041774000000005,0.005044552,-0.020658623,-0.016839899,0.04047049,0.08522911300000001,-0.07079679400000001,0.0036138109999999998,-0.034305277,-0.001171922,0.04213266,-0.062369009,-0.04765164400000001,-0.024248175,0.041713349,0.001143173,0.02634532,-0.048257834000000006,0.001968631,0.029807168999999998,0.008297543000000001,0.029379744,0.046091025,0.053395841
1878,Tick-borne encephalitis virus inhibits rRNA synthesis and host protein production in human cells of neural origin,"Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a member of the genus Flavivirus (Flaviviridae), is a causative agent of a severe neuroinfection. Recently, several flaviviruses have been shown to interact with host protein synthesis. In order to determine whether TBEV interacts with this host process in its natural target cells, we analysed de novo protein synthesis in a human cell line derived from cerebellar medulloblastoma (DAOY HTB-186). We observed a significant decrease in the rate of host protein synthesis, including the housekeeping genes HPRT1 and GAPDH and the known interferon-stimulated gene viperin. In addition, TBEV infection resulted in a specific decrease of RNA polymerase I (POLR1) transcripts, 18S and 28S rRNAs and their precursor, 45-47S pre-rRNA, but had no effect on the POLR3 transcribed 5S rRNA levels.

1888,Proofreading-Deficient Coronaviruses Adapt for Increased Fitness over Long-Term Passage without Reversion of Exoribonuclease-Inactivating Mutations,"The coronavirus (CoV) RNA genome is the largest among the single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses. CoVs encode a proofreading 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV high-fidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold-decreased fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogues. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in parallel with wild-type MHV (WT-MHV). Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated enhanced replication and increased competitive fitness without reversion at the ExoN(-) active site. Furthermore, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 was less susceptible than MHV-ExoN(-) P3 to multiple nucleoside analogues, suggesting that MHV-ExoN(-) was under selection for increased replication fidelity. We subsequently identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially accounted for the reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogues. Our results suggest that increased replication fidelity is selected in ExoN(-) CoVs and that there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) reversion. These results also support the hypothesis that high-fidelity replication is linked to CoV fitness and indicate that multiple replicase proteins could compensate for ExoN functions during replication.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.136200262,0.046470927999999995,-0.101658993,0.037327698,-0.016440239,-0.027633103,0.022390791,0.021067332999999997,0.0032926059999999996,-0.016825108999999998,0.05581799900000001,0.021427161,-0.056881653,-0.001627464,0.036470404,0.08997044400000001,-0.061562474000000006,-0.009576219,-0.040034597000000005,-0.010815958,0.09072501,-0.079831757,0.14124816099999998,0.109568863,0.100105648,0.15942835,-0.028639513999999998,-0.100174711,-0.10129640699999999,-0.13365724199999998
1889,A system for production of defective interfering particles in the absence of infectious influenza A virus,"Influenza A virus (IAV) infection poses a serious health threat and novel antiviral strategies are needed. Defective interfering particles (DIPs) can be generated in IAV infected cells due to errors of the viral polymerase and may suppress spread of wild type (wt) virus. The antiviral activity of DIPs is exerted by a DI genomic RNA segment that usually contains a large deletion and suppresses amplification of wt segments, potentially by competing for cellular and viral resources. DI-244 is a naturally occurring prototypic segment 1-derived DI RNA in which most of the PB2 open reading frame has been deleted and which is currently developed for antiviral therapy. At present, coinfection with wt virus is required for production of DI-244 particles which raises concerns regarding biosafety and may complicate interpretation of research results. Here, we show that cocultures of 293T and MDCK cell lines stably expressing codon optimized PB2 allow production of DI-244 particles solely from plasmids and in the absence of helper virus. Moreover, we demonstrate that infectivity of these particles can be quantified using MDCK-PB2 cells. Finally, we report that the DI-244 particles produced in this novel system exert potent antiviral activity against H1N1 and H3N2 IAV but not against the unrelated vesicular stomatitis virus. This is the first report of DIP production in the absence of infectious IAV and may spur efforts to develop DIPs for antiviral therapy.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.121440571,-0.06655145400000001,-0.01934352,0.038878212,-0.061773322,0.043752449000000006,-0.081744847,0.031731897,0.02173726,-0.041067474,-0.002868432,-0.087064763,0.031565132999999995,0.042321853,0.147133383,0.12473269199999999,-0.15599075199999998,0.116678215,0.022881912999999997,0.018850815,0.055232638,-0.000377759,0.06598466900000001,0.00896872,0.079738495,0.100811249,0.043198835,-0.024718946000000002,0.037215739,0.017946458999999998
1891,Identification of Cis-Acting Elements on Positive-Strand Subgenomic mRNA Required for the Synthesis of Negative-Strand Counterpart in Bovine Coronavirus,"It has been demonstrated that, in addition to genomic RNA, sgmRNA is able to serve as a template for the synthesis of the negative-strand [(−)-strand] complement. However, the cis-acting elements on the positive-strand [(+)-strand] sgmRNA required for (−)-strand sgmRNA synthesis have not yet been systematically identified. In this study, we employed real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to analyze the cis-acting elements on bovine coronavirus (BCoV) sgmRNA 7 required for the synthesis of its (−)-strand counterpart by deletion mutagenesis. The major findings are as follows. (1) Deletion of the 5'-terminal leader sequence on sgmRNA 7 decreased the synthesis of the (−)-strand sgmRNA complement. (2) Deletions of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) bulged stem-loop showed no effect on (−)-strand sgmRNA synthesis; however, deletion of the 3' UTR pseudoknot decreased the yield of (−)-strand sgmRNA. (3) Nucleotides positioned from −15 to −34 of the sgmRNA 7 3'-terminal region are required for efficient (−)-strand sgmRNA synthesis. (4) Nucleotide species at the 3'-most position (−1) of sgmRNA 7 is correlated to the efficiency of (−)-strand sgmRNA synthesis. These results together suggest, in principle, that the 5'- and 3'-terminal sequences on sgmRNA 7 harbor cis-acting elements are critical for efficient (−)-strand sgmRNA synthesis in BCoV.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.115768115,-0.041881506,-0.00855117,-0.010795472,-0.004544365,-0.064001983,-0.048331338,0.037650361,-0.028420004,-0.050434217999999996,0.016859044,0.017090388,-0.02162248,-0.012409756999999999,0.024520777,0.068464153,-0.021383343,0.01394003,-0.002109249,-0.049350443,-0.024701958,-0.00595429,-0.047269269,-0.05117775,-0.002156974,-0.07238502200000001,-0.086951907,0.031643456,0.09905677199999999,-0.013259558999999999
1895,Highly similar structural frames link the template tunnel and NTP entry tunnel to the exterior surface in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases,"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is essential to viral replication and is therefore one of the primary targets of countermeasures against these dangerous infectious agents. Development of broad-spectrum therapeutics targeting polymerases has been hampered by the extreme sequence variability of these sequences. RdRps range in length from 400–800 residues, yet contain only ∼20 residues that are conserved in most species. In this study, we made structure-based comparisons that are independent of sequence composition using a recently developed algorithm. We identified residue-to-residue correspondences of multiple protein structures and created (two-dimensional) structure-based alignment maps of 37 polymerase structures that provide both sequence and structure details. Using these maps, we determined that ∼75% of each polymerase species consists of seven protein segments, each of which has high structural similarity to segments in other species, though they are widely divergent in sequence composition and order. We define each of these segments as a ‘homomorph’, and each includes (though most are much larger than) the well-known conserved polymerase motifs. All homomorphs contact the template tunnel or nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) entry tunnel and the exterior of the protein, suggesting they constitute a structural and functional skeleton common among the polymerases.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.189554133,-0.036727837,-0.043763086,0.045797772,0.035177384,-0.02433101,0.043653022,0.027695018999999998,-0.046339907,0.017613127,-0.013508445,0.06007608,-0.005455154,-0.126416243,-0.061245178,-0.072804912,0.045109605,0.010454157,-0.024382235,-0.02869477,0.001821022,-0.013726091000000001,-0.030521479,-0.010012858000000001,0.002877132,0.0064057509999999995,0.030099467999999997,0.004759057,0.065125543,0.041175454
1907,Hepatitis C Virus RNA Replication Depends on Specific Cis- and Trans-Acting Activities of Viral Nonstructural Proteins,"Many positive-strand RNA viruses encode genes that can function in trans, whereas other genes are required in cis for genome replication. The mechanisms underlying trans- and cis-preferences are not fully understood. Here, we evaluate this concept for hepatitis C virus (HCV), an important cause of chronic liver disease and member of the Flaviviridae family. HCV encodes five nonstructural (NS) genes that are required for RNA replication. To date, only two of these genes, NS4B and NS5A, have been trans-complemented, leading to suggestions that other replicase genes work only in cis. We describe a new quantitative system to measure the cis- and trans-requirements for HCV NS gene function in RNA replication and identify several lethal mutations in the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B genes that can be complemented in trans, alone or in combination, by expressing the NS3–5B polyprotein from a synthetic mRNA. Although NS5B RNA binding and polymerase activities can be supplied in trans, NS5B protein expression was required in cis, indicating that NS5B has a cis-acting role in replicase assembly distinct from its known enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the RNA binding and NTPase activities of the NS3 helicase domain were required in cis, suggesting that these activities play an essential role in RNA template selection. A comprehensive complementation group analysis revealed functional linkages between NS3-4A and NS4B and between NS5B and the upstream NS3–5A genes. Finally, NS5B polymerase activity segregated with a daclatasvir-sensitive NS5A activity, which could explain the synergy of this antiviral compound with nucleoside analogs in patients. Together, these studies define several new aspects of HCV replicase structure-function, help to explain the potency of HCV-specific combination therapies, and provide an experimental framework for the study of cis- and trans-acting activities in positive-strand RNA virus replication more generally.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.18577082600000003,-0.061551620999999994,-0.064873685,0.037189832,-0.07576957599999999,-0.032376421,0.021230057000000004,0.023655685,0.001054678,-0.001044281,0.007863506999999999,0.06687639299999999,-0.006945046,0.067992724,-0.027317287000000003,-0.028801521,0.033849346,0.142226888,0.194420366,-0.09422845199999999,-0.057722696,0.006000496,0.038795291,0.004514135,-0.060326363,-0.077170896,-0.07477569099999999,0.059894921,-0.017907567,-0.06899454299999999

In this study, for the first time, we characterized viral small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) profiles in P. equestris co-infected with CymMV and ORSV through small RNA sequencing technology. CymMV and ORSV small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) demonstrated several general and specific/new characteristics. vsiRNAs, with A/U bias at the first nucleotide, were predominantly 21-nt long and they were derived predominantly (90%) from viral positive-strand RNA. 21-nt siRNA duplexes with 0-nt overhangs were the most abundant 21-nt duplexes, followed by 2-nt overhangs and then 1-nt overhangs 21-nt duplexes in infected P. equestris. Continuous but heterogeneous distribution and secondary structures prediction implied that vsiRNAs originate predominantly by direct Dicer-like enzymes cleavage of imperfect duplexes in the most folded regions of the positive strand of both viruses RNA molecular. Furthermore, we totally predicted 54 target genes by vsiRNAs with psRNATarget server, including disease/stress response–related genes, RNA interference core components, cytoskeleton-related genes, photosynthesis or energy supply related genes. Gene Ontology classification showed that a majority of the predicted targets were related to cellular components and cellular processes and performed a certain function. All target genes were down-regulated with different degree by vsiRNAs as shown by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.

1915,Viral Nucleases Induce an mRNA Degradation-Transcription Feedback Loop in Mammalian Cells,"Summary Gamma-herpesviruses encode a cytoplasmic mRNA-targeting endonuclease, SOX, that cleaves most cellular mRNAs. Cleaved fragments are subsequently degraded by the cellular 5′-3′ mRNA exonuclease Xrn1, thereby suppressing cellular gene expression and facilitating viral evasion of host defenses. We reveal that mammalian cells respond to this widespread cytoplasmic mRNA decay by altering RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription in the nucleus. Measuring RNAPII recruitment to promoters and nascent mRNA synthesis revealed that the majority of affected genes are transcriptionally repressed in SOX-expressing cells. The transcriptional feedback does not occur in response to the initial viral endonuclease-induced cleavage, but instead to degradation of the cleaved fragments by cellular exonucleases. In particular, Xrn1 catalytic activity is required for transcriptional repression. Notably, viral mRNA transcription escapes decay-induced repression, and this escape requires Xrn1. Collectively, these results indicate that mRNA decay rates impact transcription and that gamma-herpesviruses use this feedback mechanism to facilitate viral gene expression.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.141598788,-0.058758327,-0.029565904,-0.064796067,-0.092619964,0.007906365,-0.0055033009999999995,-0.028466677000000003,0.050424559,-0.049665477,-0.076174336,-0.08583058699999999,0.011272748999999999,0.113247562,-0.028398457999999998,0.02435699,0.010037839,-0.103993394,-0.08186412400000001,-0.014795198999999998,0.002546542,0.049532968,-0.034736231,0.003649184,-0.008262707,-0.13875956,-0.022435826000000002,0.041789064,0.13051142699999999,0.00504015
1918,Biochemical and genetic analysis of the role of the viral polymerase in enterovirus recombination,"Genetic recombination in single-strand, positive-sense RNA viruses is a poorly understand mechanism responsible for generating extensive genetic change and novel phenotypes. By moving a critical cis-acting replication element (CRE) from the polyprotein coding region to the 3′ non-coding region we have further developed a cell-based assay (the 3′CRE-REP assay) to yield recombinants throughout the non-structural coding region of poliovirus from dually transfected cells. We have additionally developed a defined biochemical assay in which the only protein present is the poliovirus RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which recapitulates the strand transfer events of the recombination process. We have used both assays to investigate the role of the polymerase fidelity and nucleotide turnover rates in recombination. Our results, of both poliovirus intertypic and intratypic recombination in the CRE-REP assay and using a range of polymerase variants in the biochemical assay, demonstrate that RdRp fidelity is a fundamental determinant of recombination frequency. High fidelity polymerases exhibit reduced recombination and low fidelity polymerases exhibit increased recombination in both assays. These studies provide the basis for the analysis of poliovirus recombination throughout the non-structural region of the virus genome and provide a defined biochemical assay to further dissect this important evolutionary process.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.17443169,-0.017109733999999998,0.00751032,0.093259066,0.015038731999999999,-0.059375533,0.0384029,0.023239541000000002,-0.067446851,0.036795334,0.106410567,0.112182476,-0.082654637,-0.047157661,-0.014022285,0.027666847999999997,-0.050462035999999995,-0.051822043,-0.075367103,-0.041880061,0.153574881,-0.100769283,0.081733209,0.08135353,-0.084696311,0.059714785,0.089825108,-0.013463771000000001,-0.084071165,-0.076844898
1920,The Hepatitis E virus intraviral interactome,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging virus causing epidemic acute hepatitis in developing countries as well as sporadic cases in industrialized countries. The life cycle of HEV is still poorly understood and the lack of efficient cell culture systems and animal models are the principal limitations for a detailed study of the viral replication cycle. Here we exhaustively examine all possible intraviral protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of HEV by systematic Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and LuMPIS screens, providing a basis for studying the function of these proteins in the viral replication cycle. Key PPIs correlate with the already published HEV 3D structure. Furthermore, we report 20 novel PPIs including the homodimerization of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the self-interaction of the papain like protease, and ORF3 interactions with the papain-like protease and putative replicase components: RdRp, methylase and helicase. Furthermore, we determined the dissociation constant (K(d)) of ORF3 interactions with the viral helicase, papain-like protease and methylase, which suggest a regulatory function for ORF3 in orchestrating the formation of the replicase complex. These interactions may represent new targets for antiviral drugs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.153742987,-0.05073695,-0.074230157,0.04402192,-0.07445937700000001,0.01000296,0.060229539000000006,-0.01248851,0.014005232,0.033871101,0.005477915999999999,0.056863446,-0.019581857,-0.036630398,-0.025095909,-0.068353187,0.049538889,0.019977637,0.032393717,0.027238579,-0.035009191,0.018712515,-0.050023384000000004,-0.062208789,0.033080427,0.07614823,0.015836938999999998,-0.010542986,0.026867207,-0.034306931
1921,Delayed kinetics of poliovirus RNA synthesis in a human cell line with reduced levels of hnRNP C proteins,"Abstract The hnRNP C heterotetramer [(C13)C2] binds RNA polymerase II transcripts in the nucleus, along with other proteins of the core hnRNP complex, and plays an important role in mRNA biogenesis and transport. Infection of HeLa cells with poliovirus causes hnRNP C to re-localize from the nucleus, where it is normally retained during interphase, to the cytoplasm. We have proposed that in the cytoplasm, the protein isoforms of hnRNP C participate in the recognition of viral specific RNAs by the poliovirus replication proteins and/or in the assembly of membrane-bound RNA replication complexes. In SK-OV-3 cells, which express reduced levels of hnRNP C compared to HeLa cells or 293 cells, the kinetics of poliovirus replication are delayed. hnRNP C is also re-localized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in SK-OV-3 cells infected with poliovirus. Increased expression of hnRNP C in SK-OV-3 cells by transient transfection increases the rate of virus production and overall yield over that seen in mock-transfected cells. We propose that hnRNP C interacts with poliovirus RNA and replication proteins to increase the efficiency of viral genomic RNA synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.154033224,-0.06308702599999999,-0.046385533,-0.014681575,-0.092962705,-0.016790561000000002,0.003224953,-0.010631826,0.025278083,-0.023454805,0.007601119,-0.036011,-0.024326566,0.10508877400000001,0.021799386,0.052960239000000006,-0.007177788,-0.055760088,-0.015695495,0.015495528,-0.003228683,0.030118332999999997,0.00462745,-0.052079546,0.032475937,0.013232871,-0.023854635,0.012160048,-0.052285387,0.010460999
1922,Hepatitis E Virus Cysteine Protease Has Papain Like Properties Validated by in silico Modeling and Cell-Free Inhibition Assays,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) has emerged as a global health concern during the last decade. In spite of a high mortality rate in pregnant women with fulminant hepatitis, no antiviral drugs or licensed vaccine is available in India. HEV-protease is a pivotal enzyme responsible for ORF1 polyprotein processing leading to cleavage of the non-structural enzymes involved in virus replication. HEV-protease region encoding 432–592 amino acids of Genotype-1 was amplified, expressed in Sf21 cells and purified in its native form. The recombinant enzyme was biochemically characterized using SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and Immunofluorescence. The enzyme activity and the inhibition studies were conducted using Zymography, FTC-casein based protease assay and ORF1 polyprotein digestion. To conduct ORF1 digestion assay, the polyprotein, natural substrate of HEV-protease, was expressed in E. coli and purified. Cleavage of 186 kDa ORF1 polyprotein by the recombinant HEV-protease lead to appearance of non-structural proteins viz. Methyltransferase, Protease, Helicase and RNA dependent RNA polymerase which were confirmed through immunoblotting using antibodies generated against specific epitopes of the enzymes. FTC-casein substrate was used for kinetic studies to determine Km and Vmax of the enzyme and also the effect of different metal ions and other protease inhibitors. A 95% inhibition was observed with E-64 which was validated through in silico analysis. The correlation coefficient between inhibition and docking score of Inhibitors was found to have a significant value of r(2) = 0.75. The predicted 3D model showed two domain architecture structures similar to Papain like cysteine protease though they differed in arrangements of alpha helices and beta sheets. Hence, we propose that HEV-protease has characteristics of “Papain-like cysteine protease,” as determined through structural homology, active site residues and class-specific inhibition. However, conclusive nature of the enzyme remains to be established.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.132840604,-0.034365903999999996,-0.022081167999999998,-0.013820828,-0.050500080999999995,0.031336245,0.009324235,-0.027427887,0.040793536,-0.024094674,-0.036237824,0.06949036,-0.012027063999999999,-0.065526143,-0.056590682999999996,-0.074617679,0.056245914,0.050159599000000006,0.080865883,-0.000751858,-0.013775633999999998,0.00062419,-0.0067260309999999995,-0.012203303,0.061485508,0.10067746400000001,0.010047825,-0.039845561,0.01133655,-0.040151471
1928,A Reverse Genetics System for Cypovirus Based on a Bacmid Expressing T7 RNA Polymerase,"Dendrolimus punctatus cypovirus (DpCPV), belonging to the genus Cypovirus within the family Reoviridae, is considered the most destructive pest of pine forests worldwide. DpCPV has a genome consisting of 10 linear double-stranded RNA segments. To establish a reverse genetics system, we cloned cDNAs encoding the 10 genomic segments of DpCPV into three reverse genetics vectors in which each segment was transcribed under the control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter and terminator tagged with a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme sequence. We also constructed a vp80-knockout Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus bacmid to express a T7 RNA polymerase codon-optimized for Sf9 cells. Following transfection of Sf9 cells with the three vectors and the bacmid, occlusion bodies (OBs) with the typical morphology of cypovirus polyhedra were observed by optical microscopy. The rescue system was verified by incorporation of a HindIII restriction enzyme site null mutant of the 9th genomic segment. Furthermore, when we co-transfected Sf9 cells with the reverse genetics vectors, the bacmid, and an additional vector bearing an egfp gene flanked with the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of the 10th genomic segment, aggregated green fluorescence co-localizing with the OBs was observed. The rescued OBs were able to infect Spodopetra exigua larvae, although their infectivity was significantly lower than that of wild-type DpCPV. This reverse genetics system for DpCPV could be used to explore viral replication and pathogenesis and to facilitate the development of novel bio-insecticides and expression systems for exogenous proteins.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.153210134,-0.040727609,0.000576445,-0.000777206,-0.016549377,-0.023444402000000003,-0.046695390999999996,-0.009007944,0.006320396,-0.019358287,-0.019414238,-0.040563797,-0.006483845,0.044368078,0.03501094,0.018009129,-0.036944561,-0.012458398,-0.006140431,0.0030241290000000004,0.013112453999999999,0.006636554,0.006657315,-0.000685453,-0.036936828,0.00268471,0.02492873,-0.002435624,-0.06635202,0.035561634
1931,Host-Driven Phosphorylation Appears to Regulate the Budding Activity of the Lassa Virus Matrix Protein,"Lassa mammarenavirus (LASV) is an enveloped RNA virus that can cause Lassa fever, an acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome associated with significant morbidity and high rates of fatality in endemic regions of western Africa. The arenavirus matrix protein Z has several functions during the virus life cycle, including coordinating viral assembly, driving the release of new virus particles, regulating viral polymerase activity, and antagonizing the host antiviral response. There is limited knowledge regarding how the various functions of Z are regulated. To investigate possible means of regulation, mass spectrometry was used to identify potential sites of phosphorylation in the LASV Z protein. This analysis revealed that two serines (S18, S98) and one tyrosine (Y97) are phosphorylated in the flexible N- and C-terminal regions of the protein. Notably, two of these sites, Y97 and S98, are located in (Y97) or directly adjacent to (S98) the PPXY late domain, an important motif for virus release. Studies with non-phosphorylatable and phosphomimetic Z proteins revealed that these sites are important regulators of the release of LASV particles and that host-driven, reversible phosphorylation may play an important role in the regulation of LASV Z protein function.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.129271896,-0.055763987,-0.060985115,-0.001992605,-0.055700197,0.045522876,0.036321629,-0.027868568,0.039931628,0.017916235,-0.050595075,-0.036091171,0.018977549,0.012998593999999999,-0.009580085,-0.045839305999999996,0.034863567000000005,-0.030893217,-0.024631799,0.053055409000000005,-0.025405781000000002,0.042131073,-0.034980909,-0.018092872,0.0516561,0.07118482,0.04826392,-0.033822056,-0.006555058000000001,0.013906865
1932,A cypovirus VP5 displays the RNA chaperone-like activity that destabilizes RNA helices and accelerates strand annealing,"For double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses in the family Reoviridae, their inner capsids function as the machinery for viral RNA (vRNA) replication. Unlike other multishelled reoviruses, cypovirus has a single-layered capsid, thereby representing a simplified model for studying vRNA replication of reoviruses. VP5 is one of the three major cypovirus capsid proteins and functions as a clamp protein to stabilize cypovirus capsid. Here, we expressed VP5 from type 5 Helicoverpa armigera cypovirus (HaCPV-5) in a eukaryotic system and determined that this VP5 possesses RNA chaperone-like activity, which destabilizes RNA helices and accelerates strand annealing independent of ATP. Our further characterization of VP5 revealed that its helix-destabilizing activity is RNA specific, lacks directionality and could be inhibited by divalent ions, such as Mg(2+), Mn(2+), Ca(2+) or Zn(2+), to varying degrees. Furthermore, we found that HaCPV-5 VP5 facilitates the replication initiation of an alternative polymerase (i.e. reverse transcriptase) through a panhandle-structured RNA template, which mimics the 5′-3′ cyclization of cypoviral positive-stranded RNA. Given that the replication of negative-stranded vRNA on the positive-stranded vRNA template necessitates the dissociation of the 5′-3′ panhandle, the RNA chaperone activity of VP5 may play a direct role in the initiation of reoviral dsRNA synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.203243617,-0.055220247,-0.070412519,0.098145805,-0.054204361,-0.074559622,0.0064166169999999995,0.033829639,-0.036826564,-0.000275935,0.07834247700000001,0.026405117999999998,-0.045420808,0.060900298,0.0052622,0.017610973000000002,0.022520823,-0.029751697999999997,0.019992691,0.000354799,-0.039671793,0.046138965,-0.050173292,-0.080815613,-0.023271695,-0.03438813,-0.05309264,0.012775568000000001,-0.029511152000000002,0.026404571
1939,Potent Host-Directed Small-Molecule Inhibitors of Myxovirus RNA-Dependent RNA-Polymerases,"Therapeutic targeting of host cell factors required for virus replication rather than of pathogen components opens new perspectives to counteract virus infections. Anticipated advantages of this approach include a heightened barrier against the development of viral resistance and a broadened pathogen target spectrum. Myxoviruses are predominantly associated with acute disease and thus are particularly attractive for this approach since treatment time can be kept limited. To identify inhibitor candidates, we have analyzed hit compounds that emerged from a large-scale high-throughput screen for their ability to block replication of members of both the orthomyxovirus and paramyxovirus families. This has returned a compound class with broad anti-viral activity including potent inhibition of different influenza virus and paramyxovirus strains. After hit-to-lead chemistry, inhibitory concentrations are in the nanomolar range in the context of immortalized cell lines and human PBMCs. The compound shows high metabolic stability when exposed to human S-9 hepatocyte subcellular fractions. Antiviral activity is host-cell species specific and most pronounced in cells of higher mammalian origin, supporting a host-cell target. While the compound induces a temporary cell cycle arrest, host mRNA and protein biosynthesis are largely unaffected and treated cells maintain full metabolic activity. Viral replication is blocked at a post-entry step and resembles the inhibition profile of a known inhibitor of viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) activity. Direct assessment of RdRp activity in the presence of the reagent reveals strong inhibition both in the context of viral infection and in reporter-based minireplicon assays. In toto, we have identified a compound class with broad viral target range that blocks host factors required for viral RdRp activity. Viral adaptation attempts did not induce resistance after prolonged exposure, in contrast to rapid adaptation to a pathogen-directed inhibitor of RdRp activity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14582958199999999,-0.054538170999999996,-0.076156976,0.100572269,-0.154192805,0.10007487,0.16010577199999998,-0.024855975,0.023211615,0.083835198,0.021802091000000003,0.0058676430000000005,-0.004170522,0.091697681,-0.025009905,-0.029266262999999997,-0.003222819,0.027680722,0.032326798999999996,0.01915076,0.013594183999999999,0.040171192,0.007872331,0.021647165,0.021020703999999998,0.015575583,0.058711637000000004,-0.013394198999999999,0.015424863999999998,0.075376239
1942,Discovery of an essential nucleotidylating activity associated with a newly delineated conserved domain in the RNA polymerase-containing protein of all nidoviruses,"RNA viruses encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that catalyzes the synthesis of their RNA(s). In the case of positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the order Nidovirales, the RdRp resides in a replicase subunit that is unusually large. Bioinformatics analysis of this non-structural protein has now revealed a nidoviral signature domain (genetic marker) that is N-terminally adjacent to the RdRp and has no apparent homologs elsewhere. Based on its conservation profile, this domain is proposed to have nucleotidylation activity. We used recombinant non-structural protein 9 of the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV) and different biochemical assays, including irreversible labeling with a GTP analog followed by a proteomics analysis, to demonstrate the manganese-dependent covalent binding of guanosine and uridine phosphates to a lysine/histidine residue. Most likely this was the invariant lysine of the newly identified domain, named nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN), whose substitution with alanine severely diminished the described binding. Furthermore, this mutation crippled EAV and prevented the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in cell culture, indicating that NiRAN is essential for nidoviruses. Potential functions supported by NiRAN may include nucleic acid ligation, mRNA capping and protein-primed RNA synthesis, possibilities that remain to be explored in future studies.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.230022667,0.049998429000000004,-0.16126305300000002,0.16366108099999999,-0.025436816,-0.080903444,0.037780363,-0.016774391,-0.059406346,0.045208314000000006,0.079694103,0.102150406,-0.044774428,-0.055489356,-0.064359294,-0.08473189199999999,0.0926502,-0.093723586,-0.03441287,-0.032172042000000005,0.013675666000000001,-0.016578337,0.061892697999999996,-0.08641166300000001,0.025697926,0.071098512,-0.012606016999999999,0.015450258,0.004362352,0.025212388
