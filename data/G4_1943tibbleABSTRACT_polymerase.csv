71,Severe Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) Pneumonia,"Abstract Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection, which ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia and multiorgan failure, caused by a novel coronavirus named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Majority of cases have been reported from Saudi Arabia. MERS cases occur as sporadic cases or as clusters or hospital outbreaks. Dromedary camels are thought to be a host for MERS-CoV. Direct contact with dromedary camels within 14days prior to infection was identified as an independent risk factor for MERS. Diagnosis of MERS is based on a positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), obtained from a respiratory specimen. The mainstay of management of MERS-CoV infection is supportive care. There is no specific antiviral therapy for MERS-CoV infection at present, although several modalities of treatment options have been examined or are under investigation.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.11644826300000001,0.319417351,-0.166520167,-0.0117203,-0.02382696,0.019284772,-0.023307527,0.48390487200000004,0.41198545,0.020264769,0.058965052000000004,-0.051468139,-0.01997553,-0.017123021000000002,0.009888547,-0.036510051,0.004062085,-0.055130472,-0.007491064,0.0053580369999999995,-0.008523746,0.055452222999999995,0.021966523999999998,0.049141992999999995,0.024352685,-0.030337196,-0.027132556000000002,-0.007538454,-0.010272277,0.023304823
85,Pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of women with severe acute respiratory syndrome,"Abstract Objective This study was undertaken to evaluate the pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of pregnant women with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Study design All pregnant women (12) who presented with SARS in Hong Kong between February 1 and July 31, 2003, were included. The pregnancy and perinatal outcomes were collected. Evidence of perinatal transmission of virus was assessed with the SARS-associated coronavirus reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on cord blood, placenta tissue, and subsequent follow-up of the neonate on serology. Results Three deaths occurred among the 12 patients, giving a case fatality rate of 25%. Four of the 7 patients (57%) who presented in the first trimester had spontaneous miscarriage. Four of the 5 patients who presented after 24 weeks were delivered preterm. Two mothers recovered without delivery, but their ongoing pregnancies were complicated by intrauterine growth restriction. No newborn infant had clinical SARS and all investigations were negative for SARS. Conclusion SARS during pregnancy is associated with high incidences of spontaneous miscarriage, preterm delivery, and intrauterine growth restriction. There is no evidence of perinatal SARS infection among infants born to these mothers.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.074021818,0.236979635,-0.167314894,-0.08728452099999999,-0.059909757,-0.000453685,-0.06898387,-0.184915747,-0.114787425,-0.012979918,0.003283172,0.006135827,0.003366103,-0.030148887000000003,0.026190066,0.05452835,-0.0072963540000000006,0.008310617,0.011141789,0.011273604,0.007141557,-0.065509048,-0.06326175,-0.005934900999999999,0.004018508,-0.032504532,0.007677886,0.011564826,-0.028682613,-0.012734158999999998
93,A real-time PCR for SARS-coronavirus incorporating target gene pre-amplification,"Abstract An enhanced polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) was developed in which a target gene pre-amplification step preceded TaqMan real-time fluorescent PCR. Clinical samples were collected from 120 patients diagnosed as suspected or probable SARS cases and analyzed by conventional PCR followed by agarose gel electrophoresis, conventional TaqMan real-time PCR, and our enhanced TaqMan real-time PCR assays. An amplicon of the size expected from SARS-CoV was obtained from 28/120 samples using the enhanced real-time PCR method. Conventional PCR and real-time PCR alone identified fewer SARS-CoV positive cases. Results were confirmed by viral culture in 3/28 cases. The limit of detection of the enhanced real-time PCR method was 102-fold higher than the standard real-time PCR assay and 107-fold higher than conventional PCR methods. The increased sensitivity of the assay may help control the spread of the disease during future SARS outbreaks.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.131824906,0.393415907,0.111089898,0.076179484,-0.046564324000000004,-0.069225556,-0.070645137,-0.122868054,-0.046639072000000004,-0.0024372779999999998,-0.00247397,-0.036833306,0.007553592,0.037049602,0.026248649,-0.023308856,0.034817297999999997,-0.034001518,0.034629765,-0.134032081,0.038578522999999997,0.088649135,0.062119533,-0.054057325999999996,-0.07918157099999999,0.009080887,0.043334705999999994,-0.035817262999999995,0.030485368,0.031010872000000002
103,Clinical and Laboratory Features of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Vis-À-Vis Onset of Fever,"Study objectives: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a rapidly progressive disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) infection. However, the disease presentation is nonspecific. The aim of this study was to define clearly the presentation, clinical progression, and laboratory data in a group of patients who had SARS. Design: Retrospective observational study. Setting: A tertiary care medical center with 51 negative-pressure isolation rooms in Taipei, Taiwan. Patients: Fifty-three patients with SARS seen between April 27 and June 16, 2003. Results: Fever (ie, temperature > 38°C) was the most common symptom (98%) and the earliest. When admitted to the isolation unit of the hospital for observation, most patients reported nonspecific symptoms associated with their fever. Only two patients with preexisting illnesses had cough on the same day the fever began. Eventually, 39 patients (74%) developed cough, beginning at a mean (± SD) time of 4.5 ± 1.9 days after fever onset, and 35 patients (66%) had diarrhea beginning at a mean time of 6.0 ± 3.3 days after fever onset. Thirty-one patients (59%) had abnormal findings on chest radiographs on hospital admission, and all but 1 patient (98%) eventually developed lung infiltrates that were consistent with pneumonia. The majority of patients (63%) first developed unifocal infiltrates at a mean time of 4.5 ± 2.1 days after fever onset, while in 37% of patients the initial infiltrates were multifocal, appearing at a mean time of 5.8 ± 1.3 days after fever onset. Common laboratory findings included lymphopenia (on hospital admission, 70%; during hospitalization, 95%), thrombocytopenia (on hospital admission, 28%; during hospitalization, 40%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (on hospital admission, 58%; during hospitalization, 88%), creatine kinase (on hospital admission, 18%; during hospitalization, 32%), and aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase levels (on hospital admission, 27%; during hospitalization, 62%). Throat or nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR was positive in 40 of the 47 patients (85%) in whom the test was performed. Conclusions: None of the presenting symptoms or laboratory findings are pathognomonic for SARS. Even though cough developed in a majority of patients, it did not occur until later in the disease course, suggesting that a cough preceding or concurrent with the onset of fever is less likely to indicate SARS. While PCR for SARS-CoV appears to be the best early diagnostic test currently available, it is clear that better methods are needed to differentiate between SARS and non-SARS illness on initial presentation.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.203495819,0.269217714,-0.192297387,-0.108931104,-0.10285738300000001,-0.04724725,-0.138205341,-0.027240592999999997,-0.185834319,0.013002267,-0.024965368999999998,0.023176517,-0.029259302999999997,0.037330304,-0.031460771,0.030441107999999998,-0.00028481299999999997,0.067469948,-0.004763029,0.040228926,0.03708654,-0.037183144,-0.076735572,-0.058792015999999996,-0.06837504400000001,-0.009661856,0.011974796999999999,-0.027153458,-0.051506154000000005,0.002739872
104,Colonization of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Associated Coronavirus Among Health-Care Workers Screened by Nasopharyngeal Swab,"Study objectives To report the efficacy and findings of a large-scale preventive screening program for severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) using amplification of the virus from a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) obtained from the health-care workers (HCWs). Design A prospective observational study. Setting A medical center in Taiwan. Participants Two hundred thirty HCWs. Intervention NPS examination for the presence of SARS-CoV by two nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Measurements and results During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), NPS polymerase chain reaction screening of HCWs for SARS-CoV was performed. SARS-CoV was examined by two nested RT-PCRs and a quantitative RT-PCR. Serum-specific antibodies were assessed by enzyme immunoassay and indirect immunofluorescence. We monitored 230 HCWs, including 217 first-line HCWs and 13 non–first-line HCWs. One hundred ninety first-line HCWs and 13 non–first-line HCWs had negative results in both nested RT-PCR assays. Two first-line HCWs who were positive on both nested RT-PCR assays had SARS. They had 16,900 ± 7,920 copies (mean ± SD) of RNA per milliliter in the NPS and had detectable anti-SARS antibodies. The remaining 25 first-line HCWs were negative for the first nested RT-PCR but positive for the second nested RT-PCR. Their corresponding titers were 338 ± 227 copies of RNA per milliliter; antibodies developed in none of these 25 HCWs. The expression and function of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 were not different among these HCWs. This study shows that colonization of SARS-CoV occurred in 25 of 217 well-protected first-line HCWs on a SARS-associated service, but they remained seronegative. Conclusion With the second RT-PCR assay more sensitive than the first RT-PCR assay, we are able to show that approximately 11.5% of well-protected HCWs exposed to SARS patients or specimens may have colonization without seroconversion. Only those with significant clinical symptoms or disease would have active immunity. Thus, regular NPS screening for nested RT-PCR assays in conjunction with a daily recording of body temperature in all first-line HCWs may provide an effective way of early detection.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.041703933,0.284365266,0.003066776,0.022423248,-0.030954642999999997,-0.018772183,-0.053612302,-0.09882853300000001,-0.016547832,-0.051547648,0.01625324,-0.0029396009999999996,-0.032721787,0.04371474400000001,0.020383626000000002,0.020570585,0.039173876,-0.007058028,-0.011350146,-0.062982165,-0.002993118,0.022173262000000003,-0.020109738000000002,0.017663245,0.008594267,0.015858674,0.016070756000000002,-0.012705441000000001,0.040101717,-0.028745839
110,"Enteric involvement of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infection 1 1 The authors thank Man-yee Yung, Sara Fung, Dr. Bonnie Kwan, and Dr. Thomas Li for their help in retrieving patient information.","Abstract Background & Aims : Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently emerged infection from a novel coronavirus (CoV). Apart from fever and respiratory complications, gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently observed in patients with SARS but the significance remains undetermined. Herein, we describe the clinical, pathologic, and virologic features of the intestinal involvement of this new viral infection. Methods : A retrospective analysis of the gastrointestinal symptoms and other clinical parameters of the first 138 patients with confirmed SARS admitted for a major outbreak in Hong Kong in March 2003 was performed. Intestinal specimens were obtained by colonoscopy or postmortem examination to detect the presence of coronavirus by electron microscopy, virus culture, and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results : Among these 138 patients with SARS, 28 (20.3%) presented with watery diarrhea and up to 38.4% of patients had symptoms of diarrhea during the course of illness. Diarrhea was more frequently observed during the first week of illness. The mean number of days with diarrhea was 3.7 ± 2.7, and most diarrhea was self-limiting. Intestinal biopsy specimens obtained by colonoscopy or autopsy showed minimal architectural disruption but the presence of active viral replication within both the small and large intestine. Coronavirus was also isolated by culture from these specimens, and SARS-CoV RNA can be detected in the stool of patients for more than 10 weeks after symptom onset. Conclusions : Diarrhea is a common presenting symptom of SARS. The intestinal tropism of the SARS-CoV has major implications on clinical presentation and viral transmission.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.115628102,0.322604735,-0.21610537300000002,-0.049802022,-0.038301966,-0.037555347999999995,-0.079502031,-0.14690687800000002,-0.123531062,0.031538066000000003,0.008122707,0.007489053000000001,0.004509316,0.024220062,0.092932264,-0.042175622999999995,-0.00986488,0.02495753,0.014745466,0.067364912,0.018242746,-0.027789441,-0.082462908,0.001254124,-0.009337253,-0.040308486,-0.029624083,-0.014177241,-0.029737147000000002,-0.002705077
113,Pathological Changes in Masked Palm Civets Experimentally Infected by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus,"Summary Masked palm civets are highly susceptible to infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Infected animals become less aggressive and develop pyrexia, lethargy and diarrhoea. The present study describes the spectrum of histopathological changes in the lung, spleen, lymph node, liver, small intestine, kidney and cerebrum of civets infected experimentally with SARS-CoV. In-situ hybridization (ISH) with probes specific for the RNA polymerase gene demonstrated viral RNA in the lung, small intestine and cerebrum only. In-situ labelling was employed in order to demonstrate cellular apoptosis in the cerebrum, but there was no evidence of apoptosis within the myocardium. These results indicate that SARS-CoV causes multi-organ pathology in civets, similar to that observed in human SARS patients. These parallels suggest that civets may be used as an animal model of this infection to gain insight into the pathogenesis of SARS and for evaluation of candidate vaccines and antiviral drugs.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.040427771,0.356230526,-0.206760547,-0.022296489,-0.061830023,0.033289366,-0.029730961,-0.19752961,-0.010692073,0.019861185,0.011164122,-0.03509397,0.021773426000000002,0.02165234,0.049643386,-0.0019138760000000001,-0.038855022999999995,0.012038416000000001,0.002065754,0.049651832,0.02879693,-0.0031526659999999997,0.011619728000000001,0.025268891,0.009689620999999999,-0.041523807,-0.05948581,0.0057691290000000004,0.002153523,0.005167837
137,A clinicopathological study of three cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),"Summary Aims The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused a large outbreak of atypical pneumonia in Beijing, China from early March 2003. We report the pathological features from three patients who died of SARS. Methods Autopsies were performed on three patients who died 9–15 days after the onset of the illness, and the clinical and laboratory features reviewed. Tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and in situ reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) on lung sections was performed using SARS coronavirus-specific primers. Results The typical gross pathological change in the lungs was diffuse haemorrhage on the lung surface. Histopathological examination revealed serous, fibrinous and haemorrhagic inflammation in most pulmonary alveoli, with capillary engorgement and some capillary microthrombosis. The pulmonary alveoli were thickened with interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, diffuse alveolar damage, desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline-membrane formation; fibrinoid material and erythrocytes were present in alveolar spaces. There were thromboemboli in some bronchial arterioles. Haemorrhagic necrosis and reduced numbers of lymphocytes were observed in lymph nodes and spleen. In situ RT–PCR detected SARS coronavirus RNA in type II alveolar cells, interstitial cells and bronchiolar epithelial cells from all three patients Conclusions Severe immunological damage in lung tissue is responsible for the clinical features of SARS.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.05181569,0.229614978,-0.098097655,-0.084145922,-0.078378357,-0.01769115,-0.08878043599999999,-0.164657531,-0.12109919400000001,-0.003329362,-0.013867082,-0.010741968000000001,0.006893666,0.101256557,0.024446586,0.0020134370000000003,-0.004113139,0.026669778999999998,-0.041562699999999994,0.038459131,0.061789602,-0.007304985999999999,-0.035342011,-0.021658233,-0.008053194,-0.010786961000000001,-0.03573559,0.05679465400000001,-0.026607317000000002,-0.054192147
155,Attenuation of SARS coronavirus by a short hairpin RNA expression plasmid targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,"Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious and sometimes a lethal disease, which spread over five continents in 2002–2003. Laboratory analysis showed that the etiologic agent for SARS is a new type of coronavirus. Currently, there is no specific treatment for this disease. RNA interference (RNAi) is a recently discovered antiviral mechanism in plant and animal cells that induces a specific degradation of double-stranded RNA. Here, we provide evidences that RNAi targeting at coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression plasmids can specifically inhibit expression of extraneous coronavirus RDRP in 293 and HeLa cells. Moreover, this construct significantly reduced the plaque formation of SARS coronaviruses in Vero-E6 cells. The data may suggest a new approach for treatment of SARS patients.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.147542005,0.221643913,-0.19110998399999998,0.072041994,-0.081454897,-0.02145059,-0.009272672,-0.18490989300000002,-0.08808412800000001,0.038891173,0.04104395,0.010905938,0.016105162,0.058877729000000004,0.021091804,0.007430664,-0.029020555,0.01433752,0.027360033,0.013355147,0.056898719,-0.023221266,-0.00324369,-0.016654923000000002,-0.03584071,-0.03505054,0.009215622,0.042631434,0.018824545,0.017703492
158,"Expression, purification, and characterization of SARS coronavirus RNA polymerase","Abstract The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is essential for viral replication and a potential target for anti-SARS drugs. We report here the cloning, expression, and purification of the N-terminal GST-fused SARS-CoV RdRp and its polymerase catalytic domain in Escherichia coli. During purification, the full-length GST-RdRp was found to cleave into three main fragments: an N-terminal p12 fragment, a middle p30 fragment, and a C-terminal p64 fragment comprising the catalytic domain, presumably due to bacterial proteases. Biochemical assays show that the full-length GST-RdRp has RdRp activity and the p64 and p12 fragments form a complex that exhibits comparable RdRp activity, whereas the GST-p64 protein has no activity, suggesting that the p12 domain is required for polymerase activity possibly via involvement in template-primer binding. Nonnucleoside HIV-1 RT inhibitors are shown to have no evident inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV RdRp activity. This work provides a basis for biochemical and structural studies of SARS-CoV RdRp and for development of anti-SARS drugs.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.18665653399999999,0.335232824,-0.24736380800000002,0.125071309,-0.103230616,-0.014061208,0.03519596,-0.183743198,-0.071787715,0.015038676,0.09432188,0.17332901899999997,-0.096929541,-0.09564069300000001,-0.070723939,-0.046005477,0.079536653,-0.03194521,0.004077323,-0.064632824,0.062577696,-0.019085392,0.12187087099999999,-0.012658283999999999,0.068849088,0.076129639,0.014792567,0.0154452,0.11580087900000001,0.090098468
163,Rhesus angiotensin converting enzyme 2 supports entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in Chinese macaques,"Abstract Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) utilizes for target cell entry and, therefore, plays an important role in SARS pathogenesis. Since Chinese rhesus (rh) macaques do not usually develop SARS after SARS-CoV infection, it has been suggested that rh-ACE2 probably does not support viral entry efficiently. To determine the role of rh-ACE2 in early lung pathogenesis in vivo, we studied eleven Chinese rhesus monkeys experimentally infected with a pathogenic SARS-CoVPUMC01 strain. Rh-ACE2 genes were amplified from all animals by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and their function was studied in vitro using a pseudovirus entry assay. Many natural non-synonymous (NS) changes were found in rh-ACE2 genes. Compared to human (hu) ACE2, thirty-eight consensus NS changes were found in rh-ACE2. Since these changes do not interact with the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV, rh-ACE2 in general is as effective as human homolog in supporting viral entry. Rh-ACE2, however, is more polymorphic than hu-ACE2. Additional sporadic NS substitutions in clone Rh11-7 reduced the level of rh-ACE2 protein expression and did not support viral entry effectively. Further mutagenesis analysis showed that a natural mutation Y217N dramatically alters ACE2 expression and entry efficiency. Moreover, introduction of the Y217N mutation into hu-ACE2 caused the down-regulation of expression and reduced viral entry efficiency. These results indicate that the Y217N mutation plays a role in modulating SARS-CoV infection. Our results provide insights for understanding the role of rh-ACE2 in SARS lung pathogenesis in a non-human primate model.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.050626948,0.158360585,-0.094738541,-0.06381030900000001,-0.055247227999999995,0.043353264,0.007850111,-0.126724522,0.008436464,-0.022868551,-0.030719059,-0.007874981999999999,-0.001910756,-0.002934987,0.013290208999999999,0.009231922,-0.016620557,-0.025167436,-0.024599568,-0.014300016,0.02766319,0.00044402199999999997,-0.010221069000000001,0.026271639,-0.010689703,-2.47e-05,0.001253966,0.003217111,0.016495975,-0.041542358
189,Lung pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): a study of 8 autopsy cases from Singapore,"Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious condition caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a new member in the family Coronaviridae. To evaluate the lung pathology in this life-threatening respiratory illness, we studied postmortem lung sections from 8 patients who died from SARS during the spring 2003 Singapore outbreak. The predominant pattern of lung injury in all 8 cases was diffuse alveolar damage. The histology varied according to the duration of illness. Cases of 10 or fewer days’ duration demonstrated acute-phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), airspace edema, and bronchiolar fibrin. Cases of more than 10 days’ duration exhibited organizing-phase DAD, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, multinucleated giant cells, and acute bronchopneumonia. In acute-phase DAD, pancytokeratin staining was positive in hyaline membranes along alveolar walls and highlighted the absence of pneumocytes. Multinucleated cells were shown to be both type II pneumocytes and macrophages by pancytokeratin, thyroid transcription factor-1, and CD68 staining. SARS-CoV RNA was identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 7 of 8 cases in fresh autopsy tissue and in 8 of 8 cases in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue, including the 1 negative case in fresh tissue. Understanding the pathology of DAD in SARS patients may provide the basis for therapeutic strategies. Further studies of the pathogenesis of SARS may reveal new insight into the mechanisms of DAD.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.04336501,0.293473797,-0.196159867,-0.06948426,-0.07768591700000001,0.014982876000000001,-0.067233797,-0.20138821699999998,-0.067290379,-0.011557518999999999,-0.00036845599999999997,-0.020517758,0.000473195,0.020077957,0.056745193,0.014901036000000001,-0.037640684,-0.005664381,-0.009777249,0.028169935,0.018896356,-0.00866708,-0.059065492000000004,-0.014879637,-0.027118661000000002,-0.006682338,-0.04814094,0.078320439,-0.023434649,-0.065777919
224,Development of Taqman RT-nested PCR system for clinical SARS-CoV detection,"Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute newly emerged infectious respiratory illness. The etiologic agent of SARS was named ‘SARS-associated coronavirus’ (SARS-CoV) that can be detected with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. In this study, 12 sets of nested primers covering the SARS-CoV genome have been screened and showed sufficient sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV in RNA isolated from virus cultured in Vero 6 cells. To optimize further the reaction condition of those nested primers sets, seven sets of nested primers have been chosen to compare their reverse transcribed efficiency with specific and random primers, which is useful to combine RT with the first round of PCR into a one-step RT-PCR. Based on the sensitivity and simplicity of results, the no. 73 primer set was chosen as the candidate primer set for clinical diagnoses. To specify the amplicon to minimize false positive results, a Taqman RT-nested PCR system of no. 73 nested primer set was developed. Through investigations on a test panel of whole blood obtained from 30 SARS patients and 9 control persons, the specificity and sensitivity of the Taqman RT-nested PCR system was found to be 100 and 83%, respectively, which suggests that the method is a promising one to diagnose SARS in early stages.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.055085484000000004,0.422887821,0.014763082,0.086468412,-0.00393885,-0.061139386,-0.099455216,-0.22891846,-0.074952333,-0.023979182,0.018186089,-0.017196576,0.0013586770000000002,0.067048333,0.026896431000000002,0.000565708,0.057839981,0.005743863,-0.014871549,-0.056031929,0.001040069,0.023165869,-0.00032977699999999996,0.06790406,0.040382717,-0.01990957,-0.008632051,-0.018387703999999998,0.019131533,0.0037113240000000002
292,SARS-CoV ORF1b-encoded nonstructural proteins 12–16: Replicative enzymes as antiviral targets,"Abstract The SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic caused ten years ago by the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has stimulated a number of studies on the molecular biology of coronaviruses. This research has provided significant new insight into many mechanisms used by the coronavirus replication-transcription complex (RTC). The RTC directs and coordinates processes in order to replicate and transcribe the coronavirus genome, a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of outstanding length (∼27–32kilobases). Here, we review the up-to-date knowledge on SARS-CoV replicative enzymes encoded in the ORF1b, i.e., the main RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the helicase/triphosphatase (nsp13), two unusual ribonucleases (nsp14, nsp15) and RNA-cap methyltransferases (nsp14, nsp16). We also review how these enzymes co-operate with other viral co-factors (nsp7, nsp8, and nsp10) to regulate their activity. These last ten years of research on SARS-CoV have considerably contributed to unravel structural and functional details of one of the most fascinating replication/transcription machineries of the RNA virus world.

299,Toward the identification of viral cap-methyltransferase inhibitors by fluorescence screening assay,"Abstract Two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses associated with severe respiratory syndromes emerged since the beginning of the century. The severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-coronavirus (CoV) spread first in southern China in 2003 with about 8000 infected cases in few months. Then in 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) emerged from the Arabian Peninsula giving a still on-going epidemic associated to a high fatality rate. CoVs are thus considered a major health threat. This is especially true as no vaccine nor specific therapeutic are available against either SARS- or MERS-CoV. Therefore, new drugs need to be identified in order to develop antiviral treatments limiting CoV replication. In this study, we focus on the nsp14 protein, which plays a key role in virus replication as it methylates the RNA cap structure at the N7 position of the guanine. We developed a high-throughput N7-MTase assay based on Homogenous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF®) and screened chemical libraries (2000 compounds) on the SARS-CoV nsp14. 20 compounds inhibiting the SARS-CoV nsp14 were further evaluated by IC50 determination and their specificity was assessed toward flavivirus- and human cap N7-MTases. Our results reveal three classes of compounds: 1) molecules inhibiting several MTases as well as the dengue virus polymerase activity unspecifically, 2) pan MTases inhibitors targeting both viral and cellular MTases, and 3) inhibitors targeting one viral MTase more specifically showing however activity against the human cap N7-MTase. These compounds provide a first basis towards the development of more specific inhibitors of viral methyltransferases.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.016002492,0.304242008,-0.19775644,0.077027234,-0.067125263,0.052323094,0.058180808,0.011519766,0.10312959599999999,0.04674520099999999,0.001077421,-0.001308029,0.001508346,-0.035689789,-0.024469995,-0.041068129,-0.021023828999999997,0.033160201,0.021014732999999997,0.091060943,-0.013989345,0.062780037,0.09111004800000001,0.11067766,0.088842152,-0.01644175,-0.013563813000000001,-0.003206142,0.103554618,0.036955694
301,Broad spectrum antiviral remdesivir inhibits human endemic and zoonotic deltacoronaviruses with a highly divergent RNA dependent RNA polymerase,"Abstract The genetically diverse Orthocoronavirinae (CoV) family is prone to cross species transmission and disease emergence in both humans and livestock. Viruses similar to known epidemic strains circulating in wild and domestic animals further increase the probability of emergence in the future. Currently, there are no approved therapeutics for any human CoV presenting a clear unmet medical need. Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog with potent activity against an array of RNA virus families including Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae, and Orthocoronavirinae, through the targeting of the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed multiple assays to further define the breadth of RDV antiviral activity against the CoV family. Here, we show potent antiviral activity of RDV against endemic human CoVs OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and 229E (HCoV-229E) with submicromolar EC50 values. Of known CoVs, the members of the deltacoronavirus genus have the most divergent RdRp as compared to SARS- and MERS-CoV and both avian and porcine members harbor a native residue in the RdRp that confers resistance in beta-CoVs. Nevertheless, RDV is highly efficacious against porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV). These data further extend the known breadth and antiviral activity of RDV to include both contemporary human and highly divergent zoonotic CoV and potentially enhance our ability to fight future emerging CoV.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.09326074699999999,0.198560285,-0.138873469,0.080881676,0.077501174,0.06697964299999999,0.157296729,0.073140299,0.095687014,-0.001414264,0.031658143,0.159806309,0.030284607,0.025854887000000003,-0.007060363,-0.012626025,-0.012146455,0.034527058,0.017980747,0.010448579,0.007898353,-0.011253949,0.09759709400000001,0.036283462999999995,0.027877336000000003,0.011345005,0.019308338,0.0020213920000000003,0.065462093,0.05514417
326,"Insights into RNA synthesis, capping, and proofreading mechanisms of SARS-coronavirus","Abstract The successive emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs) such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 has stimulated a number of studies on the molecular biology. This research has provided significant new insight into functions and activities of the replication/transcription multi-protein complex. The latter directs both continuous and discontinuous RNA synthesis to replicate and transcribe the large coronavirus genome made of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of ∼30kb. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of SARS-CoV enzymes involved in RNA biochemistry, such as the in vitro characterization of a highly active and processive RNA polymerase complex which can associate with methyltransferase and 3′–5′ exoribonuclease activities involved in RNA capping, and RNA proofreading, respectively.

352,Establishing a clinical decision rule of severe acute respiratory syndrome at the emergency department,"Abstract Study objective In the absence of reliable rapid confirmatory tests during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) endemics, we designed a 2-phase cohort study to establish a scoring system for SARS and to evaluate whether it could improve the sensitivity and specificity of the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Methods According to the clinical characteristics and initial laboratory findings of 175 suspected cases defined by the WHO criteria (20 confirmed as cases of SARS) in 3 university teaching hospitals in Taipei between March 1 and April 20, 2003, the scoring system for SARS was designed by multivariate analysis and stepwise logistic regression as the simple arithmetic sum of point values assigned to 7 parameters. We thereafter applied the scoring system for SARS to the consecutive 232 patients (the validation group) who met the WHO criteria of suspected cases from April 21 to May 22, 2003. Final diagnosis of SARS was determined by the results of real-time polymerase chain reaction and paired serum. Results The scoring system for SARS was defined as radiographic findings of multilobar or bilateral infiltrates (3 points), sputum monocyte predominance (3 points), lymphocytopenia (2 points), history of exposure (1 point), lactate dehydrogenase more than 450 U/L (1 point), C-reactive protein more than 5.0 mg/dL (1 point), and activated partial prothrombin time more than 40 seconds (1 point). Of the validation group, 60 patients (group A) were confirmed as having cases of SARS, and the other 172 (group B) patients tested negative for SARS. The total points of the scoring system for SARS at initial presentation were significantly higher in the SARS group (median 9; range 6 to 11) than in the non-SARS group (median 4; range 3 to 7; P<.001). At the cutoff value of 6 points, the sensitivity and specificity of the scoring system for SARS in diagnosing SARS were 100% and 93%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values of the scoring system for SARS were 83% and 100%, respectively. Conclusion The scoring system for SARS can provide a rapid and reliable clinical decision to help emergency physicians detect cases of SARS more accurately in the endemic area.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.08607531,0.401701625,-0.179269078,-0.050314133,-0.079635838,-0.008086263,-0.10186022900000001,-0.29367586100000004,-0.203623914,-0.030647666,-0.028652851,0.004168766,-0.004758532,-0.06431466799999999,0.0013876910000000001,0.035659088,-0.025829632999999998,0.014277907,0.021087427000000002,0.015917304,-0.008463518,-0.021741454,-0.040261906,-0.030773777000000002,-0.051585846,-0.01974293,-0.0057312909999999995,-0.00043564,-0.042153575,-0.013577711999999999
353,Sequential symptomatic analysis in probable severe acute respiratory syndrome cases,"Abstract Study objective Previous reports on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) described mainly its symptoms. However, the time sequence of symptom development was rarely discussed. The objective of this study is to chronologically document the time sequence of symptom development in probable SARS cases and compare that of the febrile non-SARS cases, thus providing valuable information for early recognition of the disease. Methods This prospective, descriptive, cohort study was conducted in an academic university hospital in Taipei, Taiwan, from March 14 through May 12, 2003. Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a temperature of at least 38.0°C (≥100.3°F) and exposure history were evaluated with a structured protocol. Detailed time sequences of individual symptoms were recorded, and chest radiography and laboratory test results were obtained. Probable SARS cases were determined by the Center of Disease Control Taiwan. Children younger than 15 years and suspected SARS patients with negative polymerase chain reaction results were excluded from final analysis. Results Seventy-nine SARS and 220 non-SARS cases were analyzed. The major clinical symptoms of SARS patients on ED presentation were myalgia, loose stool or diarrhea, nonproductive cough or dyspnea, headache, and chills. Upper airway symptoms, including rhinorrhea and sore throat, were rarely seen in the SARS patients but were common in the non-SARS group. Characteristic symptom sequence, consisting of initial fever accompanied by diarrhea and myalgia and then progressive respiratory symptoms, was identified in 55 SARS patients (69.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60 to 0.80) but only 7 (3.2%; 95% CI 0.008 to 0.05) non-SARS patients. Chest radiographic abnormality may precede lower respiratory tract symptoms in some SARS patients. Conclusion During an outbreak period, recognition of possible SARS cases depends on the heightened awareness of its clinical presentation. Aside from travel and contact history, the time sequence of the accompanying symptoms of SARS should help first-line physicians screen SARS patients at an early stage.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.157214262,0.354419172,-0.253976734,-0.076239327,-0.069256734,-0.039189802,-0.145477781,-0.263759867,-0.218076987,-0.013448041,-0.036455699,0.03674707,0.001442345,-0.063595452,0.001043028,0.038620548,-0.043379672,0.018935908,0.02362546,0.019278794,-0.009138832,-0.018248184,-0.09026182099999999,-0.007624,-0.072859522,-0.012585579,-0.007919634,-0.03292074,-0.023955273,-0.023652383
357,Infection control and prevention practices implemented to reduce transmission risk of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus in a tertiary care institution in Saudi Arabia,"Background Transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) among health care workers (HCWs) and patients has been documented with mortality rate approximating 36%. We propose advanced infection control measures (A-IC) used in conjunction with basic infection control measures (B-IC) help reduce pathogen transmission. B-IC include standard and transmission-based precautions. A-IC are initiatives implemented within our center to enhance effectiveness of B-IC. Objective Study effectiveness of combining B-IC and A-IC to prevent transmission of MERS-CoV to HCWs. Methods A retrospective observational study was undertaken. A-IC measures include administrative support with daily rounds; infection control risk assessment; timely screening, isolation, and specimen analysis; collaboration; epidemic planning; stockpiling; implementation of contingency plans; full personal protective equipment use for advanced airway management; use of a real-time electronic isolation flagging system; infection prevention and control team on-call protocols; pretransfer MERS-CoV testing; and education. Results A total of 874 real-time polymerase chain reaction MERS-CoV tests were performed during the period beginning July 1, 2013, and ending January 31, 2015. Six hundred ninety-four non-HCWs were tested, of these 16 tested positive for MERS-CoV and their infection was community acquired. Sixty-nine percent of the confirmed MERS-CoV-positive cases were men, with an average age of 56 years (range, 19-84 years). Of the total tested for MERS-CoV, 180 individuals were HCWs with zero positivity.

361,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus transmission among health care workers: Implication for infection control,"Background Many outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have occurred in health care settings and involved health care workers (HCWs). We describe the occurrence of an outbreak among HCWs and attempt to characterize at-risk exposures to improve future infection control interventions. Methods This study included an index case and all HCW contacts. All contacts were screened for MERS-CoV using polymerase chain reaction. Results During the study period in 2015, the index case was a 30-year-old Filipino nurse who had a history of unprotected exposure to a MERS-CoV–positive case on May 15, 2015, and had multiple negative tests for MERS-CoV. Weeks later, she was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and MERS-CoV infection. A total of 73 staff were quarantined for 14 days, and nasopharyngeal swabs were taken on days 2, 5, and 12 postexposure. Of those contacts, 3 (4%) were confirmed positive for MERS-CoV. An additional 18 staff were quarantined and had MERS-CoV swabs. A fourth case was confirmed positive on day 12. Subsequent contact investigations revealed a fourth-generation transmission. Only 7 (4.5%) of the total 153 contacts were positive for MERS-CoV. Conclusions The role of HCWs in MERS-CoV transmission is complex. Although most MERS-CoV–infected HCWs are asymptomatic or have mild disease, fatal infections can occur and HCWs can play a major role in propagating health care facility outbreaks. This investigation highlights the need to continuously review infection control guidance relating to the role of HCWs in MERS-CoV transmission in health care outbreaks, especially as it relates to the complex questions on definition of risky exposures, who to test, and the frequency of MERS-CoV testing; criteria for who to quarantine and for how long; and clearance and return to active duty criteria.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.076602488,0.344768952,-0.175213672,-0.04641093,-0.014320818,0.059520329000000004,-0.033145072000000005,0.426490673,0.339845829,-0.031679945,0.06940378900000001,-0.026241511000000002,-0.07693372400000001,-0.05960831900000001,0.019476574,0.012781765,-0.009622443,-0.086551252,-0.015781145,-0.021284223999999997,-0.038124952999999996,0.02807498,0.009897193,0.019105481,0.002608037,-0.011945488999999998,-0.043894128,0.01458383,-0.015941728,0.027572954
362,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus intermittent positive cases: Implications for infection control,"Background Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to be reported from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Data on the phenomenon of intermittent positive results for MERS-CoV on reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with negative results in between are lacking. Here we describe cases with intermittent positive MERS-CoV test results and highlight the required number of tests to rule out or rule in MERS-CoV infection based on a large retrospective cohort of patients with confirmed MERS-CoV. Methods This analysis included cases admitted between January 2014 and December 2017. The included patients had a minimum of 3 nasopharyngeal MERS-CoV RT-PCR tests for confirmation and needed 2 negative samples for MERS-CoV evaluated 48 hours apart with clinical improvement or stabilization apart to ensure clearance. Results A total of 408 patients with positive MERS-CoV test results were treated at the referring hospital. We excluded 72 patients who had only 1 swab result available in the system and were treated in the initial years of the disease. Of the remaining 336 patients, 300 (89%) had a positive result after 1 swab, 324 (96.5%) had a positive result after 2 consecutive swabs, and 328 (97.6%) had a positive result after 3 consecutive swabs. Of the total cases, 46 (13.7%) had a positive MERS-CoV test then a negative test, followed by positive test results. Conclusions Our data indicate that 2 to 3 nasopharyngeal samples are needed to produce the highest yield of positive results for MERS-CoV. In addition, 2 negative results 48 hours apart with clinical improvement or stabilization are needed to clear patients from MERS-CoV. Evaluation of the yield of sputum samples is needed to assess the effectiveness against nasopharyngeal swabs.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.154096445,0.35280409999999995,-0.144021982,-0.040268282,-0.014244568,-0.019167138,-0.096263526,0.43960480700000004,0.233715265,-0.014678176999999999,0.07061026299999999,-0.007347105,-0.076485323,0.038840676,-0.016491093999999998,-0.021580029,0.040267631,-0.056532074,-0.012901901,-0.048840264,-0.010518058,0.038285742000000005,0.04408271,0.010771608,0.001074272,-0.011294361000000001,-0.010811343999999999,-0.011478898999999999,-0.021485194,0.030417878
372,Clinical presentation and outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome in dialysis patients,"Abstract There was a major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) affecting more than 300 patients occurring in a private housing estate in Hong Kong, in which an infected renal patient was suspected to be the primary source. It is unknown whether renal patients would represent a distinct group of patients who share some characteristics that could predispose them to have higher infectivity. In this context, we have encountered 4 dialysis patients contracting SARS in a minor outbreak, which involved 11 patients and 4 health care workers, in a medical ward of a regional hospital. Of these 4 dialysis patients, 1 patient was receiving hemodialysis while the other 3 patients were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Fever and radiological changes were their dominant presenting features. All were having positive results for SARS-associated coronavirus ribonucleic acid by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction performed on their nasopharyngeal aspirates or stool samples. It appeared that treatment with high-dose intravenous ribavirin and corticosteroids could only resolve the fever, but it could not stop the disease progression. All 4 patients developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation on days 9 through 12. At the end, all of the patients died from sudden cardiac arrest, which was associated with acute myocardial infarction in 2 cases. From this small case series, it appeared that dialysis patients might have an aggressive clinical course and poor outcome after contracting SARS. However, a large-scale study is required to further examine this issue, and further investigation into the immunologic abnormalities associated with the uremic state in this group of patients is also warranted.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.187786201,0.188535736,-0.20918787100000003,-0.134169436,-0.094261604,-0.060336358,-0.135194832,0.00602473,-0.229909648,0.053464388,-0.04480637,0.035414915,0.016058703,0.077752625,-0.036217214,-0.001019488,0.013301946,0.09633754300000001,-0.010284545,0.086507671,0.08108296799999999,-0.09722410599999999,-0.09399446,-0.021267867000000003,-0.058429401,-0.031122526,-0.022251232000000003,0.008115362,-0.09227382099999999,-0.001566103
400,Immunomodulatory and anti-SARS activities of Houttuynia cordata,"Abstract Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a life-threatening form of pneumonia caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). From late 2002 to mid 2003, it infected more than 8000 people worldwide, of which a majority of cases were found in China. Owing to the absence of definitive therapeutic Western medicines, Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (Saururaceae) (HC) was shortlisted by Chinese scientists to tackle SARS problem as it is conventionally used to treat pneumonia. Aim of the study The present study aimed to explore the SARS-preventing mechanisms of HC in the immunological and anti-viral aspects. Results Results showed that HC water extract could stimulate the proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes significantly and dose-dependently. By flow cytometry, it was revealed that HC increased the proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Moreover, it caused a significant increase in the secretion of IL-2 and IL-10 by mouse splenic lymphocytes. In the anti-viral aspect, HC exhibited significant inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). On the other hand, oral acute toxicity test demonstrated that HC was non-toxic to laboratory animals following oral administration at 16g/kg. Conclusion The results of this study provided scientific data to support the efficient and safe use of HC to combat SARS.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.029116517999999997,0.227494476,-0.15603462099999998,-0.036565635,-0.073383933,0.021158842,-0.018791226,-0.17782022600000003,-0.051529436,-0.014692543,-0.004209212,-0.001907895,-0.008395447,-0.019981673000000002,0.010522653,0.028621987999999998,-0.034344942,0.007263703000000001,0.018697852,0.001762208,0.003939187,0.004134777,0.021451348,0.00700855,-0.000531654,0.005797943000000001,0.005420136999999999,0.026931602000000002,0.011629068999999999,-0.021615284
423,Clinical validation of 3 commercial real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays for the detection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus from upper respiratory tract specimens,"Abstract Since discovery of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a novel betacoronavirus first isolated and characterized in 2012, MERS-CoV real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays represent one of the most rapidly expanding commercial tests. However, in the absence of extensive evaluations of these assays on positive clinical material of different sources, evaluating their diagnostic effectiveness remains challenging. We describe the diagnostic performance evaluation of 3 common commercial MERS-CoV rRT-PCR assays on a large panel (n = 234) of upper respiratory tract specimens collected during an outbreak episode in Saudi Arabia. Assays were compared to the RealStar® MERS-CoV RT-PCR (Alton Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany) assay as the gold standard. Results showed i) the TIB MolBiol® LightMix UpE and Orf1a assays (TIB MolBiol, Berlin, Germany) to be the most sensitive, followed by ii) the Anyplex™ Seegene MERS-CoV assay (Seegene, Seoul, Korea), and finally iii) the PrimerDesign™ Genesig® HCoV_2012 assay (PrimerDesign, England, United Kingdom).

429,Characteristic features and outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome found in severe acute respiratory syndrome intensive care unit patients,"Abstract Purpose The aim of the study was to identify characteristic clinical features and outcomes of critically ill patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Materials and Methods This retrospective study enrolled all patients admitted to a 12-bed SARS intensive care unit (ICU) in a tertiary care medical center in Taipei between May 15 and July 17, 2003. Patients with positive results of either reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction or antibody to SARS coronavirus were defined as SARS cases and others with negative results as control cases. Results Of the 50 patients, 14 had confirmed SARS. Demographics were similar between the 2 groups. The highest leukocyte and neutrophil counts, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase; positive end-expiratory pressure; and use of corticosteroids, ribavirin, and intravenous immunoglobulin were higher in the SARS group. In contrast, the lowest lymphocyte count and the ratio of Pao 2 to the fraction of inspired oxygen were lower in the SARS group. Of the 15 deaths in the control group, 12 (80%) occurred during the first 2 weeks after ICU admission. However, in the confirmed SARS group, 5 (55.6%) of the 9 deaths occurred within the third or fourth week. This difference in timing between these 2 groups was significant (P = .004). Conclusions In a SARS ICU, patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS had significantly different clinical features and timing of mortality from those of the control group.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.135152687,0.329517673,-0.23742925899999998,-0.11054896800000001,-0.063365462,-0.026393675,-0.12805431,-0.21170376100000002,-0.225398687,-0.007779454,-0.026199625,0.017957211,-0.0201027,0.001058854,-0.011236383999999999,0.033623594,-0.007555703,0.04678574,0.01733341,0.055939040999999995,0.0032865090000000004,-0.07952352900000001,-0.058991043,-0.010107396999999999,-0.061588040999999996,-0.050385625,-0.008097397,-0.009758016,-0.058840937999999995,-0.010500668999999999
507,Viral load quantitation of SARS-coronavirus RNA using a one-step real-time RT-PCR,"Summary Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease that first occurred in humans in the People's Republic of China in November 2002 and has subsequently spread worldwide. A novel virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family has been identified as the cause of this pulmonary disease. The severity of the disease combined with its rapid spread requires the development of fast and sensitive diagnostic assays. Results A real-time quantitative RT-PCR was designed in the nsp11 region of the replicase 1B domain of the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome. To evaluate this quantitative RT-PCR, cRNA standards were constructed by in vitro transcription of SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 RNA using T7 RNA polymerase, followed by real-time RT-PCR. The assay allowed quantitation over a range of 102 to 108 RNA copies per reaction. Conclusions Extrapolated to clinical samples, this novel assay has a detection range of 104 to 1010 copies of viral genome equivalents per millilitre. In comparison to the current de facto cRNA Artus Biotech standard, the in-house cRNA standard gives a 100-fold higher absolute quantity, suggesting a possible underestimation of the viral load when using the Artus Biotech standard.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.012799919,0.32033848,0.03896083,0.12801875,-0.026747531,-0.08143965,-0.030885244,-0.121786445,-0.036009067,0.004953549,0.015902653,-0.031618761,0.011435046,0.025641397000000003,0.011643486000000002,-0.016555788999999998,0.002586795,0.009449535,0.00020406099999999998,-0.025773424,0.005500625,0.049637758,-0.036598894,0.001039014,-0.05074109,-0.017684224,0.069743997,-0.029262146,0.021813969,0.023109245
509,A family cluster of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus infections related to a likely unrecognized asymptomatic or mild case,"Abstract Background Ninety confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported to the World Health Organization. We report the details of a second family cluster of MERS-CoV infections from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Methods We present the clinical, laboratory and epidemiological details of 3 patients from a family cluster of MERS-CoV infections. Results The first patient developed respiratory symptoms and fever 14 days after admission to hospital for an unrelated reason. He died 11 days later with multi-organ failure. Two of his brothers presented later to another hospital with respiratory symptoms and fever. MERS-CoV infection in the latter 2 patients was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. All 3 patients had fever, cough, shortness of breath, bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and rises in serum creatinine kinase and alanine transaminase. No hospital or other social contacts are known to have acquired the infection. It appears that the index patient in this cluster acquired MERS-CoV infection whilst in hospital from an unrecognized mild or asymptomatic case.

510,Early identification of pneumonia patients at increased risk of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in Saudi Arabia,"Abstract Background The rapid and accurate identification of individuals who are at high risk of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection remains a major challenge for the medical and scientific communities. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a risk prediction model for the screening of suspected cases of MERS-CoV infection in patients who have developed pneumonia. Methods A two-center, retrospective case–control study was performed. A total of 360 patients with confirmed pneumonia who were evaluated for MERS-CoV infection by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) between September 1, 2012 and June 1, 2016 at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh and King Fahad General Hospital in Jeddah, were included. According to the rRT-PCR results, 135 patients were positive for MERS-CoV and 225 were negative. Demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, and radiological and laboratory findings were collected for each subject. Results A risk prediction model to identify pneumonia patients at increased risk of MERS-CoV was developed. The model included male sex, contact with a sick patient or camel, diabetes, severe illness, low white blood cell (WBC) count, low alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and high aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The model performed well in predicting MERS-CoV infection (area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC) 0.8162), on internal validation (AUC 0.8037), and on a goodness-of-fit test (p =0.592). The risk prediction model, which produced an optimal probability cut-off of 0.33, had a sensitivity of 0.716 and specificity of 0.783. Conclusions This study provides a simple, practical, and valid algorithm to identify pneumonia patients at increased risk of MERS-CoV infection. This risk prediction model could be useful for the early identification of patients at the highest risk of MERS-CoV infection. Further validation of the prediction model on a large prospective cohort of representative patients with pneumonia is necessary.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.148955317,0.26134860600000004,-0.14400560699999998,-0.07249811,-0.063817445,-0.001408762,-0.063542132,0.36764197,0.156511238,0.014231200000000001,0.010851911,-0.008905524,-0.049561915,0.009807518000000001,-0.04992491,0.008964796,0.000405266,-0.017649621,-0.04288423,0.012765968,0.011957156000000002,0.018069773,0.067246851,0.035774272999999995,-0.0005861859999999999,-0.04348491,0.009793965,-0.022738129,-0.052937125,0.029137425
522,SARS-coronavirus replicates in mononuclear cells of peripheral blood (PBMCs) from SARS patients,"Abstract Background: The etiologic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently identified, positive single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Little is known about the dynamic changes of the viral replicative form in SARS cases. Objectives: Evaluate whether SARS-CoV can infect and replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of infected persons and reveal any dynamic changes to the virus during the course of the disease. Study design: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from SARS cases infected by the same infectious source were tested for both negative-stranded RNA (minus-RNA, “replicative intermediates”) and positive-stranded RNA (genomic RNA) of SARS-CoV during the course of hospitalization by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: SARS-CoV minus-RNA was detected in PBMCs from SARS patients. The viral replicative forms in PBMCs were detectable during a period of 6 days post-onset of the disease, while the plus-RNA were detectable for a longer period (8–12 days post-onset). Conclusions: SARS-coronavirus can infect and replicate within PBMCs of SARS patients, but viral replication in PBMCs seems subject to self-limitation.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.034762037999999995,0.37822998700000005,-0.236850709,0.049573563,-0.054326567,-0.06085386,-0.08899600099999999,-0.201398065,-0.116976235,0.0018390999999999998,0.074314492,-0.05102059,0.007573524,0.050107662000000004,0.043446162999999996,0.04769069099999999,-0.023985894,-0.016442024,0.0035697109999999997,0.023725372999999998,-0.022474985,0.026290254,-0.044012592,-0.00132222,-0.054872445,-0.054298745999999995,-0.024866031,0.032693843,-0.021976636,0.013715732
529,Expanding the frontiers of existing antiviral drugs: Possible effects of HIV-1 protease inhibitors against SARS and avian influenza,"Abstract When unexpected diseases such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza become a serious threat to public health, an immediate response is imperative. This should take into consideration existing licensed antiviral drugs against other viral diseases already known to be safe for use in humans. In this report, evidence is presented that HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs) currently used in anti-HIV-1 therapies might exert some effects on SARS and perhaps, on avian influenza. Evidence for the potential benefits of PIs against the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is provided by empirical clinical studies, in vivo viral inhibition assays and computational simulations of the docking of these compounds to the active site of the main SARS-CoV protease. As suggested by in silico docking of these molecules to a theoretical model of a subunit of type A influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, there also exists a remote possibility that these PIs may have an effect on avian influenza viruses. Although this evidence is still far from being definitive, the results so far obtained suggest that PIs should be seriously taken into consideration for further testing as potential therapeutic agents for SARS and avian influenza.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.0067424519999999995,0.255021242,-0.206896033,0.169390698,-0.08649001099999999,0.25110018100000003,-0.065047113,-0.20315730199999998,-0.047409494,0.010852114,0.009085459,0.004546028,0.058830254000000005,-0.053999211,0.00916506,0.011195005,-0.035239384,0.052972869000000006,0.042785567999999996,0.027063399,0.003605868,0.020537797,-0.035151819,0.059149985,-0.00161479,-0.028939943,-0.013853198999999998,-0.042034607,0.08488584,0.0008644810000000001
545,Kinetics and pattern of viral excretion in biological specimens of two MERS-CoV cases,"Abstract Background Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging coronavirus involved in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and rapid renal failure. Hospital outbreak and nosocomial transmission were reported, however, several issues remain on the viral excretion course. Objectives Describe the kinetics and pattern of viral excretion in two infected patients. Study design After the initial diagnosis, blood, urine, rectal and respiratory samples were collected regularly, aliquoted and stored at −80°C. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay targeted the UpE and Orf1a regions of the MERS-CoV genome. Results In patient 1, who died of refractory ARDS and renal failure, MERS-CoV RNA was detected in pharyngeal and tracheal swabs, as well blood samples and urine samples until the 30th day. Rectal swabs were negative. Patient 2 also developed multiple-organ failure, but survived, with persisting renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance at 30mL/min) and persistent interstitial syndrome albeit weaned off mechanical ventilation and no longer requiring oxygen. Tracheal aspirations were positive until the 33rd day, while nasopharyngeal swabs were negative. All other biological samples were negative. Discussion Lower respiratory tract excretion of MERS-CoV could be observed for more than one month. The most severely ill patient presented an expression of the virus in blood and urine, consistent with a type-1 interferon mediated immunological response impaired in patient 1, but developed by patient 2. These results suggest that infection control precautions must be adequately evaluated in clinical wards and laboratories exposed to MERS-CoV.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.11079170699999999,0.265824108,-0.102957544,-0.025568225,-0.013231806,-0.029925464,-0.044076935,0.281422142,0.20813115100000001,0.005901165999999999,0.062550171,-0.036734129,-0.020289072,0.03591874,0.026200621,-0.028559971,0.007943077,-0.06964756799999999,0.017418667,0.007049876,0.014054371000000001,-0.007742605,-0.006382538,0.0064620680000000005,-0.006537079,-0.034999102000000004,-0.050048452,0.006683921999999999,-0.036008201000000004,-0.021677047999999997
548,The clinical impact of coronavirus infection in patients with hematologic malignancies and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients,"Abstract Background Compared to other respiratory viruses, relatively little is known about the clinical impact of coronavirus (CoV) infection after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or in patients with hematologic malignancies. Objectives To characterize the role of CoV in respiratory tract infections among HSCT and hematologic malignancy patients. Study design We conducted a retrospective review of all cases of CoV infection documented by polymerase chain reaction, (PCR)-based testing on nasopharyngeal and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples between June 2010 and 2013. Cases of CoV infection occurring in HSCT and hematologic malignancy patients were identified and the clinical characteristics of these cases were compared to other respiratory viruses. Results CoV was identified in 2.6% (n =43) of all samples analyzed (n =1661) and in 6.8% of all samples testing positive for a respiratory virus (n =631). 33 of 38 (86.8%) of patients in whom CoV was identified were HSCT and hematologic malignancy patients. Among these patients, CoV was detected in 9.7% of unique infection episodes, with only rhinovirus/enterovirus (RhV/EnV) infection being more common. Group I CoV subtypes accounted for 76.3% of cases, and 57% of infections were diagnosed between December and March. CoV infection was associated with upper respiratory tract symptoms in most patients, similar to other respiratory viruses. Possible and proven lower respiratory tract disease was less common compared to other respiratory viruses except RhV/EnV. Conclusions CoV is frequently detected in HSCT and hematologic malignancy patients in whom suspicion for a respiratory viral infection exists, but is less likely to progress to lower respiratory tract disease than most other respiratory viruses.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.23048954800000002,0.15986230199999998,-0.20302478899999998,-0.0030782340000000004,0.02327658,-0.07245056700000001,-0.011742755,0.115811615,0.053906874,0.073266544,-0.0062522459999999995,-0.021502312000000003,0.037355078,0.055823091,0.021090166,-0.048377598,0.048945965,-0.032888352,0.040234963,0.047376580999999994,0.068987984,-0.085480998,-0.02878408,0.046817812,0.031468246,-0.006999002,-0.05865777900000001,0.001314087,-0.013783591000000001,-0.040775238
551,External quality assessment for the molecular detection of MERS-CoV in China,"Abstract Background In May 2015, an imported case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection occurred in China, so rapid and reliable diagnosis of suspected cases was necessary. Objectives An external quality assessment (EQA) program for the molecular detection of MERS-CoV was organized by the National Center for Clinical Laboratories (NCCL). Study design MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs) encapsulating specific RNA sequences of MERS-CoV were prepared as positive specimens. The assessment panel, which comprised of three negative and seven positive samples with different concentrations of VLPs, was distributed to 56 laboratories from 16 provinces, municipalities, or autonomous regions for molecular detection. Results Among the received data sets, three employed an in-house-developed real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay and the others applied various commercial rRT-PCR kits. Overall, the majority of laboratories (46/56, 82.1%) could achieve 100% accuracy for MERS-CoV detection, but three laboratories (5.4%) still had room for improvement. Consequently, all negative samples were identified correctly, reaching 100% specificity. The false-negative rate was 3.1%, and most of the false-negative results were obtained from samples with relatively low concentration, indicating an urgent need to improve detection in weak-positive specimens. Conclusions The majority of participants possessed reliable diagnostic capacity for the detection of MERS-CoV. Moreover, EQA is indispensable because it can help enhance the diagnostic capability for the surveillance of MERS-CoV infections and allow comparison of the results among different laboratories.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.089362207,0.298913177,0.015065038000000001,0.045121096,0.00725774,-0.019779205,-0.027389626,0.306492328,0.23143943100000003,0.006675241,0.044843398,-0.029355517,-0.02537147,-0.03225645,0.030296187000000002,-0.025665896,-0.007445613,-0.07635786,0.015955061,-0.07793451400000001,-0.023673563999999998,0.026243192000000002,0.068016884,-0.024583296,-0.002951811,-0.025066414,-0.025470784,0.003348215,-0.029630924,0.022461141
564,Structural analysis of inhibition mechanisms of Aurintricarboxylic Acid on SARS-CoV polymerase and other proteins,"Abstract We recently published experimental results that indicated Aurintricarboxylic Acid (ATA) could selectively inhibit SARS-CoV replication inside host cells by greater than 1000 times. This inhibition suggested that ATA could be developed as potent anti-viral drug. Here, to extend our experimental observation, we have incorporated protein structural studies (with positive/negative controls) to investigate the potential binding modes/sites of ATA onto RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from SARS-CoV and other pathogenic positive-strand RNA-viruses, as well as other proteins in SARS-CoV based on the fact that ATA binds to Ca2+-activated neutral protease (m-calpain), the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) and HIV integrase which have existing crystal structures. Eight regions with homologous 3D-conformation were derived for 10 proteins of interest. One of the region, R binding (754–766 in SARS-CoV's RdRp), located in the palm sub-domain mainly constituted of anti-parallel β-strand-turn-β-strand hairpin structures that covers two of the three RdRp catalytic sites (Asp 760, Asp761), was also predicted by molecular docking method (based on free energy of binding ΔG) to be important binding motif recognized by ATA. The existence of this strictly conserved region that incorporated catalytic residues, coupled with the homologous ATA binding pockets and their consistent ΔG values, suggested strongly ATA may be involved in an analogous inhibition mechanism of SARS-COV's RdRp in concomitant to the case in m-calpain, PTP and HIV integrase.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.153129344,0.20473475300000002,-0.16549687,0.056222044000000006,-0.061708498,-0.003654918,0.012631163,-0.083399005,-0.014971718,-0.00409095,0.03495683,0.078927117,-0.055524682,-0.06723993,-0.036893965,-0.022520425,0.042032259,-0.03463502,-0.00669265,-0.039195953,-0.007390304,0.01281944,0.042958185,-0.009993419,0.029458566000000002,0.022437825,-0.014663253000000001,0.015879352,0.061171283,0.047391057
566,Molecular Diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome The State of the Art,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first appeared in Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002. Although virus isolation and serology were useful early in the SARS outbreak for diagnosing new cases, these tests are not generally useful because virus culture requires a BSL-3 laboratory and seroconversion is often delayed until 2 to 3 weeks after infection. The first qualitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-coronavirus (CoV) were sensitive and capable of detecting 1 to 10 genome equivalents. These assays were quickly supplemented with quantitative real-time assays that helped elucidate the natural history of SARS, particularly the initial presence of low viral loads in the upper respiratory tract and high viral loads in the lower respiratory tract. The unique natural history of SARS-CoV infection dictates the testing of both respiratory and nonrespiratory specimens, the testing of multiple specimens from the same patient, and sending out positives to be confirmed by a reference laboratory. Commercially available reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS have recently appeared; however, meaningful evaluations of these assays have not yet been performed and their true performance has not been determined. These and other issues related to diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection are discussed in this review.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.108566626,0.43337018200000005,-0.172521182,0.05183419,-0.056560432,-0.016359136,-0.035346584,-0.240664346,-0.015262866000000002,0.030366865,-0.014425588999999999,-0.04859441,0.090938506,-0.060364838,0.06970775400000001,-0.006577663,-0.038823719,-0.007751202,-0.0035359209999999996,-0.006477725,0.01588824,-0.027617117000000004,-0.014894191000000001,-0.038423433,-0.044437212000000004,-0.020341877,-0.009511058000000001,-0.002048129,-0.019847023000000002,-0.020666817
569,"Clinical picture, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in children","Summary Children are susceptible to infection by SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) but the clinical picture of SARS is milder than in adults. Teenagers resemble adults in presentation and disease progression and may develop severe illness requiring intensive care and assisted ventilation. Fever, malaise, cough, coryza, chills or rigor, sputum production, headache, myalgia, leucopaenia, lymphopaenia, thrombocytopaenia, mildly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin times and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels are common presenting features. Radiographic findings are non-specific but high-resolution computed tomography of the thorax in clinically suspected cases may be an early diagnostic aid when initial chest radiographs appear normal. The improved reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are critical in the early diagnosis of SARS, with sensitivity approaching 80% in the first 3 days of illness when performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates, the preferred specimens. Absence of seroconversion to SARS-CoV beyond 28 days from disease onset generally excludes the diagnosis. The best treatment strategy for SARS among children remains to be determined. No case fatality has been reported in children and the short- to medium-term outcome appears to be good. The importance of continued monitoring for any long-term complications due to the disease or its empiric treatment, cannot be overemphasised.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.10611295800000001,0.31347558600000003,-0.151054277,-0.031434208,-0.079787071,-0.027226115,-0.039249829,-0.19577687,-0.033177777,-0.016287283,0.009921846,-0.026113233,0.011521834,-0.070423657,0.011695917,0.046832372000000004,-0.045899463,0.049220062,-0.047570061,-0.013057316999999999,-0.027307951,0.048378214,-0.055511297,-0.016672585,-0.025214672999999996,0.012221785,0.003156354,-0.006085465,0.033461329,0.002272256
573,SARS associated coronavirus has a recombinant polymerase and coronaviruses have a history of host-shifting,"Abstract The sudden appearance and potential lethality of severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in humans has focused attention on understanding its origins. Here, we assess phylogenetic relationships for the SARS-CoV lineage as well as the history of host-species shifts for SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses. We used a Bayesian phylogenetic inference approach with sliding window analyses of three SARS-CoV proteins: RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S). Conservation of RDRP allowed us to use a set of Arteriviridae taxa to root the Coronaviridae phylogeny. We found strong evidence for a recombination breakpoint within SARS-CoV RDRP, based on different, well supported trees for a 5′ fragment (supporting SARS-CoV as sister to a clade including all other coronaviruses) and a 3′ fragment (supporting SARS-CoV as sister to group three avian coronaviruses). These different topologies are statistically significant: the optimal 5′ tree could be rejected for the 3′ region, and the optimal 3′ tree could be rejected for the 5′ region. We did not find statistical evidence for recombination in analyses of N and S, as there is little signal to differentiate among alternative trees. Comparison of phylogenetic trees for 11 known host-species and 36 coronaviruses, representing coronavirus groups 1–3 and SARS-CoV, based on N showed statistical incongruence indicating multiple host-species shifts for coronaviruses. Inference of host-species associations is highly sensitive to sampling and must be considered cautiously. However, current sampling suggests host-species shifts between mouse and rat, chicken and turkey, mammals and manx shearwater, and humans and other mammals. The sister relationship between avian coronaviruses and the 3′ RDRP fragment of SARS-CoV suggests an additional host-species shift. Demonstration of recombination in the SARS-CoV lineage indicates its potential for rapid unpredictable change, a potentially important challenge for public health management and for drug and vaccine development.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.091318858,0.456167575,-0.25821747100000003,0.058927877999999996,0.113792024,0.066048785,0.070023705,-0.14063315,-0.044139309,0.02480218,0.007826243,-0.007746571999999999,-0.00644889,-0.065424357,-0.020448658999999998,0.031972924,-0.024205143999999998,-0.0251148,-0.013147477,0.020719118999999998,0.02295542,-0.021362028999999998,0.029780547999999997,0.060456262000000004,-0.006692074,-0.026117157999999998,0.00817622,-0.004897469000000001,0.023446619,0.034437699
574,Evidence from the evolutionary analysis of nucleotide sequences for a recombinant history of SARS-CoV,"Abstract The origins and evolutionary history of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) remain an issue of uncertainty and debate. Based on evolutionary analyses of coronavirus DNA sequences, encompassing an approximately 13kb stretch of the SARS-TOR2 genome, we provide evidence that SARS-CoV has a recombinant history with lineages of types I and III coronavirus. We identified a minimum of five recombinant regions ranging from 83 to 863bp in length and including the polymerase, nsp9, nsp10, and nsp14.

605,MERS-CoV diagnosis: An update,"Summary Diagnosis of MERS-Cov still a major concern in most of daignostic laboratories. To date the Real-time Polymerase Chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the mainstay for diagnosis of MERS-CoV. RT-PCR has limitations, including a long turnaround time and lack of common measurements and correlations with Viral Load (VL). It is recommended to screen for MERS-CoV using RT-PCR of the upstream of envelope gene (upE) followed by confirmation of the presence of one of the following genes; open reading frame 1A, 1B genes or nucleocapsid (N) gene. Scientists are looking to implement viral sequencing on all negative samples by RT-PCR and they beleive that can be exposed to another level of testing using sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene or N gene and in this case a positive result is diagnostic. It is also very important to maintain a contineous and random sequencing for MERS-Cov samples to be able to pick early viral mutations.

612,"Emerging Developments on Pathogenicity, Molecular Virulence, Epidemiology and Clinical Symptoms of Current Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)","Abstract Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a recently reported virus that is associated with severe, life threatening and rapidly spreading primarily respiratory illness called the Middle East respiratory syndrome. MERS-CoV possesses a unique positive-sense single-stranded RNA and can undergo rapid mutation in the viral genome. This results in antigenic switching and genetic variation, finally leading to the emergence of novel and new MERS-CoV subtypes which are uncontrollable by vaccines. Researchers are also finding difficulties to sort out therapeutic intervention strategies for MERS-CoV. This virus can spread from human to human, but transmission from dromedary camels to humans plays a crucial epidemiological significance. Dromedary camel acts as “gene mixing vessels” for MERS-CoV and these virus particles undergo rapid change in them.

619,"Nucleocapsid gene analysis from an imported case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Malaysia","Abstract Objective To describe the complete nucleocapsid (N) gene region of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) from imported case in Malaysia and the relations with human- and camel-derived MERS-CoV. Methods Combination of throat and nasal swab specimens was subjected to viral RNA extraction. For screening, the extracted RNA was subjected to real-time RT-PCR targeting upstream of E gene, open reading frame 1b and open reading frame 1a. For confirmation, the RNA was subjected to RT-PCR targeting partial part of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nucleocapsid, followed by amplification of complete N gene region. Nucleotide sequencing of the first Malaysian case of MERS-CoV was performed following the confirmation with real-time RT-PCR detection. Results Initial analysis of partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and N gene revealed that the nucleotides had high similarity to Jeddah_1_2013 strain. Analysis of complete N gene region (1 242 nucleotides) from the case showed high similarity and yet distinct to the nucleotide sequences of camel-derived MERS-CoV.

626,Revisiting the dangers of the coronavirus in the ophthalmology practice,"A possible threat in the ophthalmology clinic While the 2019-nCoV transmission route is still unknown, countries have been preparing measures based on past experiences with coronaviruses namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These viruses transmit primarily through droplets and other bodily secretions. In the ophthalmology practice, healthcare workers may be particularly susceptible to these infections. Firstly, ophthalmologists are extremely reliant on physical examination during patient consultation. Of particular concern is the proximity between the patient and ophthalmologist during the slit lamp microscope examination. It has been shown that droplets from a cough or sneeze can be propelled for up to 6?m [8], a range that definitely encompasses the distance between the patient and ophthalmologist. Secondly, during the SARS-CoV epidemic, clinical reports have suggested tears as a medium of infection. In a case series by Loon et al., it was shown that viral RNA of the SARS-CoV can be detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the tears of infected individuals [9]. While anecdotal in nature, such accounts highlight the possible infectivity of tears, a fluid which ophthalmologists and instruments come in contact on a daily basis. If true, this represents a crucial need for further development of disinfection and personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols for the ophthalmology clinic.SN - 1476-5454",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.013102703,0.33224816100000004,-0.105490974,0.014053794,-0.035649405,0.026204178999999998,-0.014223447,0.016567835,0.066476985,0.002764854,0.028529101,-0.016022171,0.002290959,-0.036734362,0.042047065999999994,0.032706249,-0.004343584,0.036594068,-0.058306595999999995,-0.00199463,-0.052882394000000006,0.022400503999999998,-0.063323532,0.044688770999999995,0.034396468,0.021574039,0.010101831,0.031341887,0.00670591,-0.009945079

It is timely to systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development. A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used. A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been published. A commercial RT-PCR kit developed by the Beijing Genomic Institute is currently widely used in China and likely in Asia. However, serological assays as well as point-of-care testing kits have not been developed but are likely in the near future. Several vaccine candidates are in the pipeline. The likely earliest Phase 1 vaccine trial is a synthetic DNA-based candidate. A number of novel compounds as well as therapeutics licensed for other conditions appear to have in vitro efficacy against the 2019-nCoV. Some are being tested in clinical trials against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, while others have been listed for clinical trials against 2019-nCoV.

Clinical course was summarized, including requirement for supplemental oxygen and intensive care and use of empirical treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir.Among the 18 hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (median age, 47 years; 9 [50%] women), clinical presentation was an upper respiratory tract infection in 12 (67%), and viral shedding from the nasopharynx was prolonged for 7 days or longer among 15 (83%). Six individuals (33%) required supplemental oxygen; of these, 2 required intensive care. There were no deaths. Virus was detectable in the stool (4/8 [50%]) and blood (1/12 [8%]) by PCR but not in urine. Five individuals requiring supplemental oxygen were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir. For 3 of the 5 patients, fever resolved and supplemental oxygen requirement was reduced within 3 days, whereas 2 deteriorated with progressive respiratory failure. Four of the 5 patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir developed nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea, and 3 developed abnormal liver function test results.Among the first 18 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Singapore, clinical presentation was frequently a mild respiratory tract infection.

630,Learning from the Past: Possible Urgent Prevention and Treatment Options for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections Caused by 2019-nCoV,"With the current trajectory of the 2019-nCoV outbreak unknown, public health and medicinal measures will both be needed to contain spreading of the virus and to optimize patient outcomes. Although little is known about the virus, an examination of the genome sequence shows strong homology with its better-studied cousin, SARS-CoV. The spike protein used for host cell infection shows key nonsynonymous mutations that might hamper the efficacy of previously developed therapeutics but remains a viable target for the development of biologics and macrocyclic peptides. Other key drug targets, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro), share a strikingly high (>95 %) homology to SARS-CoV. Herein, we suggest four potential drug candidates (an ACE2-based peptide, remdesivir, 3CLpro-1 and a novel vinylsulfone protease inhibitor) that could be used to treat patients suffering with the 2019-nCoV. We also summarize previous efforts into drugging these targets and hope to help in the development of broad-spectrum anti-coronaviral agents for future epidemics.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.078614506,0.18132025100000002,-0.12416591099999999,0.009656595,-0.075105061,0.06412338299999999,0.006810511,-0.026287933,0.00063827,0.030756399,-0.025357055,0.018987276,0.041879711,-0.075392377,-0.007827228,-0.018602553,-0.036584649,0.10134944300000001,0.004612928,0.012106391000000001,-0.036079478,0.043213222,-0.09510409800000001,0.006984964000000001,0.042885781,0.064100423,0.140594184,-0.021546885,0.03760152,-0.042240278
632,Evaluation of coronavirus in tears and conjunctival secretions of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the presence of novel coronavirus in tears and conjunctival secretions of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. METHODS: A prospective interventional case series study was performed, and 30 confirmed novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) patients were selected at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University from January 26, 2020 to February 9, 2020. At an interval of 2-3 days, tear and conjunctival secretions were collected twice with disposable sampling swabs for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. RESULTS: 21 common type and 9 severe type NCP patients were enrolled. Two samples of tear and conjunctival secretions were obtained from the only one patient with conjunctivitis yielded positive RT-PCR results. 58 samples from other patents were all negative. CONCLUSION: We speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may be detected in the tears and conjunctival secretions in NCP patients with conjunctivitis. This article is protected by copyright.

633,From SARS and MERS CoVs to SARS-CoV-2: moving toward more biased codon usage in viral structural and non-structural genes,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging disease with fatal outcomes. In this study, a fundamental knowledge gap question is to be resolved by evaluating the differences in biological and pathogenic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and the changes in SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with the two prior major COV epidemics, SARS and MERS coronaviruses. METHODS: The genome composition, nucleotides analysis, codon usage indices, relative synonymous codons usage (RESU) and effective number of codons (ENc) were analysed in the four structural genes; Spike (S), Envelope (E), membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) genes, and two of the most important non-structural genes comprising RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, Beta-CoV from pangolins, bat SARS, MERS and SARS CoVs. These genes include Spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), Envelop(E) and membrane (M) genes. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 prefers pyrimidine rich codons to purines. Most high-frequency codons were ending with A or T, while the low frequency and rare codons were ending with G or C. SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins showed 5-20 lower ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS and MERS CoVs. This implies higher codon bias and higher gene expression efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. SARS-CoV-2 encoded the highest number of over biased and negatively biased codons. Pangolin Beta-CoV showed little differences with SARS-CoV-2 ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS and MERS CoV. CONCLUSION: Extreme bias and lower ENc values of SARS-CoV-2, especially in Spike, Envelope and Mpro genes, are suggestive for higher gene expression efficiency, compared with SARS, bat SARS and MERS CoVs.

634,The potential chemical structure of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,"An outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan and it has rapidly spread to almost all parts of the world. For coronaviruses, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an important protease that catalyze the replication of RNA from RNA template and is an attractive therapeutic target. In this study, we screened these chemical structures from traditional Chinese medicinal compounds proven to show anti-viral activity in SARS-CoV and the similar chemical structures through a molecular docking study to target RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We found that theaflavin has a lower idock score in the catalytic pocket of RdRp in SARS-CoV-2 (-9.11 kcal/mol), SARS-CoV (-8.03 kcal/mol) and MERS-CoV (-8.26 kcal/mol) from idock. To confirm the result, we discovered that theaflavin has a lower binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol when it docks in the catalytic pocket of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by using the Blind Docking server. Regarding contact modes, hydrophobic interactions contribute significantly in binding and additional hydrogen bonds were found between theaflavin and RdRp. Moreover, one π-cation interaction was formed between theaflavin and Arg553 from the Blind Docking server. Our results suggest that theaflavin could be potential SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitor for further study. This article is protected by copyright.

635,The antiviral compound remdesivir potently inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,"Antiviral drugs for managing infections with human coronaviruses are not yet approved, posing a serious challenge to current global efforts aimed at containing the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Remdesivir (RDV) is an investigational compound with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). RDV is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). Here, we co-expressed the MERS-CoV nonstructural proteins nsp5, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 (RdRp) in insect cells as a part a polyprotein to study the mechanism of inhibition of MERS-CoV RdRp by RDV. We initially demonstrated that nsp8 and nsp12 form an active complex. The triphosphate form of the inhibitor (RDV-TP) competes with its natural counterpart ATP. Of note, the selectivity value for RDV-TP obtained here with a steady-state approach suggests that it is more efficiently incorporated than ATP and two other nucleotide analogues. Once incorporated at position i, the inhibitor caused RNA synthesis arrest at position i+3. Hence, the likely mechanism of action is delayed RNA chain termination. The additional three nucleotides may protect the inhibitor from excision by the viral 3'-5' exonuclease activity. Together, these results help to explain the high potency of RDV against RNA viruses in cell-based assays.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.11580462300000001,0.209358039,-0.192103985,0.10402681300000001,-0.049002485,-0.008406875,0.04867593,0.098360252,0.11804317800000001,0.032125881,0.085215599,0.055365272,-0.034819188,-0.024173636000000002,-0.010158695,-0.017473938,0.012863533,-0.016895728999999998,0.03745098,-0.017371867,0.000472808,0.0014788610000000002,0.06392819599999999,0.031025321,0.037553672,0.0029226990000000004,-0.028455657000000002,0.016362336,0.04383748,0.018026142
636,2019 novel coronavirus: an emerging global threat,"The coronavirus (CoV) epidemic that began in China in December 2019 follows earlier epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV in China and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV in Saudi Arabia. The full genome of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has now been shared, and data have been gathered from several case series. As of February 11, 2020, there have been 45,182 laboratory-confirmed cases, the vast majority in China, with 1115 deaths, for an overall case-fatality rate of 2.5%. Cases have been confirmed in 27 countries. On average, each patient infects 2.2 other people. Symptomatic infection appears to predominantly affect adults, with a 5-day estimated incubation period between infection and symptom onset. The most common presenting symptoms are fever, cough, dyspnea, and myalgias and/or fatigue.

641,Potential preanalytical and analytical vulnerabilities in the laboratory diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"A novel zoonotic coronavirus outbreak is spreading all over the world. This pandemic disease has now been defined as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and is sustained by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As the current gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens, the diagnostic accuracy of this technique shall be considered a foremost prerequisite. Overall, potential RT-PCR vulnerabilities include general preanalytical issues such as identification problems, inadequate procedures for collection, handling, transport and storage of the swabs, collection of inappropriate or inadequate material (for quality or volume), presence of interfering substances, manual errors, as well as specific aspects such as sample contamination and testing patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. Some analytical problems may also contribute to jeopardize the diagnostic accuracy, including testing outside the diagnostic window, active viral recombination, use of inadequately validated assays, insufficient harmonization, instrument malfunctioning, along with other specific technical issues. Some practical indications can hence be identified for minimizing the risk of diagnostic errors, encompassing the improvement of diagnostic accuracy by combining clinical evidence with results of chest computed tomography (CT) and RT-PCR, interpretation of RT-PCR results according to epidemiologic, clinical and radiological factors, recollection and testing of upper (or lower) respiratory specimens in patients with negative RT-PCR test results and high suspicion or probability of infection, dissemination of clear instructions for specimen (especially swab) collection, management and storage, together with refinement of molecular target(s) and thorough compliance with analytical procedures, including quality assurance.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.135846898,0.237684134,0.057899982,0.041169778,-0.052343861,-0.043034891,-0.029461607999999997,0.021652783,-0.035160588,0.052787626,0.0042189129999999995,-0.0041372,0.076185315,0.019304743,0.016918616,-0.001052524,0.006457163,0.057897995,-0.056264746,-0.092551381,0.000460679,0.004150614,-0.06964348299999999,-0.087308518,0.027126661,0.037099254,0.092016875,-0.054607996,0.02715702,-0.040195678

652,Absence of association between angiotensin converting enzyme polymorphism and development of adult respiratory distress syndrome in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome: a case control study,"BACKGROUND: It has been postulated that genetic predisposition may influence the susceptibility to SARS-coronavirus infection and disease outcomes. A recent study has suggested that the deletion allele (D allele) of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene is associated with hypoxemia in SARS patients. Moreover, the ACE D allele has been shown to be more prevalent in patients suffering from adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a previous study. Thus, we have investigated the association between ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and the progression to ARDS or requirement of intensive care in SARS patients. METHOD: One hundred and forty genetically unrelated Chinese SARS patients and 326 healthy volunteers were recruited. The ACE I/D genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction and agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: There is no significant difference in the genotypic distributions and the allelic frequencies of the ACE I/D polymorphism between the SARS patients and the healthy control subjects. Moreover, there is also no evidence that ACE I/D polymorphism is associated with the progression to ARDS or the requirement of intensive care in the SARS patients. In multivariate logistic analysis, age is the only factor associated with the development of ARDS while age and male sex are independent factors associated with the requirement of intensive care. CONCLUSION: The ACE I/D polymorphism is not directly related to increased susceptibility to SARS-coronavirus infection and is not associated with poor outcomes after SARS-coronavirus infection.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.059792912999999996,0.192849363,-0.154590905,-0.119797808,-0.052658622,-0.017307012,-0.07126394700000001,-0.144939126,-0.137346839,-0.009711858,-0.037106381,0.03249838,0.00680773,0.004274043,-0.035085379,0.051303594,-0.022546995,0.004927706,-0.008041290999999999,0.03846441,0.032850177,-0.065329615,-0.019135129,0.040322628,-0.028469908999999998,-0.070518149,-0.027460599999999998,-0.053838575,-0.039684979,-0.004273739
656,Association of SARS susceptibility with single nucleic acid polymorphisms of OAS1 and MxA genes: a case-control study,"BACKGROUND: Host genetic factors may play a role in susceptibility and resistance to SARS associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection. The study was carried out to investigate the association between the genetic polymorphisms of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) gene as well as myxovirus resistance 1 (MxA) gene and susceptibility to SARS in Chinese Han population. METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted. A collective of 66 SARS cases and 64 close contact uninfected controls were enrolled in this study. End point real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-based Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis were used to detect the single nucleic polymorphisms (SNPs) in OAS1 and MxA genes. Information on other factors associated with SARS infection was collected using a pre-tested questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were conducted. RESULTS: One polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the OAS1 gene was associated with SARS infection. Compared to AA genotype, AG and GG genotypes were found associated with a protective effect on SARS infection with ORs (95% CI) of 0.42 (0.20~0.89) and 0.30 (0.09~0.97), respectively. Also, a GT genotype at position 88 in the MxA gene promoter was associated with increased susceptibility to SARS infection compared to a GG genotype (OR = 3.06, 95% CI: 1.25~7.50). The associations of AG genotype in OAS1 and GT genotype in MxA remained significant in multivariate analyses after adjusting for SARS protective measures (OR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.14~0.98 and OR = 3.22, 95% CI: 1.13~9.18, respectively).

660,Using patient-collected clinical samples and sera to detect and quantify the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV),"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused a large outbreak of pneumonia in Beijing, China, in 2003. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect and quantify SARS-CoV in 934 sera and self-collected throat washes and fecal samples from 271 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS managed at a single institution. RESULTS: SARS-CoV detection rates in sera were highest in the first 9 days of illness, whereas detection was highest in throat washes 5–14 days after onset of symptoms. The highest SARS-CoV RT-PCR rates (70.4–86.3%) and viral loads (log(10 )4.5–6.1) were seen in fecal samples collected 2–4 weeks after the onset of clinical illness. Fecal samples were frequently SARS-CoV RT-PCR positive beyond 40 days, and occasional sera still had SARS-CoV detected after 3 weeks of illness. CONCLUSION: In the context of an extensive outbreak with major pressure on hospital resources, patient self-collected samples are an alternative to nasopharyngeal aspirates for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV infection.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.133015498,0.50597538,-0.15773539,0.015792074,-0.005481598000000001,-0.026901155,-0.088156852,-0.191880575,-0.067566017,-0.026686533999999998,0.033888625,-0.014570679,-0.038848647,-0.000651221,0.049935775999999994,-1.58e-06,-0.0061297769999999994,-0.021994202999999997,0.010117346999999999,-0.035866197999999995,-0.006101351999999999,0.051741549000000005,-0.039665069,0.030090887,-0.006131507,-0.008273605,0.0058293,0.018932552,-0.004789955,-0.004505589
718,Mechanism of Nucleic Acid Unwinding by SARS-CoV Helicase,"The non-structural protein 13 (nsp13) of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a helicase that separates double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or DNA (dsDNA) with a 5′→3′ polarity, using the energy of nucleotide hydrolysis. We determined the minimal mechanism of helicase function by nsp13. We showed a clear unwinding lag with increasing length of the double-stranded region of the nucleic acid, suggesting the presence of intermediates in the unwinding process. To elucidate the nature of the intermediates we carried out transient kinetic analysis of the nsp13 helicase activity. We demonstrated that the enzyme unwinds nucleic acid in discrete steps of 9.3 base-pairs (bp) each, with a catalytic rate of 30 steps per second. Therefore the net unwinding rate is ∼280 base-pairs per second. We also showed that nsp12, the SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), enhances (2-fold) the catalytic efficiency of nsp13 by increasing the step size of nucleic acid (RNA/RNA or DNA/DNA) unwinding. This effect is specific for SARS-CoV nsp12, as no change in nsp13 activity was observed when foot-and-mouth-disease virus RdRp was used in place of nsp12. Our data provide experimental evidence that nsp13 and nsp12 can function in a concerted manner to improve the efficiency of viral replication and enhance our understanding of nsp13 function during SARS-CoV RNA synthesis.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.14531801,0.19329697699999998,-0.141096154,0.083583593,-0.048901115999999994,-0.048904086,0.01558843,-0.08124924,-0.031868257000000004,0.022875005,0.053845347,0.048619447999999996,-0.028220161,-0.08218344400000001,-0.020918342,0.015860729,0.0047930740000000005,-0.040128175,-0.004595287,-0.016728688000000002,-0.029111981000000002,-0.027226331,0.043489476,-0.050421423,0.006336638,-0.007550332,-0.08623829599999999,0.053085465,-0.007679646,0.035623986
766,Distinct Immune Response in Two MERS-CoV-Infected Patients: Can We Go from Bench to Bedside?,"One year after the occurrence of the first case of infection by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) there is no clear consensus on the best treatment to propose. The World Health Organization, as well as several other national agencies, are still working on different clinical approaches to implement the most relevant treatment in MERS-CoV infection. We compared innate and adaptive immune responses of two patients infected with MERS-CoV to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in the response and propose potential therapeutic approaches. Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) of the first week and sera of the first month from the two patients were used in this study. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) was performed after extraction of RNA from BAL cells of MERS-CoV infected patients and control patients. BAL supernatants and sera were used to assess cytokines and chemokines secretion by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The first patient died rapidly after 3 weeks in the intensive care unit, the second patient still recovers from infection. The patient with a poor outcome (patient 1), compared to patient 2, did not promote type-1 Interferon (IFN), and particularly IFNα, in response to double stranded RNA (dsRNA) from MERS-CoV. The absence of IFNα, known to promote antigen presentation in response to viruses, impairs the development of a robust antiviral adaptive Th-1 immune response. This response is mediated by IL-12 and IFNγ that decreases viral clearance; levels of both of these mediators were decreased in patient 1. Finally, we confirm previous in vitro findings that MERS-CoV can drive IL-17 production in humans. Host recognition of viral dsRNA determines outcome in the early stage of MERS-CoV infection. We highlight the critical role of IFNα in this initial stage to orchestrate a robust immune response and bring substantial arguments for the indication of early IFNα treatment during MERS-CoV infection.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.034101776,0.27337221100000003,-0.168943397,-0.060813793,-0.103564931,0.032149212,0.000317535,0.333775204,0.25408815100000004,0.021718689,0.017555795,-0.068703577,-0.023799815,0.068163903,-0.027614,-0.014272375,-0.0032472440000000003,-0.054062629,-0.036397771,0.014922306000000001,0.028211016000000002,-0.022404159,0.042716673,0.040055996,-0.040379094,-0.064867548,0.015551374,-0.010474373,-0.026097558,0.048103664000000004
777,Antibody-dependent infection of human macrophages by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,"BACKGROUND: Public health risks associated to infection by human coronaviruses remain considerable and vaccination is a key option for preventing the resurgence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We have previously reported that antibodies elicited by a SARS-CoV vaccine candidate based on recombinant, full-length SARS-CoV Spike-protein trimers, trigger infection of immune cell lines. These observations prompted us to investigate the molecular mechanisms and responses to antibody-mediated infection in human macrophages. METHODS: We have used primary human immune cells to evaluate their susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV in the presence of anti-Spike antibodies. Fluorescence microscopy and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were utilized to assess occurrence and consequences of infection. To gain insight into the underlying molecular mechanism, we performed mutational analysis with a series of truncated and chimeric constructs of fragment crystallizable γ receptors (FcγR), which bind antibody-coated pathogens. RESULTS: We show here that anti-Spike immune serum increased infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages by replication-competent SARS-CoV as well as Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles (SARS-CoVpp). Macrophages infected with SARS-CoV, however, did not support productive replication of the virus. Purified anti-viral IgGs, but not other soluble factor(s) from heat-inactivated mouse immune serum, were sufficient to enhance infection. Antibody-mediated infection was dependent on signaling-competent members of the human FcγRII family, which were shown to confer susceptibility to otherwise naïve ST486 cells, as binding of immune complexes to cell surface FcγRII was necessary but not sufficient to trigger antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. Furthermore, only FcγRII with intact cytoplasmic signaling domains were competent to sustain ADE of SARS-CoVpp infection, thus providing additional information on the role of downstream signaling by FcγRII. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that human macrophages can be infected by SARS-CoV as a result of IgG-mediated ADE and indicate that this infection route requires signaling pathways activated downstream of binding to FcγRII receptors.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.032512966000000004,0.35805289700000004,-0.190937633,-0.030246227,-0.070821673,0.050292649,-0.005344071999999999,-0.197960587,0.077676755,-0.018435876,-0.034507538,-0.062798537,0.041376757,0.04824599,0.01427758,-0.000451674,-0.007034011999999999,-0.04995448,-0.026457981000000002,0.024587961000000002,0.033366103,0.00040900800000000004,0.057945696,0.027472437000000002,0.026033605,0.004532382,-0.020253252,0.014673026,-0.016611185,-0.0014825029999999998
812,Laboratory Investigation and Phylogenetic Analysis of an Imported Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Case in Greece,"Rapid and reliable laboratory diagnosis of persons suspected of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection is important for timely implementation of infection control practices and disease management. In addition, monitoring molecular changes in the virus can help elucidate chains of transmission and identify mutations that might influence virus transmission efficiency. This was illustrated by a recent laboratory investigation we conducted on an imported MERS-CoV case in Greece. Two oropharyngeal swab specimens were collected on the 1(st) and 2(nd) day of patient hospitalization and tested using two real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays targeting the UpE and Orf-1a regions of the MERS-CoV genome and RT-PCR and partial sequencing of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nucleocapsid genes. Serum specimens were also collected and serological test were performed. Results from the first swab sample were inconclusive while the second swab was strongly positive for MERS-CoV RNA by rRT-PCR and confirmed positive by RT-PCR and partial gene sequencing. Positive serologic test results further confirmed MERS-CoV infection. Full-length nucleocapsid and spike gene coding sequences were later obtained from the positive swab sample. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus was closely related to recent human-derived MERS-CoV strains obtained in Jeddah and Makkah, Saudi Arabia, in April 2014 and dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. These findings were consistent with the patient’s history. We also identified a unique amino acid substitution in the spike receptor binding domain that may have implications for receptor binding efficiency. Our initial inconclusive rRT-PCR results highlight the importance of collecting multiple specimens from suspect MERS-CoV cases and particularly specimens from the lower respiratory tract.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.057791182,0.347261294,-0.052079615,0.054968832999999995,0.080148245,-0.015698019,-0.08757206699999999,0.357732695,0.288854017,-0.000172479,0.058915977,-0.027134166,-0.027501622000000003,0.015419511,0.0020360260000000002,-0.070158305,0.04299306,-0.064562164,-0.028273349,-0.086403656,0.002274571,0.054736234,0.041564404,0.002098097,-0.027847569,0.0005458290000000001,0.036087651,-0.03597672,-0.011041212,0.013800514
843,"MERS coronavirus: diagnostics, epidemiology and transmission","The first known cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), associated with infection by a novel coronavirus (CoV), occurred in 2012 in Jordan but were reported retrospectively. The case first to be publicly reported was from Jeddah, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Since then, MERS-CoV sequences have been found in a bat and in many dromedary camels (DC). MERS-CoV is enzootic in DC across the Arabian Peninsula and in parts of Africa, causing mild upper respiratory tract illness in its camel reservoir and sporadic, but relatively rare human infections. Precisely how virus transmits to humans remains unknown but close and lengthy exposure appears to be a requirement. The KSA is the focal point of MERS, with the majority of human cases. In humans, MERS is mostly known as a lower respiratory tract (LRT) disease involving fever, cough, breathing difficulties and pneumonia that may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure and death in 20 % to 40 % of those infected. However, MERS-CoV has also been detected in mild and influenza-like illnesses and in those with no signs or symptoms. Older males most obviously suffer severe disease and MERS patients often have comorbidities. Compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), another sometimes- fatal zoonotic coronavirus disease that has since disappeared, MERS progresses more rapidly to respiratory failure and acute kidney injury (it also has an affinity for growth in kidney cells under laboratory conditions), is more frequently reported in patients with underlying disease and is more often fatal. Most human cases of MERS have been linked to lapses in infection prevention and control (IPC) in healthcare settings, with approximately 20 % of all virus detections reported among healthcare workers (HCWs) and higher exposures in those with occupations that bring them into close contact with camels. Sero-surveys have found widespread evidence of past infection in adult camels and limited past exposure among humans. Sensitive, validated reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-rtPCR)-based diagnostics have been available almost from the start of the emergence of MERS. While the basic virology of MERS-CoV has advanced over the past three years, understanding of the interplay between camel, environment, and human remains limited.

867,Treatment outcomes for patients with Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS CoV) infection at a coronavirus referral center in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"BACKGROUND: Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a poorly understood disease with no known treatments. We describe the clinical features and treatment outcomes of patients with laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV at a regional referral center in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: In 2014, a retrospective chart review was performed on patients with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of MERS-CoV to determine clinical and treatment characteristics associated with death. Confounding was evaluated and a multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the independent effect of treatments administered. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients had an overall mortality of 37 %. Most patients were male (78 %) with a mean age of 54 years. Almost a quarter of the patients were healthcare workers (23.5 %) and 41 % had a known exposure to another person with MERS-CoV. Survival was associated with male gender, working as a healthcare worker, history of hypertension, vomiting on admission, elevated respiratory rate, abnormal lung exam, elevated alanine transaminase (ALT), clearance of MERS-CoV on repeat PCR polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, and mycophenolate mofetil treatment. Survival was reduced in the presence of coronary artery disease, hypotension, hypoxemia, CXR (chest X-ray) abnormalities, leukocytosis, creatinine >1 · 5 mg/dL, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and renal failure. In a multivariate analysis of treatments administered, severity of illness was the greatest predictor of reduced survival. CONCLUSIONS: Care for patients with MERS-CoV remains a challenge. In this retrospective cohort, interferon beta and mycophenolate mofetil treatment were predictors of increased survival in the univariate analysis. Severity of illness was the greatest predictor of reduced survival in the multivariate analysis. Larger randomized trials are needed to better evaluate the efficacy of these treatment regimens for MERS-CoV.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.132275969,0.248993701,-0.171507142,-0.086189741,-0.068875595,0.015743418999999998,-0.049765785,0.350579574,0.182740765,0.016858586000000002,0.00936863,-0.007858793000000001,-0.038256692,0.014760647,-0.047988385,-0.004305183,0.000971483,9.159999999999999e-05,-0.020085226,0.002526355,0.022069388,-0.033982537,0.0272822,0.034689461,-0.014838977,-0.038888045,-0.013018838000000001,-0.039145423,-0.01330291,0.027929945
905,Mutational dynamics of the SARS coronavirus in cell culture and human populations isolated in 2003,"BACKGROUND: The SARS coronavirus is the etiologic agent for the epidemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. The recent emergence of this new pathogen, the careful tracing of its transmission patterns, and the ability to propagate in culture allows the exploration of the mutational dynamics of the SARS-CoV in human populations. METHODS: We sequenced complete SARS-CoV genomes taken from primary human tissues (SIN3408, SIN3725V, SIN3765V), cultured isolates (SIN848, SIN846, SIN842, SIN845, SIN847, SIN849, SIN850, SIN852, SIN3408L), and five consecutive Vero cell passages (SIN2774_P1, SIN2774_P2, SIN2774_P3, SIN2774_P4, SIN2774_P5) arising from SIN2774 isolate. These represented individual patient samples, serial in vitro passages in cell culture, and paired human and cell culture isolates. Employing a refined mutation filtering scheme and constant mutation rate model, the mutation rates were estimated and the possible date of emergence was calculated. Phylogenetic analysis was used to uncover molecular relationships between the isolates. RESULTS: Close examination of whole genome sequence of 54 SARS-CoV isolates identified before 14(th )October 2003, including 22 from patients in Singapore, revealed the mutations engendered during human-to-Vero and Vero-to-human transmission as well as in multiple Vero cell passages in order to refine our analysis of human-to-human transmission. Though co-infection by different quasipecies in individual tissue samples is observed, the in vitro mutation rate of the SARS-CoV in Vero cell passage is negligible. The in vivo mutation rate, however, is consistent with estimates of other RNA viruses at approximately 5.7 × 10(-6 )nucleotide substitutions per site per day (0.17 mutations per genome per day), or two mutations per human passage (adjusted R-square = 0.4014). Using the immediate Hotel M contact isolates as roots, we observed that the SARS epidemic has generated four major genetic groups that are geographically associated: two Singapore isolates, one Taiwan isolate, and one North China isolate which appears most closely related to the putative SARS-CoV isolated from a palm civet. Non-synonymous mutations are centered in non-essential ORFs especially in structural and antigenic genes such as the S and M proteins, but these mutations did not distinguish the geographical groupings. However, no non-synonymous mutations were found in the 3CLpro and the polymerase genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the SARS-CoV is well adapted to growth in culture and did not appear to undergo specific selection in human populations. We further assessed that the putative origin of the SARS epidemic was in late October 2002 which is consistent with a recent estimate using cases from China. The greater sequence divergence in the structural and antigenic proteins and consistent deletions in the 3' – most portion of the viral genome suggest that certain selection pressures are interacting with the functional nature of these validated and putative ORFs.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.049172738,0.282541568,-0.177504716,-0.01147851,0.054897790999999994,0.049706277,-0.033694478,-0.157755424,-0.01454779,0.04059732,-0.027927322999999997,9.83e-05,0.013590433,-0.046182275,0.042692405,-0.045762682,-0.051491626,-0.008880731999999999,-0.043013148,0.034357939,0.057737019,0.00672202,0.029728242999999998,0.091523955,-0.114298383,0.008317518000000001,0.01202464,0.043523063,-0.067343486,-0.057753097999999996
971,Coronavirus Susceptibility to the Antiviral Remdesivir (GS-5734) Is Mediated by the Viral Polymerase and the Proofreading Exoribonuclease,"Emerging coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe disease in humans, but no approved therapeutics are available. The CoV nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity. We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs in vitro and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model. However, studies with GS-5734 have not reported resistance associated with GS-5734, nor do we understand the action of GS-5734 in wild-type (WT) proofreading CoVs. Here, we show that GS-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with similar 50% effective concentration values (EC(50)) as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Passage of WT MHV in the presence of the GS-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all CoVs that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734, as determined by EC(50). The resistant viruses were unable to compete with WT in direct coinfection passage in the absence of GS-5734. Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same in vitro resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model. Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging CoVs.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.05808731,0.15171342,-0.104662184,-0.008450584,-0.008196394000000001,0.055150684000000005,0.06241213,-0.002151345,0.039799071,-0.021977322999999997,0.015971421,0.0038712670000000003,-0.015356927,-0.035226406,0.015379076,0.046309189,-0.039549400000000005,0.065333356,0.031063885,-0.010953698999999999,0.031941391,-0.05073755,0.096494675,0.086034325,0.072187004,0.059087154,-0.038274917,-0.036154336,0.017242028,-0.06110121599999999
1063,Infection Prevention Measures for Surgical Procedures during a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Outbreak in a Tertiary Care Hospital in South Korea,"In 2015, we experienced the largest in-hospital Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak outside the Arabian Peninsula. We share the infection prevention measures for surgical procedures during the unexpected outbreak at our hospital. We reviewed all forms of related documents and collected information through interviews with healthcare workers of our hospital. After the onset of outbreak, a multidisciplinary team devised institutional MERS-control guidelines. Two standard operating rooms were converted to temporary negative-pressure rooms by physically decreasing the inflow air volume (−4.7 Pa in the main room and −1.2 Pa in the anteroom). Healthcare workers were equipped with standard or enhanced personal protective equipment according to the MERS-related patient’s profile and symptoms. Six MERS-related patients underwent emergency surgery, including four MERS-exposed and two MERS-confirmed patients. Negative conversion of MERS-CoV polymerase chain reaction tests was noticed for MERS-confirmed patients before surgery. MERS-exposed patients were also tested twice preoperatively, all of which were negative. All operative procedures in MERS-related patients were performed without specific adverse events or perioperative MERS transmission. Our experience with setting up a temporary negative-pressure operation room and our conservative approach for managing MERS-related patients can be referred in cases of future unexpected MERS outbreaks in non-endemic countries.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.08706898,0.19472101600000002,-0.113470541,-0.091623413,-0.047379597,0.033954128,-0.064546984,0.47637389799999996,0.234924806,0.001828926,0.015612487,0.00433308,-0.058244316,0.000883164,-0.022116856,-0.007328933,0.003159564,-0.052455137,-0.029775427,-0.0013524879999999998,0.017348422,-0.006095896999999999,0.008200462,0.029545787999999996,-0.042569215,-0.033133623,-0.022066392,0.012380523999999999,-0.048377805999999995,0.031920835
1122,Analytical and Clinical Validation of Six Commercial Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus RNA Detection Kits Based on Real-Time Reverse-Transcription PCR,"BACKGROUND: During the 2015 outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), six different commercial MERS-CoV RNA detection kits based on real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) were available in Korea. We performed analytical and clinical validations of these kits. METHODS: PowerChek (Kogene Biotech, Korea), DiaPlexQ (SolGent, Korea), Anyplex (Seegene, Korea), AccuPower (Bioneer, Korea), LightMix (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Switzerland), and UltraFast kits (Nanobiosys, Korea) were evaluated. Limits of detection (LOD) with 95% probability values were estimated by testing 16 replicates of upstream of the envelope gene (upE) and open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) RNA transcripts. Specificity was estimated by using 28 nasopharyngeal swabs that were positive for other respiratory viruses. Clinical sensitivity was evaluated by using 18 lower respiratory specimens. The sensitivity test panel and the high inhibition panel were composed of nine specimens each, including eight and six specimens that were positive for MERS-CoV, respectively. RESULTS: The LODs for upE ranged from 21.88 to 263.03 copies/reaction, and those for ORF1a ranged from 6.92 to 128.82 copies/reaction. No cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses was found. All six kits correctly identified 8 of 8 (100%) positive clinical specimens. Based on results from the high inhibition panel, PowerChek and AccuPower were the least sensitive to the presence of PCR inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: The overall sensitivity and specificity of all six assay systems were sufficient for diagnosing MERS-CoV infection. However, the analytical sensitivity and detection ability in specimens with PCR inhibition could be improved with the use of appropriate internal controls.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.09072336,0.20155896199999998,0.033767458,0.06588613900000001,0.00396725,-0.066689597,-0.036300999,0.21764405899999997,0.16911502,-0.003732873,0.008598061,-0.016193012,-0.01969861,-0.013444933999999999,-0.007622686,-0.042540275999999995,0.009531527,-0.069195728,0.052425747,-0.07507259,-0.029864105,0.00552768,0.078543608,-0.004550598,-0.008186877,-0.040738301,-0.025853225,-0.045184407,-0.015174200000000002,-0.028347092
1124,Clinical Presentation and Outcomes of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in the Republic of Korea,"BACKGROUND: From May to July 2015, the Republic of Korea experienced the largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outside the Arabian Peninsula. A total of 186 patients, including 36 deaths, had been diagnosed with MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection as of September 30th, 2015. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained information of patients who were confirmed to have MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV infection was diagnosed using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 16 to 86). A total of 55.4% of the patients had one or more coexisting medical conditions. The most common symptom was fever (95.2%). At admission, leukopenia (42.6%), thrombocytopenia (46.6%), and elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (42.7%) were observed. Pneumonia was detected in 68.3% of patients at admission and developed in 80.8% during the disease course. Antiviral agents were used for 74.7% of patients. Mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and convalescent serum were employed for 24.5%, 7.1%, and 3.8% of patients, respectively. Older age, presence of coexisting medical conditions including diabetes or chronic lung disease, presence of dyspnea, hypotension, and leukocytosis at admission, and the use of mechanical ventilation were revealed to be independent predictors of death. CONCLUSION: The clinical features of MERS-CoV infection in the Republic of Korea were similar to those of previous outbreaks in the Middle East. However, the overall mortality rate (20.4%) was lower than that in previous reports. Enhanced surveillance and active management of patients during the outbreak may have resulted in improved outcomes.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.182642844,0.213476818,-0.16957758899999997,-0.100530845,-0.060771259,-0.02194614,-0.084256544,0.38313587,0.130517272,0.023917505,0.0008158330000000001,0.014766983000000001,-0.052960837999999996,0.04578791,-0.070111977,-0.005592178000000001,0.011757351000000001,0.00356692,-0.000316248,0.060986393,0.035532233999999996,-0.023538754,0.017892842,0.036081871,-0.020423735,-0.039752994,-0.008028885,-0.006068573000000001,-0.070470212,0.038243541
1130,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease is rare in children: An update from Saudi Arabia,"AIM: To summarize the reported Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cases, the associated clinical presentations and the outcomes. METHODS: We searched the Saudi Ministry of Health website, the World Health Organization website, and the Flutracker website. We also searched MEDLINE and PubMed for the keywords: Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, MERS-CoV in combination with pediatric, children, childhood, infancy and pregnancy from the initial discovery of the virus in 2012 to 2016. The retrieved articles were also read to further find other articles. Relevant data were placed into an excel sheet and analyzed accordingly. Descriptive analytic statistics were used in the final analysis as deemed necessary. RESULTS: From June 2012 to April 19, 2016, there were a total of 31 pediatric MERS-CoV cases. Of these cases 13 (42%) were asymptomatic and the male to female ratio was 1.7:1. The mean age of patients was 9.8 ± 5.4 years. Twenty-five (80.6%) of the cases were reported from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The most common source of infection was household contact (10 of 15 with reported source) and 5 patients acquired infection within a health care facility. Using real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of pediatric patients revealed that 9 out of 552 (1.6%) was positive in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. CONCLUSION: Utilizing serology for MERS-CoV infection in Jordan and Saudi Arabia did not reveal any positive patients. Thus, the number of the pediatric MERS-CoV is low; the exact reason for the low prevalence of the disease in children is not known.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.172856074,0.22661284,-0.18299865,-0.04606588599999999,0.0016524,-0.019766748,-0.053853259,0.33828872,0.228152104,-0.003842874,0.035721227,-0.008990067,-0.035254662,-0.022082987999999998,-0.012244658,-0.002549544,-0.003300128,-0.045142904000000005,-0.000407929,0.00368859,-0.007700317,0.044670749,0.009879460999999999,0.028995534,-0.019049721999999998,0.014940151,-0.014063457,0.039461869,-0.019315673999999998,0.025404904
1135,"Development of Dual TaqMan Based One-Step rRT-PCR Assay Panel for Rapid and Accurate Diagnostic Test of MERS-CoV: A Novel Human Coronavirus, Ahead of Hajj Pilgrimage","BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses (CoVs) are large ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses causing primarily respiratory disease in humans. A novel human coronavirus, subsequently named middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was first reported in Saudi Arabia in September of 2012. With increasing numbers of infections and deaths from MERS-CoV, development of a rapid and reliable kit was crucial to prevent further spread of MERS-CoV. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we present two real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays for in-house rapid and sensitive diagnostic testing of MERS-CoV, detecting the regions upstream of the envelope gene (upE) and open reading frame (ORF) 1b, respectively, for initial screening and final confirmation of MERS-CoV infection, as recommended by the world health organization (WHO). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, acquiring patient samples was difficult; thus, according to WHO recommendations and standard protocols, we synthesized RNA sequences of upE and ORF1b genes as the template signatures and TaqMan based-diagnostic rRT-PCR assays were carried out using these synthetic genes for detection of MERS-CoV. In this research, we also inaugurated a cell-free system to transcribe these RNA sequences using the DNA templates synthesized. RESULTS: The upE and ORF1b based one-step rRT-PCR assays were optimized by testing several times via different synthetic RNAs, and validation results were highly successful. The sensitivity obtained for upE was fewer than ten copies of RNA template per reaction and for ORF1b was 50 or fewer copies per reaction. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the developed rRT-PCR assays are rapid, reliable, reproducible, specific, sensitive, and simple tools for detection of MERS-CoV. Finally, a kit consisting of two assay signatures and controls was assembled, which can be distributed to public health laboratories in Iran to support international MERS-CoV surveillance and public health response.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.014773244,0.350705371,-0.013730392,0.10083802900000001,0.035382637,-0.032454751000000004,-0.041161988999999996,0.36203634799999995,0.297870649,0.006335406,-0.006857233000000001,-0.064439422,0.007577483,-0.041791322,-0.004156452,-0.044576537,0.006484064,-0.06830876799999999,0.011264406000000001,-0.088008425,-0.023888007000000003,0.00969675,0.088134512,0.00880856,-0.048666118,-0.052020385999999995,-0.01002536,-0.021854332,-0.000761321,0.027763907
1142,Performance Evaluation of the PowerChek MERS (upE & ORF1a) Real-Time PCR Kit for the Detection of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus RNA,"BACKGROUND: Molecular detection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) using real-time reverse transcription (rRT)-PCR assays is the method of choice for diagnosis of MERS. We evaluated the performance of the PowerChek MERS (upE & ORF1a) real-time PCR Kit (PowerChek MERS assay; Kogene Biotech, Korea) a one-step rRT-PCR assay for the qualitative detection of MERS-CoV. METHODS: We evaluated PowerChek MERS assay performance in comparison with nested RT-PCR and sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and N genes. To evaluate diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, 100 clinical specimens (50 positive and 50 negative for MERS-CoV) were simultaneously tested by using the PowerChek MERS and sequencing assays. Assay performance, including limit of detection and precision, was evaluated in vitro by using MERS-CoV RNA transcripts. Analytical specificity was evaluated with a diverse collection of 16 respiratory virus–positive clinical specimens and 14 respiratory bacterial isolates. RESULTS: The 95% limits of detection of the PowerChek MERS assay for the upE and the open rading frame (ORF)1a were 16.2 copies/µL and 8.2 copies/µL, respectively. No cross-reactivity was observed. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the PowerChek MERS assay were both 100% (95% confidence interval, 91.1–100%). CONCLUSIONS: The PowerChek MERS assay is a straightforward and accurate assay for detecting MERS-CoV RNA. The assay will be a useful tool for the rapid diagnosis of MERS and could prove especially important for MERS outbreak control.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.053835561,0.29681490000000005,0.05840409,0.084577562,-0.019459118,-0.060944874,-0.041478537999999995,0.400367204,0.30278357899999997,-0.034238349,0.039499986,-0.00568147,-0.08302704799999999,0.000261925,-0.034727752,-0.034045369,0.021992347000000002,-0.096581242,0.044765825,-0.056232775,-0.014196225,0.020198604,0.11482202,0.041612694,-0.042551704,-0.043957301,-0.00179052,-0.042327356,-0.021258614,0.013196072
1144,MERS-CoV Infection in a Pregnant Woman in Korea,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a lethal respiratory disease — caused by MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which was first identified in 2012. Especially, pregnant women can be expected as highly vulnerable candidates for this viral infection. In May 2015, this virus was spread in Korea and a pregnant woman was confirmed with positive result of MERS-CoV polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Her condition was improved only with conservative treatment. After a full recovery of MERS, the patient manifested abrupt vaginal bleeding with rupture of membrane. Under an impression of placenta abruption, an emergent cesarean section was performed. Our team performed many laboratory tests related to MERS-CoV and all results were negative. We report the first case of MERS-CoV infection during pregnancy occurred outside of the Middle East.

1166,Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (MERS CoV): case reports from a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome caused by novel coronavirus (MERS CoV) has been a major public health challenge since it was first described in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. So far, there is no effective treatment for this serious illness, which features a high mortality rate. We report an initial experience of the use of ribavirin and interferon (IFN)-α2b in the management of MERS CoV at a tertiary care hospital. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: A case series of 6 patients admitted with a confirmed diagnosis of MERS CoV were treated with ribavirin and IFN-α2b in addition to supportive management. The patients’ demographics, clinical parameters, and outcomes were recorded. Fifty-four close contacts of these patients were screened for MERS CoV. METHODS: Six patients with MERS CoV infection were included in this study. Four cases featured symptomatic disease, including pneumonia and respiratory failure, while 2 were asymptomatic close contacts of the MERS CoV patients. The MERS CoV infection was confirmed by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction detection of the consensus viral RNA targets upstream of the E gene (UPE) and open reading frame (ORF1b) on a sputum sample. The patients’ demographics, comorbid conditions, time to diagnosis and initiation of treatment, and clinical outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Three out of 6 patients who had comorbid conditions died during the study period, while 3 had successful outcomes. The diagnosis and treatment was delayed by an average of 15 days in those patients who died. Only 2 close contacts out of the 54 screened (3.7%) were positive for MERS CoV. CONCLUSION: Treatment with ribavirin and IFN-α2b may be effective in patients infected with MERS CoV. There appears to be a low infectivity rate among close contacts of MERS CoV patients.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.134832919,0.32830137,-0.21636881600000002,-0.067194929,-0.07070282900000001,-0.003945792,-0.08479124,0.465440467,0.222194387,0.033189913,0.012680901000000001,-0.017755695,-0.031350955,0.021401086,-0.060803297,-0.027714706000000002,0.012763712,0.011961697,-0.011425475,0.042607959,0.025335774,-0.026964615,0.024192912,0.057438468,-0.028928935,-0.043629073,0.0012935,-0.010283626,-0.041295551,0.055782082000000004
1172,739. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection Profile in Qatar: A 7-Year Retrospective Study,"BACKGROUND: A deadly zoonotic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) had emerged over the last 7 years in the Arabian Peninsula. As of February 28, 2018, 2,182 cases of MERS-CoV infection (with 779 deaths) in 27 countries were reported to WHO worldwide. The objectives of this study were to identify the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of MERS-CoV infection as well as determine its clinical outcome. METHODS: This was a retrospective-observational study of all laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection conducted at the main seven hospitals in the State of Qatar from January, 2012 to April 2018. We used the Fast Track diagnostics real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), targeting the upE and ORF1a genes respectively. Demographics, clinical information, potential contacts and probable risk factors were collected and analyzed by standard statistical methods. RESULTS: The mean annual incidence was 1.7 per 100,0000 person-years. Among the 24 confirmed cases of of MERS-CoV, males constituted the vast majority of cases (23 males) with a median age of 52 years (range 22–74). Fifty percent of the cases were Qatari and 42% reside in the same region. 67% of the cases had contact with camels, and 21% had contact with MERS-CoV-infected patient. Thirty-eight had travel history within 2 weeks of symptoms onset to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Fifty percent were smokers and 42% had comorbidities. The median symptoms duration was 4.5 days. Most of the patient presented with flu-like symptoms, were fever was the most common presentation, followed by cough, SOB, diarrhea, abdominal pain and headache, 96%, 83%, 33%, 8%, 8% and 4%, respectively. All patients were admitted to a tertiary hospital with a median hospital stay 41 days (8–97). Forty-five percent patients developed severe sepsis with multi-organ failure and needed ICU admission. Fifty percent patients developed acute kidney injury, 29% patients were on hemodialysis and 16% needed extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. Thirty-three percent patients died. The rest of patients had recovered from the infection and discharged home. Among those who died all had one or more comorbidities. CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV infection is a rare infection in the State of Qatar, seen in both Qataris and expatriates with and without travel history. The infection in patients with comorbidities carries high mortality.

We compared symptoms of 156 SARS-positive and 62 SARS-negative patients in Hong Kong; SARS was confirmed by RT-PCR. The RT-PCR–positive patients had significantly more shortness of breath, a lower lymphocyte count, and a lower lactate dehydrogenase level; they were also more likely to have bilateral and multifocal chest radiograph involvement, to be admitted to intensive care, to need mechanical ventilation, and to have higher mortality rates.

We investigated 21 cell lines routinely used for virus isolation or research. After infection with SARS-CoV, cells were observed for cytopathic effects, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure ongoing viral replication. An indirect immunofluorescence assay was also used as a confirmatory test. The study identified 10 new cell lines capable of supporting the replication of SARS-CoV and confirmed the susceptibility of 4 cell lines previously reported.

We demonstrate this principle by using 14 isolates of 9 diverse Coronavirus spp., including the severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We show that this method could identify and distinguish between SARS and other known CoV, including the human CoV 229E and OC43, individually and in a mixture of all 3 human viruses.

This situation has placed hospitals and health officials worldwide on heightened alert. In a future outbreak, rapidly and accurately distinguishing SARS from other common febrile respiratory illnesses (FRIs) could be difficult. We constructed a decision-analysis model to identify the most efficient strategies for managing undifferentiated FRIs within a hypothetical SARS outbreak in New York City during the season of respiratory infections. If establishing reliable epidemiologic links were not possible, societal costs would exceed $2.0 billion per month.

We have isolated a SARS-associated CoV (SARS-CoV) strain by injecting Vero cells with a sputum specimen from an Italian patient affected by a severe pneumonia; the patient traveled from Vietnam to Italy in March 2003. Ultrastructural analysis of infected Vero cells showed the virions within cell vesicles and around the cell membrane. The full-length viral genome sequence was similar to those derived from the Hong-Kong Hotel M isolate. By using both real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction TaqMan assay and an infectivity plaque assay, we determined that approximately 360 viral genomes were required to generate a PFU.

1224,Susceptibility of Pigs and Chickens to SARS Coronavirus,"An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans, associated with a new coronavirus, was reported in Southeast Asia, Europe, and North America in early 2003. To address speculations that the virus originated in domesticated animals, or that domestic species were susceptible to the virus, we inoculated 6-week-old pigs and chickens intravenously, intranasally, ocularly, and orally with 10(6) PFU of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Clinical signs did not develop in any animal, nor were gross pathologic changes evident on postmortem examinations.

Patients meeting the World Health Organization definition of a suspected case underwent a clinical, radiologic, and biologic assessment at the closest university-affiliated infectious disease ward. Suspected cases were immediately reported to the Institut de Veille Sanitaire. Probable case-patients were isolated, their contacts quarantined at home, and were followed for 10 days after exposure. Five probable cases occurred from March through April 2003; four were confirmed as SARS coronavirus by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, serologic testing, or both. The index case-patient (patient A), who had worked in the French hospital of Hanoi, Vietnam, was the most probable source of transmission for the three other confirmed cases; two had been exposed to patient A while on the Hanoi-Paris flight of March 22–23.

1329,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome,"Between September 2012 and January 20, 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) received reports from 27 countries of 1879 laboratory-confirmed cases in humans of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by infection with the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and at least 659 related deaths. Cases of MERS-CoV infection continue to occur, including sporadic zoonotic infections in humans across the Arabian Peninsula, occasional importations and associated clusters in other regions, and outbreaks of nonsustained human-to-human transmission in health care settings. Dromedary camels are considered to be the most likely source of animal-to-human transmission. MERS-CoV enters host cells after binding the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) receptor and the carcinoembryonic antigen–related cell-adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) cofactor ligand, and it replicates efficiently in the human respiratory epithelium. Illness begins after an incubation period of 2 to 14 days and frequently results in hypoxemic respiratory failure and the need for multiorgan support. However, asymptomatic and mild cases also occur. Real-time reverse-transcription–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) testing of respiratory secretions is the mainstay for diagnosis, and samples from the lower respiratory tract have the greatest yield among seriously ill patients. There is no antiviral therapy of proven efficacy, and thus treatment remains largely supportive; potential vaccines are at an early developmental stage. There are multiple gaps in knowledge regarding the evolution and transmission of the virus, disease pathogenesis, treatment, and prospects for a vaccine. The ongoing occurrence of MERS in humans and the associated high mortality call for a continued collaborative approach toward gaining a better understanding of the infection both in humans and in animals. MERS-CoV was first identified in September 20121 in a patient from Saudi Arabia who had hypoxemic respiratory failure and multiorgan illness. Subsequent cases have included infections in humans across the Arabian Peninsula, occasional importations and associated clusters in other regions, and outbreaks of nonsustained human-to-human transmission in health care settings (Fig. 1).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.140517419,0.222768501,-0.145159141,0.007622734,0.007931917,0.051235189,0.028727762,0.343006374,0.314941664,0.02744991,0.022832897,-0.034939013,0.006713045999999999,-0.00679006,0.028179601000000002,-0.03797431,-0.021499711,-0.019951313999999998,-0.0156654,0.029982357999999997,0.031535232999999996,0.016407265,-0.052329908,0.061211966,0.009948361999999999,-0.0013756060000000001,-0.029248572,0.006012020999999999,0.003052735,-0.028387315

He was discharged from the hospital 14 days after admission with no symptoms; however, he presented with a fever 7 days after discharge and was re-hospitalized. Chest radiographs showed newly developed consolidative opacity. His fever persisted for 3 days after commencing empirical antibiotics. Subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed focal patchy airspace consolidation and ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in a subpleural lesion of the right lower and left upper lobes, which was indicative of organizing pneumonia. We initiated empirical corticosteroid treatment for this illness, and his fever markedly subsided 1 day later. A chest radiograph showed improvement in the lung lesions, and he was discharged from the hospital 10 days after re-admission.

1378,"Contact tracing the first Middle East respiratory syndrome case in the Philippines, February 2015","BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an illness caused by a coronavirus in which infected persons develop severe acute respiratory illness. A person can be infected through close contacts. This is an outbreak investigation report of the first confirmed MERS case in the Philippines and the subsequent contact tracing activities. METHODS: Review of patient records and interviews with health-care personnel were done. Patient and close contacts were tested for MERS-coronavirus (CoV) by real time-polymerase chain reaction. Close contacts were identified and categorized. All traced contacts were monitored daily for appearance of illness for 14 days starting from the date of last known exposure to the confirmed case. A standard log sheet was used for symptom monitoring. RESULTS: The case was a 31-year-old female who was a health-care worker in Saudi Arabia. She had mild acute respiratory illness five days before travelling to the Philippines. On 1 February, she travelled with her husband to the Philippines while she had a fever. On 2 February, she attended a health facility in the Philippines. On 8 February, respiratory samples were tested for MERS-CoV and yielded positive results. A total of 449 close contacts were identified, and 297 (66%) were traced. Of those traced, 15 developed respiratory symptoms. All of them tested negative for MERS. DISCUSSION: In this outbreak investigation, the participation of health-care personnel in conducting vigorous contact tracing may have reduced the risk of transmission. However, being overly cautious to include more contacts for the outbreak response should be further reconsidered.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.10857429099999999,0.16151264,-0.100442788,-0.041793005,-0.012944171,0.033690224,-0.038799087,0.26050269600000003,0.196523927,-0.028320539,0.040109196,-0.004921565,-0.040674968,-0.047288495,0.037147015,0.002935255,-0.023783098,-0.03861987,0.0061506880000000005,-0.021603393,-0.009042237,-0.008236827,-0.068213933,-0.044803235,-0.002573184,0.025720193,-0.041468387999999995,0.040544313,-0.03260945,-0.019119027
1419,Clinical and Laboratory Findings of the First Imported Case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus to the United States,"Background. The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was discovered September 2012 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The first US case of MERS-CoV was confirmed on 2 May 2014. Methods. We summarize the clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory and radiologic findings, and MERS-CoV–specific tests. Results. The patient is a 65-year-old physician who worked in a hospital in KSA where MERS-CoV patients were treated. His illness onset included malaise, myalgias, and low-grade fever. He flew to the United States on day of illness (DOI) 7. His first respiratory symptom, a dry cough, developed on DOI 10. On DOI 11, he presented to an Indiana hospital as dyspneic, hypoxic, and with a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest radiography. On DOI 12, his serum tested positive by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for MERS-CoV and showed high MERS-CoV antibody titers, whereas his nasopharyngeal swab was rRT-PCR negative. Expectorated sputum was rRT-PCR positive the following day, with a high viral load (5.31 × 10(6) copies/mL). He was treated with antibiotics, intravenous immunoglobulin, and oxygen by nasal cannula. He was discharged on DOI 22. The genome sequence was similar (>99%) to other known MERS-CoV sequences, clustering with those from KSA from June to July 2013. Conclusions. This patient had a prolonged nonspecific prodromal illness before developing respiratory symptoms. Both sera and sputum were rRT-PCR positive when nasopharyngeal specimens were negative. US clinicians must be vigilant for MERS-CoV in patients with febrile and/or respiratory illness with recent travel to the Arabian Peninsula, especially among healthcare workers.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.157202327,0.32610997,-0.14272928,-0.020879842,-0.000191218,-0.020476656,-0.080399532,0.398139477,0.28889100300000004,-0.011052672,0.054839002000000005,-0.029534277999999997,-0.059002748,0.00289787,0.008483163,-0.036428781,0.011134024,-0.058519115,0.00218066,-0.048914117,-0.010921519,0.010439571,0.048184436,-0.001410695,-0.031949744,-0.014683574,-0.01898049,-0.015873902,-0.015006208,0.035664404
1428,"Hospital-Associated Outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus: A Serologic, Epidemiologic, and Clinical Description","BACKGROUND: In April 2012, the Jordan Ministry of Health investigated an outbreak of lower respiratory illnesses at a hospital in Jordan; 2 fatal cases were retrospectively confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to be the first detected cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). METHODS: Epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of selected potential cases were assessed through serum blood specimens, medical record reviews, and interviews with surviving outbreak members, household contacts, and healthcare personnel. Cases of MERS-CoV infection were identified using 3 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention serologic tests for detection of anti–MERS-CoV antibodies. RESULTS: Specimens and interviews were obtained from 124 subjects. Seven previously unconfirmed individuals tested positive for anti–MERS-CoV antibodies by at least 2 of 3 serologic tests, in addition to 2 fatal cases identified by rRT-PCR. The case-fatality rate among the 9 total cases was 22%. Six subjects were healthcare workers at the outbreak hospital, yielding an attack rate of 10% among potentially exposed outbreak hospital personnel. There was no evidence of MERS-CoV transmission at 2 transfer hospitals having acceptable infection control practices. CONCLUSIONS: Novel serologic tests allowed for the detection of otherwise unrecognized cases of MERS-CoV infection among contacts in a Jordanian hospital-associated respiratory illness outbreak in April 2012, resulting in a total of 9 test-positive cases. Serologic results suggest that further spread of this outbreak to transfer hospitals did not occur. Most subjects had no major, underlying medical conditions; none were on hemodialysis. Our observed case-fatality rate was lower than has been reported from outbreaks elsewhere.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.147285743,0.25782906699999997,-0.11863932199999999,-0.03896434,-0.021098578,0.027311488999999998,-0.053197777,0.30591275,0.225844856,-0.02192956,0.04800179,-0.010288927,-0.043637927,-0.059455302,0.023466355,-0.011065591999999999,-0.022553065,-0.047581585999999995,-0.023569182999999997,-0.050486872,-0.013783502,0.046848500999999994,-0.020439764,-0.016877486,-0.018874416,0.043675784,0.00193261,0.064358839,-0.042822230999999995,0.025265287
1436,Reverse Transcription Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Assay for the Detection of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,"The emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the eastern Mediterranean and imported cases to Europe has alerted public health authorities. Currently, detection of MERS-CoV in patient samples is done by real-time RT-PCR. Samples collected from suspected cases are sent to highly-equipped centralized laboratories for screening. A rapid point-of-care test is needed to allow more widespread mobile detection of the virus directly from patient material. In this study, we describe the development of a reverse transcription isothermal Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RT-RPA) assay for the identification of MERS-CoV. A partial nucleocapsid gene RNA molecular standard of MERS-coronavirus was used to determine the assay sensitivity. The isothermal (42°C) MERS-CoV RT-RPA was as sensitive as real-time RT-PCR (10 RNA molecules), rapid (3-7 minutes) and mobile (using tubescanner weighing 1kg). The MERS-CoV RT-RPA showed cross-detection neither of any of the RNAs of several coronaviruses and respiratory viruses affecting humans nor of the human genome. The developed isothermal real-time RT-RPA is ideal for rapid mobile molecular MERS-CoV monitoring in acute patients and may also facilitate the search for the animal reservoir of MERS-CoV.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.086093301,0.44653757200000005,0.11827358199999999,0.15817004,-0.013790068999999999,-0.06654539200000001,-0.017937541,0.404791389,0.294689548,-0.056370379000000005,-0.013520068,-0.005948757,-0.06177959400000001,-0.00845792,-0.07076245,0.048122727000000004,-0.010335688,-0.09948147800000001,0.097637242,0.173632638,0.051881354000000005,0.036924824,0.033451543,0.055243624000000005,-0.054134192000000005,0.026580211,0.054200954,0.012532951,0.054511565,-0.008391407
1464,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Replication Inhibitor That Interferes with the Nucleic Acid Unwinding of the Viral Helicase,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious disease, caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), for which there are no approved treatments. We report the discovery of a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV that blocks replication by inhibiting the unwinding activity of the SARS-CoV helicase (nsp13). We used a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based helicase assay to screen the Maybridge Hitfinder chemical library. We identified and validated a compound (SSYA10-001) that specifically blocks the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and dsDNA unwinding activities of nsp13, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) of 5.70 and 5.30 μM, respectively. This compound also has inhibitory activity (50% effective concentration [EC(50)] = 8.95 μM) in a SARS-CoV replicon assay, with low cytotoxicity (50% cytotoxic concentration [CC(50)] = >250 μM), suggesting that the helicase plays a still unidentified critical role in the SARS-CoV life cycle. Enzyme kinetic studies on the mechanism of nsp13 inhibition revealed that SSYA10-001 acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of nsp13 with respect to nucleic acid and ATP substrates. Moreover, SSYA10-001 does not affect ATP hydrolysis or nsp13 binding to the nucleic acid substrate. SSYA10-001 did not inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) helicase, other bacterial and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, or reverse transcriptase. These results suggest that SSYA10-001 specifically blocks nsp13 through a novel mechanism and is less likely to interfere with the functions of cellular enzymes that process nucleic acids or ATP. Hence, it is possible that SSYA10-001 inhibits unwinding by nsp13 by affecting conformational changes during the course of the reaction or translocation on the nucleic acid. SSYA10-001 will be a valuable tool for studying the specific role of nsp13 in the SARS-CoV life cycle, which could be a model for other nidoviruses and also a candidate for further development as a SARS antiviral target.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.077539279,0.29760343300000003,-0.168838093,0.032408685,-0.10579841400000001,0.017755736,0.014755583000000001,-0.165327749,-0.014240164,0.007733536,0.009542643,0.034840206,-0.015133193999999999,-0.052264723,-0.021293061000000002,0.016097718,-0.009878932,0.050194447999999996,0.094701859,-0.011500361,-0.053257233,-0.013048571,0.056619169000000004,0.007871599,0.005712555,-0.009499969,-0.063928005,0.016845995,0.00257343,0.0093377
1543,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Triggers Apoptosis via Protein Kinase R but Is Resistant to Its Antiviral Activity,"In this study, infection of 293/ACE2 cells with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) activated several apoptosis-associated events, namely, cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-8, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP), and chromatin condensation and the phosphorylation and hence inactivation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). In addition, two of the three cellular eIF2α kinases known to be virus induced, protein kinase R (PKR) and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), were activated by SARS-CoV. The third kinase, general control nonderepressible-2 kinase (GCN2), was not activated, but late in infection the level of GCN2 protein was significantly reduced. Reverse transcription-PCR analyses revealed that the reduction of GCN2 protein was not due to decreased transcription or stability of GCN2 mRNA. The specific reduction of PKR protein expression by antisense peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers strongly reduced cleavage of PARP in infected cells. Surprisingly, the knockdown of PKR neither enhanced SARS-CoV replication nor abrogated SARS-CoV-induced eIF2α phosphorylation. Pretreatment of cells with beta interferon prior to SARS-CoV infection led to a significant decrease in PERK activation, eIF2α phosphorylation, and SARS-CoV replication. The various effects of beta interferon treatment were found to function independently on the expression of PKR. Our results show that SARS-CoV infection activates PKR and PERK, leading to sustained eIF2α phosphorylation. However, virus replication was not impaired by these events, suggesting that SARS-CoV possesses a mechanism to overcome the inhibitory effects of phosphorylated eIF2α on viral mRNA translation. Furthermore, our data suggest that viral activation of PKR can lead to apoptosis via a pathway that is independent of eIF2α phosphorylation.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.08524567400000001,0.291762767,-0.20284486699999998,-0.049801255,-0.10318861900000001,0.04143678,-0.025057681000000002,-0.16492898,0.07713637400000001,-0.039016642000000004,-0.05622798,-0.072517893,-0.001564123,0.063461486,-0.008646368,0.018908914,0.02010536,-0.082677464,-0.00088018,0.028391741,0.001561858,0.027965904,0.030452424,0.011904643000000001,0.035640845,-0.008798096,-0.030844546,0.023872418,0.027878751,-0.013789676
1555,Molecular Targets for Diagnostics and Therapeutics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV),"PURPOSE: The large number of deaths in a short period of time due to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infection led to the unparalleled collaborative efforts world wide to determine and characterize the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The full genome sequence was determined within weeks of the first outbreak by the Canadian group with international collaboration. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), the continual lack of a rapid laboratory test to aid the early diagnosis of suspected cases of SARS makes this area a priority for future research. To prevent deaths in the future, early diagnosis and therapy of this infectious disease is of paramount importance. METHODS: This review describes the specific molecular targets for diagnostics and therapeutics of viral infection. RESULTS: The three major diagnostic methods available for SARS includes viral RNA detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), virus induced antibodies by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) or by enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) of nucleocapsid protein (NP). The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S1 region of the spike glycoprotein contains multiple conformational epitopes that induces highly potent neutralizing antibodies. The genetically engineered attenuated form of the virus or viral vector vaccine encoding for the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein has been shown to elicit protective immunity in vaccinated animals. CONCLUSION: NP is the preferred target for routine detection of SARS-CoV infection by ELISA which is an economical method compared to other methods. The RBD of the spike glycoprotein is both a functional domain for cell receptor binding and also a major neutralizing determinant of SARS-CoV. The progress in evaluating a therapeutic or vaccine would depend on the availability of clinically relevant animal model.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.011926137,0.401317795,-0.121029186,0.03660741,-0.054032610999999994,0.026891474,-0.038923109,-0.204433157,0.015417261000000002,0.040672972,-0.021144976,-0.034075967,0.048816222,-0.07776813099999999,0.00986592,-0.030398971,-0.008838105,-0.005999531999999999,-0.024241876000000002,0.044773090999999994,-0.008045164,-0.014527472,0.019053225,0.01236282,0.019999253999999998,-0.005703543,0.032482935,-0.027351835,-0.022268896,0.032500989
1573,An Outbreak of Human Coronavirus OC43 Infection and Serological Cross-reactivity with SARS Coronavirus,"BACKGROUND: In summer 2003, a respiratory outbreak was investigated in British Columbia, during which nucleic acid tests and serology unexpectedly indicated reactivity for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). METHODS: Cases at a care facility were epidemiologically characterized and sequentially investigated for conventional agents of respiratory infection, SARS-CoV and other human CoVs. Serological cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and human CoV-OC43 (HCoV-OC43) was investigated by peptide spot assay. RESULTS: Ninety-five of 142 residents (67%) and 53 of 160 staff members (33%) experienced symptoms of respiratory infection. Symptomatic residents experienced cough (66%), fever (21%) and pneumonia (12%). Eight residents died, six with pneumonia. No staff members developed pneumonia. Findings on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays for SARS-CoV at a national reference laboratory were suspected to represent false positives, but this was confounded by concurrent identification of antibody to N protein on serology. Subsequent testing by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction confirmed HCoV-OC43 infection. Convalescent serology ruled out SARS. Notably, sera demonstrated cross-reactivity against nucleocapsid peptide sequences common to HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the virulence of human CoV-OC43 in elderly populations and confirm that cross-reactivity to antibody against nucleocapsid proteins from these viruses must be considered when interpreting serological tests for SARS-CoV.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.09250368199999999,0.406511935,-0.212372155,0.005698262,0.045719703,-0.008443218,-0.009005981,-0.129802196,0.072646776,-0.039375647,-0.04827275,0.11829291800000001,0.157432706,0.0062706440000000006,0.011520912,0.014711203999999999,-0.030307807000000003,-0.028123347000000003,-0.017961552,0.050102601,0.00289016,0.006941221,0.074991155,-0.005636911999999999,0.031118833999999998,0.005863763,0.00254392,0.034436809,-0.014287365,0.007502096999999999
1588,Molecular Diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome : The State of the Art,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first appeared in Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002. Although virus isolation and serology were useful early in the SARS outbreak for diagnosing new cases, these tests are not generally useful because virus culture requires a BSL-3 laboratory and seroconversion is often delayed until 2 to 3 weeks after infection. The first qualitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-coronavirus (CoV) were sensitive and capable of detecting 1 to 10 genome equivalents. These assays were quickly supplemented with quantitative real-time assays that helped elucidate the natural history of SARS, particularly the initial presence of low viral loads in the upper respiratory tract and high viral loads in the lower respiratory tract. The unique natural history of SARS-CoV infection dictates the testing of both respiratory and nonrespiratory specimens, the testing of multiple specimens from the same patient, and sending out positives to be confirmed by a reference laboratory. Commercially available reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS have recently appeared; however, meaningful evaluations of these assays have not yet been performed and their true performance has not been determined. These and other issues related to diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection are discussed in this review.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.108566626,0.43337018200000005,-0.172521182,0.05183419,-0.056560432,-0.016359136,-0.035346584,-0.240664346,-0.015262866000000002,0.030366865,-0.014425588999999999,-0.04859441,0.090938506,-0.060364838,0.06970775400000001,-0.006577663,-0.038823719,-0.007751202,-0.0035359209999999996,-0.006477725,0.01588824,-0.027617117000000004,-0.014894191000000001,-0.038423433,-0.044437212000000004,-0.020341877,-0.009511058000000001,-0.002048129,-0.019847023000000002,-0.020666817
1596,A single immunization with a rhabdovirus-based vector expressing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) S protein results in the production of high levels of SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies,"Foreign viral proteins expressed by rabies virus (RV) have been shown to induce potent humoral and cellular immune responses in immunized animals. In addition, highly attenuated and, therefore, very safe RV-based vectors have been constructed. Here, an RV-based vaccine vehicle was utilized as a novel vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). For this approach, the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (N) or envelope spike protein (S) genes were cloned between the RV glycoprotein G and polymerase L genes. Recombinant vectors expressing SARS-CoV N or S protein were recovered and their immunogenicity was studied in mice. A single inoculation with the RV-based vaccine expressing SARS-CoV S protein induced a strong SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibody response. The ability of the RV-SARS-CoV S vector to confer immunity after a single inoculation makes this live vaccine a promising candidate for eradication of SARS-CoV in animal reservoirs, thereby reducing the risk of transmitting the infection to humans.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.047487034000000004,0.39359000899999996,-0.21534113300000002,-0.028962943999999997,-0.030528526,0.049742811,-0.036836938,-0.19689788600000002,0.06618212700000001,-0.007605527,-0.050603814000000004,-0.052606087999999995,-0.011641202,-0.048224345999999994,-0.004217767,-0.024830888,0.005846595,-0.058282347000000005,-0.022985099,0.040957564,0.016592785,-0.017734581,0.054184014,0.07494525099999999,0.040705892,-0.012929916999999999,0.039305015,-0.01317327,-0.03872275,0.071367095
1598,Development of a quantitative assay for SARS coronavirus and correlation of GAPDH mRNA with SARS coronavirus in clinical specimens,"Aims: To develop a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) detection and explore the potential of using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA as an internal control to exclude false negative results. Methods: SARS-CoV and GAPDH mRNA were both measured in 26 specimens from 16 patients with SARS, 40 follow up specimens from the same batch of patients, and appropriate control subjects. The relation between SARS positivity and GAPDH mRNA concentration was investigated using the χ(2) test. Increasing the sensitivity for SARS-CoV and GAPDH mRNA detection was investigated in follow up specimens in which SARS-CoV and GAPDH mRNA were not detected initially. Results: Varying amounts of SARS-CoV were found in the 26 SARS-CoV positive specimens and SARS-CoV was not detected in the 40 follow up specimens and controls. In addition, concentrations of GAPDH mRNA were significantly different between the patients with SARS, follow up specimens, and healthy controls (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.05). Moreover, GAPDH mRNA concentrations were highly correlated with SARS-CoV positivity (χ(2) = 5.43; p<0.05). Finally, SARS-CoV and GAPDH mRNA were both detected in three follow up urine specimens that were initially negative when the amount of cDNA used was increased from 5 μl to 10 and 15 μl. Conclusions: This Q-RT-PCR assay can be used to detect SARS-CoV. Moreover, GAPDH mRNA may be useful to rule out false negative results in SARS-CoV detection, and the current extraction method for urine may not be sensitive enough to detect low titres of SARS-CoV.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.04328132,0.479422629,-0.171351239,-0.007560198000000001,-0.051302547999999996,-0.02743531,-0.080609161,-0.19017915600000002,-0.04477759,-0.04482835,-0.019250478,-0.044886857,0.00846031,0.005044348,0.003753689,0.026718524,-0.012591531000000001,-0.058209384,-0.005835048000000001,-0.035339292,-0.004637299,0.01481279,0.06616823599999999,0.043839313,-0.022881116,-0.073196978,-0.031711169,0.015303926,0.071324067,0.012835737
1601,"Acquired but reversible loss of erythrocyte complement receptor 1 (CR1, CD35) and its longitudinal alteration in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome","This longitudinal study investigates the change of erythrocyte complement receptor (E-CR1) expression in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Circulating E-CR1 expression was semiquantified by flow cytometric analyses in 54 SARS patients and in 212 healthy individuals as a control. Since E-CR1 expression is influenced by the genetic polymorphisms in the CR1 gene, a major genetic polymorphism located within intron 27 of the CR1 gene was simultaneously analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The results showed that the expression level of E-CR1 (referred to as net fluorescence intensity values, NFI) was statistically correlated with the relevant genetic genotypes among the Chinese population including the healthy individuals (NFI: 5·14 ± 0·82, 3·57 ± 0·66 and 2·67 ± 0·32 for HH, HL and LL genotypes, respectively) and SARS patients (NFI: 3·52 ± 0·91 and 2·63 ± 0·70 for HH and HL genotypes, respectively). Interestingly, the expression density of E-CR1 was found to fall significantly during the initiation and progressive phases (weeks 1 and 2 after the disease onset) and gradually returned close to normal through their whole convalescent phase (beginning from weeks 2 or 3 to weeks 7 or 8) in SARS patients irrespective CR1 genotype. In conclusion, our findings, at least, suggest that E-CR1 is likely involved in immune pathogenesis of SARS disease.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.035187506,0.19126694800000002,-0.125198808,-0.142636924,-0.03433215,0.009743231,-0.08393535099999999,-0.184064408,-0.117140204,-0.008654599,-0.054194813,0.014367383000000001,-0.004100968,0.037618177,-0.047791438,0.019345729,-0.024177669,-0.032484796,0.000381153,-0.030901172999999997,0.051106634000000005,-0.063464178,-0.001111761,0.036046557,-0.086177487,-0.066136075,0.019328216999999998,-0.036412462,0.004779688,-0.006227144
1606,Initial viral load and the outcomes of SARS,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus. It may progress to respiratory failure, and a significant proportion of patients die. Preliminary data suggest that a high viral load of the SARS coronavirus is associated with adverse outcomes in the intensive care unit, but the relation of viral load to survival is unclear. METHODS: We prospectively studied an inception cohort of 133 patients with virologically confirmed SARS who were admitted to 2 general acute care hospitals in Hong Kong from Mar. 24 to May 4, 2003. The patients were followed until death or for a minimum of 90 days. We used Cox proportional hazard modelling to analyze potential predictors of survival recorded at the time of presentation, including viral load from nasopharyngeal specimens (measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [PCR] of the SARS-associated coronavirus). RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (24.1%) met the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 24 patients (18.0%) died. The following baseline factors were independently associated with worse survival: older age (61–80 years) (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 5.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.03–13.53), presence of an active comorbid condition (adjusted HR 3.36, 95% CI 1.44–7.82) and higher initial viral load of SARS coronavirus, according to quantitative PCR of nasopharyngeal specimens (adjusted HR 1.21 per log(10) increase in number of RNA copies per millilitre, 95% CI 1.06–1.39). INTERPRETATION: We found preliminary evidence that higher initial viral load is independently associated with worse prognosis in SARS. Mortality data for patients with SARS should be interpreted in light of age, comorbidity and viral load. These considerations will be important in future studies of SARS.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.159532573,0.20858623,-0.21297896,-0.048663095,-0.078382721,-0.07564536200000001,-0.071559554,-0.17128145,-0.16376563800000002,-0.005009028,-0.011503312,0.012267131,-0.003840508,0.013807207,-0.050800793,0.058022185,-0.06044985,-0.033980371,0.038941734,0.024369692999999998,-0.09827035,0.012799678,-0.04311974,0.061851934000000004,-0.060946067,-0.090863881,0.020247304,-0.165214041,-0.082543813,0.023928457
1609,Identification and Characterization of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Replicase Proteins,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) encodes proteins required for RNA transcription and genome replication as large polyproteins that are proteolytically processed by virus-encoded proteinases to produce mature replicase proteins. In this report, we generated antibodies against SARS-CoV predicted replicase protein and used the antibodies to identify and characterize 12 of the 16 predicted mature replicase proteins (nsp1, nsp2, nsp3, nsp4, nsp5, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14, nsp15, and nsp16) in SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells. Immunoblot analysis of infected-cell lysates identified proteins of the predicted sizes. Immunofluorescence microscopy detected similar patterns of punctate perinuclear and distributed cytoplasmic foci with all replicase antibodies and as early as 6 h postinfection. Dual-labeling studies demonstrated colocalization of replicase protein nsp8 with nsp2 and nsp3 in cytoplasmic complexes and also with LC3, a protein marker for autophagic vacuoles. Antibodies directed against mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) virions and against the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol) detected SARS-CoV nucleocapsid and nsp12 (Pol), respectively, in SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells. These results confirm the predicted protein processing pattern for mature SARS-CoV replicase proteins, demonstrate localization of replicase proteins to cytoplasmic complexes containing markers for autophagosome membranes, and suggest conservation of protein epitopes in the replicase and nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV and the group II coronavirus, MHV. Further, the results demonstrate the ability of replicase antibodies to detect SARS-CoV-infected cells as early as 6 h postinfection and thus represent important tools for studies of SARS-CoV replication, inhibition, and diagnosis.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.152616416,0.338736625,-0.24835195399999999,0.047061054000000005,-0.048776504000000005,-0.037009786,-0.074863179,-0.17710743,0.043940093,-0.030106015,-0.031487852999999996,-0.043885244000000004,0.018794426,0.010480126999999999,-0.0017952110000000001,-0.012961746000000001,0.063426868,-0.093433943,0.018444818999999998,0.07805672400000001,-0.048580255,0.043784959000000005,0.044311117000000004,-0.042239419,0.10973854400000001,0.066870389,-0.059671946,-0.002368222,-0.104266408,0.013891474
1611,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in tears,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease that caused a global outbreak in 2003. Research has shown that it is caused by a novel coronavirus. A series of cases is reported where polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on tears had demonstrated the presence of the virus. Detection of ocular infection from tears using the PCR technique has been widely used by ophthalmologists to diagnose infections for other viruses. Methods: This is a case series report from cases classified as probable or suspect SARS cases. Tear samples were collected from 36 consecutive patients who were suspected of having SARS in Singapore over a period of 12 days (7–18 April 2003), and analysed by PCR using protocols developed by the WHO network of laboratories. Results: Three patients with probable SARS (one female and two male patients) had positive results from their tear samples. Tear samples were used to confirm SARS in the female patient, who was positive only from her tears. The positive specimens were found in cases sampled early in their course of infection. Conclusions: This is the first case series reported with the detection of the SARS coronavirus from tears, and has important implications for the practice of ophthalmology and medicine. The ability to detect and isolate the virus in the early phase of the disease may be an important diagnostic tool for future patients and tear sampling is both simple and easily repeatable. Many healthcare workers are in close proximity to the eyes of patients and this may be a source of spread among healthcare workers and inoculating patients. Ophthalmic practices may need to change as more stringent barrier methods, appropriate quarantine, and isolation measures are vital when managing patients with SARS.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.175210573,0.317296775,-0.12605519699999998,-0.038406152,-0.065248746,-0.021375948,-0.11511609099999999,-0.123229691,-0.19248194,0.06940929,-0.004845347,-0.001737356,0.05070349,0.01097976,0.04093804,0.002983618,-0.0037116479999999997,0.037309673,0.002392255,-0.000453126,0.042821107000000004,-0.008882938,-0.076334684,-0.050946645,-0.039054207,0.005109353,-0.00647428,0.030607655,-0.065236675,0.002481192
1613,Inhibition of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus Replication by Small Interfering RNAs in Mammalian Cells,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute respiratory infectious disease that spread worldwide in early 2003. The cause was determined as a novel coronavirus (CoV), SARS-associated CoV (SARS-CoV), with a single-stranded, plus-sense RNA. To date, no effective specific treatment has been identified. To exploit the possibility of using RNA interference as a therapeutic approach to fight the disease, plasmid-mediated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were generated to target the SARS-CoV genome. The expression of siRNAs from two plasmids, which specifically target the viral RNA polymerase, effectively blocked the cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV on Vero cells. These two plasmids also inhibited viral replication as shown by titer assays and by an examination of viral RNA and protein levels. Thus, our results demonstrated the feasibility of developing siRNAs as effective anti-SARS drugs.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.09165664,0.427318276,-0.266765627,0.08532439,-0.091259366,-0.014920458999999999,-0.035179986,-0.211105242,0.019642743,0.029910098,0.015777273,-0.077058247,0.047083195999999994,0.019448515,0.056982274000000006,0.022382555,-0.060747057,-0.0016658579999999999,0.029183831,0.049347524000000004,-0.013842578000000001,0.030886662000000002,-0.006083611,0.04371901,-0.024117092000000003,-0.04895523400000001,-0.00080785,-0.007565788,0.026910526,0.040402221

Common laboratory features include lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, raised alanine transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. The constellation of compatible clinical and laboratory findings, together with certain characteristic radiological features and lack of clinical response to broad spectrum antibiotics, should arouse suspicion of SARS.

1616,Multiple Enzymatic Activities Associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Helicase,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a newly identified group 2 coronavirus, is the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a life-threatening form of pneumonia in humans. Coronavirus replication and transcription are highly specialized processes of cytoplasmic RNA synthesis that localize to virus-induced membrane structures and were recently proposed to involve a complex enzymatic machinery that, besides RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, and protease activities, also involves a series of RNA-processing enzymes that are not found in most other RNA virus families. Here, we characterized the enzymatic activities of a recombinant form of the SARS-CoV helicase (nonstructural protein [nsp] 13), a superfamily 1 helicase with an N-terminal zinc-binding domain. We report that nsp13 has both RNA and DNA duplex-unwinding activities. SARS-CoV nsp13 unwinds its substrates in a 5′-to-3′ direction and features a remarkable processivity, allowing efficient strand separation of extended regions of double-stranded RNA and DNA. Characterization of the nsp13-associated (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphatase ([dNTPase) activities revealed that all natural nucleotides and deoxynucleotides are substrates of nsp13, with ATP, dATP, and GTP being hydrolyzed slightly more efficiently than other nucleotides. Furthermore, we established an RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity for the SARS-CoV nsp13 helicase which may be involved in the formation of the 5′ cap structure of viral RNAs. The data suggest that the (d)NTPase and RNA 5′-triphosphatase activities of nsp13 have a common active site. Finally, we established that, in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells, nsp13 localizes to membranes that appear to be derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and are the likely site of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.167738177,0.272047377,-0.250747424,0.120126666,-0.036392421,-0.082753787,-0.03617572,-0.100477611,-0.032428996,0.00108241,0.038045538,-0.006271441,-0.006373017,-0.016452555,-0.007172536,0.022596098999999998,0.009202403,-0.024061186000000002,0.03023549,0.053042214000000004,-0.052659878,0.034663792,0.033240097,-0.03455695,0.050028587,-0.040909054,-0.10678598800000001,0.05588140900000001,0.025920147,0.005991478000000001
1617,The Laboratory Diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: Emerging Laboratory Tests for an Emerging Pathogen,"The 2003 pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) profiled the ability of modern diagnostic microbiology and molecular biology to identify, isolate and characterize, within weeks, a previously unknown viral infectious pathogen. The culprit, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was detected in patient specimens by traditional cell culture using an unusual cell line for respiratory viruses, Vero E6, and by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the polymerase 1 B region of the genome. In addition, serologic assays were rapidly developed, and the genome of this large virus was sequenced within one month of its spread to North America. At the present time, diagnostics have progressed to the point that RT-PCR has a sensitivity approaching 80% within the first few days of onset of illness, while serology has a sensitivity close to 100% on convalescent sera taken >21 days after illness onset. Viral culture remains a method confined to biosafety level III laboratories. The specificity of RT-PCR and serology remains to be conclusively defined, but in most studies to date seems to be >90%. Serologic cross-reactivity with human coronaviruses causing the common cold may be a problem with some serologic assays. The early development of SARS-CoV diagnostics is now being replaced by refinement and optimization of these assays. Although at the present time we do not have a test that will definitively rule in or rule out SARS at the time of initial presentation of a patient with a respiratory infection, modifications of existing assays will hopefully result in our ability to make this diagnosis with a high degree of accuracy in the future.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.083824649,0.336755986,-0.008674076,0.08875145,-0.047308755,-0.020511815,-0.034099747,-0.15869424699999998,-0.016241901,0.029089182,-0.018782441,-0.046177203,0.077157634,0.000267435,0.033944275,-0.015594648999999999,-0.00116298,0.003822204,-0.016864747,-0.034503837999999995,0.01719135,-0.011117263999999998,-0.011505351,-0.009631418000000001,-0.017823269,-0.004797967,0.027486969,-0.031286282,-0.004975495,-0.036533875
1619,Interpretation of diagnostic laboratory tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome: the Toronto experience,"BACKGROUND: An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) began in Canada in February 2003. The initial diagnosis of SARS was based on clinical and epidemiological criteria. During the outbreak, molecular and serologic tests for the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) became available. However, without a “gold standard,” it was impossible to determine the usefulness of these tests. We describe how these tests were used during the first phase of the SARS outbreak in Toronto and offer some recommendations that may be useful if SARS returns. METHODS: We examined the results of all diagnostic laboratory tests used in 117 patients admitted to hospitals in Toronto who met the Health Canada criteria for suspect or probable SARS. Focusing on tests for SARS-CoV, we attempted to determine the optimal specimen types and timing of specimen collection. RESULTS: Diagnostic test results for SARS-CoV were available for 110 of the 117 patients. SARS-CoV was detected by means of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in at least one specimen in 59 (54.1%) of 109 patients. Serologic test results of convalescent samples were positive in 50 (96.2%) of 52 patients for whom paired serum samples were collected during the acute and convalescent phases of the illness. Of the 110 patients, 78 (70.9%) had specimens that tested positive by means of RT-PCR, serologic testing or both methods. The proportion of RT-PCR test results that were positive was similar between patients who met the criteria for suspect SARS (50.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 38.4%–63.2%) and those who met the criteria for probable SARS (58.0%, 95% CI 44.2%–70.7%). SARS-CoV was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs in 33 (32.4%) of 102 patients, in stool specimens in 19 (63.3%) of 30 patients, and in specimens from the lower respiratory tract in 10 (58.8%) of 17 patients. INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that the rapid diagnostic tests in use at the time of the initial outbreak lack sufficient sensitivity to be used clinically to rule out SARS. As tests for SARS-CoV continue to be optimized, evaluation of the clinical presentation and elucidation of a contact history must remain the cornerstone of SARS diagnosis. In patients with SARS, specimens taken from the lower respiratory tract and stool samples test positive by means of RT-PCR more often than do samples taken from other areas.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.186930177,0.495969241,-0.175828645,-0.007246206999999999,-0.070088796,-0.054250047999999995,-0.134485461,-0.21829253899999998,-0.187190595,0.002507722,-0.00757556,0.019750357,0.023769906,0.003131057,0.004161076,0.018236135,0.000840701,0.007685905,0.012435746000000001,-0.035912493,0.004587885,-0.006872766999999999,0.0027593270000000002,-0.021255525,-0.022124979,-0.033525482,-0.005743542,-0.059378140999999995,-0.047347794000000006,-0.010152483
1620,Molecular model of SARS coronavirus polymerase: implications for biochemical functions and drug design,"The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a previously unidentified coronavirus, SARS-CoV. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV plays a pivotal role in viral replication and is a potential target for anti-SARS therapy. There is a lack of structural or biochemical data on any coronavirus polymerase. To provide insights into the structure and function of SARS-CoV RdRp, we have located its conserved motifs that are shared by all RdRps, and built a three-dimensional model of the catalytic domain. The structural model permits us to discuss the potential functional roles of the conserved motifs and residues in replication and their potential interactions with inhibitors of related enzymes. We predict important structural attributes of potential anti-SARS-CoV RdRp nucleotide analog inhibitors: hydrogen-bonding capability for the 2′ and 3′ groups of the sugar ring and C3′ endo sugar puckering, and the absence of a hydrophobic binding pocket for non-nucleoside analog inhibitors similar to those observed in hepatitis C virus RdRp and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase. We propose that the clinically observed resistance of SARS to ribavirin is probably due to perturbation of the conserved motif A that controls rNTP binding and fidelity of polymerization. Our results suggest that designing anti-SARS therapies can benefit from successful experiences in design of other antiviral drugs. This work should also provide guidance for future biochemical experiments.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.140789269,0.362272734,-0.28634953,0.11725454699999999,-0.097244829,0.031316684,0.04515890400000001,-0.219489673,-0.06400903200000001,0.046942133,0.073134502,0.12145581400000001,-0.040447425,-0.115611041,-0.037728136,-0.040801521,0.024228412,0.020438859,0.0008575210000000001,-0.016226377,0.056240525,-0.024081607999999997,0.060173442,0.065287445,0.027872632,0.034340043,0.019023936,-0.00300463,0.09904773300000001,-0.003101343
1760,Structure of the SARS-CoV NSP12 polymerase bound to NSP7 and NSP8 co-factors,"Recent history is punctuated by the emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS- and MERS-CoV into human circulation. Upon infecting host cells, coronaviruses assemble a multi-subunit RNA-synthesis complex of viral non-structural proteins (NSP) responsible for the replication and transcription of the viral genome. Here, we present the 3.1 [A] resolution structure of the SARS-CoV NSP12 polymerase bound to its essential co-factors, NSP7 and NSP8, using single particle cryo-electron microscopy. NSP12 possesses an architecture common to all viral polymerases as well as a large N-terminal extension containing a kinase-like fold and is unexpectedly bound by two NSP8 co-factors. This structure illuminates the assembly of the coronavirus core RNA-synthesis machinery, provides key insights into NSP12 polymerase catalysis and fidelity and acts as a template for the design of novel antiviral therapeutics.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.170949987,0.17473269600000002,-0.19108828,0.123517012,-0.045052660999999994,-0.024934982,0.047780775,-0.007492238000000001,0.023838892,0.025765496000000002,0.061438016,0.032350314,-0.009678157,-0.01301112,-0.027177876,0.003855851,0.035728259,-0.06755502599999999,-0.040016452,0.047721637000000004,-0.039750025,0.039398699999999995,-0.004978275999999999,-0.002151378,0.021048146,-0.031554263,-0.040188245,0.008338623,-0.00207338,0.006330791
1775,Aerodynamic Characteristics and RNA Concentration of SARS-CoV-2 Aerosol in Wuhan Hospitals during COVID-19 Outbreak,"Background: The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has spread rapidly and sparked global concern. While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear, the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been little studied. Methods: Thirty-five aerosol samples of three different types (total suspended particle, size segregated and deposition aerosol) were collected in Patient Areas (PAA) and Medical Staff Areas (MSA) of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Renmin) and Wuchang Fangcang Field Hospital (Fangcang), and Public Areas (PUA) in Wuhan, China during COVID-19 outbreak. A robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method was employed to quantitate the viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and determine aerosol RNA concentration. Results: The ICU, CCU and general patient rooms inside Renmin, patient hall inside Fangcang had undetectable or low airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but deposition samples inside ICU and air sample in Fangcang patient toilet tested positive. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 in Fangcang MSA had bimodal distribution with higher concentration than those in Renmin during the outbreak but turned negative after patients number reduced and rigorous sanitization implemented. PUA had undetectable airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but obviously increased with accumulating crowd flow. Conclusions: Room ventilation, open space, proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Gathering of crowds with asymptomatic carriers is a potential source of airborne SARS-CoV-2. The virus aerosol deposition on protective apparel or floor surface and their subsequent resuspension is a potential transmission pathway and effective sanitization is critical in minimizing aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.016812325,0.39813193399999997,-0.190198368,-0.018438342,-0.034482746,0.037649456,-0.03582094,-0.08300955,-0.00877877,-0.012522552,0.012391493,-0.00930499,-0.013993815,-0.060376528,0.059623985,0.040817493999999996,-0.04693963599999999,-0.010907227,-0.002726065,-0.005406095,-0.023377734,0.025190143999999998,-0.028084815,-0.00330344,-0.032220288,0.005250253000000001,0.011495528,0.049393597000000004,-0.016305638,0.0067544219999999995
1776,A data-driven drug repositioning framework discovered a potential therapeutic agent targeting COVID-19,"AbstractThe global spread of SARS-CoV-2 requires an urgent need to find effective therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19. We developed a data-driven drug repositioning framework, which applies both machine learning and statistical analysis approaches to systematically integrate and mine large-scale knowledge graph, literature and transcriptome data to discover the potential drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. The retrospective study using the past SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV data demonstrated that our machine learning based method can successfully predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus. Our in silico screening followed by wet-lab validation indicated that a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor, CVL218, currently in Phase I clinical trial, may be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Our in vitro assays revealed that CVL218 can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 replication without obvious cytopathic effect. In addition, we showed that CVL218 is able to suppress the CpG-induced IL-6 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that it may also have anti-inflammatory effect that is highly relevant to the prevention immunopathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic evaluation in rats and monkeys showed a high concentration of CVL218 in lung and observed no apparent signs of toxicity, indicating the appealing potential of this drug for the treatment of the pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, molecular docking simulation suggested that CVL218 may bind to the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2, providing a possible model to explain its antiviral action. We also proposed several possible mechanisms to explain the antiviral activities of PARP1 inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, based on the data present in this study and previous evidences reported in the literature. In summary, the PARP1 inhibitor CVL218 discovered by our data-driven drug repositioning framework can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of COVID-19.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.04879302,0.43256328299999997,-0.22635211100000002,-0.018611077,-0.127629351,0.098582739,0.015568838,-0.117032096,0.082586279,0.0044634440000000004,-0.0029404179999999998,-0.0034329290000000004,0.009894619,-0.038727695,-0.00831997,-0.001477475,-0.031673535,0.054191763,0.028018677999999998,0.006168509,-0.015136137,0.048543885999999994,-0.002877557,0.045954493,0.049458006,0.028388795,0.050377871,0.021937225,0.084422248,0.014879155
1777,High sensitivity detection of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 using multiplex PCR and a multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method,"Many detection methods have been used or reported for the diagnosis and/or surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. Among them, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive, claiming detection of about 5 copies of viruses. However, it has been reported that only 47-59% of the positive cases were identified by RT-PCR, probably due to loss or degradation of virus RNA in the sampling process, or even mutation of the virus genome. Therefore, developing highly sensitive methods is imperative to ensure robust detection capabilities. With the goal of improving sensitivity and accommodate various application settings, we developed a multiplex-PCR-based method comprised of 172 pairs of specific primers, and demonstrate its efficiency to detect SARS-CoV-2 at low copy numbers. The assay produces clean characteristic target peaks of defined sizes, which allows for direct identification of positives by electrophoresis. In addition, optional sequencing can provide further confirmation as well as phylogenetic information of the identified virus(es) for specific strain discrimination, which will be of paramount importance for surveillance purposes that represent a global health imperative. Finally, we also developed in parallel and tested a multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method that is amenable to detect SARS-CoV-2, with the additional benefit of its potential for uncovering mutational diversity and novel pathogens at low sequencing depth.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.039657923,0.308174474,0.099171027,0.144871053,0.009298699,-0.016940817,-0.013984503999999998,-0.08067049,-0.020495179,0.045664242,0.0026575170000000003,-0.037324743,0.032987372,-0.022115474,0.038405221,-0.013999628,0.001224891,-0.041654692,-0.038839606,-0.060919376,-0.007970027,0.035501293999999996,0.055090435,0.033933779,-0.013001967,-0.015270305,0.042087054000000006,0.014993992,-0.014154966000000001,0.007993378
1778,Nucleotide Analogues as Inhibitors of SARS-CoV Polymerase,"SummarySARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronavirus family, has caused a global public health emergency.1 Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously reasoned that the FDA-approved heptatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) should inhibit coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.2 Here, using model polymerase extension experiments, we demonstrate that the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is incorporated by low-fidelity polymerases and SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and blocks further incorporation by these polymerases; the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is not incorporated by a host-like high-fidelity DNA polymerase. Using the same molecular insight, we selected two other anti-viral agents, Alovudine and AZT (an FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV RdRp. We demonstrate the ability of two HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 3’-fluoro-3’-deoxythymidine triphosphate and 3’-azido-3’-deoxythymidine triphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of Alovudine and AZT), to be incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp where they also terminate further polymerase extension. Given the 98% amino acid similarity of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps, we expect these nucleotide analogues would also inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase. These results offer guidance to further modify these nucleotide analogues to generate more potent broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus agents.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.117133394,0.38050624299999997,-0.236209191,0.08531601800000001,-0.069182643,0.051813258,0.05322518,-0.123580726,0.010720876,0.042912871,0.067364175,0.076825199,-0.020336517,-0.103851792,-0.011969076,-0.003832354,-0.014177105,0.039855149,0.01863832,-0.023518219,0.025296842000000003,-0.0047789270000000005,0.058510778,0.08946023300000001,0.029887546,0.010820864,0.029803402000000003,-0.018337041999999998,0.047352775,0.018586946
1779,Evidence and characteristics of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2,"Background: On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 in humans was reported in Wuhan, and then spread fast to other provinces, China. We analyzed data from field investigations and genetic sequencing to describe the evidence and characteristics of human-to-human transmission in Guangdong Province. Methods: A confirmed COVID-19 case was defined if a suspected case was verified with positive of SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs, nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), or endotracheal aspirates by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) or genetic sequencing. Field investigations were conducted for each confirmed case. Clinical and demographic data of confirmed cases were collected from medical records. Exposure and travel history were obtained by interview. Results: A total of 1,151 confirmed cases were identified as of February 10, 2020 in Guangdong Province, China. Of them, 697 (60.1%) cases were from 234 cluster infections. Two hundred and fourteen (18.6%) were secondary cases, in which 144 cases were from family cluster infections. With the epidemic continuing, although familial cluster events were dominated, community cluster events increased with a nosocomial event. The whole genomes within the same family cluster infections were identical, and presented a few unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) compared with SARS-CoV-2 identified on December 2019 in Wuhan. Conclusions: We observed evident human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong, China. Although most of them were from family cluster infections, community and nosocomial infections were increasing. Our findings indicate that human-to-human transmission risks are transferring from family to community in Guangdong Province.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.088544173,0.186000085,-0.087577735,-0.043306879000000006,0.033157727000000005,0.02454594,-0.007700579,-0.000641827,-0.009152585999999999,-0.015166378999999999,0.014345212,0.046209072999999996,-0.019610157,-0.053206979,0.048282438,-0.00875673,-0.050082518,0.052252988,-0.038059339,-0.028011412000000003,-0.005678167,0.092673825,-0.149792623,-0.014067302,-0.033135957,0.116672292,0.08557860199999999,0.10532257699999999,0.016200944,-0.063443685
1783,Comparison of throat swabs and sputum specimens for viral nucleic acid detection in 52 cases of novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19),"Abstract Background: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. Diagnostic test based on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (qRT-PCR) was the main means of confirmation, and sample collection was mostly throat swabs, which was easy to miss the diagnosis. It is necessary to seek specimen types with higher detection efficiency and accuracy. Methods: Paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum were obtained from 54 cases, and RNA was extracted and tested for 2019-nCoV (equated with SARS-CoV-2) by qRT-PCR assay. Results: The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. Sputum specimens showed a significantly higher positive rate than throat swabs in detecting viral nucleic acid using qRT-PCR assay (P=0.001). Conclusions: The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens are significantly higher than throat swabs. We suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of 2019-nCoV in patients who produce sputum.

1784,The infection evidence of SARS-COV-2 in ocular surface： a single-center cross-sectional study,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to identify whether SARS-COV-2 infected in ocular surface. Methods: Cross-sectional study of patients presenting for who received a COVID-19 diagnosis, from December 30, 2019 to February 7, 2020, at Tongji hospital, Tongji medical college, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Demographics, temperature was recorded, blood routine test (Rt), chest Computed Tomography (CT) were took intermittently, and SARS-COV-2 real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay were arranged for the nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swab samples. Results: A total of 102 patients (48 Male [50%] and 54 Female [50%]) with clinical symptoms, Rt, and chest Computed Tomography (CT) abnormalities were identified with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients had a mean [SD] gestational age of 57.63 [14.90] years. Of a total of 102 patients identified, 72 patients (36 men [50%] and 36 women [50%]; mean [SD] age, 58.68 [14.81] years) confirmed by laboratory diagnosis with SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR assay. Only two patients (2.78%) with conjunctivitis was identified from 72 patients with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19. However, SARS-COV-2 RNA fragments was found in ocular discharges by SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR only in one patient with conjunctivitis. Conclusions: Although we suspect the incidence of SARS-COV-2 infection through the ocular surface is extremely low, the nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 through the eyes after occupational exposure is a potential route. The inefficient diagnostic method and the sampling time lag may contribute to the lower positive rate of conjunctival swab samples of SARS-COV-2. Therefore, to lower the SARS-COV-2 nosocomial infection, the protective goggles should be wore in all the health care workers.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.16326185,0.481960516,-0.154759242,-0.019342907,-0.06458655099999999,-0.050777079,-0.125005962,-0.06165831099999999,-0.10647456300000001,-0.029128248,0.023780176,0.01785425,-0.041572806000000004,0.051742609,-0.021671113,0.027031511,0.037824426,0.060010222,0.0035979859999999996,-0.014029517,0.005952294,0.030641006000000002,-0.058967625999999995,-0.000661215,0.000544854,0.046424434,0.083203538,0.014887802,0.003169263,0.001641831
1785,"Clinical features and sexual transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 infected female patients: a descriptive study in Wuhan, China","Background: As of March 2, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 80174 people and caused 2915 deaths in China. This virus rapidly spreads to 56 countries worldwide. Thus, in order to effectively block its transmission, it is urgent to uncover all the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: From January 28 to February 18, 2020, 35 female patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital were included in this descriptive study. The gynecologic history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography (CT) of all patients were recorded in detail. To examine whether there is sexual transmission through vaginal from female to her partner, we employed real-time polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal environment (including vaginal discharge, cervical or vaginal residual exfoliated cells) and anal swab samples, and inquired recent sexual behaviors from the patients. Findings: The age range of the 35 patients with COVID-19 was 37-88 years. Over 50% patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had chronic diseases. We tested the vaginal environment and anal swabs from the 35 female patients with COVID-19 and found that only an anal swab sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. All the samples from vaginal environment were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The infection rate of the patients' sexual partner was 42.9%. Additionally, two female patients admitted having sex with their partners during a possible infection incubation period, while one patient's partner was uninfected and the other patient's partner was diagnosed with COVID-19 (after the diagnosis of the female patient). Conclusion: No positive RT-PCR result was found in the vaginal environment perhaps due to the lack of ACE2 expression, which is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, in the vagina and cervix tissues (human protein atlas). The results from this study show no evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through vaginal sex from female to her partner. However, the risk of infection of non vaginal sex and other intimate contacts during vaginal sex should not be ignored.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.090858157,0.311310787,-0.154071472,-0.078165378,-0.05345915,-0.0007041419999999999,-0.073590343,-0.018198045,-0.063737984,-0.013569236,0.004171271,0.017308348,-0.016731226999999998,0.031184787000000002,0.002576343,0.027368134,0.006560137,0.036920324,-0.01039626,-0.008083813,0.008384052,0.015155885,-0.06636131599999999,-0.022498951,-0.0121201,0.040860207,0.049503817,0.024506472,-0.017766498999999998,0.009405334
1786,Sensitive one-step isothermal detection of pathogen-derived RNAs,"The recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) require fast, simple, and sensitive onsite nucleic acid diagnostics that can be developed rapidly to prevent the spread of diseases. We have developed a SENsitive Splint-based one-step isothermal RNA detection (SENSR) method for rapid and straightforward onsite detection of pathogen RNAs with high sensitivity and specificity. SENSR consists of two simple enzymatic reactions: a ligation reaction by SplintR ligase and subsequent transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. The resulting transcript forms an RNA aptamer that induces fluorescence. Here, we demonstrate that SENSR is an effective and highly sensitive method for the detection of the current epidemic pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We also show that the platform can be extended to the detection of five other pathogens. Overall, SENSR is a molecular diagnostic method that can be developed rapidly for onsite uses requiring high sensitivity, specificity, and short assaying times.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.012078769,0.285762317,0.075280314,0.128779135,-0.078007878,-0.065741333,0.015695035,0.026730806,0.021490147999999997,0.053313374000000004,-0.028934948999999998,-0.021708741,0.058099618,-0.105816017,0.025044407999999997,0.033658296000000004,-0.091298915,0.005578082,-0.050816057000000005,0.012791541000000002,-0.08209886799999999,-0.042980659000000004,0.018532756,-0.03379139,0.039065649,-0.033764071,-0.031738777999999995,0.056942928,-0.032927805,0.008260370999999999
1787,Prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 in feces of pediatric patients during the convalescent phase,"Background: Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified virus which mainly spreads from person-to-person. Fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 has been constantly reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Most published studies focus on adult populations, whereas data concerning pediatric patients is relatively scarce. Methods: From January 17, 2020 to March 6, 2020, three pediatric cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data of these children were collected. Real-time fluorescence reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs and fecal specimens. Results: All the three pediatric cases were household contacts of adults whose symptoms developed earlier. There has been no evidence showing the virus was transmitted from the children to others. Severity of disease of these children was mild to moderate and fever was the most consistent and predominant symptom at onset of illness (two cases had body temperature higher than 38.5 Celsius). All children showed increased lymphocytes (>4.4*109/L) with normal white blood cell counts on admission. One child had elevated serum levels of procalcitonin and C-reaction protein. Radiological changes were not typical for COVID-19. All children showed good response to supportive treatment. Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas persistent presence of viral RNA was found in stools of all children. One case had fecal SARS-CoV-2 turned negative 8 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 20 days. At the time of writing, one child still had positive results for RT-PCR analysis in stools after negative conversion of viral RNA in respiratory samples (over 19 days behind). Conclusions: Pediatric patients with COVID-19 are very different from adult patients in regards to epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics. Prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected children indicates the potential for the virus to be transmitted through fecal excretion. Massive efforts should be made at all levels to prevent spreading of the infection among children after reopening of kindergartens and schools.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.18237436,0.26426843,-0.19521662399999998,-0.009657170999999999,-0.015372638000000001,-0.09329970900000001,-0.048680345,-0.071203555,-0.025535274,-0.024920464,0.05201225,-0.015724053999999998,-0.037366861,0.012276393,0.023105545,0.017434414,-0.030886256,0.038375584,-0.0039933979999999996,-0.032413553,-0.055226820999999995,0.132257238,-0.11817231800000001,-0.029074156,-0.046200324,0.124627813,0.09028160800000001,0.025638393,0.029516965,-0.001180986
1790,The SARS-Unique Domain (SUD) of SARS Coronavirus Contains Two Macrodomains That Bind G-Quadruplexes,"Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the three-dimensional structures of several of the replicase/transcriptase components of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the non-structural proteins (Nsps), have been determined. However, within the large Nsp3 (1922 amino-acid residues), the structure and function of the so-called SARS-unique domain (SUD) have remained elusive. SUD occurs only in SARS-CoV and the highly related viruses found in certain bats, but is absent from all other coronaviruses. Therefore, it has been speculated that it may be involved in the extreme pathogenicity of SARS-CoV, compared to other coronaviruses, most of which cause only mild infections in humans. In order to help elucidate the function of the SUD, we have determined crystal structures of fragment 389–652 (“SUD(core)”) of Nsp3, which comprises 264 of the 338 residues of the domain. Both the monoclinic and triclinic crystal forms (2.2 and 2.8 Å resolution, respectively) revealed that SUD(core) forms a homodimer. Each monomer consists of two subdomains, SUD-N and SUD-M, with a macrodomain fold similar to the SARS-CoV X-domain. However, in contrast to the latter, SUD fails to bind ADP-ribose, as determined by zone-interference gel electrophoresis. Instead, the entire SUD(core) as well as its individual subdomains interact with oligonucleotides known to form G-quadruplexes. This includes oligodeoxy- as well as oligoribonucleotides. Mutations of selected lysine residues on the surface of the SUD-N subdomain lead to reduction of G-quadruplex binding, whereas mutations in the SUD-M subdomain abolish it. As there is no evidence for Nsp3 entering the nucleus of the host cell, the SARS-CoV genomic RNA or host-cell mRNA containing long G-stretches may be targets of SUD. The SARS-CoV genome is devoid of G-stretches longer than 5–6 nucleotides, but more extended G-stretches are found in the 3′-nontranslated regions of mRNAs coding for certain host-cell proteins involved in apoptosis or signal transduction, and have been shown to bind to SUD in vitro. Therefore, SUD may be involved in controlling the host cell's response to the viral infection. Possible interference with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-like domains is also discussed.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.086654016,0.198607002,-0.138574848,-0.015910162,-0.019722578,0.032128872,0.012063218999999998,-0.11989802199999999,-0.001555519,-0.021244058,-0.033579082,-0.0073980980000000005,0.007796651999999999,-0.043701652,-0.010901424,0.005463743,0.02395045,-0.03252622,-0.017370495,0.018990849,-0.005203955,0.002504579,-0.009289831,-0.0014791129999999998,0.020088525,-0.011495778,-0.037429002999999995,0.017080818,0.022217277999999997,-0.030910625
1795,Delicate structural coordination of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus Nsp13 upon ATP hydrolysis,"To date, an effective therapeutic treatment that confers strong attenuation toward coronaviruses (CoVs) remains elusive. Of all the potential drug targets, the helicase of CoVs is considered to be one of the most important. Here, we first present the structure of the full-length Nsp13 helicase of SARS-CoV (SARS-Nsp13) and investigate the structural coordination of its five domains and how these contribute to its translocation and unwinding activity. A translocation model is proposed for the Upf1-like helicase members according to three different structural conditions in solution characterized through H/D exchange assay, including substrate state (SARS-Nsp13-dsDNA bound with AMPPNP), transition state (bound with ADP-AlF(4)(−)) and product state (bound with ADP). We observed that the β19–β20 loop on the 1A domain is involved in unwinding process directly. Furthermore, we have shown that the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), SARS-Nsp12, can enhance the helicase activity of SARS-Nsp13 through interacting with it directly. The interacting regions were identified and can be considered common across CoVs, which provides new insights into the Replication and Transcription Complex (RTC) of CoVs.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.134388507,0.215577558,-0.158396213,0.048991318,-0.0006947310000000001,0.021627091,0.080730202,-0.139116623,-0.07778463099999999,-0.016261405,-0.005526175,0.040971932,-0.046806137000000005,-0.052704886,-0.049336369000000005,0.0219049,0.038470665,0.013536273,0.009496066,0.015248386000000001,-0.029127023,-0.03491327,0.0341933,-0.045386801,0.050307852,0.007039351,-0.07006264599999999,0.02889986,0.063476823,-0.033521372
1806,The R Protein of SARS-CoV: Analyses of Structure and Function Based on Four Complete Genome Sequences of Isolates BJ01-BJ04,"The R (replicase) protein is the uniquely defined non-structural protein (NSP) responsible for RNA replication, mutation rate or fidelity, regulation of transcription in coronaviruses and many other ssRNA viruses. Based on our complete genome sequences of four isolates (BJ01-BJ04) of SARS-CoV from Beijing, China, we analyzed the structure and predicted functions of the R protein in comparison with 13 other isolates of SARS-CoV and 6 other coronaviruses. The entire ORF (open-reading frame) encodes for two major enzyme activities, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and proteinase activities. The R polyprotein undergoes a complex proteolytic process to produce 15 function-related peptides. A hydrophobic domain (HOD) and a hydrophilic domain (HID) are newly identified within NSP1. The substitution rate of the R protein is close to the average of the SARS-CoV genome. The functional domains in all NSPs of the R protein give different phylogenetic results that suggest their different mutation rate under selective pressure. Eleven highly conserved regions in RdRp and twelve cleavage sites by 3CLP (chymotrypsin-like protein) have been identified as potential drug targets.

1897,Duration of quarantine in hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection: a question needing an answer,"In December 2019 a new form of pneumonia was observed in the Chinese province of Hubei.[1] The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was subsequently identified as responsible of this condition, defined coronavirus disease (COVID-19).[2] The virus has now spread outside Chinese borders with 82,297 cases and 2,804 deaths worldwide at the 26th of February.[3] After infection, symptoms appear after an incubation time of 3-5 days, with 80% of those infected developing a mild disease, 15% a severe disease and 5% will require support in intensive care unit (ICU).[4] Overall, the estimated case-fatality rate is comprised between 0.4% and 2.9% and the basic reproduction number is approximately 3.28.[4,5] SARS-CoV-2 is a new pathogen for humankind and any type of immune protection exist, thus everybody can be potentially infected. Moreover, no primary prophylaxis measures (vaccination) nor effective treatments are available. If the above represented percentages are applied to the worldwide populations, it appears clear why any measure should be considered to avoid a further diffusion of the virus and prevent the saturation and collapse of health systems and the most catastrophic pandemic since 1919 Spanish flu. Isolation of those affected and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) are the mainstay to block transmission of this pathogen, which is presumed through respiratory droplets. A 14 days quarantine is applied to subjects coming from endemic areas or who had contact with confirmed cases. It is assumed that, if in this period the subject does not develop any sign or symptoms compatible with COVID-19, he is not infected and thus the quarantine can be removed, and the subject returned to the community. Domiciliary quarantine of 14 days since a positive test is applied also for patients with a diagnosed mild disease who did not need medical support. These rules are effective in controlling infections in the community, but several doubts arise when it is necessary to transpose them in the hospital setting. Hospitals are indeed a delicate place in epidemics: they collect fragile persons who can be exposed to the virus and are subsequently readmitted to the community thus spreading the infection. Indeed, the ongoing outbreak in Northern Italy has been linked to a single infected patient who accessed to a community hospital where he transmitted the virus to several other patients and health-care operators.[6] Moreover, the isolation of patients in the hospital setting impose a significant burden in terms of PPE used by the health-care operators, space dedicated and time employed in their management. Even more complex is the situation of patients in ICU, where viral spreading is facilitated by endotracheal tubes and manoeuvres performed on the respiratory tract. Therefore, a clear definition of the infectiousness timing and intensity of viral spreading is mandatory to alleviate the burden on the health-care system. Unfortunately, the data available on the topic are scarce and composed only of measurements of viral shedding, without an assessment of the infectivity. Kim et al.[7] assessed the viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in upper and lower respiratory tract materials in the first two confirmed patients in Korea. They employed real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 and converted cycle threshold (CT) values of rRT-PCR into RNA copy number. The detection limit of rRT-PCR was 2,690 copies/mL. Overall, viral load above detection limit was detected until 14 and 25 days after symptoms onset and for 13 and 11 days after the first detection, respectively.[7] Of note, both patients received treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir. Instead, Zou and colleagues analysed viral load in repeated nasal and throat swabs obtained from the 17 symptomatic patients.[8] They also employed rRT-PCR and considered a CT of 40 as detection limit. Higher viral loads were observed in nasal swabs and in samples collected soon after symptoms onset. Overall, only two patients prese ted positive samples, and only in nasal swab, 14 days after symptoms onset, and with low viral load. In conclusion, a larger amount of data about duration of viral spreading and infectivity in hospitalized patients, especially in ICU, is badly needed to better define quarantine period and avoid nosocomial transmission. Before their availability, the canonical 14 days period of quarantine should be respected.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.19501977399999998,0.16833774199999998,-0.117553315,-0.025042571,-0.072579161,-0.033828995,-0.060540702,0.059947305,-0.074712736,0.058160885,0.023950597999999997,-0.024225456,0.006128093,0.037604696,0.032569739,0.004362921,-0.026251775,0.020198721,0.014025966,0.015157233,-0.03803134,0.003249852,-0.123492011,-0.051019009000000004,-0.029829266,0.034596192000000005,0.067290846,-0.007794315,-0.041272953,0.015126152

1936,Analysis of therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2 and discovery of potential drugs by computational methods,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused tens of thousands of infections and more than one thousand deaths. There are currently no registered therapies for treating coronavirus infections. Because of time consuming process of new drug development, drug repositioning may be the only solution to the epidemic of sudden infectious diseases. We systematically analyzed all the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes, compared them with proteins from other coronaviruses, predicted their structures, and built 19 structures that could be done by homology modeling. By performing target-based virtual ligand screening, a total of 21 targets (including two human targets) were screened against compound libraries including ZINC drug database and our own database of natural products. Structure and screening results of important targets such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), Spike, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and papain like protease (PLpro) were discussed in detail. In addition, a database of 78 commonly used anti-viral drugs including those currently on the market and undergoing clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 was constructed. Possible targets of these compounds and potential drugs acting on a certain target were predicted. This study will provide new lead compounds and targets for further in vitro and in vivo studies of SARS-CoV-2, new insights for those drugs currently ongoing clinical studies, and also possible new strategies for drug repositioning to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.082678192,0.291990387,-0.176372611,0.059870190999999996,-0.07403822,0.07772005,0.057527335,-0.128867738,0.037383269,0.055511578,-0.025316987000000003,0.026266183999999998,0.058615692999999996,-0.105173511,-0.001728028,-0.044180724000000005,-0.010937755,0.105045628,0.048740476,0.025018133999999997,-0.032207551,0.028248309,-0.047999089,0.048866806,0.032313821,0.006063165,0.061504312,-0.028227989,0.12600225199999998,0.022727017999999998
