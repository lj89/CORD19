Selective induction of interleukin-6 in mouse microglia by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor,"Abstract Astrocytes produce granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and support the survival and proliferation of microglia. To study the functions of GM-CSF in the central nervous system (CNS), we examined the effects of GM-CSF on cytokine production by glial cells. GM-CSF induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by microglia, but not by astrocytes, in a dose-dependent manner as assessed by bioassay and the detection of IL-6 mRNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. GM-CSF did not induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)a or IL-1 in microglia and astrocytes, whereas lipopolysaccharide induced all these cytokines. The induction of IL-6 by GM-CSF in microglia was completely inhibited by antibodies to GM-CSF. Neither IL-3 nor macrophage-CSF (M-CSF) induced IL-6 production in microglia. Given that IL-1 and TNFα, monokines derived from microglia, induce IL-6 production in astrocytes, but not in microglia, results indicate that astrocytes and microglia may mutually regulate IL-6 production by different cytokines.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.044345517,-0.021360977,0.027004715,-0.125376088,-0.064565103,0.031320094,0.029740096,-0.027272967,0.03458619,-0.0586429,-0.002656506,-0.025331813,-0.024426652,0.05395039,-0.019408304,0.041396284,-0.001725949,-0.041263683,-0.025302601,-0.057897518,0.020508046,-0.045923729,0.030080925,-0.016598913,-0.00512236,-0.031965379,0.018319747,0.02858699,0.049780028,-0.015333081
The coronavirus avian infectious bronchitis virus requires the cell nucleus and host transcriptional factors,"Abstract Replication of avian infectious bronchitis virus in permissive BHK-21 cells is blocked when these cells are enucleated or irradiated with ultraviolet light prior to infection, or if cells are treated with α-amanitin during the virus growth cycle. This coronavirus, like influenza virus, can replicate normally in the presence of α-amanitin in Chinese hamster ovary cells which possess a drug-resistant RNA polymerase II. These findings indicate that avian infectious bronchitis virus requires the intact cell nucleus and one or more host transcriptional functions for productive infections. Preliminary data suggest that these cellular functions involve some aspect of virus-directed RNA synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.127477986,-0.081715979,-0.048511414,0.055472978,-0.052151052,0.113541649,-0.035887892,-0.044414254,0.053715114,0.071304157,0.037532797,-0.083281074,0.019187415,0.148720026,0.034413272,0.068830171,-0.003020058,-0.030426027,0.014660531,0.065104971,-0.004163702,0.017532905,-0.006152911,-0.026847862,0.016201503,0.01478804,-0.020448848,0.027141218,-0.055505848,-0.018209711
Effect of sulfhydryl reagents on the infectivity of vesicular stomatitis virus,"Abstract The infectivity of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was moderately affected by iodoacetic acid and drastically affected by N-ethylmaleimide; the antiviral effect of these sulfhydryl reagents was enhanced somewhat by the reducing agent, 2-mercaptoethanol. Reducing and/or alkylating reagents did not affect VSV hemagglutination and the impermeable sulfhydryl reagent, dextran-maleimide, did not significantly influence VSV infectivity. These data indicate that glycoprotein spikes are not the major sites for the antiviral activity of sulfhydryl reagents. [14C]Iodoacetic acid was able to penetrate the virion membrane to bind covalently to the free sulfhydryl groups of all five virion proteins, particularly the reduced disulfides of the L protein. The RNA polymerase activity of intact VSV was inhibited by iodoacetic acid and to a greater extent by N-ethylmaleimide, which probably accounts for the loss of viral infectivity caused by the permeable sulfhydryl reagents.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.094380804,-0.038752156,-0.011736723,-0.032672231,-0.072070584,0.033810124,0.027868141,-0.006527114,0.01955449,-0.002939972,-0.015458367,0.007957261,-0.009747662,-0.007828309,0.001412066,-0.001094659,0.010762767,0.021109328,0.020056621,0.029231012,-0.023922614,-0.0065813,-0.00569754,-0.027449685,0.038206306,0.044416799,-0.005336042,-0.009797959,-0.022687842,0.042103443
Further characterization of mouse hepatitis virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerases,"Abstract Two temporally and enzymatically distinct RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activities associated with membranes of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected cells have been identified previously [Brayton et al., J. Virol. 42, 847–853 (1982)]. In this paper, the subcellular distribution and functions of these two polymerases were examined. Fractionation of the postnuclear membranes by sucrose gradient sedimentation showed that the early polymerase activity (detected at 1 hr p.i.) was homogeneous, while the late polymeras e (6 hr p.i.) was associated with two distinct membrane fractions. The early polymerase synthesized a single RNA species of viral genomic size and negative sense. In contrast, the light peak of the late polymerase synthesized genomic-sized RNA of positive sense, while the heavy peak of the activity synthesized positive-sensed genomic and subgenomic mRNAs. These findings suggest that the light peak of the late polymerase represents a replication complex while the heavy peak represents a transcription complex. They also establish the essential features of the mode of replication of MHV.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.162108888,-0.054615817,-0.060576687,0.043005503,-0.018968619,-0.07505274,-0.018855764,0.022310289,-0.021956793,-0.034507542,0.038988833,-0.024704608,-0.00400926,0.070664387,0.057520118,0.071087703,-0.029473726,0.01129126,0.017713027,0.012756239,-0.020645761,0.022233723,-0.01614376,-0.023848478,0.061780842,0.028557988,-0.048222091,-0.008885905,-0.049629494,0.032808962
Characterization of Kunjin virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase: Reinitiation of synthesis in Vitro,"Abstract RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) activity was characterized in a cytoplasmic extract of Kunjin virus-infected Vero cells at 24 hr. The activity was influenced, possibly indirectly, by the length of prior treatment of infected cells with actinomycin D; however, 6 μg/ml actinomycin D and 10−5 M α-amanitin in the RDRP assay had no effect. The replication complex was membrane-bound and Mg2+ was essential for RDRP activity. Incorporation was more dependent on exogenous UTP and GTP than ATP or CTP. The specific activity was low, and rate of incorporation of GMP decreased as the period of assay was increased; however, incorporation of label lasted for at least 60 min. RNA products were fractionated by LiCl precipitation, and kinetic studies showed that the sequence of accumulation of label was the same as that observed in vivo, viz., RI → RF → 44 S RNA; limited reinitiation was also observed. This sequence of labeling also indicated that the in vitro RDRP activity was due to an enzyme capable of elongation, release, and reinitiation of Kunjin RNA synthesis and not merely end labeling or elongating preexisting RNA molecules. No labeled bands in urea-polyacrylamide gels were observed using extracts from mock-infected cells and hence the three RNA products of assays were readily identified in a single gel. The replication complex was still active after treatment with nonionic detergent, but no labeled 44 S RNA was detected in gels, even in the presence of RNasin in the assay which inhibited some nuclease activity. Antibodies to flavivirus-specific nonstructural proteins were preincubated with infected cell extracts in the presence and absence of detergent but no inhibition of RDRP activity was observed. However, anti-dsRNA plus detergent blocked activity by as much as 78% and label was found only in RF.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.242382992,-0.037592897,-0.06232561,0.128606856,-0.099190343,-0.075331676,0.045064703,-0.000976701,-0.028273009,-0.004036203,0.122002071,0.097110131,-0.113092614,0.092953212,-0.031937034,-0.003950015,0.034633545,-0.028624134,0.067834379,-0.024519724,0.028475258,-0.019384295,0.094311506,-0.072145515,0.024338399,0.071352493,-0.022047681,0.05599396,-0.029904704,0.07741693
Identification of putative polymerase gene product in cells infected with murine coronavirus A59,"Abstract The virion RNA of mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59 (MHV-A59) is believed to be the mRNA for the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The cell-free translation of virion RNA results in the synthesis of two predominant products p220 and p28 (M. R. Denison and S. Perlman, 1986, J. Virol. 60, 12–18). p28 is a basic protein and is readily detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. When infected cells and isolated virions were assayed for this protein by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, p28 could be detected in infected cells labeled at late times after infection, but not at early times or in purified virions. p28 represents the first protein product of the putative coronavirus polymerase gene to be identified in infected cells.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.174150773,-0.058283393,-0.034245001,-0.000832309,-0.008219254,-0.073761153,-0.095974028,-0.013868297,0.025991517,-0.042959511,-0.032825107,-0.073592146,0.02299723,0.064780677,0.023662218,0.00985219,0.009558909,-0.005221904,0.038626507,0.033163512,-0.017966642,0.032200026,0.02490969,-0.005745714,0.102526294,0.100439722,-0.021546192,-0.003232831,-0.084669033,0.074097381
Analysis of intracellular small RNAs of mouse hepatitis virus: evidence for discontinuous transcription,"Abstract We have previously shown the presence of multiple small leader-containing RNA species in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected cells. In this paper, we have analyzed the origin, structure, and mechanism of synthesis of these small RNAs. Using cDNA probes specific for leader RNA and genes A, D, and F, we demonstrate that subsets of these small RNAs were derived from the various viral genes. These subsets have discrete and reproducible sizes, varying with the gene from which they are derived. The size of each subset correlates with regions of secondary structure, whose free energy ranges from −1.6 to −77.1 kcal/mol, in each of the mRNAs examined. In addition, identical subsets were detected on the replicative intermediate (RI) RNA, suggesting that they represent functional transcriptional intermediates. The biological significance of these small RNAs is further supported by the detection of leader-containing RNAs of 47, 50, and 57 nucleotides in length, which correspond to the crossover sites in two MHV recombinant viruses. These data, coupled with the high frequency of RNA recombination during MHV infection, suggest that the viral polymerase may pause in or around regions of secondary structure, thereby generating pools of free leader-containing RNA intermediates which can reassociate with the template, acting as primers for the synthesis of full-length or recombinant RNAs. These data suggest that MHV transcription uses a discontinuous and nonprocessive mechanism in which RNA polymerase allows the partial RNA products to be dissociated from the template temporarily during the process of transcription.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.231921865,-0.065874982,-0.036089509,0.090843192,0.048342552,-0.144482301,-0.119214929,0.050254199,-0.031060985,-0.045403752,0.000990841,-0.091039256,0.045215994,0.033741653,0.106252404,0.124651198,-0.145219597,0.043398497,-0.028560748,-0.028895069,0.019938541,-0.009912352,0.028888713,0.034033678,0.047138215,-0.00491721,0.007020606,0.016286626,0.043332669,0.034159792
Synthesis of virus-specific RNA in permeabilized murine coronavirus-infected cells,"Abstract We have developed a permeabilized cell system for assaying mouse hepatitis virus-specific RNA polymerase activity. This activity was characterized as to its requirements for mono- and divalent cations, requirements for an exogenous energy source, and pH optimum. This system faithfully reflects MHV-specific RNA synthesis in the intact cell, with regard to both its time of appearance during the course of infection and the products synthesized. The system is efficient and the RNA products were identical to those observed in intact MHV-infected cells as judged by agarose gel electrophoresis and hybridization.

Defective-interfering particles of murine coronavirus: Mechanism of synthesis of defective viral RNAs,"Abstract The mechanism of synthesis of the defective viral RNAs in cells infected with defective-interfering (DI) particles of mouse hepatitis virus was studied. Two DI-specific RNA species, DIssA of genomic size and DIssE of subgenomic size, were detected in DI-infected cells. Purified DI particles, however, were found to contain predominantly DIssA and only a trace amount of DIssE RNA. Despite its negligible amount, the DIssE RNA in virions appears to serve as the template for the synthesis of DIssE RNA in infected cells. This conclusion was supported by two studies. First, the uv target size for DIssE RNA synthesis is significantly smaller than that for DIssA. Second, when purified DIssE RNA was transfected into cells which had been infected with a helper virus, DIssE RNA could replicate itself and became a predominant RNA species in the infected cells. Thus, DIssE RNA was not synthesized from the genomic RNA of DI particles. By studying the relationship between virus dilution and the amount of intracellular viral RNA synthesis, we have further shown that DIssE RNA synthesis requires a helper function, but it does not utilize the leader sequence of the helper virus. In contrast, DIssA synthesis appears to be helper-independent and can replicate itself. Thus DIssA codes for a functional RNA polymerase.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.217806872,-0.074719737,-0.058696232,0.08239826,-0.000238597,-0.135202172,-0.106894684,0.057326156,-0.038254555,-0.053364667,0.048607289,-0.110905343,0.012770983,0.08365092,0.170984923,0.18168581,-0.176132044,0.083362897,0.023449563,-0.003726512,0.020157166,-0.003966313,0.066238856,-0.037528602,0.065674535,0.060231442,-0.01187182,0.006894426,0.024272911,0.033728284
Primary structure and translation of a defective interfering rna of murine coronavirus,"Abstract An intracellular defective-interfering (DI) RNA, DIssE, of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) obtained after serial high multiplicity passage of the virus was cloned and sequenced. DIssE RNA is composed of three noncontiguous genomic regions, representing the first 864 nucleotides of the Fend, an internal 748 nucleotides of the polymerase gene, and 601 nucleotides from the 3′ end of the parental MHV genome. The DIssE sequence contains one large continuous open reading frame. Two protein products from this open reading frame were identified both by in vitro translation and in DI-infected cells. Sequence comparison of DIssE and the corresponding parts of the parental virus genome revealed that DIssE had three base substitutions within the leader sequence and also a deletion of nine nucleotides located at the junction of the leader and the remaining genomic sequence. The 5′ end of DIssE RNA was heterogeneous with respect to the number of UCUAA repeats within the leader sequence. The parental MHV genomic RNA appears to have extensive and stable secondary structures at the regions where DI RNA rearrangements occurred. These data suggest that MHV DI RNA may have been generated as a result of the discontinuous and nonprocessive manner of MHV RNA synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.235051133,-0.076129762,-0.043218853,0.042911399,0.097461019,-0.166250233,-0.237979043,0.069175595,-0.015638886,-0.10252881,-0.048883021,-0.127201854,0.071884136,-0.038626328,0.150816917,0.142887516,-0.180117266,0.127762966,0.010779098,-0.015734519,0.058991122,-0.043078845,0.071805363,0.041520007,0.086017288,0.097841311,0.019233417,-0.040765266,0.048116105,-0.009304357
Nucleotide sequence of bovine rotavirus gene 1 and expression of the gene product in Baculovirus,"Abstract The nucleotide sequence of the gene that encodes for the structural viral protein VP1 of bovine rotavirus (RF strain) has been determined. The sequence data indicate that segment 1 contains 3302 by and is A+T rich (65.3%). The positive strand of segment 1 contains a single open reading frame that extends 1088 codons and possesses 5′- and 3′-terminal untranslated regions of 18 and 20 bp, respectively. The first AUG conforms to the Kozak consensus sequence and if utilized, would yield a protein having a calculated molecular weight of 124–847, very close to the apparent molecular weight of VP1 (M.W. 125,000). The deduced amino acid sequence presents significant similarities with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of several RNA viruses. VP1 was also synthesized in baculovirus using two transfer vecors: pAC461 and pVL941. Following infection of Sf9 cells with a recombinant baculovirus, a full-length nonfusion protein was synthesised which shares properties with authentic VP1 made in monkey kidney cells. The level of VP1 synthesis was about 10-fold higher when the baculovirus recombinant was derived from the pVL941 transfer vector. In that case, VP1 was expressed in yields approximately equivalent to 10% of the cellular protein. The recombinant protein was immunoprecipitated by hyperimmune serum raised against purified rotavirus. It also was immunogenic; a hyperimmune serum made in guinea pigs reacted with VP1 using immunoprecipitation and Western blot. This serum did not possess neutralization activity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.159671606,-0.052644804,-0.013342452,-0.043433644,0.030220909,-0.04107281,-0.087316897,-0.008680529,0.019043037,-0.04489972,-0.049966989,0.000957638,-0.006769639,-0.043406521,-0.026644772,-0.095561928,0.039263131,-0.020572383,0.034903002,-0.006548977,0.001119881,0.009489687,0.017971871,-0.009371354,-0.010654021,0.049760707,0.037575791,-0.031351016,-0.062284768,0.073808896
"Molecular cloning of the gene encoding the putative polymerase of mouse hepatitis coronavirus, strain A59","Abstract Complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries were constructed representing the genome RNA of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59 (MHV-A59). From these libraries clones were selected to form a linear map across the entire gene A, the putative viral polymerase gene. This gene is approximately 23 kb in length, considerably larger than earlier estimates. Sequence analysis of the U terminal region of the genome indicates the presence of the 66-nucleotide leader that is found on all mRNAs. Secondary structure analysis of the 5′terminal region suggests that transcription of leader terminates in the region of nucleotide 66. The sequence of the first 2000 nucleotides is very similar to that reported for the closely related JHM strain of MHV and potentially encodes p28, a basic protein thought to be a component of the viral polymerase (L. Soe, C. K. Shieh, S. Baker, M. F. Chang, and M. M. C. Lai, 1987, J. Virol., 61, 3968–3976). Gene A contains two of the consensus sequences found in intergenic regions.

Complex formation between influenza virus polymerase proteins expressed in Xenopus oocytes,"Abstract All three influenza virus polymerase (P) proteins were expressed in Xenopus oocytes from microinjected in vitro transcribed mRNA analogs, with yields of up to 100 ng per oocyte. To examine the functional state of the Xenopus-expressed P proteins, the polypeptides were tested for their ability to form stable complexes with each other. As seen in virus-infected cells, all three P proteins associated into an immunoprecipitable complex, suggesting that the system has considerable promise for the reconstruction of an active influenza RNA polymerase. Examination of the ability of paired combinations of the P proteins to associate indicated that PB1 contained independent binding sites for PB2 and PA, and so probably formed the backbone of the complex. Sedimentation analysis of free and complexed P proteins indicated that PB1 and PB2 did not exist as free monomers, and that similarly, complexes of all three P proteins did not simply consist of one copy of each protein. The heterodisperse sedimentation rate seen for complexes of all three P proteins did not appear to result from their binding to RNA, suggesting the incorporation of additional polypeptides polymerase complex.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.129945972,-0.077034241,-0.049711255,0.040672085,-0.061396595,0.074789275,-0.044311586,-0.013993302,0.009438211,-0.061007444,-0.022509261,-0.005143824,-0.009063904,0.02379516,-0.025608069,-0.019567152,0.056411737,-0.067644751,0.002693431,0.028397557,-0.013847944,0.027812972,0.001775658,-0.062720575,0.062110625,0.054012965,-0.033139774,-0.00692144,-0.051395282,0.026111422
Primary structure and post-translational processing of the berne virus peplomer protein,"Abstract The nucleotide sequence of the peplomer (P) protein gene of Berne virus (BEV), the torovirus prototype, was determined. The gene encodes an apoprotein of 1581 amino acids with an Mr of about 178K. The open reading frame was cloned behind the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and its translation product was identified as the BEV P protein precursor by in vivo expression and immunoprecipitation. The deduced amino acid sequence contains a number of domains which are typical for type I membrane glycoproteins: an N-terminal signal sequence, a putative C-terminal transmembrane anchor, and a cytoplasmic tail. Eighteen potential N-glycosylation sites, two heptad repeat domains, and a possible “trypsin-like” cleavage site were identified. The mature P protein consists of two subunits and their electrophoretic mobility upon endoglycosidase F treatment strongly suggests that the predicted cleavage site is functional in vivo. The heptad repeat domains are probably involved in the generation of an intra-chain coiled-coil secondary structure; similar inter-chain interactions can play a role in P protein oligomerization. Using a sucrose gradient assay the P protein was indeed shown to form dimers. The intra- and inter-chain coiled-coil interactions may stabilize the elongated BEV peplomers.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.191159409,-0.060084266,-0.02017505,-0.046067588,0.037581721,-0.038722417,-0.116607066,-0.014311962,0.038423055,-0.065083704,-0.142407129,-0.001554665,0.042028329,-0.12526817,-0.086740733,-0.141085173,0.119769169,-0.022652151,0.001204237,0.011609918,-0.009296128,-0.01553879,-0.012435758,-0.026069895,0.02966755,0.082134035,0.019920133,-0.03045977,-0.002983444,-0.021857371
Establishing a genetic recombination map for murine coronavirus strain A59 complementation groups,"Abstract MHV-A59 temperature-sensitive mutants, representing one RNA+ and five RNA− complementation groups, were isolated and characterized by genetic recombination techniques. Maximum recombination frequencies occurred under multiplicities of infection greater than 10 each in which 99.99% of the cells were co-infected. Recombination frequencies between different is mutants increased steadily during infection and peaked late in the virus growth cycle. These data suggest that recombination is a late event in the virus replication cycle. Recombination frequencies were also found to range from 63 to 20,000 times higher than the sum of the spontaneous reversion frequencies of each is mutant used in the cross. Utilizing standard genetic recombination techniques, the five RNA− complementation groups of MHV-A59 were arranged into an additive, linear, genetic map located at the 5′ end of the genome in the 23-kb polymerase region. These data indicate that at least five distinct functions are encoded in the MHV polymerase region which function in virus transcription. Moreover, using well-characterized is mutants the recombination frequency for the entire 32-kb MHV genome was found to approach 25% or more. This is the highest recombination frequency described for a nonsegmented, linear, plus-polarity RNA virus.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.145608755,-0.058011554,-0.019197505,0.023837411,0.06202435,-0.067090807,-0.065785195,0.023800973,-0.033326876,0.001896826,0.040214659,-0.020796478,0.005266173,-0.009776601,0.073893326,0.110152686,-0.115907262,0.022915405,-0.046496124,0.014361383,0.07307943,-0.089479877,0.054247296,0.073118855,0.013538382,0.061740541,0.0594034,-0.018166109,-0.136206587,-0.016656718
Comparison of the genome organization of toro- and coronaviruses: Evidence for two nonhomologous RNA recombination events during berne virus evolution,"Abstract Recently, toroviruses and coronaviruses have been found to be ancestrally related by divergence of their polymerase and envelope proteins from common ancestors. In addition, their genome organization and expression strategy, which involves the synthesis of a 3′-coterminal nested set of mRNAs, are comparable. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the genome of the torovirus prototype, Berne virus (BEV), has now revealed the results of two independent nonhomologous RNA recombinations during torovirus evolution. Berne virus open reading frame (ORF) 4 encodes a protein with significant sequence similarity (30–35% identical residues) to a part of the hemagglutinin esterase proteins of corona-viruses and influenza virus C. The sequence of the C-terminal part of the predicted BEV polymerase ORF1a product contains 31–36% identical amino acids when compared with the sequence of a nonstructural 30 32K corona-virus protein. The cluster of coronaviruses which contains this nonstructural gene expresses it not as a part of their polymerase, but by synthesizing an additional subgenomic mRNA.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.165957662,-0.069865155,-0.038553082,0.02582185,0.127827862,-0.01758682,-0.143129506,0.012950931,0.003962096,-0.06799256,-0.123654226,-0.035769855,0.073490077,-0.105765149,-0.046741762,-0.122301346,0.106708511,-0.02061496,0.024394988,0.037785757,-0.01257411,-0.015534265,-0.029013854,0.018224231,-0.025569355,0.022234894,0.031962056,-0.03104245,-0.007782556,-0.028308913
The complete sequence (22 kilobases) of murine coronavirus gene 1 encoding the putative proteases and RNA polymerase,"Abstract The 5′-most gene, gene 1, of the genome of murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), is presumed to encode the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. We have determined the complete sequence of this gene of the JHM strain by cDNA cloning and sequencing. The total length of this gene is 21,798 nucleotides long, which includes two overlapping, large open reading frames. The first open reading frame, ORF 1 a, is 4488 amino acids long. The second open reading frame, ORF 1 b, overlaps ORF 1 a for 75 nucleotides, and is 2731 amino acids long. The overlapping region may fold into a pseudoknot RNA structure, similar to the corresponding region of the RNA of avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The in vitro transcription and translation studies of this region indicated that these two ORFs were most likely translated into one polyprotein by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. Thus, the predicted molecular weight of the gene 1 product is more than 800,000 Da. The sequence of ORF 1 b is very similar to the corresponding ORF of IBV. In contrast, the ORF 1 a of these two viruses differ in size and have a high degree of divergence. The amino acid sequence analysis suggested that ORF 1 a contains several functional domains, including two hydrophobic, membrane-anchoring domains, and three cysteine-rich domains. It also contains a picornaviral 3C-like protease domain and two papain-like protease domains. The presence of these protease domains suggests that the polyprotein is most likely processed into multiple protein products. In contrast, the ORF 1b contains polymerase, helicase, and zinc-finger motifs. These sequence studies suggested that the MHV gene 1 product is involved in RNA synthesis, and that this product is processed autoproteolytically after translation. This study completes the sequence of the MHV genome, which is 31 kb long, and constitutes the largest viral RNA known.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.264343415,-0.074530704,-0.034984146,0.016413908,0.197986157,-0.115211908,-0.274440248,0.014786829,0.04799034,0.011387588,-0.145016559,-0.050318329,0.093271176,-0.165436472,-0.098548591,-0.112505533,0.093735137,0.052563047,0.066796369,0.046617112,-0.059997685,-0.030074633,-0.049864677,0.013893638,-0.023979606,0.052399205,0.056485484,-0.072044562,-0.025509972,-0.06438793
Comparison of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the S genes specified by virulent and avirulent strains of bovine coronaviruses,"Abstract The entire nucleotide sequences of the spike glycoprotein (S) genes of the highly virulent bovine coronavirus (BCV) strain BCV-LY138, the avirulent BCV-L9 and related Norden Vaccine (BCV-Vaccine) strains were determined using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify cDNAs obtained by reverse transcription of viral RNA, and to produce single strand cDNAs for DNA sequencing. The S gene sequences of these viral strains were compared with those of recently published strains BCV-Mebus, BCV-Quebec, and BCV-F15. An open reading frame of 4092 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 1363 amino acid residues, was found in all six strains. Frameshifts and insertions or deletions were not observed except for the BCV-Fl 5. The S gene sequences were more than 98% conserved overall inspite of different origins of the six viruses. There were 45 to 56 nt differences between the virulent and avirulent groups while there were 6 to 14 nt differences among four avirulent strains. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences indicated that the S proteins had typical properties of membrane glycoproteins. Nineteen Winked glycosylation sites were predicted in five strains, and 18 of them were conserved in the avirulent strain BCV-L9. The sequence KRRSRR at the predicted proteolytic cleavage site was identified in five strains while the sequence KRRSVR was found in BCV-Fl 5. Substitutions of few amino acids in the putative fusogenic domains and two prolines at 507 and 567 in the antigenic domains may cause altered immunogenic and other functional properties of the S proteins specified by the virulent and avirulent BCV strains. Nine amino acid substitutions between the virulent and avirulent groups may correlate with BCV virulence.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.106313557,-0.032680646,0.030901673,-0.075888234,0.104969035,0.01781532,-0.073783505,-0.012526331,0.016253757,-0.002453059,-0.04020251,0.052796249,0.002700341,-0.097393539,-0.021939531,-0.071937878,0.016251186,0.009550608,-0.001875271,0.006556041,0.03172982,-0.003265455,-0.014860678,0.045449942,0.041221683,-0.00581965,0.008688405,-0.03353443,-0.027315969,0.044668012
De novo generation of defective interfering RNAs of tomato bushy stunt virus by high multiplicity passage,"Abstract Defective interfering (DI) RNAs were generated de novo in each of 12 independent isolates of tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) upon serial passage at high multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.) in plants, but not in any of 4 additional isolates after 11 serial passages at low m.o.i. The DI RNAs were detected in RNA isolated from virus particles and in 2.3 M LiCl-soluble RNA fractions isolated from inoculated leaves. Symptom attenuation leading to persistent infections was closely correlated with the passage in which DIs first developed. Comparisons of nucleotide sequences of 10 cDNA clones from 2 DI RNA populations and with a previously characterized TBSV DI RNA revealed the same four regions of sequence from the TBSV genome were strictly conserved in each of the DI RNAs: the virus 5′ leader sequence of 168 bases; a region of approximately 200–250 bases from the viral polymerase gene; approximately 70 bases from the 3′ terminus of the viral pl9 and p22 genes; and approximately 130 bases from the 3′terminal noncoding region.

Evolutionary relatedness of the predicted gene product of RNA segment 2 of the Tick-Borne Dhori virus and the PB1 polymerase gene of influenza viruses,"Abstract The complete nucleotide sequence of the second largest RNA segment of Dhori/India/1313/61 virus was determined and the deduced amino acid sequence was compared with the polymerase (P) proteins of influenza A, B, and C viruses. RNA segment 2 (2224 nucleotides) of Dhori virus contains a single long open reading frame that can encode a 716-amino amid polypeptide (81.3 kDa). The predicted polypeptide shares between 27 and 31% sequence identities with the PB1 polypeptides of influenza A, B, and C viruses. Among the regions most highly conserved are the sequences around the Asp-Asp motif common to many RNA polymerases. In spite of the high level of sequence identity between the Dhori RNA segment 2 gene product and the influenza A, B, and C virus PB1 proteins the amino acid composition of the Dhori protein indicates an acidic charge feature at pH 7.0 in contrast to the basic nature of the PB1 proteins of the influenza viruses.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV): Molecular cloning and sequencing of the full-length viral genome,"Abstract We have recently described the cloning of a portion of the hepatitis E virus (HEV) and confirmed its etiologic association with enterically transmitted (waterborne, epidemic) non-A, non-B hepatitis. The virus consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.5 kb, with a polyadenylated 3' end. We now report on the cloning and nucleotide sequencing of an overlapping, contiguous set of cDNA clones representing the entire genome of the HEV Burma strain [HEV(B)]. The largest open reading frame extends approximately 5 kb from the Fend and contains the RNA-directed RNA polymerase and nucleoside triphosphate binding motifs. The second major open reading frame (ORF2) begins 37 by downstream of the first and extends approximately 2 kb to the termination codon present 65 by from the 3' terminal stretch of poly(A) residues. ORF2 contains a consensus signal peptide sequence at its amino terminus and a capsid-like region with a high content of basic amino acids similar to that seen with other virus capsid proteins. A third open reading frame partially overlaps the first and second and encompasses only 369 bp. In addition to the 7.5-kb full-length genomic transcript, two subgenomic polyadenylated messages of approximately 3.7 and 2.0 kb were detected in infected liver using a probe from the 3' third of the genome. The genomic organization of the virus is consistent with the Fend encoding nonstructural and the 3' end encoding the viral structural gene(s). The expression strategy of the virus involves the use of three different open reading frames and at least three different transcripts. HEV was previously determined to be a nonenveloped particle with a diameter of 27–34 nm. These findings on the genetic organization and expression strategy of HEV suggest that it is the prototype human pathogen for a new class of RNA virus or perhaps a separate genus within the Caliciviridae family",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.190883413,-0.063916635,-0.029354537,0.020505153,0.097635238,-0.073853386,-0.125492942,0.023159884,0.010414644,-0.03758247,-0.07383062,-0.032052359,0.058453825,-0.09750116,0.00117859,-0.097494876,0.024687735,0.051036217,0.044168719,0.019354175,0.010069001,-0.011279939,-0.038675486,0.019793326,-0.077611702,0.016875684,0.037251853,-0.027730309,-0.006524058,-0.026811757
Random nature of coronavirus RNA recombination in the absence of selection pressure,"Abstract RNA-RNA recombination is thought to occur preferentially at certain selected sites and in only a few RNA viruses; the mechanism for these restrictions is unknown. In this paper we report the development of a recombination assay for coronavirus, using polymerase chain reaction, in the absence of selection pressure. Our results showed that within a 1-kb region of the peplomer gene, RNA recombination occurred at almost every potential crossover site. Thus, coronavirus RNA recombination appears to be more random than previously realized. However, after serial passages of the recombinant viruses in tissue culture, the recombination sites among the progeny viruses became clustered in the region which contains the previously reported “hot spot” for coronavirus recombination. These results suggest that RNA recombination is common and random in nature, but only certain recombinants can be selected. Thus, the presence of recombinational “hot spots” for coronavirus or other RNA viruses most likely resulted from selection of certain recombinant viruses and not restriction on the occurrence of RNA recombination. The failure to detect recombinants in other RNA viruses may therefore be due to unfavorable properties of recombinant viruses. This approach can be used to detect recombinants in these viruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.152736237,-0.03398089,-0.030490156,0.112077917,0.100019537,-0.079261641,-0.024594896,0.044732047,-0.062770094,0.05799252,0.07663216,0.004291603,0.025481983,-0.001268792,0.050767438,0.04375199,-0.078573233,-0.014201463,-0.021888281,-0.016983532,0.074106315,-0.037477527,0.005876014,0.086027936,-0.076944115,-0.00186432,0.051927895,-0.001506228,-0.082499954,-0.053900781
Sequence analysis of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus genome segment B and its encoded VP1 protein: A putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase lacking the Gly-Asp-Asp motif,"Abstract The genome segment B sequence of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus was determined for both the Jasper and Sp serotypes. The sequences are 2784 and 2630 by long, respectively, and contain a single large open reading frame encoding the VP1 protein, the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of IPNV. The proteins exhibit an 88% homology with each other, but only 41% with infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) VP1, another member of the Birnaviridae. Despite the low overall homology between the IPNV and IBDV VP1 proteins, homologous regions were detected within the central portion of the proteins. The carboxy-proximal regions of the VP1, which contain very low amino acid homology, displayed evidence of conservation in structural features such as a hydrophilic, highly basic domain. Consensus sequences associated with GTP-binding proteins and RdRps were also detected in VP1. However, unlike the RdRps associated with single-stranded plus RNA viruses, the birnavirus RdRp lacks the Gly-Asp-Asp motif characteristic of this enzyme family.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.165473372,-0.049625637,-0.041609984,0.021808626,0.052860859,-0.043161528,-0.029734351,0.004988843,-0.022781701,0.015808168,0.006521343,0.052494526,-0.007180956,-0.105412812,-0.052776782,-0.080745684,0.06480159,-0.032945559,-0.00940699,-0.008539246,0.016750418,-0.004682072,-0.009049888,-0.019769231,-0.002813594,0.047288573,0.020656079,-0.000858937,-0.041131216,0.024682593
Cloning and sequencing of the matrix protein (M) gene of turkey rhinotracheitis virus reveal a gene order different from that of respiratory syncytial virus,"Abstract Several biochemical properties and the sequence of the fusion glycoprotein (F) have indicated that turkey rhinotracheitis virus (TRTV) is a pneumovirus, subfamily Pneumovirinae of the Paramyxoviridae family. As TRTV was known to generate polycistronic mRNAs, cDNA was generated from TRTV strain U K/3 BV/85-infected Vero cell mRNAs using an oligonucleotide primer corresponding to a region of the F gene. Sequencing of four cDNAs revealed that the gene adjacent to the beginning (3′ end) of the F gene was that for the matrix (M) protein, i.e., that TRTV had the partial gene order 3′-M-F-5′. This was unexpected as human respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, the type species of the genus Pneumovirus, has the partial gene order 3′-M-SH-G-F-5′, where SH and G are the small hydrophobic protein and attachment glycoprotein, respectively. Instead TRTV resembled the Morbillivirus and Paramyxovirus genera of the Paramyxoviridae (subfamily Paramyxoviridae) which have the partial gene order 3′-M-F-5′. Two further oligonucleotides, one corresponding to a sequence near the end of the M gene and the other (oligo B) to a sequence near the beginning of the F gene, with their 5′ ends spaced 300 nucleotides apart on the basis of the cDNA sequence, were used in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using genomic RNA as template. Only a PCR product of 0.3 kb was obtained. The same sized product was also obtained using these oligonucleotides and genomic RNA from three other TRTV strains (SA/91 /78, UK/8544/85, and SA/2381/88) which had been grown in chicken tracheal organ cultures. In addition PCR was performed using genomic RNA from TRTV-3BV and SA/2381/88 with oligo B and another oligonucleotide near the 5′ end of the gene upstream from M, spaced 1141 nucleotides apart on the basis of the sequence data. Only a 1.14-kb PCR product was obtained. Larger products would have been expected if another gene had been situated between M and F. The absence of such larger products, plus the demonstration that infected cells contained M-F dicistronic mRNAs, supported the conclusion that in the TRTV genome the M gene is adjacent to the F gene in the order 3'-M-F-5′. The 5′ termini of the M and F mRNAs were confirmed by mRNA mapping. The TRTV M gene encoded a protein of 254 amino acids, very similar to that of RS virus (256 residues; 37% amino acid identity) but very different from that of the morbilliviruses and paramyxoviruses (approximately 350 residues). Thus, on the basis of the sequences of both the M and the F genes, TRTV is more closely related to the pneumoviruses than to the paramyxoviruses and morbilliviruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.131066245,-0.031618215,0.03513025,-0.040852174,0.110536744,-0.02823365,-0.113716389,-0.004775468,0.023922959,-0.02774968,-0.085371618,-0.042204618,0.029402531,-0.038655865,-0.024809576,-0.045228955,0.019316281,-0.002286441,-0.002484637,-0.027250862,0.032819238,0.008856104,0.025594597,0.025596447,-0.017991958,-0.006533535,0.018240673,-0.027628439,0.010334304,0.039311371
The 9-kDa hydrophobic protein encoded at the 3′ end of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus genome is membrane-associated,"Abstract The open reading frame potentially encoding a 78 amino acid, 9101 Da hydrophobic protein (HP) and, mapping at the 3′ end of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) genome, was shown to be expressed during virus replication. The cloned HP gene was placed in a plasmid under control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and in vitro translation of transcripts generated in vitro yielded a 9.1-kDa protein that was immunoprecipitable with porcine hyperimmune anti-TGEV serum. Antiserum raised in rabbits against a 31 amino acid synthetic polypeptide that represented the central hydrophilic region of HP specifically immunoprecipitated HP from TGEV-infected cells. HP was further shown to become associated with microsomal membranes during synthesis in vitro and was found to be closely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and cell surface membranes in infected cells. The intracellular location of HP suggests that it may play a role in the membrane association of replication complexes or in virion assembly.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.150810138,-0.048356512,-0.013611106,-0.057683881,-0.012069268,-0.021430374,-0.073514843,-0.016940607,0.040974839,-0.061724964,-0.059934816,-0.014243671,-0.002388431,-0.001582633,0.026198138,-0.060703264,0.035101355,-0.017314686,0.029901374,0.053616014,-0.029832528,0.004363614,0.00893199,-0.021994888,0.055231358,0.045002164,-0.021419032,-0.040204352,-0.05488836,0.02269888
The hemagglutinin/esterase gene of human coronavirus strain OC43: Phylogenetic relationships to bovine and murine coronaviruses and influenza C virus,"Abstract The complete nucleotide sequences of the hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) genes of human coronavirus (HCV) strain OC43 and bovine respiratory coronavirus (BRCV) strain G95 were determined from single-stranded cDNA fragments generated by reverse transcription of virus-specific mRNAs and amplified by polymerase chain reaction. An open reading frame of 1272 nucleotides was identified as the putative HE gene by homology to the bovine coronavirus HE gene. This open reading frame encodes a protein of 424 amino acids with an estimated molecular weight of 47.7 kDa. Ten potential N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted in the HE protein of HCV-OC43 while nine of them were present in BRCV-G95. Fourteen cysteine residues were conserved in the HE proteins of both viruses. Two hydrophobic sequences at the N-terminus and the C-terminus may serve as signal peptide and transmembrane anchoring domain, respectively. The predicted HE protein of HCV-OC43 was 95% identical to the HEs of BRCV-G95 and other bovine coronaviruses, and 60% identical to the HEs of mouse hepatitis viruses. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the HE genes of coronaviruses and influenza C virus have a common ancestral origin, and that bovine coronaviruses and HCV-OC43 are closely related.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.129473888,-0.042130263,-0.022607352,-0.001431979,0.156031848,-0.004385494,-0.103625138,-0.020987344,0.069227965,-0.067809756,-0.141068742,0.075595782,0.152467027,-0.045166701,-0.057231658,-0.138969882,0.087904522,0.138998119,0.227885241,-0.049903641,-0.031126228,-0.020632121,0.06475562,0.109536075,-0.006476037,-0.009716782,-0.000188186,-0.025667121,-0.066239779,-0.071855587
Human coronavirus gene expression in the brains of multiple sclerosis patients,"Abstract Total RNA extracted from both white and gray matter of brain tissue from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and controls was analyzed using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for the presence of the nucleic acid of human coronavirus (HCV) 229E and OC43, the two strains characterized to date and associated with respiratory infections. HCV-229E viral RNA was detectable in the central nervous system tissue of 4 of 11 MS patients and in none of 6 neurological and 5 normal controls. No HCV-OC43 nucleic acid was detected in any of the specimens. These results suggest a neurotropism on the part of the 229E strain of human coronavirus and underline the importance of further studies on its tissue distribution. The fact that it was detected only in tissue from MS patients illustrates the need for continued studies on the possible role of coronaviruses in the etiology of MS.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.013921044,-0.016927619,-0.032769435,-0.035096973,0.023928064,-0.053203019,0.008225488,0.011054156,-0.017560094,0.046894006,-0.019616916,0.127353172,0.130361928,0.077440619,-0.026846887,-0.030349102,0.012710389,0.14432289,0.162890574,-0.060792399,-0.031756124,-0.051274616,0.065301488,0.036708334,-0.026803172,-0.063875784,-0.068938346,0.065558178,-0.095704724,-0.028456808
Comparison of a dengue-2 virus and its candidate vaccine derivative: Sequence relationships with the flaviviruses and other viruses,"Abstract A comparison of the sequence of the dengue-2 16681 virus with that of the candidate vaccine strain (16681-PDK53) derived from it identified 53 of the 10,723 nucleotides which differed between the strains. Nucleotide changes occurred in genes coding for all virion and nonvirion proteins, and in the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions. Twenty-seven of the nucleotide changes resulted in amino acid alterations. The greatest amino acid sequence differences in the virion proteins occurred in prM (2.20%; 2 91 amino acids) followed by the M protein (1.33%; 1 75 amino acids), the C protein (0.88%; 1 114 amino acid), and the E protein (0.61%; 3 495 amino acids). Differences in the amino acid sequence of nonvirion proteins ranged from 1.51% ( 6 398 amino acids) in NS4 to 0.33% ( 3 900 amino acids) in NS5. The encoded protein sequences of 16681-PDK53 were also compared with the published sequences of other flaviviruses to obtain a detailed classification of 17 flaviviruses using the neighbor-joining tree method. The analyses of the sequence data produced dendrograms which supported the traditional groupings based on serological evidence, and they suggested that the flaviviruses have evolved by divergent mutational change and there was no evidence of genetic recombination between members of the group. Comparisons of the sequences of the flavivirus polymerase and helicase-like proteins (NS5 and NS3, respectively) with those from other viruses yielded a classification of the flaviviruses indicating that the primary division of the flaviviruses was between those transmitted by mosquitoes and those transmitted by ticks.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.137640406,-0.055155531,0.002351386,-0.06427179,0.089531023,0.01101103,-0.074886242,-0.012590949,0.014279688,-0.011591818,-0.091065642,0.040991022,0.013836011,-0.145948145,-0.054277508,-0.131759702,0.053181244,-0.010932996,-0.008255622,0.029095475,0.006452117,-0.03288473,-0.005707391,0.014562314,0.024986866,0.092726241,0.054928674,-0.055238638,-0.094162331,0.055129006
Evidence for variable rates of recombination in the MHV genome,"Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus has been shown to undergo RNA recombination at high frequency during mixed infection. Temperature-sensitive mutants were isolated using 5-fluorouracil and 5-azacytidine as mutagen. Six RNA+ mutants that reside within a single complementation group mapping within the S glycoprotein gene of MHV-A59 were isolated which did not cause syncytium at the restrictive temperature. Using standard genetic techniques, a recombination map was established that indicated that these mutants mapped into two distinct domains designated F1 and F2. These genetic domains may correspond to mutations mapping within the S1 and S2 glycoproteins, respectively, and suggest that both the S1 and S2 domains are important in eliciting the fusogenic activity of the S glycoprotein gene. In addition, assuming that most distal is alleles map roughly 4.0 kb apart, a recombination frequency of 1 % per 575–676 by was predicted through the S glycoprotein gene. Interestingly, this represents a threefold increase in the recombination frequency as compared to rates predicted through the polymerase region. The increase in the recombination rate was probably not due to recombination events resulting in large deletions or insertions (>50 bp), but rather was probably due to a combination of homologous and nonhomologous recombination. A variety of explanations could account for the increased rates of recombination in the S gene.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.128508938,-0.044088738,0.000509669,-0.028409742,0.086828443,-0.025726579,-0.055582322,0.011438482,-0.013640871,0.021967625,0.010405323,0.015089649,-0.008071471,-0.056181745,0.007809624,0.058310053,-0.073915918,0.016899032,-0.04317591,-0.011745953,0.081534088,-0.095996626,0.051938045,0.088649729,-0.01764894,0.042856289,0.066645534,-0.026483883,-0.096563177,-0.032071001
Coronavirus mRNA synthesis: Identification of novel transcription initiation signals which are differentially regulated by different leader sequences,"Abstract The mRNA synthesis of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) has been proposed to be the result of interaction between the leader RNA and the intergenic sites. Previously, we have identified a transcription initiation site (for mRNA 2-1), which is more efficiently transcribed by viruses containing two copies of UCUAA sequence in the leader RNA than by those with three copies. In this study, we have identified several sites which are regulated in the opposite way, namely, they are efficiently transcribed by the leader RNA with three UCUAA copies but not by those with two copies. These sites were characterized by primer extension and amplification by polymerase chain reaction. One of these sites is in the gene 3 region of a recombinant virus between A59 and JHM strains of MHV. Another is in the gene 2 region of MHV-1 strain. Both of these sites have a sequence similar to but different from the consensus transcription initiation signal (UCUAAUCUAUC and UUUAAUCUU, as opposed to UCUAAAC). These two novel intergenic sequences are not present in the genome of the JHM strain, consistent with the absence of these mRNAs in the JHM-infected cells. The discovery of this type of transcription initiation site provides additional evidence for the importance of the leader RNA in the transcription initiation of MHV mRNAs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.201111659,-0.055817469,0.006605324,0.030627737,0.082602469,-0.110008122,-0.168495262,0.031880232,-0.00722999,-0.079660422,-0.054340862,-0.073613255,0.035263535,-0.001791552,0.060194921,0.070159831,-0.094608578,0.04209274,-0.015378484,0.004860631,0.052620712,0.003877138,0.026592886,0.076296959,0.085604995,0.008112172,-0.015992472,0.017327812,0.042332519,0.046733032
The mechanism of RNA recombination in poliovirus,"Abstract We have investigated RNA recombination among poliovirus genomes by analyzing both intratypic and intertypic recombinant crosses involving the same defined genetic markers. Sequence analysis of the recombinant junctions of 13 nonsibling intertypic recombinants showed that intertypic RNA recombination is not site-specific, nor does it require extensive homology between the recombining parents at the crossover site. To discriminate between breaking-rejoining and copy choice mechanisms of RNA recombination, we have inhibited the replication of the recombining parents independently and found opposite effects on the frequency of genetic recombination in intratypic crosses. The results strongly support a copy choice mechanism for RNA recombination, in which the viral RNA polymerase switches templates during negative strand synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.187405901,-0.054103589,-0.044146482,0.058631924,0.034325976,-0.080744426,-0.030497611,0.041680195,-0.056249697,0.020822637,0.085367441,0.025276188,-0.024267084,-0.001592358,0.030542085,0.086927704,-0.089676739,-0.005428422,-0.045859762,-0.036844227,0.043648105,-0.040533868,0.013704031,0.023589682,-0.059194784,-0.026764382,0.026506315,0.010448575,-0.061943842,0.002029846
Prevalence of group A and group B rotaviruses in the feces of neonatal dairy calves from California,"Abstract 136 fecal samples, collected from 47 dairy calves on a calf ranch and in a dairy herd in California, were tested for the presence of group A and group B rotaviruses by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Samples were collected from each calf at days 1, 7 and 14. Within the 14 day period, 44 calves (94%) were positive for group A rotavirus and an unexpectedly high number of calves (38 calves, 81%) were positive for group B rotavirus. When these samples were examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), rotavirus was found in 21 calves and all of them had group A electropherotype. Among 25 PAGE positive samples from 21 calves, 17 (68%) were of short electropherotype, 4 (28%) were of long electropherotype and 4 (28%) contained both short and long electropherotype rotaviruses.

"Cloning, expression and characterization of biologically active feline tumour necrosis factor-α","Abstract We report the cloning, expression and characterization of biologically active feline tumour necrosis factor-α (fTNF-α). Messenger RNA was extracted from feline peritoneal macrophage cultures and used to synthesize cDNA for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The PCR products were cloned into the plasmid vector pCRII and sequenced, showing 99.3% homology with a published fTNF-α gene sequence. Subcloning into the vector pGEX-2T and subsequent expression resulted in a 43 kDa fusion protein of fTNF-α and glutathione S-transferase (GST). Thrombin cleavage of the fusion protein yielded a 17 kDa protein. This protein cross-reacted with a monoclonal anti-human TNF-α antibody in Western blotting, but not with a polyclonal anti-murine TNF-α serum. Recombinant fTNF-α (rfTNF-α) and rfTNF-α-GST had a CD50 of 15 ng ml−1 and 230 ng ml−1, respectively, in the L929 cytotoxicity assay. Cats given rfTNF-α-GST intravenously manifested the typical biological effects of TNF-α, including fever, depression, and piloerection.

Polymerase chain reaction for probe synthesis and for direct amplification in detection of bovine coronavirus,"Abstract The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to synthesize ds and ss probes for the detection of bovine coronavirus (BCV) using recombinant plasmids as template molecules. The ds probes detected a minimum of about 2 × 105 viral genomes after exposure for 1 h, a detection limit similar to nick-translated probes after exposure of the films for 60 h. More than 8 h exposure to blots probed with these ds probes resulted in complete darkening of the film. The ss probes, synthesized by asymmetric PCR on linearized plasmids, permitted the detection of 5 × 104 genomes, which equalled the capacity of random-primed probes. Prolonged exposure did not increase the background as in case of ds PCR-probed blots. Probes, synthesized by asymmetric PCR and random-priming were labeled to similar specific activities and were better in terms of sensitivity and detectability as opposed to nick-translated probes. However, the specificity of detection with ss probes as to random primed probes was increased further. About 10 viral genomes, after fragment-specific amplification by PCR, were detected by agarose-gel analysis. PCR-probe synthesis was simple, highly reproducible, and allowed the synthesis of probes for specific fragments.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.022909019,0.019712593,0.114644319,5.88E-05,-0.018149931,-0.017701876,-0.002983118,0.00829222,-0.016390206,0.000300973,-0.013691419,-0.010598321,0.015125703,-0.011912017,0.013779263,0.016656308,0.001644204,-0.021010197,-0.016445575,-0.078007357,-0.003639232,0.011550066,0.034137816,-0.019691071,-0.009230611,-0.023967694,-0.017239481,-0.016031335,-0.009978223,0.044608311
"Type-specific identification of influenza viruses A, B and C by the polymerase chain reaction","Abstract The aim of this study was to develop a polymerase chain reaction for specific detection of influenza A, B, and C RNA genomes. Three primer sets were selected from conserved regions of the genome coding for the non-structural proteins and were tested on 61 influenza A (22 H1N1, 9 H2N2, and 30 H3N2), 11 influenza B, and three influenza C isolates. Specific amplified products were obtained with all these strains after electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. The specificity of the reaction was increased by hybridization with oligonucleotide probes. When nucleic acids from a variety of micro-organisms from the respiratory tract were subjected to the PCR with these primers, no specific amplified products were generated. The sensitivity of the technique was found to be at the subpicogram level. The RNA-PCR was applied to 21 clinical specimens from patients with a culture/IF proven influenza infection. Six influenza A positive patients and 13 influenza B positive patients could be confirmed in the RNA-PCR. In two cases, influenza B positive IF specimens were found negative by the PCR. No virus could be isolated on eggs or tissue culture from these samples.

An appraisal of different methods for the detection of the walnut strain of cherry leafroll virus,"Abstract Three methods were evaluated for the detection of cherry leafroll virus: ELISA, dot-blot and reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Dot-blot and RT-PCR were carried out in crude plant extracts without any further RNA purification. Dot-blot hybridization using a 32P-labelled DNA probe was as sensitive as previously reported ELISA results for cherry leafroll virus detection. The most sensitive method was RT-PCR, which amplified a specific fragment of 448 bp from the 3' untranslated region of both viral genomic RNAs.

Optimization of extraction and PCR amplification of RNA extracts from paraffin-embedded tissue in different fixatives,"Abstract A method was developed for fast and efficient isolation of RNA from paraffin-embedded tissue sections for subsequent PCR analysis. This method is based on the binding of RNA to acid-treated glass beads in the presence of a high molarity of guanidinium salt. It can be completed within an hour, and obviates the need for dewaxing and phenol/chloroform extractions. The effect of various fixatives and fixation times was tested and the amplification of actin mRNA fragments ranging in length from 82 to 507 bp was used to demonstrate the presence of RNA in the extracts. The method was compared to existing extraction techniques by studying the quality of the templates for reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction amplification (RT-PCR), using virus-infected and mock-infected paraffin-embedded cell pellets as a model. PCR amplification of cellular and viral RNA was successful for RNA isolated by use of all extraction techniques, although the glass bead method was preferred for its simplicity and rapidity. Specimens fixed with formalin were found to be suitable for PCR, but the best results were obtained with acetone-fixed paraffin-embedded material. Dewaxing of tissue sections had no effect on the yield and quality of RNA extractions, and further purification of the extracts using gel filtration did not improve the results. After the protocols were optimized, rotavirus-infected cell pellets were used to demonstrate that extraction and amplification of dsRNA was possible. The information obtained from the studies with the model system was used for extraction of toroviral and rotaviral RNA from archival intestinal material. These data indicate that paraffin-embedded archival tissue can be used for RT-PCR analysis, adding an important technique to diagnostic pathology and retrospective studies.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.074814998,0.045020601,0.14957316,0.068398565,-0.048134739,-0.064651309,-0.007222254,0.0040994,-0.034028098,0.024154158,0.028751967,-0.023614961,0.017698849,0.047115117,0.027025633,0.031142074,-0.012306938,0.002470659,-0.043770023,-0.059433993,-0.057788264,0.005186535,0.027274415,-0.067383208,-0.025169833,-0.029562207,-0.027958212,-0.005287267,-0.037305725,0.05476754
Genic amplification of the entire coding region of the HEF RNA segment of influenza C virus,"Abstract In order to provide an easy and powerful analysis of influenza C viral HEF RNA segment of a recent strain, a combination of reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction was used. We amplified the entire coding region of the HEF gene of a laboratory strain of virus called C/Johannesburg/1/66, widely used for binding and esterase activity studies as well as that of a strain isolated in 1991 (C/Paris/145/91) from a patient suffering from severe flu syndrome. The sequences we amplified were about 2 kilobases long. In this work, we show that the forward ‘universal primer’ Unil, which has been used for influenza A and B viruses cDNA syntheses can also be used for influenza C virus. The PCR primers were designed to contain restriction sites to make the PCR products ready to be used for further purposes. A restriction analysis of the PCR products combined with analyses of all the human influenza C virus HEF gene sequences published so far permitted the design of sets of oligonucleotides which can prime PCR on cDNA of unknown influenza C virus for cloning.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.010420807,-0.03885692,0.066810901,0.154216993,0.07280442,0.195312083,-0.194910198,-0.024743153,-0.017295238,-0.016473491,-0.01474011,-0.023969681,0.057033092,-0.004345164,0.000677017,-0.040252529,0.021969575,0.003814244,-0.023108449,-0.060102288,0.031032979,0.032235297,0.059559646,0.029333945,-0.019286392,-0.01994717,0.006424982,-0.023760884,-0.028819047,0.112611412
Inhibitory effect of papaverine on RNA and protein synthesis of vesicular stomatitis virus,"Abstract Papaverine, an inhibitor of cAMP phosphodiesterase, reduced yields of infectious vesicular stomatitis virus in HEp-2 cells approximately 100-fold if added to cultures at a concentration of 30 μM before and after virus infection. The extent of papaverine-induced suppression of viral growth was dependent on drug dose and treatment regimen. Cells progressively recovered their viral permissive state after removal of drug. The cyclic nucleotide, cGMP, nullified the inhibitory effect of papaverine if added to cells during drug treatment. Pulse labeling experiments with [35S]methionine showed that papaverine compromises production of all virus-specific proteins in infected cells without adversely affecting host cell protein synthesis. Treatment of cells with papaverine strongly inhibited the production of viral RNA and both cellular RNA and DNA. It was found that VSV causes an immediate but transient stimulation of DNA synthesis in HEp-2 cells which is prevented by papaverine treatment. This drug also selectively blocked primary transcription of VSV in vivo and to a lesser extent in vitro RNA polymerase activity of the virion-bound transcriptase. The finding that papaverine has a strong inhibitory effect on viral biosynthesis including early transcription suggests that VSV replication may depend on host factors that regulate intracellular levels of cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.172517394,-0.061936397,-0.050322026,0.004487502,-0.15982248,0.042369919,0.045419745,-0.032709628,0.057081098,0.026209455,0.006572873,-0.073313601,0.003683436,0.15151141,0.010600424,0.025455,-0.016864037,0.018761908,0.045424505,0.052908576,-0.031226323,0.053815223,-0.012240976,0.000488061,0.02935635,0.013647181,0.011484755,0.012627521,-0.019236223,0.057796658
Sequence of the S gene from a virulent British field isolate of transmissible gastroenteritis virus,"Abstract Subgenomic mRNA from a virulent field isolate of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), strain FS772/70, was used to produce cDNA. The cDNA from three overlapping clones was sequenced by the chain termination method and two open reading frames (ORFs) were identified. The largest ORF, 4350bp, encoded a polypeptide of 1449 amino acids of relative molecular mass (Mr) 159811, which contained 33 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, a cysteine-rich region, and a potential transmembrane region. The C-terminal half of this ORF showed homology to the S proteins of four other coronaviruses. The other ORF consisted of the 3'-end of a gene with homology to the carboxyl terminus of the F2 subunit of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) RNA polymerase.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.166032375,-0.046212667,0.033561366,-0.048989541,0.153716016,-0.029992114,-0.196760104,-0.02321185,0.056149146,0.043794699,-0.088926605,-0.029273172,0.041195749,-0.11191138,-0.049305751,-0.099612134,0.07671761,0.0249758,0.043796511,0.058754447,-0.050030593,-0.032125829,-0.002058204,0.003347991,-0.008438285,0.024940247,0.022484039,-0.047378502,-0.02117681,-0.000719008
The cloning and sequencing of the virion protein genes from a British isolate of porcine respiratory coronavirus: comparison with transmissible gastroenteritis virus genes,"Abstract Previous analysis of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) mRNA species showed that mRNAs 2 and 3 were smaller than the corresponding transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) mRNA species (Page et al. (1991) J. Gen. Virol. 72, 579–587). Sequence analysis showed that mRNA 3 was smaller due to the presence of a new putative RNA-leader binding site upstream of the PRCV ORF-3 gene. However, this observation did not explain the deletion observed in PRCV mRNA 2. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to generate cDNA from the 3' coding region of the putative polymerase gene to the poly (A) tail of PRCV for comparison to the equivalent region from TGEV. The PRCV S protein was found to consist of 1225 amino acids, which had 98% similarity to the TGEV S protein. However, the PRCV S gene contained a 672 nucleotide deletion, corresponding to 224 amino acids (residues 21 to 245 in TGEV S protein), 59 nucleotides downstream of the S gene initiation codon. The PRCV genome from the ORF-3 gene to the poly (A) tail was sequenced for comparison to TGEV in order to identify other potential differences between the two viruses. Four ORFs were identified that showed 98% similarity to the TGEV ORF-4, M, N and ORF-7 genes. No other deletions or any PRCV specific sequences were identified.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.137012371,-0.041151691,0.017267746,-0.072026014,0.105310842,-0.036918934,-0.129177951,-0.005995974,0.025614584,-0.071918393,-0.113745242,-0.025886523,0.019040036,-0.080695063,-0.005257969,-0.096284528,0.058088286,-0.003264608,0.011424019,0.014767691,0.013117344,-0.00351761,0.006092732,0.038399946,0.020779945,-0.002177651,0.012803092,-0.049475108,0.042390926,0.017597945
Sequence analysis of human coronavirus 229E mRNAs 4 and 5: evidence for polymorphism and homology with myelin basic protein,"Abstract Human coronaviruses (HCV) are important pathogens responsible for respiratory, gastrointestinal and possibly neurological disorders. To better understand the molecular biology of the prototype HCV-229E strain, the nucleotide sequence of the 5'-unique regions of mRNAs 4 and 5 were determined from cloned cDNAs. Sequence analysis of the cDNAs synthesized from mRNA 4 revealed a major difference with previously published results. However, polymerase chain reaction amplification of this region showed that the sequenced cDNAs were produced from minor RNA species, an indication of possible genetic polymorphism in this region of the viral genome. The mutated messenger RNA 4 contains two ORFs: (1) ORF4a consisting of 132 nucleotides which potentially encodes a 44-amino acid polypeptide of 4653 Da; this coding sequence is preceded by a consensus transcriptional initiation sequence, CUAAACU, similar to the ones found upstream of the N and M genes; (2) ORF4b of 249 nucleotides potentially encoding an 83-amino acid basic and leucine-rich polypeptide of 9550 Da. On the other hand, mRNA 5 contains one single ORF of 231 nucleotides which could encode a 77-amino acid basic and leucine-rich polypeptide of 9046 Da. This putative protein presents a significant degree of amino acid homology (33%) with its counterpart found in transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). The proteins in the two different viruses exhibit similar molecular weights and are extremely hydrophobic. Interestingly, a sequence homology of five amino acids was found between the protein encoded by ORF4b of HCV-229E and an immunologically important region of human myelin basic protein.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.1723439,-0.058732723,-0.013616904,-0.02274303,0.112367978,-0.056931464,-0.09057054,0.008092761,0.032887701,-0.025714488,-0.131782976,0.040891859,0.117760399,-0.130595377,-0.063488788,-0.146778443,0.063009397,0.098694422,0.113010176,-0.013890444,-0.032731645,-0.038654141,0.024768253,0.047605729,-0.028156732,-0.013930306,-0.007971576,-0.002106961,-0.057728468,-0.007433034
Detection of negative-stranded subgenomic RNAs but not of free leader in LDV-infected macrophages,"Abstract The mechanism of synthesis of the seven subgenomic mRNAs of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) was explored. One proposed mechanism, leader-primed transcription, predicts the formation of free 5'-leader in infected cells which then primes reinitiation of transcription at specific complementary sites on the antigenomic template. No free LDV 5'-leader of 156 nucleotides was detected in LDV-infected macrophages. Another mechanism, independent replication of the subgenomic mRNAs, predicts the presence of negative complements to all subgenomic mRNAs in infected cells which might be generated from subgenomic mRNAs in virions. Full-length antigenomic RNA was detected in LDV-infected macrophages by Northern hybridization at a level of < 1% of that of genomic RNA, but no negative polarity subgenomic RNAs. Negative complements to all subgenomic mRNAs, however, were detected by reverse transcription of total RNA from infected macrophages using as primer an oligonucleotide complementary to the antileader followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification using this sense primer in combination with various oligonucleotide primers complementary to a segment downstream of the junction between the 5' leader and the body of each subgenomic RNA. It is unclear whether these minute amounts of negative subgenomic RNAs function in the replication of the subgenomic mRNAs. They could also be by-products of the RNA replication process. Finally, no subgenomic mRNAs were detected in LDV virions.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.156668359,-0.054365591,-0.010906094,0.016535458,0.000435115,-0.092605358,-0.093925662,0.033248108,-0.011306375,-0.063775196,0.009558162,-0.063706951,0.015231525,0.058029242,0.081632867,0.084975681,-0.067815196,0.016072083,0.002068325,-0.002541644,-0.022061346,0.018250027,-0.008166077,-0.032443146,0.025731659,-0.05865221,-0.06037425,0.035687001,0.049776906,0.034283557
The membrane glycoprotein G1 of Uukuniemi virus contains a signal for localization to the Golgi complex,"Abstract Members of the Bunyaviridae family acquire their envelopes by budding into the Golgi complex (GC). The accumulation of the membrane glycoproteins G1 and G2 in the GC probably determines the site of maturation. Here we have studied the intracellular transport and targeting to the GC of G1 and G2 of Uukuniemi virus, a member of the Phlebovirus genus, and report on their expression from cloned cDNAs either together or separately by using a T7 RNA polymerase-driven vaccinia virus expression system. When G1 and G2 were expressed together from a full-length cDNA as the p110 precursor, both proteins were localized to the Golgi complex, as evidenced by colocalization with the Golgi marker enzyme mannosidase II. Immunofluorescent staining indicated that G1 expressed alone also localized to the GC. However, pulse-chase experiments showed that G1 remained endoglycosidase H sensitive. G2 expressed alone remained associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). G2 could be rescued from the ER and transported to the GC by coexpression with G1 from separate mRNAs. Coexpression also increased the efficiency of G1 transport to the GC. With none of the constructs could the glycoproteins be observed on the cell surface. These results show that efficient export of G1 and G2 from the ER requires coexpression of both proteins, in conformity with our previous results showing that G1 and G2 from heterodimeric complexes in the ER. Since G1 expressed alone is retained in the GC, we conclude that G1 contains a retention signal for localization to the GC. G2 might thus become associated with the GC indirectly via its interaction with G1.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.079763263,-0.035533978,0.003542097,-0.07151101,-0.040164457,0.016780008,0.006706599,-0.011822157,0.021681489,-0.039116608,-0.032665521,0.003463874,-0.020327315,0.008465106,0.003262357,0.011705579,0.019285963,-0.036567691,-0.013556659,-0.007302108,0.000593445,0.000385878,-0.006857839,-0.037830199,0.01693801,0.014316785,-0.021958002,0.015509385,-0.018498662,-0.01166525
Cloning and sequencing of a 8.4-kb region from the 3′-end of a Taiwanese virulent isolate of the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus,"Abstract The nucleotide sequence (8396 nucleotides) was determined, from the 3′-end of the putative polymerase gene to the poly(A) tail, for a Taiwanese virulent isolate, TFI, of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). The TFI nucleotide sequence had very high identity to the British virulent field isolate FS772/70 (98.3%), the attenuated Purdue 115 (96.7%) and from the S gene to ORF-4 gene region, to the low passaged virulent Miller (98.3%) strains of TGEV. Comparison of the TFI S protein sequence with those determined from other TGEV strains and those of the TGEV variant, porcine respiratory coronavirus, isolated from Europe and North America showed that they had changed very little over a period of 4 decades. The two extra amino acids found to be present in the spike proteins of the virulent FS772/70 and Miller strains when compared to the avirulent Purdue strain were found to be present in the TFI strain.

Detection of related positive-strand RNA virus genomes by reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers for common replicase sequences,"Abstract A set of degenerate sense and antisense primers were designed on the basis of short segments with identical amino acids in the predicted ORF 1b replicase proteins of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), equine arteritis virus (EAV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, strain Lelystad virus (PRRSV-LV), which are members of a new group of positive-strand RNA viruses. Reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction amplification using this set of degenerate primers yielded products of the expected size from the genomes of all three viruses. It also yielded a product of appropriate size from the genome of another strain of PRRSV (VR2332), the ORF 1b sequence of which is unknown, but the 3′ end of the genome of which differs from that of the PRRSV-LV genome by about 50%. No products were generated from the genome of simian hemorhagic fever virus (SHFV), another member of this virus group. However, an appropriate product was generated with a second set of degenerate primers which was designed from the same ORF 1b segments of LDV, EAV and PRRSV-LV as the first set but on the basis of human codon preferences. Sequence analysis showed that the amplified SHFV ORF 1b segment exhibited about 50% nucleotide identity with the corresponding segments of ORF 1b of LDV, EAV and PRRSV.

A general method for the induction and screening of antisera for cDNA-encoded polypeptides: antibodies specific for a coronavirus putative polymerase-encoding gene,"Abstract A prokaryotic vector, pGE374, containing the recA and lacZ genes, out-of-frame, was used for the expression of cDNA derived from the putative polymerase-encoding gene of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59). The pGE374/viral recombinant vector generates a tripartite bacterial/viral protein composed of a segment of the RecA protein at the N terminus, the coronaviral sequences in the middle, and an enzymatically active β-galactosidase at the C terminus. Rabbits immunized with such recombinant proteins generated antibodies to the MHV-A59 portion of the tripartite protein. Because the MHV-A59 polymerase proteins have been difficult to identify during infection, we used a novel method to demonstrate the viral specificity of the antiserum. The viral cDNA was excised from the expression vector, and transferred to a pGem vector, downstream from and in-frame with a portion of the cat gene. This construct contained a bacteriophage RNA polymerase promoter that enabled the cell-free synthesis of a fusion protein that was used to verify that antibodies were generated to the expressed viral DNA.

Enhancement of the vaccinia virus/phage T7 RNA polymerase expression system using encephalomyocarditis virus 5'-untranslated region sequences,"Abstract A recombinant vaccinia virus producing the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase was used to express foreign genes in eukaryotic cells. Translation efficiency in this expression system was enhanced significantly by employing the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 5'-untranslated region (UTR) which confers cap-independent translation by directing internal initiation of translation. The enhancement was accomplished by fusing open reading frames (ORFs) to the N terminus of the EMCV polyprotein coding region, thus utilizing its highly efficient translation initiation site. Expression vectors were constructed to allow cloning in all three reading frames. As reporter genes, we used the lacZ gene and a number of genes encoding coronavirus structural proteins: among others the genes encoding glycoproteins with N-terminal signal sequences. The signal sequences of these glycoproteins are located internally in the primary translation product. We demonstrated that this did not interfere with translocation and glycosylation and yields biologically active proteins. The usefulness of sequences that direct internal initiation was extended by using EMCV UTR s to express two and three ORFs from polycistronic mRNAs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.176274703,-0.060981204,-0.016474763,-0.039696711,0.036067763,-0.034662712,-0.116648536,0.00250996,0.030461317,-0.053527872,-0.134981687,-0.060302262,0.044858718,-0.034176701,-0.052066995,-0.068836091,0.05083491,-0.033978969,-0.011379857,-0.005516234,-0.005812023,0.015657758,0.00158479,0.024432166,-0.04240231,-0.056428904,0.011395831,0.021891651,0.072161431,-0.001827352
Mapping of a region of dengue virus type-2 glycoprotein required for binding by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody,"Abstract Envelope glycoprotein E of flaviviruses is exposed at the surface of the virion, and is responsible for eliciting a neutralizing antibody (Ab) response, as well as protective immunity in the host. In this report, we describe a method for the fine mapping of a linear sequence of the E protein of dengue virus type-2 (DEN-2), recognized by a type-specific and neutralizing monoclonal Ab (mAb), 3H5. First, an Escherichia coli expression vector containing a heat-inducible λ p l promoter was used to synthesize several truncated, and near-full length E polypeptides. Reactivities of these polypeptides with polyclonal mouse hyperimmune sera, as well as the 3H5 mAb revealed the location of the 3H5-binding site to be within a region of 166 amino acids (aa) between aa 255 and 422. For fine mapping, a series of targeted deletions were made inframe within this region using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The hydrophilicity pattern of this region was used as a guide to systematically delete the regions encoding the various groups of surface aa residues within the context of a near-full-length E polypeptide by using PCR. The 3H5-binding site was thus precisely mapped to a region encoding 12 aa (between aa 386 and 397). A synthetic peptide containing this sequence was able to bind to the 3H5 mAb specifically, as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, we show that rabbit Abs raised against the synthetic peptide of 12 aa were able to bind to the authentic E protein, and to neutralize DEN-2 virus in a plaque reduction assay.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.099592209,-0.019761337,0.042785163,-0.053080864,0.004939291,0.002338355,-0.052005931,-0.024662051,0.028962052,-0.05045278,-0.059306934,0.00780268,0.00685404,-0.050393169,-0.019230095,-0.060691566,0.038374354,-0.020374097,-0.011716675,-0.014561667,0.029711741,-0.019672026,0.037813111,0.005865104,0.028651166,0.057053039,0.029642816,-0.034900165,-0.01802985,0.030759678
Molecular biology of transmissible gastroenteritis virus,"Abstract The causative agent (TGEV) of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis belongs to the Coronaviridae, a family of enveloped viruses with a positive, single-stranded RNA genome. Important progress has recently been made concerning the molecular biology of TGEV. The research work of our group has been focused on two main aspects: genome structure and functional domains of the envelope proteins. TGEV genomic RNA is organised into seven regions. The sequence of six of them, i.e. the 3′ most 8300 nucleotides, has been established from cDNA clones. Three genes encoding the structural proteins, the peplomer protein E2, the transmembrane protein E1 and the nucleoprotein, have been identified. Additional open reading frames allowed for the prediction of four non-structural polypeptides, the role of which remains to be discovered. The remaining part of the genome (estimated length 20 kb) is thought to encode the polymerase. Expression of TGEV genes involves the production of six subgenomic mRNAs, which together with the virion RNA, form a 3′ terminal nested set. The peplomer glycoprotein E2 (220 kDa) is 1431 residues long and highly glycosylated. Several domains were identified, including a C-terminal anchoring region and at least four major antigenic sites, which cluster in the amino half part of the molecule. Two sites containing most of the critical neutralisation determinants are highly conserved among TGEV strains. The glycoprotein E1 (29kDa) is mostly embedded in the membrane and plays a crucial role in the virion architecture. However, a short N-terminal domain protruding out of the particle mediates complement-dependent neutralisation, and induces alpha interferon synthesis, likely through a direct interaction with the lymphocyte membrane.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.214264372,-0.048461729,-0.034685764,0.004990955,0.07407449,-0.059179694,-0.091817426,0.006753554,0.004337901,-0.037289476,-0.075481305,0.010909096,0.01012635,-0.078477141,-0.012453905,-0.121472643,0.077491209,-0.012150847,0.001846911,0.057965056,-0.031620067,0.006767686,-0.031640565,-0.024639552,0.037471924,0.014644081,0.018034353,-0.032913944,0.002688051,0.019630672
Detection of feline immunodeficiency proviral DNA in peripheral blood lymphocytes by the polymerase chain reaction,"Abstract Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) proviral DNA was detected by the polymerase chain reaction method (PCR). PCR products were detected by gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The P-10, P-15 and P-24 regions of the gag gene of FIV were chosen as the target sequences for amplification, and three primer pairs were prepared. The PCR products subjected to amplification with each primer pair were found to possess sites of digestion by a restriction enzyme, as hypothesized. They did not react with feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-infected or feline syncytium-forming virus (FeSFV)-infected cell-derived DNA, and specifically amplified FIV-infected cell-derived DNA. FIV proviral DNA was detected by the PCR method with either primer pair (one-step amplification: single PCR) in DNA derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 7 of 12 FIV antibody-positive cats. When PCR products in each of the 12 cats were subjected to a second amplification using the same primer pair (two-step amplification: double PCR), FIV proviral DNA was detected in all of the cats. When PBL samples collected from three cats that were negative and three that were positive in the single PCR were cultured for a few weeks in the presence of interleukin 2, FIV proviral DNA was detected in all six cats by the single PCR method. The results suggest that either the use of cultured PBL as the sample or the performance of the double PCR method enables simple and specific detection of FIV proviral DNA in PBL.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.017769612,0.024182362,0.185319237,-0.067828084,-0.007222627,-0.019757153,0.018093632,-0.017782977,-0.029869492,-0.073055568,0.184599492,-0.096888824,0.137785626,-0.016687597,-0.059273463,0.006031929,0.019137892,-0.02468123,0.005361313,-0.016835248,-0.03697874,0.009692947,0.06771578,0.000710623,-0.036481526,-0.012958433,-0.068528245,0.057105657,-0.037375485,0.060906909
Serological and genotypic characterization of group a rotavirus reassortants from diarrheic calves born to dams vaccinated against rotavirus,"Abstract Two strains of bovine rotavirus (BRV), designated strain Nebraska Scottsbluff-1 (NS-1) and NS-2, were isolated from 2 neighboring cow-calf beef cattle ranches where dams had been vaccinated with a commercial vaccine containing group A BRV strain Neonatal Calf Diarrhea Virus (NCDV)-Lincoln (P1:G6). Nothern blot by hybridizations using whole genomic RNA probes indicated that strains NS-1 and NS-2 had identical group A RNA electrophoretic patterns and were homologous at all gene segments. Strain NS-1 was compared with reference group A BRV strains using serological and genotypic methods. In vitro virus neutralization assays indicated that strain NS-1 was neutralized by a G6-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) and guinea pig hyperimmune serum (GPHS) raised against BRV strain B641 (P5:G6), but not by G10-specific neutralizing mAb or GPHS raised against BRV strain BRV strain B223 (P11:G10). Nucleic acid hybridization experiments using whole-genomic RNA probes revealed that gene segment 4 of strain NS-1 differed from BRV strains NCDV-Lincoln and B223, but hybridized with strain B641. Conversely, gene segment 5 of strain NS-1 hybridized with BRV strain B223, but not with BRV strains NCDV-Lincoln and B641. A G-specific cDNA probe produced by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of strain NS-1 hybridized specifically only with G6 strains NCDV-Lincoln and B641, but not with G10 strain B223. Co-electrophoresis experiments using strains NS-1, B641, and B223 further confirmed these results, suggesting that strain NS-1 was a naturally-occurring reassortant BRV between strains B641 and B223. Taken together these results indicated that a naturally-occurring group A BRV reassortant with a P gene different from the vaccine virus was responsible for the diarrheal syndrome observed on both ranches. Results from this study also indicate the existence of at least 2 different gene segments 5 among group A BRV infecting cattle.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.068505688,-0.013161708,0.061942534,-0.085840128,0.073825773,0.037362398,-0.055682239,-0.023861926,0.013069592,0.00091406,0.006024098,0.049485466,-0.033032897,-0.02309262,0.026669272,-0.023263347,-0.026513875,0.008583817,0.008082585,0.001324859,0.045341891,-0.008728468,0.003413822,0.034420076,0.048503002,-0.02696089,-0.003631485,-0.032060825,-0.047106313,0.071180715
Detection of feline coronaviruses in cell cultures and in fresh and fixed feline tissues using polymerase chain reaction,"Abstract Feline coronavirus infections in cell cultures and in fresh and fixed feline tissues were detected using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Cell cultures were inoculated with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), feline enteric coronavirus (FECV)_or sham inoculum. The tissue samples of liver, kidney and spleen were taken from specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cats that were inoculated intranasally with 103 TCID50 of FIPV 79-1146 (n = 10), FIPV UCD1 (n = 3) or sham inoculum (n = 3), from clinical cats (n = 43), and from formalin-fixed archived feline tissues (n = 49), respectively. Additional tissue samples were taken from the FIPV-inoculated cats (n = 6) and were kept at 4°C, room temperatures (20–24°C) and 37°C respectively for 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours before frozen (−70°C) for PCR to evaluate the effects of the ambient temperatures and post-mortem intervals on the test. The samples were also fixed in 10% neutrally buffered formalin, 95% ethanol, and Bouin's solution respectively to evaluate the effects of the fixatives on the test. Positive PCR results were obtained from the cell cultures that were inoculated with FIPV and FECV and from the FIPV-inoculated cats (13/13). Negative PCR results were obtained from the sham-inoculated cell cultures and cats (3/3). Of the 92 clinical cats, 7 of the 8 FIP-suspected cats (87.5%) and 51 of the 84 non-FIP-suspected cats (60.7%) were shown to be virus-positive in at least one of the tissue samples. There was no significant difference in the PCR results between the fresh and the formalin-fixed tissues of the clinical cats (P > 0.05). Of the FIPV inoculated cats, the virus was detectable equally well in fresh and formalin-, Bouin's solution- or ethanol-fixedtissues. However, the amounts of total RNA extracted from the fixed tissues were significantly less than those from fresh tissues (P < 0.01). In tissues that were kept at 4°C, the virus was detectable up to 96 h; at room temperatures, up to 48 h; and at 37°C, up to 24 h, respectively.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.00477513,-0.003448748,0.092071919,-0.172309195,0.010302248,0.024655585,0.007143079,-0.017585599,-0.044931956,-0.128616445,0.363366271,-0.127687875,0.164872316,0.002396244,-0.064326717,-0.036024071,0.047420222,-0.014024271,0.031239278,0.037803187,-0.034816595,-0.015663122,0.074545301,-0.006463666,-0.038583816,0.039385282,-0.008177911,0.019095621,-0.005607311,-0.029553097
Origin of the human L1 elements: Proposed progenitor genes deduced from a consensus DNA sequence,"Abstract A consensus sequence for the human long interspersed repeated DNA element, L1H8 (LINE or KpnI sequence), is presented. The sequence contains two open reading frames (ORFs) which are homologous to ORFs in corresponding regions of L1 elements in other species. The L1H8 ORFs are separated by a small evolutionarily nonconserved region. The 5′ end of the consensus contains frequent terminators in all three reading frames and has a relatively high GC content with numerous stretches of weak homology with AluI repeats. The 5′ ORF extends for a minimum of 723 bp (241 codons). The 3′ ORF is 3843 bp (1281 codons) and predicts a protein of 149 kD which has regions of weak homology to the polymerase domain of various reverse transcriptases. The 3′ end of the consensus has a 208-bp nonconserved region followed by an adenine-rich end. The organization of the L1H8 consensus sequence resembles the structure of eukaryotic mRNAs except for the noncoding region between ORFs. However, due to base substitutions or truncation most elements appear incapable of producing mRNA that can be translated. Our observation that individual elements cluster into subfamilies on the basis of the presence or absence of blocks of sequence, or by the linkage of alternative bases at multiple positions, suggests that most L1 sequences were derived from a small number of structural genes. An estimate of the mammalian L1 substitution rate was derived and used to predict the age of individual human elements. From this it follows that the majority of human L1 sequences have been generated within the last 30 million years. The human elements studied here differ from each other, yet overall the L1H8 sequences demonstrate a pattern of species-specificity when compared to the L1 families of other mammals. Possible mechanisms that may account for the origin and evolution of the L1 family are discussed. These include pseudogene formation (retroposition), transposition, gene conversion, and RNA recombination.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.152644908,-0.051026129,-0.011360504,-0.026537276,0.145167619,-0.056060194,-0.093749813,0.029998878,-0.003451257,-0.053299948,-0.09986376,-0.019396769,0.068686711,-0.130335145,-0.041750575,-0.062386755,0.013234976,0.026083474,-0.023424305,-0.026005784,0.018773494,-0.014290965,-0.063694432,0.054108595,-0.097147679,-0.055614073,0.018186559,0.00637951,0.052251044,-0.032996285
Expression of nitric oxide synthase type II in the spinal cord under conditions producing thermal hyperalgesia,"Abstract There is evidence supporting spinal cord nitric oxide (NO) production in the mechanisms underlying hyperalgesia, presumed to arise from the activity of neuronal nitric oxide synthase type I (NOS I). Intrathecal administration of interleukin-1β and interferon-γ to rats results in a thermal hyperalgesia which peaks at 2 h post-injection but which is undetectable 8 h post-injection. Expression of mRNA for nitric oxide synthase type II (NOS II) was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction followed by Southern hybridization utilizing specific oligonucleotides in spinal cord tissue from animals 4 h and 8 h after cytokine injection, but not at longer time points. NOS II protein was detected in soluble fractions of spinal cords from animals 4 h and 8 h after cytokine injection. In situ hybridization for NOS II mRNA revealed positive cells bilaterally in the spinal cord 4 h after cytokine injection in a perivascular distribution and scattered throughout the gray and white matter. Immunohistochemistry for NOS II showed a similar distribution which could only be partially accounted for by macrophages/microglia. These results provide evidence for induction of NOS II expression under conditions producing thermal hyperalgesia and suggest a possible role in this behavior for the production of NO by a variety of cell types in the CNS.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.067139663,-0.029139978,0.019124174,-0.117773765,-0.054783755,0.035306741,0.012851316,-0.03635955,0.038267145,-0.049511609,-0.024574956,-0.023818466,-0.013418978,0.070808906,0.003181322,0.01037243,-0.01227806,-0.058723456,-0.049248694,-0.034917066,0.032299908,-0.005223193,0.010702395,-0.001514363,0.001339551,-0.045209981,-0.029753119,0.045365556,0.033081652,-0.031756666
Advances in the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections,"Abstract Background: Advances have been made in selecting sensitive cell lines for isolation, in early detection of respiratory virus growth in cells by rapid culture assays, in production of monoclonal antibodies to improve many tests such as immunofluorescence detection of virus antigens in nasopharyngeal aspirates, in highly sensitive antigen detections by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassays (TR-FIAs) and biotin-enzyme immunoassays (BIOTH-E), and, finally, in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of respiratory virus DNA or RNA in clinical specimens. All of these advances have contributed to new or improved possibilities for the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections. Objectives and study design: This review summarizes our experiences during the last 15 years in the development of diagnostic tests for respiratory virus infections, and in use of these tests in daily diagnostic work and in epidemiological studies. Results: Immunofluorescence tests based on monoclonal antibodies, all-monoclonal TR-FIAs, and biotin-enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) have about the same sensitivities and specificities. They compare well with the sensitivity of virus culture. PCR followed by liquid-phase hybridization is a sensitive method for detecting adenovirus DNA and enterovirus and rhinovirus RNA in clinical specimens. IgG EIA on paired acute and convalescent phase sera is the most sensitive serological test for respiratory virus infections and is a valuable reference method when evaluating the sensitivity of new diagnostic tests. The IgG avidity test can distinguish primary infections from re-infections at least in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. IgM antibody assays, on the other hand, had low sensitivities in our studies. Conclusions: The choice of diagnostic methods for respiratory virus infections depends on the type and location of the laboratory, the number of specimens tested, and the previous experience of the laboratory. Virus culture, whenever possible, should be the basic diagnostic method; the results, including identification of the virus, should be available no more than 24 h later than the results of rapid diagnostic tests. In small laboratories, especially in hospitals where specimen transportation is well organized, immunofluorescence may be the best choice for antigen detection with the provision that an experienced microscopist and a good UV microscope are available. If the laboratory receives a large number of specimens and has previous experience with EIAs, then biotin-EIAs or TR-FIAs may be the most practical techniques. Their advantages include the stability of the antigens in clinical samples since intact, exfoliated epithelial cells are not required, treatment of specimens is practical, testing of large numbers of specimens is possible, and reading the printed test result is less subjective than reading fluorescence microscopy. The larger role of PCR in the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections depends on future developments such as practical methods to extract DNA or RNA and to purify the extracts from nonspecific inhibitors, plus further improvements to minimize cross-contamination. Group-specific detection of enteroviruses and rhinoviruses is an example of the potential for PCR technology. In experienced laboratories. EIA IgG antibody tests should be available. Recombinant antigens may be a useful part of such assays.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.128936826,0.01838817,0.12354907,0.128475735,-0.076741853,-0.059654778,0.045973012,-0.027048557,0.047125306,0.112268866,-0.027967544,-0.084300071,0.129970197,-0.043457535,0.069841278,-0.044877303,-0.000222529,0.005551014,-0.003898364,-0.059373065,-0.004073088,-0.098520139,0.079328565,-0.111644067,0.031848343,0.010406619,-0.012182232,-0.031604518,-0.08016257,-0.011875147
Viruses that multiply in the gut and cause endemic and epidemic gastroenteritis,"Abstract Background: Acute infectious diarrhea in young children is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Even in developed countries, infectious enteritis is second only to respiratory infections as a cause of morbidity in early childhood. Objective: To nominate the various viral agents that cause enteritis, discuss the pathogenesis, clinical features, epidemiology and diagnostic procedures employed. Study design: Pertinent literature was reviewed and the findings of investigations carried out on viral enteritis by various colleagues recalled. Results: The viruses causing gastroenteritis include: Rotaviruses; Adenoviruses-especially Ad 31, Ad 40 and Ad 41; members of the Caliciviridae, e.g. Norwalk virus, Hawaii virus, Snow Mountain virus, Taunton virus, Southampton virus, Toronto virus (formerly mini-reovirus) and others; Astrovirus; Coronavirus; Torovirus; Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and possibly Picobirnavirus. Enteritis-producing viruses replicate in columar epithelial cells in the distal parts of villi of the small intestine. Two mechanisms are addressed to explain why diarrhea occurs. Clinically, the main expression of illness is a watery diarrhea that lasts 24 h to about 7 days. Vomiting is of shorter duration and may not always accompany the diarrhea. Fever is generally ⩽ 38.5°C. Virus is shed in the stool for about 3–7 days. Diagnostic procedures employ electron microscopy (EM), immune electron microscopy (IEM), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA), latex agglutination, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Conclusion: In developed countries viral enteritis among young children may be up to three times more common than bacterial gut disease.

CHAPTER 28 Coronaviridae,"Publisher Summary Coronaviruses are ssRNA viruses that infect a wide range of mammalian and avian species; they are important causes of respiratory and enteric disease, encephalomyelitis, hepatitis, serositis, and vasculitis in domestic animals. In humans, coronaviruses are one of several groups of viruses that cause the common cold. The prototype of the family, avian infectious brochitis virus, is one of the most infectious of all viruses and causes an acute respiratory disease, which in young chicks can cause very high mortality. Outbreaks can be explosive, involving nearly every bird in the flock at about the same time, because of respiratory transmission and a very short incubation period. In many ways, transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine and mouse hepatitis virus behave similarly, affecting young animals most severely, spreading very quickly to all animals at risk, and causing major economic losses before control strategies can be put into place. The strategy of expression of the coronavirus genome is unique. The input virion RNA molecule is translated directly, one of the products being an RNA polymerase that then transcribes a full-length (—) sense copy RNA, from which in turn is transcribed a 3′-coterminal nested set of subgenomic mRNAs. The nested set comprises six overlapping species of mRNAs that extend for different lengths from a common 3′ terminus. Only the unique sequence toward the 5′ end, which is not shared with the next smallest mRNA in the nested set, is translated, each product, therefore, being a unique protein.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.074485045,-0.034665274,-0.02034601,0.053634251,0.115280697,-0.009016059,0.004482651,0.007860217,-0.001677542,0.046220089,-0.011394997,-0.062416131,0.056671241,-0.009965462,0.046684806,-0.011274664,-0.00858716,-0.004319416,0.019097204,0.047493648,0.003811978,-0.02047047,-0.076780679,0.023538575,-0.003768823,-0.044393448,-0.026076727,-0.016123846,0.011153264,-0.053576556
Diagnostic Techniques: Serological and Molecular Approaches,"Virus laboratory diagnostics has an increasingly important role in modern patient care. Virological methods are needed to investigate the etiology of acute viral infection or the reactivation of a latent infection, as well as to follow virus load in antiviral treatments. Serological assays are also used for screening of blood products for the risk of certain chronic infections, evaluation of the immune status, and need for prophylatic treatments in connection with organ transplantations. For diagnostic purposes the following approaches can be used: demonstration of presence of infectious virus or its structural components directly from a patient's specimens or investigation of specific antibody response in serum specimes. Virus isolation is used to demonstrate infectious virus in a patient's specimens, whereas nucleic acid amplification techniques, like polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are widely used to detect virus nucleic acids. Virus antigens are investigated by antigen detection assays. Serological diagnosis is based on either the demonstration of the presence of virus-specific IgM antibodies or a significant increase in the levels of specific IgG antibodies. Immunoassays are the most commonly used serological assays. Point-of-care tests (POC tests), both for antigens and antibodies, are also becoming more and more common in diagnostic use. In order to reach the best diagnostic efficiency for each patient it is important to select the most suitable method using the right sample collected at the right time.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.049896457,0.035224956,0.125266377,0.022580925,-0.090353339,0.030930561,0.033156021,0.002240704,0.029424673,0.113445147,-0.033596408,-0.077451637,0.141252619,-0.090774606,0.037679393,-0.00824543,-0.029901834,0.006131508,-0.04879031,-0.047006379,-0.042249401,-0.079282065,0.049438517,-0.11604423,0.015804933,0.01366494,0.014898127,-0.062228277,-0.12652437,0.066557385
Leader Sequence,"Abstract The region of a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule that precedes the coding sequence of a gene is called the ‘leader sequence’. This region is also known as the ‘five prime untranslated region’ (Figure 1) of the mRNA. Leader sequences have the propensity for forming secondary structures (stem-loops) by base pairing of complementary sequences. They are involved in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In eukaryotes, the leader sequence may vary from few nucleotides to more than 1000 nucleotides. In prokaryotes, the leader sequences are usually short and at times contain an attenuator segment that is translated to a short-leader peptide. The leader peptide functions to terminate transcripts before the RNA polymerase reaches the first structural gene of the operon. The leader sequences in viruses have been shown to play an important role in the regulation of gene expression, replication, and pathogenicity. Mutations in the leader sequences of cellular mRNAs can have implications for disease and tumorigenesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.181669662,-0.060715497,-0.011998364,-0.038386983,0.083247381,-0.064192516,-0.143731048,0.026437757,0.007495885,-0.073413357,-0.076534942,-0.070525676,0.052228277,-0.048627518,0.021463487,0.040220038,-0.068356503,0.023762198,-0.040919973,-0.042562559,0.052513611,-0.009140525,-0.013202887,0.059506101,-0.019577632,-0.081321804,-0.001901965,0.009440663,0.14358459,-0.0093828
13 General Mechanisms of Antiviral Resistance,"This review explores the broad mechanisms of virus resistance. This will go beyond the generally accepted concept of antiviral resistance by summarizing those evolutionary outcomes that have enabled human viruses to resist mankind’s best efforts at control. The review then focuses on how viruses acquire resistance to compounds that specifically target a virus protein (e.g., polymerase, protease, integrase, sialidase). All viruses have a principle mechanism of acquiring resistance, random point mutations. Those viruses, which have segmented genomes, have an additional mechanism, genetic reassortment. For antiviral compounds that target a key virus enzyme, there is usually a stepwise evolution of resistance. For the therapy of chronic viral infections, such as HIV, the concept of increasing the genetic barrier has been important for optimizing drug combinations for effectively delaying the appearance of resistance. In some cases, the price to the virus for gaining resistance may be reduced “fitness” but there may also be other unexpected effects. Conceptually, one way to avoid virus resistance is to use a compound to target a host protein rather than a viral protein. Such an approach seems to risk causing unacceptable toxicity, however, some instances have been identified where there can be specificity for the virus-infected cell. We end by asking the question, how will viruses respond to such an indirect challenge?",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.067221407,-0.063574813,-0.025022641,0.057581292,-0.083293588,0.113754984,0.100162278,-0.011335983,0.027304926,0.08469487,-0.020962522,-0.015721892,0.058885131,-0.03111838,0.026606779,-0.042738735,-0.024655171,0.048257484,0.014347317,0.059566416,0.004936038,0.02459092,-0.025211705,0.118730683,-0.014858248,0.043262473,0.094798382,-0.094057477,0.000163174,-0.013881649
Chapter fifteen Enzymatic Assembly of Overlapping DNA Fragments,"Abstract Three methods for assembling multiple, overlapping DNA molecules are described. Each method shares the same basic approach: (i) an exonuclease removes nucleotides from the ends of double-stranded (ds) DNA molecules, exposing complementary single-stranded (ss) DNA overhangs that are specifically annealed; (ii) the ssDNA gaps of the joined molecules are filled in by DNA polymerase, and the nicks are covalently sealed by DNA ligase. The first method employs the 3′-exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase (T4 pol), Taq DNA polymerase (Taq pol), and Taq DNA ligase (Taq lig) in a two-step thermocycled reaction. The second method uses 3′-exonuclease III (ExoIII), antibody-bound Taq pol, and Taq lig in a one-step thermocycled reaction. The third method employs 5′-T5 exonuclease, Phusion® DNA polymerase, and Taq lig in a one-step isothermal reaction and can be used to assemble both ssDNA and dsDNA. These assembly methods can be used to seamlessly construct synthetic and natural genes, genetic pathways, and entire genomes and could be very useful for molecular engineering tools.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.075320342,-0.006247841,0.081959914,-0.029556728,-0.063445571,0.002045883,0.043054439,-0.005507052,0.009109359,-0.011864782,-0.036723376,-0.000408206,0.024859918,-0.045114212,-0.021877478,0.055729193,-0.036440158,-0.034431875,-0.048528176,-0.031469051,-0.025360177,-0.004693456,-0.006914411,0.008415751,-0.0259598,-0.07179308,-0.091420354,0.058686529,-0.025447412,0.002681864
Principles of Diagnosis of Infectious Diseases,"Abstract Infectious diseases are diagnosed by detection of a bacterium, virus, fungus, protozoan, or helminth in a patient with a compatible clinical illness. The methods of detection include cultivation of bacteria and fungi on growth medium, isolation of viruses in cell culture, and identification of the agent biochemically, antigenically, or genetically. Infectious diseases can also be identified by detection of a specific immune response, usually antibodies, that develop during the course of illness. Visualization of an agent in infected tissue can provide a diagnosis based on specific morphological characteristics or identify the category of organism, for example, gram-positive or gram-negative bacterium or virus (e.g., eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in neurons in rabies virus infection). Methods that detect and allow visualization of antigens (immunohistochemistry) or nucleic acid sequences (in situ hybridization) provide more specific diagnoses. Detection of specific nucleic acid sequences amplified by polymerase chain reaction is a powerful molecular diagnostic tool. Since the elucidation of the etiology of the first infectious disease, anthrax, more than 135 years ago, Koch's postulates have been applied and modified as novel technologies and agents have emerged. During the last 45 years, more than 70 previously unknown agents of infections have been identified in emerging infectious diseases, a phenomenon that is likely to continue.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.037088893,0.003366553,0.108012252,-0.013917399,-0.030380619,0.028856148,0.03886802,-0.007218967,0.006841435,0.127079376,-0.023739933,-0.056873148,0.103955021,-0.087053296,0.042528473,-0.015798354,-0.044736385,0.021908099,-0.061837561,-0.005381081,-0.022683122,-0.030425009,0.026410249,-0.07159179,0.020013149,-0.008727449,-0.028613007,0.008465849,-0.083664977,0.036881501
Chapter 2 Recent Advances in Hantavirus Molecular Biology and Disease,"Abstract Hantaviruses are emerging zoonotic pathogens that belong to the Bunyaviridae family. They have been classified as category A pathogens by CDC (centers for disease control and prevention). Hantaviruses pose a serious threat to human health because their infection causes two highly fatal diseases, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). These pathogens are transmitted to humans through aerosolized excreta of their infected rodent hosts. Hantaviruses have a tripartite-segmented negative-sense RNA genome. The three genomic RNA segments, S, M, and L, encode a nucleocapsid protein (N), a precursor glycoprotein that is processed into two envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively. N protein is the major structural component of the virus, its main function is to protect and encapsidate the three genomic RNAs forming three viral ribonucleocapsids. Recent studies have proposed that N in conjunction with RdRp plays important roles in the transcription and replication of viral genome. In addition, N preferentially facilitates the translation of viral mRNA in cells. Glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, play major roles in viral attachment and entry to the host cells, virulence, and assembly and packaging of new virions in infected cells. RdRp functions as RNA replicase and transcriptase to replicate and transcribe the viral RNA and is also thought to have endonuclease activity. Currently, no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available for the treatment of hantavirus-associated diseases. Understanding the molecular details of hantavirus life cycle will help in the identification of targets for antiviral therapeutics and in the design of potential antiviral drug for the treatment of HFRS and HCPS. Due to the alarming fatality of hantavirus diseases, development of an effective vaccine against hantaviruses is a necessity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.192202943,-0.038496597,-0.09803005,0.114789124,-0.091698674,0.004781039,0.08343558,0.026932674,0.007761743,0.108573566,0.047309738,-0.007430966,0.022470073,0.030260624,0.007023296,-0.049258914,-0.018422114,0.033309956,-0.013933684,0.062649365,-0.016061608,0.059084618,-0.039255946,-0.023507629,0.033489868,0.000282771,0.071330028,-0.037616038,0.050832846,0.078234441
Chapter 12 Synthesis,"Abstract The preceding chapters have described in detail specific examples of viruses that have emerged or re-emerged from animal sources. Most, although not all, are zoonotic and have caused significant human morbidity and mortality. This final chapter will attempt to bring together a number of the common themes raised by these examples. These include the role of historical events in shaping the emergence of viruses in the present, the ability to retrospectively test samples to trace the emergence of disease and the technologies used to detect viruses. Technologies such as the polymerase chain reaction and mass sequencing have revolutionized virus detection and enabled the rapid identification and characterization of viruses. The application of these methods has led to the identification of new groups of viruses in samples obtained from a range of animal species without the need for invasive sampling or the recovery of live virus. However, with the detection of such a large range of viruses that exist asymptomatically with other species, the challenge now becomes the identification of those with the potential to become pathogenic for humans.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.021973619,-0.009749675,0.069976442,0.060769853,0.055360848,0.063268551,0.125228466,0.029446522,-0.03627862,0.105827299,-0.037509926,-0.038431692,0.074294995,-0.043276655,0.055020434,-0.0190675,-0.034150749,-0.021572864,-0.033081819,0.005696104,0.021069829,-0.005333197,-0.017919467,0.046053054,-0.04094309,-0.013212521,-0.009765386,-0.038827018,-0.04569176,-0.056375447
"Chapter Four Next-Generation Molecular-Diagnostic Tools for Gastrointestinal Nematodes of Livestock, with an Emphasis on Small Ruminants A Turning Point?","Abstract Parasitic nematodes of livestock have major economic impact worldwide. Despite the diseases caused by these nematodes, some advances towards the development of new therapeutic agents and attempts to develop effective vaccines against some of them, there has been limited progress in the development of practical diagnostic methods. The specific and sensitive diagnosis of parasitic nematode infections of livestock underpins effective disease control, which is now particularly important given the problems associated with anthelmintic resistance in parasite populations. Traditional diagnostic methods have major limitations, in terms of sensitivity and specificity. This chapter provides an account of the significance of parasitic nematodes (order Strongylida), reviews conventional diagnostic techniques that are presently used routinely and describes advances in polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods for the specific diagnosis of nematode infections.

Chapter 34 Antiviral Drugs,"Abstract Viruses are major pathogenic agents causing a variety of serious diseases in humans, other animals, and plants. Drugs that combat viral infections are called antiviral drugs. There are no effective antiviral drugs for many viral infections. However, there are several drugs for influenza, a couple of drugs for herpesviruses, and some new antiviral drugs for treatment of HIV and hepatitis C infections. The arsenal of antivirals is complex. As of March 2014, it consists of approximately 50 drugs approved by the FDA, approximately half of which are directed against HIV. Antiviral drug creation strategies are focused on two different approaches: targeting the viruses themselves or targeting host cell factors. Direct virus-targeting antiviral drugs include attachment inhibitors, entry inhibitors, uncoating inhibitors, protease inhibitors, polymerase inhibitors, nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, and integrase inhibitors. Protease inhibitors (darunavir, atazanavir, and ritonavir), viral DNA polymerase inhibitors (acyclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, and tenofovir), and an integrase inhibitor (raltegravir) are included in the list of Top 200 Drugs by sales for the 2010s.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.05141869,-0.040697583,-0.039529708,0.046442607,-0.136618148,0.176463734,0.116578445,-0.018350547,0.064678873,0.064686607,0.014133155,0.044958927,0.064678238,-0.031441788,0.018224224,-0.034362233,-0.034509577,0.217905097,0.113513644,0.044977821,-0.020940842,0.048394877,-0.089018999,0.134950342,0.069025726,0.001394969,0.062218997,-0.093106179,0.168540125,0.029835515
Chapter 42 Group IV Viruses Single-Stranded (+)Sense RNA,"The Group IV viruses have a positive sense genome. Positive sense RNA can be translated directly into protein, without a DNA intermediate and without creating a complementary RNA strand. To replicate its genome, though, a complementary DNA strand is required. The positive RNA strand serves as a template for an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, yielding a complementary RNA strand, to form a dimer with the template strand. The double-stranded RNA subsequently serves as the template for a new positive sense genome. The positive strand RNA genome is independently infectious, for most Group IV viruses. This means that in the absence of a capsid, envelope, or enclosed proteins, the RNA molecule, when inserted into a cell, is capable of using host cell machinery to construct additional viruses. There are six subclasses of the Group IV single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses: Picornaviridae, Togaviridae, Coronaviridae, Hepeviridae, Caliciviridae, Flaviviridae, and Astroviridae. As expected, within each class, viruses share structural similarities; but there are no properties, other than the defining property of a (+)-sense single stranded RNA genome, that extends to all six classes of the Group IV viruses. For example, some classes have envelopes (i.e., Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Coronaviridae), and others do not (i.e., Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Hepeviridae, and Astroviridae).

Chapter 7 Long-Term Virus Evolution in Nature,"Abstract Viruses spread to give rise to epidemics and pandemics, and some key parameters that include virus and host population numbers determine virus persistence or extinction in nature. Viruses evolve at different rates of evolution depending on the polymerase copying fidelity during genome replication. Calculated rates of evolution in nature vary depending on the time interval between virus isolations. In particular, intra-host evolution is generally more rapid that inter-host evolution and several possible mechanisms for this difference are considered.

Chapter 3 Features of Host Cells Cellular and Molecular Biology Review,"Abstract As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses are completely dependent upon a host cell for their replication. They use energy generated by the host cell, and they exploit the host's machinery to manufacture viral proteins. Many of the cell's organelles, as well as the plasma membrane, are involved in viral replication processes. The organelles involved in protein synthesis, processing, and transport—namely the ribosome, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi complex—are utilized in the manufacture of viral proteins, as well, and viruses use ATP generated by the host cell's mitochondria. The plasma membrane, made of a phospholipid bilayer, is the cell's primary zone of contact with the extracellular world. As such, it is the first obstacle that a virus must overcome for entry into a cell. The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology states that DNA is replicated to create more DNA, DNA is transcribed into mRNA, and mRNA is translated by ribosomes to create proteins. All viruses are dependent upon the host's translation machinery, and many viruses will use other portions of the cell's replication and transcription mechanisms. DNA polymerase is the major enzyme involved in DNA replication, while RNA polymerase creates messenger RNA. Host ribosomes translate the messenger RNA into proteins, composed of amino acids. Viruses also have many unique strategies to ensure the translation of their proteins over host proteins.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.199852223,-0.085242845,-0.05716723,0.069709662,-0.108134369,0.028250042,0.078971309,-0.015548581,0.02819377,0.040726521,-0.058200905,-0.098286304,0.049269331,0.101184391,-0.014953321,-0.010402606,0.025523791,-0.104518658,-0.003587729,0.092797744,-0.062933016,0.093099615,-0.072639288,-0.026314702,-0.008729928,-0.048154909,-0.02557298,-0.009339088,-0.096993862,-0.003489393
Diagnostic Techniques: Serological and Molecular Approaches☆,"Abstract Virus laboratory diagnostics has an increasingly important role in modern patient care. Virological methods are needed to investigate the etiology of acute viral infection or the reactivation of a latent infection, as well as to follow virus load in antiviral treatments. Serological assays are also used for screening of blood products for the risk of certain chronic infections, evaluation of the immune status, and need for prophylactic treatments in connection with organ transplantations. For diagnostic purposes the following approaches can be used: demonstration of presence of infectious virus or its structural components directly from a patient's specimens or investigation of specific antibody response in serum specimens. Amplification techniques, most commonly polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is currently the workhorse of nucleic acid testing for the detection and quantitation of virus genomes. Virus isolation is used to demonstrate infectious virus in a patient's specimens, whereas virus antigens are investigated by antigen detection assays. Serological diagnosis is based on either the demonstration of the presence of virus-specific IgM antibodies or a significant increase in the levels and/or avidity of specific IgG antibodies. Immunoassays are the most commonly used serological assays. Point-of-care tests (POC tests), for antigens, antibodies, and also nucleic acids are also becoming more and more common in diagnostic use. In order to reach the best diagnostic efficiency for each patient it is important to select the most suitable method using the right sample collected at the right time.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.056227176,0.038931678,0.13233304,0.028928483,-0.091731732,0.024002195,0.035917961,0.007932524,0.024673202,0.116737332,-0.03306959,-0.074148695,0.143744357,-0.09098611,0.03957723,-0.010030603,-0.032414956,0.005783387,-0.048128985,-0.051409186,-0.042056814,-0.078697369,0.049228236,-0.116591324,0.016575868,0.011380042,0.018251808,-0.063519684,-0.124350429,0.06732042
Severe Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) Pneumonia,"Abstract Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection, which ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia and multiorgan failure, caused by a novel coronavirus named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Majority of cases have been reported from Saudi Arabia. MERS cases occur as sporadic cases or as clusters or hospital outbreaks. Dromedary camels are thought to be a host for MERS-CoV. Direct contact with dromedary camels within 14days prior to infection was identified as an independent risk factor for MERS. Diagnosis of MERS is based on a positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), obtained from a respiratory specimen. The mainstay of management of MERS-CoV infection is supportive care. There is no specific antiviral therapy for MERS-CoV infection at present, although several modalities of treatment options have been examined or are under investigation.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.116448263,0.319417351,-0.166520167,-0.0117203,-0.02382696,0.019284772,-0.023307527,0.483904872,0.41198545,0.020264769,0.058965052,-0.051468139,-0.01997553,-0.017123021,0.009888547,-0.036510051,0.004062085,-0.055130472,-0.007491064,0.005358037,-0.008523746,0.055452223,0.021966524,0.049141993,0.024352685,-0.030337196,-0.027132556,-0.007538454,-0.010272277,0.023304823

Chapter 17 Family Coronaviridae,"Abstract Members of the family Coronaviridae are large, enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses. They are the largest known RNA viruses, with genomes ranging from 25 to 32kb and virions of 118–140nm in diameter. The family is divided into two subfamilies, the Coronavirinae and the Torovirinae. They can be distinguished on the basis of their nucleocapsids as the toroviruses have unique doughnut-shaped nucleocapsids. Virions are roughly spherical and are notable for the large spike (S) glycoprotein that extends from the virus envelope. Current taxonomy places the family in the order Nidovirales. Within the subfamily Coronavirinae are four genera, the alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and deltacoronaviruses. All family members share the same unique strategy for mRNA synthesis whereby the polymerase complex jumps or moves from one region of the template to a more distant region. The need for the polymerase complex to dissociate from the template may explain the high rate of RNA recombination that occurs during genome replication. Both the coronaviruses and toroviruses are enteric and respiratory tract pathogens, usually associated with only mild disease (or inapparent infection).

Chapter 2 Genetic Instability of RNA Viruses,"Abstract Despite having very limited coding capacity, RNA viruses are able to withstand challenge of antiviral drugs, cause epidemics in previously exposed human populations, and, in some cases, infect multiple host species. They are able to achieve this by virtue of their ability to multiply very rapidly, coupled with their extraordinary degree of genetic heterogeneity. RNA viruses exist not as single genotypes, but as a swarm of related variants, and this genomic diversity is an essential feature of their biology. RNA viruses have a variety of mechanisms that act in combination to determine their genetic heterogeneity. These include polymerase fidelity, error-mitigation mechanisms, genomic recombination, and different modes of genome replication. RNA viruses can vary in their ability to tolerate mutations, or “genetic robustness,” and several factors contribute to this. Finally, there is evidence that some RNA viruses exist close to a threshold where polymerase error rate has evolved to maximize the possible sequence space available, while avoiding the accumulation of a lethal load of deleterious mutations. We speculate that different viruses have evolved different error rates to complement the different “life-styles” they possess.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.137786505,-0.058862115,-0.054354884,0.108277428,0.05413852,0.006207607,0.099114816,0.046687865,-0.060308705,0.084157104,0.064780832,0.008888608,0.011095713,-0.008745805,0.042044141,0.020171631,-0.082842987,-0.010849595,-0.042364746,0.014816671,0.048384374,-0.002527174,-0.046214283,0.110340768,-0.125203881,-0.030946799,0.070302617,-0.035959632,-0.055907121,-0.067027391

Chapter 3 Infectious Bronchitis Virus in Poultry: Molecular Epidemiology and Factors Leading to the Emergence and Reemergence of Novel Strains of Infectious Bronchitis Virus,"Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a coronavirus that causes an acute and highly contagious disease in chickens. The virus can cause substantial economic losses throughout the poultry industry worldwide. It can affect the upper respiratory tract and the reproductive tract, and some strains can cause nephritis. The causative agent IBV is an RNA virus with great ability for mutation and recombination, thus capable of generating new virus strains that are difficult to control. There are many IBV strains found worldwide, including the Massachusetts, 4/91, D274, and QX-like strains that can be grouped under the classic or variant serotypes. In addition, new types of the virus continue to arise due to mutations and recombination events in the viral genome and even more factors, making this virus difficult to identify and extremely difficult to control. Surveillance and identification of IBV types are extremely important for control of the disease and the advancement of molecular methods has aided in this pursuit. Genetic typing of IBV, which involves reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequence analysis of the S1 glycoprotein gene, has revolutionized diagnosis and identification of this virus by making it possible to type and compare the relatedness of a large number of virus isolates in a short period of time. Several conventional and molecular diagnostic methods have been described for the diagnosis of IB in chickens. “All-in/all-out” operations of rearing along with good biosafety measures form the basis of prevention, whereas vaccination forms the backbone of IB control program. Both live and inactivated (oil emulsified) conventional vaccines are available. The new generation vaccines (recombinant and vector-based) developed against locally prevailing IBV strains may be more helpful and avoid the reversion of virulence in live vaccine viruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.03713731,-0.022973714,0.105798467,-0.036653786,0.1724752,0.106255886,-0.131707462,-0.097508881,0.11704911,0.384708451,0.073704117,0.01861486,-0.021206626,-0.021107981,-0.079408957,0.117822609,-0.044468984,0.01445412,-0.017474019,0.08992621,-0.003100918,-0.053225183,0.014457142,-0.008370527,-0.001938769,-0.00049712,0.02468298,-0.00124571,-0.016398027,0.003486735
"Chapter 10 Polymerases of Coronaviruses Structure, Function, and Inhibitors","Abstract Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a major group of viruses known to be responsible for wide spectrum of diseases in multiple species. The CoVs affecting human population are referred to as human coronaviruses (HCoVs). They lead to multiple respiratory diseases, such as common cold, pneumonia, bronchitis, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome. CoVs are RNA viruses that require RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) for various steps in their life cycle. Action of RdRP is needed in several steps in the life cycle of CoVs and thus RdRPs constitute potential targets for drugs and other therapeutic interventions for the treatment of diseases caused by CoVs.

Chapter 7 Long-term virus evolution in nature,"Abstract Viruses spread to give rise to epidemics and pandemics, and some key parameters that include virus and host population numbers determine virus persistence or extinction in nature. Viruses evolve at different rates depending on the polymerase copying fidelity during genome replication and a number of environmental influences. Calculated rates of evolution in nature vary depending on the time interval between virus isolations. In particular, intrahost evolution is generally more rapid that interhost evolution, and several possible mechanisms for this difference are considered. The mechanisms by which the error-prone viruses evolve are very unlikely to render the operation of a molecular clock (constant rate of incorporation of mutations in the evolving genomes), although a clock is assumed in many calculations. Several computational tools permit the alignment of viral sequences and the establishment of phylogenetic relationships among viruses.

The desirable characteristics of such diagnostic methods are easy to use, cost-effective, highly sensitive, and specific, coupled with the high-throughput detection capabilities. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are still the most common assays used for the detection of animal pathogens across the globe. However, utilizing the principles of ELISA and PCR, several serological and molecular technologies have been developed to achieve higher sensitivity, rapid, and point-of-care (POC) detection such as lateral flow assays, biosensors, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, recombinase polymerase amplification, and molecular platforms for field-level detection of animal pathogens. Furthermore, animal disease diagnostics need to be updated regularly to capture new, emerging and divergent infectious pathogens, and biotechnological innovations are helpful in fulfilling the rising demand for such diagnostics for the welfare of the society.

Chapter 19 Advances in structure-assisted antiviral discovery for animal viral diseases,"Abstract The latest advancements in drug development are structure-assisted and computer-aided identification, design, and synthesis of target-specific antiviral. Structural virology of animal viruses has made valuable contribution to our understanding of viruses in general, replication, evolution, and interaction with the host. Structure–function relation studies are definitely the need of the hour for rational design of drugs and vaccines to effectively treat animal viral diseases. These studies are important for economical, veterinary, and human medical perspectives. X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and cryo-electron microscopy techniques elaborate the structure–function relation studies by utilizing various computational approaches for structure-assisted designing of drug molecules and antiviral against viruses. Availability of protein three-dimensional structures, high-performance computing, data management software, and internet are enhancing the modern day drug discovery process. Computational tools offer the advantage of delivering new drug candidates more quickly and at a lower cost. Various viral proteins that are necessary for the survival of the virus inside the host are discussed in this chapter such as viral polymerase, helicase, protease, etc. Various antiviral drug molecules identified and designed on the basis of the structure of viral proteins which are highlighted, and disclosed details of the available inhibitors and potential antiviral are discussed. Further improvement in identified inhibitors, the need of novel structure-based drugs and their clinical testing is emphasized. This chapter describes briefly the structural techniques and advances made in animal virology toward structure-based identification and development of antiviral for treatment of animal viruses.

Chapter 19 Disease resistance for different livestock species,"Abstract This chapter deals with progress in disease resistance for the livestock population species-wise and describes the progress that occurred globally. Certain genes were identified for mastitis resistance and the strategies for genomic control of mastitis are discussed. Gene-edited tuberculosis-resistant cattle were developed for the first time with CRISPR/Cas 9 technology with NRAMP gene insert. Similarly studies are in progress for the development of trypanosomiasis-resistant cattle at ILRI. Genomic insights were discussed for disease resistance for goat against gastrointestinal nematode infestation, coccidiosis, peste des petits ruminants, and scrapie. Similarly genomic resistance was also discussed for sheep, discussing the mechanism of disease resistance with MHC, antibody and T cell response, cytokines, and receptors. Genes identified for bacterial diarrhoeal resistance as K88, F18 (an intestinal receptor) for resistance to bacterial infection in pig. Gene-edited pigs were developed against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and transmissible gastroenteritis caused by corona virus using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Insights on the omics technologies developed and studied were discussed for livestock species. Genomic control on various diseases of poultry is discussed as salmonellosis, avian influenza, Marek’s disease, Newcastle disease with advanced genomic and allied techniques for its control as RNA interference, flow cytometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, transcriptomics, etc. A new concept on natural antibodies was discussed.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.041739454,-0.010557212,0.04251863,-0.034705183,-0.021256512,0.094624105,0.030997008,-0.008825217,0.018247505,0.032767488,-0.049762034,-0.017341906,0.037242257,-0.05513507,0.0505928,-0.009381682,-0.047282892,0.036092224,-0.023431692,0.019614123,0.004052101,-0.02116624,0.013882828,0.020808671,-0.031661304,-0.023532879,0.011980741,-0.057191428,0.046187941,0.006563131
28 New and Emerging Infections of the Lung,"Abstract In this era of rapid globalization and frequent travel, emerging viral infections have gained an immense potential to spread at an unprecedented speed and scale compared with the past. This poses a significant challenge to coordinated international efforts in global surveillance and infection control. Significantly, respiratory viral infections, spread mostly via droplet transmission, are extremely contagious and have caused significant morbidity and mortality during outbreaks in the last decade. Molecular diagnostics via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been key in the rapid diagnosis of most of these viral infections. However, a high index of suspicion and early institution of appropriate isolation measures remain as the mainstay in the control and containment of the spread of these viral infections. Although treatment for most of the viral infections remains supportive, efficacious antiviral agents against influenza infections exist. The infections discussed in this chapter include those first described in the 2000s: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and metapneumovirus and rhinovirus C as well as those that have been described in the past but have reemerged in the last decade in outbreaks resulting in significant morbidity and mortality, including adenovirus, influenza virus, and enterovirus D68 (EV-D68).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.113790101,0.028762238,-0.03048459,0.099783852,-0.051313273,0.079952272,0.045584631,0.080057871,0.127040276,0.07802322,0.019717838,-0.048446191,0.075759332,-0.028794182,0.059542877,-0.039231979,-0.004433151,0.01760543,-0.021514753,0.032564562,-0.021465856,-0.03439515,-0.068765785,0.062173321,0.02710518,-0.012494392,0.005531724,-0.046905952,0.057766152,0.024338292
Chapter 5 Laboratory diagnosis of viral infection,"Abstract Since the last Handbook of Clinical Neurology volume on this topic, viral diagnosis has made tremendous strides, moving from the margin to the mainstream of clinical care. For many years, conventional virus isolation was the mainstay of viral diagnosis since it was sensitive and “open-minded.” However, growth in conventional cell culture entails an inherent delay that limits its clinical impact. Although rapid culture and viral antigen methods detect fewer pathogens and are less sensitive than conventional culture, both require less expertise and have greatly reduced time to result. Polymerase chain reaction has ushered in a new era in virology, especially in the diagnosis of neurologic diseases. Molecular amplification methods are rapid, highly sensitive, can be automated, quantitative, and detect viruses not amenable to routine culture. User-friendly, walk-away tests with results in an hour, as well as multiplex tests that can detect 20 viruses in a single reaction, are now a reality. As the variety of test methods and commercial products proliferate, the challenges for clinicians and laboratories are selecting which tests to utilize in which clinical scenarios, and understanding how to interpret the results. The advantages and limitations of each method are discussed in this chapter, with special attention to neurologic disease.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.07079898,0.025784599,0.141844103,0.050175968,-0.086987836,-0.015808462,0.053723692,0.009209671,-0.012401778,0.123924642,-0.040891745,-0.052641276,0.12024998,-0.068088978,0.029860304,-0.013093996,-0.014813897,0.025044169,-0.067046912,-0.034129453,-0.015433882,-0.022367204,0.033854497,-0.069483475,-0.019719439,-0.014850753,-0.015225078,-0.050449858,-0.059476362,0.00825981
Pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of women with severe acute respiratory syndrome,"Abstract Objective This study was undertaken to evaluate the pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of pregnant women with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Study design All pregnant women (12) who presented with SARS in Hong Kong between February 1 and July 31, 2003, were included. The pregnancy and perinatal outcomes were collected. Evidence of perinatal transmission of virus was assessed with the SARS-associated coronavirus reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on cord blood, placenta tissue, and subsequent follow-up of the neonate on serology. Results Three deaths occurred among the 12 patients, giving a case fatality rate of 25%. Four of the 7 patients (57%) who presented in the first trimester had spontaneous miscarriage. Four of the 5 patients who presented after 24 weeks were delivered preterm. Two mothers recovered without delivery, but their ongoing pregnancies were complicated by intrauterine growth restriction. No newborn infant had clinical SARS and all investigations were negative for SARS. Conclusion SARS during pregnancy is associated with high incidences of spontaneous miscarriage, preterm delivery, and intrauterine growth restriction. There is no evidence of perinatal SARS infection among infants born to these mothers.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.074021818,0.236979635,-0.167314894,-0.087284521,-0.059909757,-0.000453685,-0.06898387,-0.184915747,-0.114787425,-0.012979918,0.003283172,0.006135827,0.003366103,-0.030148887,0.026190066,0.05452835,-0.007296354,0.008310617,0.011141789,0.011273604,0.007141557,-0.065509048,-0.06326175,-0.005934901,0.004018508,-0.032504532,0.007677886,0.011564826,-0.028682613,-0.012734159
Identification of New Pathogens in the Intraocular Fluid of Patients With Uveitis,"Purpose To determine infectious causes in patients with uveitis of unknown origin by intraocular fluids analysis. Design Case-control study. Methods Ocular fluids from 139 patients suspected of infectious uveitis, but negative for herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, and Toxoplasma gondii by polymerase chain reaction and/or antibody analysis in intraocular fluids, were assessed for the presence of 18 viruses and 3 bacteria by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The ocular fluids from 48 patients with uveitis of known etiology or with cataract were included as controls. Results Positive PCR results were found for Epstein-Barr virus, for rubella virus, and for human herpesvirus 6 each in 1 patient and for human parechovirus in 4 patients. Of the human parechovirus–positive patients, 1 was immunocompromised and had panuveitis. The other 3 patients were immunocompetent and had anterior uveitis, all with corneal involvement.

2009 H1N1 Influenza: A Twenty-First Century Pandemic With Roots in the Early Twentieth Century,"Abstract A swine-origin H1N1 triple-reassortant influenza A virus found to be a distant relative of the 1918 “Spanish flu” virus emerged in April 2009 to give rise to the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century. Although disease was generally mild and similar to seasonal influenza, severe manifestations including respiratory failure were noted in some, particularly those with underlying conditions such as asthma, pregnancy and immunosuppression. Children and younger adults accounted for most cases, hospitalizations and deaths. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay was superior to antigen-based rapid tests for diagnosis. All 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza strains were susceptible to 1 or more neuraminidase inhibitors. Monovalent, unadjuvanted 2009 H1N1 vaccines were licensed in the United States in September 2009 and initially targeted to younger individuals, pregnant women, caretakers of infants and healthcare providers.

Combination of multiplex reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification with an immunochromatographic strip for subtyping influenza A virus,"Abstract Considering the fatal human victims and economic loss by the annual epidemic influenza virus, the development of a rapid and convenient genetic analysis methodology is demanding for timely on-site pathogen detection. In this study, we utilized reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) for multiplex target gene amplification, and the resultant amplicons were analyzed on the immunochromatographic strip (ICS) for subtyping influenza A virus. Through the optimized primer design, reaction temperature and time, and concentration of enzymes (Bst DNA polymerase and AMV reverse transcriptase) and dNTP, the HA (H1, H3, and H5 gene) and conserved M gene were amplified. The ICS contains two test lines in addition to a control line in order to detect the presence of the HA and M gene, thereby informing us of influenza virus A type as well as its subtype (H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1). The combination of the multiplex RT-LAMP with the ICS could be complete in 40min and the pathotyping and subtyping of influenza A virus were performed even with 10 copies of viral RNA templates. Moreover, the subtyping of clinical samples, which were obtained from patients infected by influenza A virus was successfully confirmed using the multiplex RT-LAMP and ICS techniques, showing great feasibility of our methodology for real sample analysis with high speed, simplicity and sensitivity.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.046489598,0.003866933,0.195132607,0.182544891,-0.025108355,0.130364295,-0.124373914,-0.002788111,-0.042721244,-0.088940987,-0.055771664,0.00886472,-0.000684573,0.042265182,-0.063776327,0.033462795,0.044384585,0.02772103,-0.096024022,0.028168202,-0.045274572,-0.039321476,-0.026817757,0.146386134,0.034243041,-0.00064792,-0.07881654,0.083694059,-0.058991676,0.032269871
Development of multisample detection system using a tag insertion primer and an electrochemical DNA chip,"Abstract We have developed a novel multisample detection system by employing a technology combining a tag insertion primer and an electrochemical DNA chip. In the first application, Helicobacter species-infected mouse samples were detected. The primers that insert a different tag sequence in each sample were prepared, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction was carried out. Then amplification products in which a part of the sequence was different in each sample could be obtained. The target sample in which these amplification products were mixed was injected into a cassette that included the DNA chip with immobilized probes. After the cassette was set in the DNA detection system, Genelyzer, the processes of hybridization, washing, and detection were performed by the system automatically. The positive and negative concordance rates of the existing nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and this method were 100% (40/40 samples) and 97.3% (117/120 samples), respectively. This is a simple high-throughput method. Moreover, the cost per sample can be drastically lowered. Therefore, it is expected to contribute to the diagnosis of infectious agents in humans and animals.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.003886679,0.061724534,0.254393104,0.027951401,-0.004280875,-0.046705766,0.037542363,0.008049958,-0.035154796,0.003110451,-0.059409259,-0.001773155,0.041771988,-0.082506459,-0.021819948,0.0613879,-0.049081982,-0.004295123,-0.042287335,-0.015510143,-0.093548787,-0.043790984,-0.017257294,0.036964124,0.038011595,-0.053469888,-0.129185192,0.090743886,-0.096170197,0.059352918
Effective Amplification of 20-kb DNA by Reverse Transcription PCR,"Abstract Polymerase chain reaction has been applied to the amplification of long DNA fragments from a variety of sources, including genomic, mitochondrial, and viral DNAs. However, polymerase chain reaction amplification from cDNA templates produced by reverse transcription has generally been restricted to products of less than 10 kilobases. In this paper, we report a system to effectively amplify fragments up to 20 kilobases from human coronavirus 229E genomic RNA. We demonstrate that the integrity of the RNA template and the prevention of false priming events during reverse transcription are the critical parameters to achieve the synthesis of long cDNAs. The optimization of the polymerase chain reaction conditions enabled us to improve the specificity and yield of product but they were not definitive. Finally, we have shown that the same reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technology can be used for the amplification of extended regions of the dystrophin mRNA, a cellular RNA of relatively low abundance.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.105461796,0.009652904,0.068071729,0.054794745,-0.025132326,-0.07083009,-0.019512987,0.020338734,-0.010394305,-0.010907697,-0.016726762,-0.009709552,0.072268063,-0.016573318,-0.006523921,0.061123091,-0.045055466,0.006495467,-0.043335938,0.006743128,-0.078637386,-0.010793856,-0.002842569,-0.022615382,-0.022002182,-0.08419138,-0.065771143,0.057995826,-0.02717966,0.068021709
La sécurité virale des médicaments d’origine biologique,"Résumé Les crises sanitaires survenues dans les années 1980 ont dramatiquement contribué à la prise de conscience des risques iatrogènes liés aux médicaments d’origine biologique et, ainsi, au développement du concept de sécurité virale de ces médicaments, qu’ils soient d’origine humaine, avec notamment les médicaments dérivés du sang (MDS), animale ou issus des biotechnologies (produits par des cellules eucaryotes). La sécurité virale des médicaments repose sur trois éléments : la qualité de la matière première, le procédé de fabrication qui inclue des étapes aptes à éliminer ou à inactiver les virus et, éventuellement, les contrôles des produits intermédiaires ou finis. La qualité de la matière première est désormais aisément garantie, pour les MDS, par le screening des dons de sang ou de plasma (screening individuel ou en pool) pour les marqueurs directs (antigènes, génomes) et indirects (anticorps) de virus majeurs. La succession d’étapes de purification des principes actifs (étapes de partition), d’étapes d’inactivation des virus (traitement solvant–détergent, chauffage) et d’étapes dédiées spécifiquement à l’élimination des virus (nanofiltration) au cours du procédé de fabrication permet de réduire considérablement le risque viral. Cette réduction peut être estimée quantitativement lors des études de validation par épreuves de surcharge à échelle réduite. Les contrôles virologiques sur produits intermédiaires ou sur produits finis permettent de conforter la sécurité virale d’un médicament lorsque les contributions des deux premiers éléments, qualité de la matière première et procédé de fabrication, paraissent insuffisants. Le développement des principes et des techniques de sécurisation des médicaments d’origine biologique permet désormais de garantir au mieux l’absence d’infectiosité liée à des virus connus mais également, par anticipation, de garantir l’absence d’infectiosité liée à des virus inconnus. Summary The viral safety of biologicals, either human blood derivatives or animal products or recombinant proteins issued from biotechnology, relies on the quality of the starting material, the manufacturing process and, if necessary, the control of the final product. The quality of the starting material is highly guaranteed for blood derivatives due to the individual screening for specific markers (antigens, genome, antibodies) for major blood borne viruses such as hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It can be reinforced by the detection through amplification procedures (polymerase chain reaction) in the plasma pool of genomes from viruses that have been implicated in contaminations of blood derivatives in the past (parvovirus B19, hepatitis A virus). The association in the manufacturing process of different steps dedicated to purification of plasma proteins (partitioning), virus inactivation (solvent/detergent treatment, heat inactivation) or specific procedures allowing virus removal (nanofiltration) allows to reduce the viral risk very efficiently. The validation studies using scaled down systems and model viruses allow to evaluate the virus safety of any product quantitatively. The aim of these procedures is to guarantee the lack of infectivity due to any virus, either known or unknown.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.027276119,-0.0471624,0.022643772,-0.044276628,-0.03354469,0.02945294,0.051577526,-0.008866701,0.032103976,-0.000872509,-0.011393525,0.0096707,0.040360668,-0.09564168,0.193567143,0.207875516,0.307469476,0.052564874,-0.026989784,0.036922346,0.014282706,0.054114703,0.069329678,0.033314672,-0.03324674,0.024796769,-0.01046418,-0.039071058,-0.039179943,0.006602338
A real-time PCR for SARS-coronavirus incorporating target gene pre-amplification,"Abstract An enhanced polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) was developed in which a target gene pre-amplification step preceded TaqMan real-time fluorescent PCR. Clinical samples were collected from 120 patients diagnosed as suspected or probable SARS cases and analyzed by conventional PCR followed by agarose gel electrophoresis, conventional TaqMan real-time PCR, and our enhanced TaqMan real-time PCR assays. An amplicon of the size expected from SARS-CoV was obtained from 28/120 samples using the enhanced real-time PCR method. Conventional PCR and real-time PCR alone identified fewer SARS-CoV positive cases. Results were confirmed by viral culture in 3/28 cases. The limit of detection of the enhanced real-time PCR method was 102-fold higher than the standard real-time PCR assay and 107-fold higher than conventional PCR methods. The increased sensitivity of the assay may help control the spread of the disease during future SARS outbreaks.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.131824906,0.393415907,0.111089898,0.076179484,-0.046564324,-0.069225556,-0.070645137,-0.122868054,-0.046639072,-0.002437278,-0.00247397,-0.036833306,0.007553592,0.037049602,0.026248649,-0.023308856,0.034817298,-0.034001518,0.034629765,-0.134032081,0.038578523,0.088649135,0.062119533,-0.054057326,-0.079181571,0.009080887,0.043334706,-0.035817263,0.030485368,0.031010872
Near-infrared spectroscopy: Promising diagnostic tool for viral infections,"Abstract Although several methods, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescent assay, and Western blotting, have been used for the diagnosis of viral infections, none of them is ideal in terms of cost-effectiveness, speed, and accuracy. Currently, the rate of outbreak of emerging viruses is increasing and therefore the development and establishment of analytical methods for such viral infections are becoming more important. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a fast, multicomponent assay that enables non-invasive, non-destructive analysis. Recently, the diagnosis of viral infections using NIR spectroscopy has been attempted. In this review, the potential of the NIR method in the medical and virological fields is discussed.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.030221506,0.012046166,0.097949734,0.037028254,-0.085420378,0.004238991,0.092184066,-0.009005686,0.011598268,0.057465216,-0.025328121,-0.021907093,0.055522648,-0.05787842,0.01053029,-0.031757467,-0.011875565,0.010946762,-0.025704312,0.014285897,8.39E-05,-0.032800608,-0.027705223,0.009789486,-0.019061166,0.005624688,0.030047522,-0.034918058,0.008203615,0.021644913
Regulation of hepatitis C virus replication by the core protein through its interaction with viral RNA polymerase,"Abstract The hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein is a structural component of the nucleocapsid and has been shown to modulate cellular signaling pathways by interaction with various cellular proteins. In the present study, we investigated the role of HCV core protein in viral RNA replication. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the core protein binds to the amino-terminal region of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which encompasses the finger and palm domains. Direct interaction between HCV RdRp and core protein led to inhibition of RdRp RNA synthesis activity of in vitro. Furthermore, over-expression of core protein, but not its derivatives lacking the RdRp-interacting domain, suppressed HCV replication in a hepatoma cell line harboring an HCV subgenomic replicon RNA. Collectively, our results suggest that the core protein, through binding to RdRp and inhibiting its RNA synthesis activity, is a viral regulator of HCV RNA replication.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.286157779,-0.075045221,-0.11973409,0.10282198,-0.117557587,-0.073671146,0.043093299,0.001051492,0.006012197,0.017304146,0.041832494,0.134023577,-0.044231173,0.06098436,-0.093964528,-0.093080344,0.126747753,0.133550192,0.250371827,-0.110060758,-0.058076229,0.011645915,0.126212274,-0.041616808,0.003860067,0.018705861,-0.042128504,0.055827762,-0.054168799,0.022011502
Multiplex Molecular Detection of Respiratory Pathogens in Children With Asthma Exacerbation,"Background Up to 80% of asthma exacerbations in white children are associated with viral upper respiratory infections. The relative importance of different respiratory pathogens and relevant microbiological data in Asian children are unclear. This study elucidated the epidemiology of respiratory infections in Hong Kong children with asthma exacerbation. Methods A total of 209 children aged 3-18 years with asthma exacerbations and 77 controls with stable asthma were recruited. The severity of asthma exacerbations was assessed according to Global Initiative for Asthma guideline, and subjects aged 6 years or older performed exhaled nitric oxide and spirometric measurements. Nested multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to detect 20 different respiratory pathogens. Results Respiratory pathogens were detected in 105 (51.0%) subjects. The presence of any respiratory pathogen was associated with asthma exacerbation (odds ratio [OR], 2.77; 95% CI, 1.51–5.11; P < .001). Specifically, human rhinovirus (HRV) infection was more common among children with asthma exacerbation (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.09–5.32; P = .018). All other pathogens or coinfections were not associated with asthmatic attacks. None of these respiratory infections was associated with the severity of asthma exacerbation (P > .15 for all). During peak HRV season in the winter of 2007 to 2008, this virus was detected in 46.4% of children with asthma exacerbations. Conclusions Respiratory viral infections are commonly found in children with asthma exacerbation, with HRV being the most important pathogen in our patients. Respiratory viral infection is a triggering factor for asthma exacerbation but does not correlate with its severity.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.199965772,-0.128555088,-0.10197493,-0.050380248,0.008442683,-0.132211016,0.086884725,-0.06582762,0.032911754,0.026827242,-0.034683276,-0.044164499,-0.037306723,-0.045622121,0.024621755,0.043524504,0.006020916,-0.135989391,0.075819863,-0.047519048,-0.072473328,-0.158692834,-0.055197106,0.169608343,-0.047645811,0.175175634,-0.146867771,-0.075006387,0.170679369,0.246267017
The Natural Viral Load Profile of Patients With Pandemic 2009 Influenza A(H1N1) and the Effect of Oseltamivir Treatment,"Background The natural history of viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract of the new pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) and the effect of oseltamivir treatment were uncertain. Methods A retrospective cohort study involving 145 consecutive patients with specimens positive by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for the matrix and new H1 genes was conducted. Results The nontreated and oseltamivir-treated patients were comparable in their viral load at presentation, demography, and the presenting symptoms. No correlation was observed between viral load with age and number of symptoms. Viral load of nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was significantly lower in treated than in nontreated patients at day 5 after symptom onset. When oseltamivir was initiated ≤ 2 days after symptom onset, a greater rate of viral load reduction in NPA of treated patients than that of nontreated patients was observed (−0.638 [95% CI, −0.809 to −0.466] vs −0.409 [95% CI, −0.663 to −0.185] log10 copies/mL/d post-symptom onset), and the viral load was undetectable at day 6 after oseltamivir initiation, which was 1 day earlier than that of those whose treatment was initiated > 2 days of symptom onset. The viral load was inversely correlated with concomitant absolute lymphocyte count in nontreated patients (Pearson correlation coefficient [r] = −0.687, P = .001) and treated patients (Pearson r = −0.365, P < .001). Resolution of fever was 1.4 days later in nontreated than treated patients (P = .012) Conclusions The natural viral load profile was described. Oral oseltamivir suppresses viral load more effectively when given early in mild cases of pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) infections.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.150781807,-0.0498899,-0.099375083,-0.047279922,-0.106484424,0.035659629,-0.062703991,0.060290254,-0.122926742,-0.006657749,0.002771178,0.019202501,-0.022411356,0.068917163,-0.038144056,0.018251322,-0.028934668,0.01481786,0.005788012,-0.000364719,-0.067061533,-0.00943513,-0.107802125,0.013335037,-0.10441921,-0.012542257,0.027765899,-0.118023841,-0.051117558,0.086243928
"Clinical Course of Avian Influenza A(H5N1) in Patients at the Persahabatan Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia, 2005–2008","Background Limited understanding of the presentation and course of influenza A(H5N1) infection in humans hinders evidence-based management. Methods We reviewed the case records of patients admitted to the Persahabatan Hospital (RSP), Jakarta, Indonesia, with influenza A(H5N1) confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results Twenty-two previously well patients, aged 3 to 47 years (median 24.5 years), were identified. All attended a clinic or hospital after a median of 2 days of illness (range 0–7). Times to first dose of oseltamivir (three died before receiving oseltamivir) were 2 to 12 days (median 7 days), administered mostly (n = 15) at RSP. Nineteen patients required mechanical ventilation. Deaths numbered 18 (case fatality = 82%) occurring within hours to 6 days of RSP admission, corresponding to 6 to 16 days of illness. Admission hyperglycemia (≥ 140 mg/dL), unrelated to steroids or known underlying diabetes mellitus, and elevated D-dimer levels (0.81–5.2 mg/L, upper limit of normal < 0.5 mg/L) were present in 14/21 (67%) and 20/21 (95%) patients, respectively. Fibrinogen concentrations were mostly low/normal at 129.9 to 517.9 mg/dL (median 241.1, normal 200–400 mg/dL), whereas C-reactive protein (9/11) and ferritin (6/8) levels were increased. Risk factors for death (univariate analysis) included: (1) increased D-dimers, (2) hyperglycema, (3) increased urea, (4) more extensive chest radiograph shadowing, and (5) lower admission oxygen saturation. Conclusions Early diagnosis and effective treatment of human influenza A(H5N1) infection remains challenging. Most patients were referred late with advanced disease. Oseltamivir had limited clinical impact. Elevated D-dimer levels, consistent with fibrinolysis, and hyperglycemia warrant more research to determine their underlying mechanisms and optimal treatment.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.135777019,-0.037723664,-0.080116033,-0.082488916,-0.087416888,0.081518155,-0.087259102,0.085144322,-0.08491636,-0.030876336,-0.008435198,0.034480457,-0.034437381,0.040422629,-0.060944045,0.04229815,-0.007963568,0.043910281,-0.010345038,0.012411854,0.008369854,-0.043908073,-0.045833301,-0.029926749,-0.038505725,-0.013834076,0.012364306,-0.049057104,-0.020657117,0.006824044
Respiratory Viruses in Adults With Community-Acquired Pneumonia,"Background Use of nucleic acid amplification techniques has increased the identification of respiratory viruses (RVs) in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The objectives of the present study were to identify RV in patients with CAP using three different sampling methods and to compare CAP virus proportions and types with two comparison groups. Methods The study population included 183 adult patients with CAP, 450 control subjects, and 201 patients with nonpneumonic lower respiratory tract infection (NPLRTI). Each participant was sampled by oropharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, and nasopharyngeal washing, and the samples were tested for detection of 12 RVs by multiplex TaqMan Hydrolysis probe-based real-time polymerase chain reaction (Integrated DNA Technology; Coralville, IA). Results At least one RV was identified in 58 patients with CAP (31.7%) compared with 32 (7.1%) in control subjects and 104 (51.7%) in patients with NPLRTI (P < .01 and P < .01, respectively). Coronaviruses were identified in 24 (13.1%) patients with CAP, compared with 17 (3.8%) in control subjects, and 21 (10.4%) patients with NPLRTI. Respiratory syncytial virus was identified in 13 (7.1%), four (0.9%), and seven (3.5%); rhinovirus in nine (4.9%), nine (2.0%), and 15 (7.5%); and influenza virus in eight (4.4%), two (0.4%), and 63 (31.3%) patients with CAP, control subjects, and patients with NPLRTI, respectively. Conclusions The proportion of RV involvement in CAP is higher than previously reported. The proportion of RV identified in healthy subjects is significantly lower than in CAP, but it is not zero and should be weighed when interpreting corresponding proportions among patients.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.219107668,-0.054670559,-0.078630243,-0.074246475,-0.052045502,-0.078702096,-0.074538904,0.119195049,-0.246933931,0.091445922,-0.115018358,0.009215214,0.021790738,0.057780492,-0.122217278,-0.049104466,0.035250763,-0.009922178,-0.037965679,0.120137951,0.030013266,-0.027014467,0.197911693,0.083076676,0.087405432,-0.111999328,-0.010896878,0.068854926,0.067115714,0.079241582
"Upper-Respiratory Viral Infection, Biomarkers, and COPD Exacerbations","Background Respiratory viruses frequently are recovered in the upper-respiratory tract during acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), but their role as contributing pathogens remains unclear. The usefulness of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein as indicators of the presence or absence of viral infection in this setting also needs to be evaluated. Methods The study was of a prospective cohort of patients with COPD admitted to the ED for AECOPD. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for 14 respiratory viruses was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs collected at admission and after recovery in stable condition. Results Eighty-six patients (mean age, 72 years; male, 64%) were included. During AECOPD, upper-respiratory viral infections were detected in 44 (51%) patients: picornavirus in 22, metapneumovirus in seven, coronavirus in eight, influenza A/B in two, parainfluenza in two, and respiratory syncytial virus in three. A dual infection was present in three patients. After recovery, viruses were detected in only eight (11%) of 71 patients (P < .001 compared with AECOPD phase). In five of these patients, no virus had been identified during the initial exacerbation, thus suggesting a new viral infection acquired during follow-up. During AECOPD, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels did not differ significantly between patients with or without a proven viral infection. Conclusions Prevalence of upper-respiratory viral infection, as detected from nasopharyngeal swab by RT-PCR, is high in AECOPD and low after clinical recovery, suggesting that AECOPD frequently are triggered by viral infections initiated in the upper-respiratory tract. In our study, serum procalcitonin and C-reactive protein did not discriminate virus-associated exacerbations from others.

IL-27 Is Elevated in Patients With COPD and Patients With Pulmonary TB and Induces Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells to Produce CXCL10,"Background The role of IL-27 in the pathogenesis of airway inflammatory diseases remains elusive. We, therefore, have studied its concentrations in the sputum and plasma of patients with COPD and patients with pulmonary TB (PTB), and further investigated the mechanism-of-action effects of IL-27 on bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. Methods Human bronchial epithelial cells grown on air-liquid interface culture were activated by IL-27, alone, or in combination with other inflammatory cytokines in the presence or absence of various signaling molecule inhibitors. The expression of CXCL10 was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The underlying signaling pathways were studied by intracellular staining using flow cytometry, Western blot, ELISA, or siRNA. Results Significantly higher sputum and plasma concentrations of IL-27 were found in patients with COPD (n = 34; P < .01 and P < .001, respectively) or patients with PTB (n = 31; P < .01 and P < .001, respectively) than in healthy control subjects (n = 48). Sputum, but not plasma, IL-27 levels in patients with COPD correlated negatively with FEV1 (r = −0.51, P < .01). Sputum, but not plasma, IL-27 in patients with PTB correlated positively with mycobacterial load in sputum (r = 0.48, P < .05). Further in vitro studies demonstrated that IL-27 could induce gene and protein expression of CXCL10 in bronchial epithelial cells, which was regulated by the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway. Conclusions The production of IL-27 is related to the pathogenesis of COPD and PTB, and IL-27 induces the expression of CXCL10 in bronchial epithelial cells through the activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.000609729,-0.035415069,-0.024834261,-0.181772715,-0.114391692,0.002634466,0.002152715,-0.00597518,-0.019623265,-0.037767358,-0.071812359,-0.035889432,-0.033915326,0.144686759,-0.067396033,0.019343904,0.01013645,-0.051166402,4.35E-05,-0.056152682,0.053508564,-0.085914,0.068826572,0.010514042,-0.047190007,-0.020861962,0.045812254,0.045610494,0.017932658,-0.000561304
A Prospective Study of Respiratory Viral Infection in Pregnant Women With and Without Asthma,"Background Respiratory viral infections are common in pregnancy, but their health impact, especially in asthma, is unknown. The objective of this study was to assess the frequency, severity, and consequences of respiratory viral infection during pregnancy in women with and without asthma. Methods In this prospective cohort study, common cold symptoms were assessed during pregnancy in 168 women with asthma and 117 women without asthma using the common cold questionnaire and by self-report. Nasal and throat swabs were collected for suspected infections and tested by polymerase chain reaction for respiratory viruses. Pregnancy and asthma outcomes were recorded. Results Pregnant women with asthma had more prospective self-reported and questionnaire-detected common colds than pregnant women without asthma (incidence rate ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.30-2.42; P < .0001). Retrospectively reported common colds in early pregnancy and post partum were increased in women with asthma compared with women without asthma. The severity of cold symptoms was also increased in women with asthma (total cold score median, 8; interquartile range [5, 10] in women with asthma vs 6 [5, 8] in control subjects; P = .031). Among women with asthma, having a laboratory-confirmed viral infection was associated with poorer maternal health, with 60% of infections associated with uncontrolled asthma and a higher likelihood of preeclampsia. Conclusions Pregnant women with asthma have more common colds during pregnancy than pregnant women without asthma. Colds during pregnancy were associated with adverse maternal and pregnancy outcomes. Prevention of viral infection in pregnancy may improve the health of mothers with asthma.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.066428561,-0.05244239,-0.044452024,-0.085560247,-0.028024369,-0.022795253,0.03669541,-0.001467534,0.009764817,-0.013630134,-0.002372064,-0.008009247,-0.045579592,-0.049304313,0.023048635,0.053435113,0.002510785,-0.075796699,0.043941455,-0.049559475,-0.04259653,-0.152260908,-0.083506818,0.061720332,0.014099223,0.074054352,-0.038465924,-0.023347683,0.085739326,0.112607025
Clinical and Laboratory Features of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Vis-À-Vis Onset of Fever,"Study objectives: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a rapidly progressive disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) infection. However, the disease presentation is nonspecific. The aim of this study was to define clearly the presentation, clinical progression, and laboratory data in a group of patients who had SARS. Design: Retrospective observational study. Setting: A tertiary care medical center with 51 negative-pressure isolation rooms in Taipei, Taiwan. Patients: Fifty-three patients with SARS seen between April 27 and June 16, 2003. Results: Fever (ie, temperature > 38°C) was the most common symptom (98%) and the earliest. When admitted to the isolation unit of the hospital for observation, most patients reported nonspecific symptoms associated with their fever. Only two patients with preexisting illnesses had cough on the same day the fever began. Eventually, 39 patients (74%) developed cough, beginning at a mean (± SD) time of 4.5 ± 1.9 days after fever onset, and 35 patients (66%) had diarrhea beginning at a mean time of 6.0 ± 3.3 days after fever onset. Thirty-one patients (59%) had abnormal findings on chest radiographs on hospital admission, and all but 1 patient (98%) eventually developed lung infiltrates that were consistent with pneumonia. The majority of patients (63%) first developed unifocal infiltrates at a mean time of 4.5 ± 2.1 days after fever onset, while in 37% of patients the initial infiltrates were multifocal, appearing at a mean time of 5.8 ± 1.3 days after fever onset. Common laboratory findings included lymphopenia (on hospital admission, 70%; during hospitalization, 95%), thrombocytopenia (on hospital admission, 28%; during hospitalization, 40%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (on hospital admission, 58%; during hospitalization, 88%), creatine kinase (on hospital admission, 18%; during hospitalization, 32%), and aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase levels (on hospital admission, 27%; during hospitalization, 62%). Throat or nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR was positive in 40 of the 47 patients (85%) in whom the test was performed. Conclusions: None of the presenting symptoms or laboratory findings are pathognomonic for SARS. Even though cough developed in a majority of patients, it did not occur until later in the disease course, suggesting that a cough preceding or concurrent with the onset of fever is less likely to indicate SARS. While PCR for SARS-CoV appears to be the best early diagnostic test currently available, it is clear that better methods are needed to differentiate between SARS and non-SARS illness on initial presentation.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.203495819,0.269217714,-0.192297387,-0.108931104,-0.102857383,-0.04724725,-0.138205341,-0.027240593,-0.185834319,0.013002267,-0.024965369,0.023176517,-0.029259303,0.037330304,-0.031460771,0.030441108,-0.000284813,0.067469948,-0.004763029,0.040228926,0.03708654,-0.037183144,-0.076735572,-0.058792016,-0.068375044,-0.009661856,0.011974797,-0.027153458,-0.051506154,0.002739872
Colonization of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Associated Coronavirus Among Health-Care Workers Screened by Nasopharyngeal Swab,"Study objectives To report the efficacy and findings of a large-scale preventive screening program for severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) using amplification of the virus from a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) obtained from the health-care workers (HCWs). Design A prospective observational study. Setting A medical center in Taiwan. Participants Two hundred thirty HCWs. Intervention NPS examination for the presence of SARS-CoV by two nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Measurements and results During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), NPS polymerase chain reaction screening of HCWs for SARS-CoV was performed. SARS-CoV was examined by two nested RT-PCRs and a quantitative RT-PCR. Serum-specific antibodies were assessed by enzyme immunoassay and indirect immunofluorescence. We monitored 230 HCWs, including 217 first-line HCWs and 13 non–first-line HCWs. One hundred ninety first-line HCWs and 13 non–first-line HCWs had negative results in both nested RT-PCR assays. Two first-line HCWs who were positive on both nested RT-PCR assays had SARS. They had 16,900 ± 7,920 copies (mean ± SD) of RNA per milliliter in the NPS and had detectable anti-SARS antibodies. The remaining 25 first-line HCWs were negative for the first nested RT-PCR but positive for the second nested RT-PCR. Their corresponding titers were 338 ± 227 copies of RNA per milliliter; antibodies developed in none of these 25 HCWs. The expression and function of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 were not different among these HCWs. This study shows that colonization of SARS-CoV occurred in 25 of 217 well-protected first-line HCWs on a SARS-associated service, but they remained seronegative. Conclusion With the second RT-PCR assay more sensitive than the first RT-PCR assay, we are able to show that approximately 11.5% of well-protected HCWs exposed to SARS patients or specimens may have colonization without seroconversion. Only those with significant clinical symptoms or disease would have active immunity. Thus, regular NPS screening for nested RT-PCR assays in conjunction with a daily recording of body temperature in all first-line HCWs may provide an effective way of early detection.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.041703933,0.284365266,0.003066776,0.022423248,-0.030954643,-0.018772183,-0.053612302,-0.098828533,-0.016547832,-0.051547648,0.01625324,-0.002939601,-0.032721787,0.043714744,0.020383626,0.020570585,0.039173876,-0.007058028,-0.011350146,-0.062982165,-0.002993118,0.022173262,-0.020109738,0.017663245,0.008594267,0.015858674,0.016070756,-0.012705441,0.040101717,-0.028745839
Viral Etiology of Acute Exacerbations of COPD in Hong Kong,"Introduction Viral respiratory infections may precipitate acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). However, little is known about viral etiology related to AECOPD in Asia. We aimed to study the viral etiology of AECOPD in Hong Kong. Methods Patients admitted to an acute hospital in Hong Kong with AECOPD were recruited prospectively from May 1, 2004, to April 30, 2005. Nasopharyngeal aspirate was collected and assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and viral culture. Spirometry was performed in the stable phase at 2 to 3 months after hospital discharge. Results There were 262 episodes of AECOPD among 196 patients (mean age, 75.7 ± 7.7 years [± SD]; 160 men). Mean FEV1 was 39.6 ± 18.9% of predicted normal, and FEV1/FVC ratio was 58.0 ± 15.2%. Fifty-eight episodes (22.1%) yielded positive viral PCR results. The viruses identified were influenza A (7.3%), coronavirus OC43 (4.6%), rhinovirus (3.1%), influenza B (2.7%), and respiratory syncytial virus (2.3%). The diagnostic yield of viral identification by PCR was 2.7 times higher than that based on conventional viral culture. The rates of identifying a positive viral etiology by PCR were similar among the subjects with FEV1 ≥ 50%, ≥ 30 to 50%, and < 30% of predicted normal. Viral infection appeared to have no effect on subsequent readmissions or mortality rate over a study period of 1 year Conclusion Influenza A and two less-attended viruses, coronavirus OC43 and rhinovirus, were the common etiologic agents in patients hospitalized with AECOPD in Hong Kong. These should be considered in developing diagnostic and intervening strategies pertaining to AECOPD.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.159769788,-0.061995917,-0.060570104,0.019330142,-0.023383495,-0.004724541,-0.029960924,0.014335942,-0.078606101,0.044713561,-0.018219555,-0.022585146,0.037960138,0.050113237,0.006524079,-0.027932231,0.055084592,-0.023898483,0.022865534,-0.016701529,-0.008457479,-0.047751678,-0.026624886,0.04260694,-0.008620308,0.017033016,0.020286493,-0.031166374,0.004201495,0.090315814
The Role of Viral Infection in Pulmonary Exacerbations of Bronchiectasis in Adults A Prospective Study,"BACKGROUND Although viral infections are a major cause of exacerbations in patients with chronic airway diseases, their roles in triggering bronchiectasis exacerbations in adults remain unclear. Therefore, we prospectively investigated the incidence and clinical impacts of viral infection in adults with bronchiectasis exacerbations. METHODS The study cohort of 119 adults with bronchiectasis was followed up prospectively for 12 months. Nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples were assayed for 16 respiratory viruses, using polymerase chain reaction assays. Symptoms, spirometry, quality of life, bacterial cultures, and inflammatory markers were assessed during steady-state bronchiectasis and exacerbations. RESULTS A total of 100 exacerbations were captured from 58 patients during 1-year follow-up. Respiratory viruses were found more frequently in nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum during bronchiectasis exacerbations (49 of 100, 49.0') than during steady state (11 of 58, 18.9'; P < .001). The most common viruses found in patients experiencing exacerbations were coronavirus (19 of 65, 39.2'), rhinovirus (16 of 65, 24.6'), and influenza A/B viruses (16 of 65, 24.6'). Virus-positive exacerbations were associated with a greater increase in markers of systemic and airway inflammation (serum IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α; sputum IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α) compared with virus-negative exacerbations, but the differences in spirometric indexes, quality of life, and bacterial density were unremarkable. In receiver operating characteristics analysis, serum interferon-γ-induced protein 10 yielded an area under curve of 0.67 (95' CI, 0.53-0.77; P = .018). Furthermore, a greater proportion of patients with virus-positive exacerbations received IV antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS Prevalence of viral infections, detected by polymerase chain reaction assay, is higher in cases of bronchiectasis exacerbations than in steady-state bronchiectasis, suggesting that respiratory viruses play crucial roles in triggering bronchiectasis exacerbations. The potential mechanisms of virus-induced bronchiectasis exacerbations merit further investigations.

Effect of Interactions Between Lower Airway Bacterial and Rhinoviral Infection in Exacerbations of COPD,"Study objectives The inflammatory responses and associated clinical severity of COPD exacerbations are greatly variable, and the determinants of these factors are poorly understood. We examined the hypothesis that bacteria and viruses may modulate this heterogeneity and that interactions between bacterial and viral infection may affect changes in airway bacterial load and the clinical features and inflammatory responses of exacerbations in patients with COPD. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Outpatient Department, London Chest Hospital, London, UK. Patients Thirty-nine patients with COPD. Measurements We prospectively studied 56 COPD exacerbations, obtaining clinical data and paired sputum and serum samples at baseline and exacerbation. Qualitative and quantitative microbiology, polymerase chain reaction detection for rhinovirus, and estimation of cytokine levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed. Results A total of 69.6% of exacerbations were associated with a bacterial pathogen, most commonly Haemophilus influenzae. Rhinovirus was identified in 19.6% of exacerbations. The rise in bacterial load at exacerbation correlated with the rise in sputum interleukin (IL)-8 (r = 0.37, p = 0.022) and fall in FEV1 (r = 0.35, p = 0.048). Exacerbations with both rhinovirus and H influenzae had higher bacterial loads (108.56 cfu/mL vs 108.05cfu/mL, p = 0.018) and serum IL-6 (13.75 pg/mL vs 6.29 pg/mL, p = 0.028) than exacerbations without both pathogens. In exacerbations with both cold symptoms (a marker of putative viral infection) and a bacterial pathogen, the FEV1 fall was greater (20.3% vs 3.6%, p = 0.026) and symptom count was higher (p = 0.019) than those with a bacterial pathogen alone. Conclusions The clinical severity and inflammatory responses in COPD exacerbations are modulated by the nature of the infecting organism: bacterial and viral pathogens interact to cause additional rises in inflammatory markers and greater exacerbation severity.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.098509198,-0.063355621,-0.039879001,-0.14405366,-0.086458044,-0.065530658,0.046642485,0.025512076,-0.099171935,0.053916559,-0.049429229,-0.055184878,-0.029155526,0.02040012,-0.021828391,-0.01660482,0.011639849,-0.069406547,0.009958075,-0.04041543,-0.015678325,-0.108322641,0.007999379,0.076734123,-0.028739602,0.049255425,0.010347143,-0.002408317,0.09186585,0.136866889
"Características de las infecciones respiratorias agudas causadas por los coronavirus OC43, NL63 y 229E","Resumen Antecedentes y objetivos Las infecciones respiratorias agudas son una entidad muy frecuente en la población general. La mayoría de ellas son debidas a infecciones víricas. Este estudio pretende precisar las características clínicas y epidemiológicas de los pacientes adultos con infección respiratoria por los coronavirus OC43, NL63 y 229E. Pacientes y métodos Entre enero del 2013 y febrero del 2014 se estudió prospectivamente a todos los pacientes con sospecha clínica de infección respiratoria mediante la toma de un frotis faríngeo y la realización de una reacción en cadena de la polimerasa en transcripción reversa en tiempo real en búsqueda de coronavirus. Resultados En 48 casos (7,0% de los 686 pacientes incluidos; 12,6% de los 381 en los que se detectó algún virus) se pudo demostrar la presencia de algún coronavirus. En 24 casos se trataba del OC43 (50%), en 14 del NL63 (29%) y en 10 del 229E (21%). La edad media fue de 54,5 años, con un ligero predominio de varones. Las presentaciones clínicas más frecuentes fueron el cuadro gripal inespecífico (43,7%), la neumonía (29,2%) y la agudización de enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva crónica (8,3%). El 52% de los pacientes precisaron ingreso hospitalario, en 2 ocasiones en cuidados intensivos. No se produjo ningún fallecimiento. Conclusión Las infecciones respiratorias agudas causadas por coronavirus inciden preferentemente en varones fumadores en la edad media de la vida, frecuentemente afectados de enfermedades previas. La sintomatología clínica mas frecuente ha sido el cuadro gripal inespecífico. Abstract Background and objectives Acute respiratory infection is a very common condition in the general population. The majority of these infections are due to viruses. This study attempted to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of adult patients with respiratory infection by the coronavirus OC43, NL63 and 229E. Patients and methods Between January 2013 and February 2014, we prospectively studied all patients with suspected clinical respiratory infection by taking throat swabs and performing a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in search of coronavirus. Results In 48 cases (7.0% of the 686 enrolled patients; 12.6% of the 381 in whom a virus was detected) the presence of a coronavirus demonstrated. In 24 cases, the virus was OC43 (50%); in 14 cases, the virus was NL63 (29%); and in 10 cases, the virus was 229E (21%). The mean age was 54.5 years, with a slight predominance of men. The most common clinical presentations were nonspecific influenza symptoms (43.7%), pneumonia (29.2%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (8.3%). Fifty-two percent of the patients required hospitalization, and 2 patients required intensive care. There were no deaths. Conclusion Acute respiratory infections caused by coronavirus mainly affect middle-aged male smokers, who are often affected by previous diseases. The most common clinical picture has been nonspecific influenza symptoms.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.108268887,-0.05125489,-0.066751146,-0.082103448,-0.005624833,-0.00012675,-0.012465402,0.022250821,0.009822252,-0.039394055,-0.016026822,0.092569178,0.054282824,-0.096092909,0.256427039,0.346457978,0.501198632,0.122307474,-0.018801719,0.128170308,0.081382693,0.049821067,0.057155568,0.041571497,-0.098332899,-0.103742678,0.059638362,0.037792389,-0.046885901,0.023401418
In vitro activity of cepharanthine hydrochloride against clinical wild-type and lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus isolates,"Abstract Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection causes major public health problems worldwide. The clinical limitation of current antiviral drugs for HBV, such as lamivudine, is the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains during prolonged antiviral therapy. Cepharanthine hydrochloride (CH), a natural alkaloid-derived compound, has been reported to possess potent activity against various viruses. The present study was performed to evaluate the in vitro activity of CH against clinical wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV isolates in transiently transfected cells. HBV DNA was extracted from serum samples collected both before lamivudine therapy and at the time of viral breakthrough and was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplicons were cloned into a novel expression vector, pHY106, which can initiate the intracellular HBV replication cycle after cell transfection. Following transfection of the cloned amplicon into HepG2 cells, a drug susceptibility assay was performed. The level of viral antigen, HBeAg, was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) was used for determining the amount of intracellular HBV DNA. Heat stress cognate 70 (Hsc70), a host protein required for HBV replication, was also analyzed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to explore the possible antiviral mechanism of CH. The results showed that CH inhibited replication and HBeAg production by either wild-type or lamivudine-resistant HBV clinical isolates in a dose-dependent manner. The Hsc70 mRNA was also downregulated significantly. In conclusion, CH is active against both wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV clinical isolates, and its activity may be associated with its inhibition of host Hsc70.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.063811572,-0.010053421,0.056546843,-0.032438639,-0.108429502,0.063714315,0.045388615,-0.031462779,0.044501775,0.024696987,8.83E-05,0.003037653,-0.017625636,0.092843546,0.004102352,-0.012503825,-0.014018842,0.070050851,0.056593684,-0.030473144,0.043278639,0.052812277,0.030031074,0.044615902,0.011486545,0.014930571,0.049191382,-0.031310031,0.028879269,0.00991044
"Enteric involvement of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infection 1 1 The authors thank Man-yee Yung, Sara Fung, Dr. Bonnie Kwan, and Dr. Thomas Li for their help in retrieving patient information.","Abstract Background & Aims : Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently emerged infection from a novel coronavirus (CoV). Apart from fever and respiratory complications, gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently observed in patients with SARS but the significance remains undetermined. Herein, we describe the clinical, pathologic, and virologic features of the intestinal involvement of this new viral infection. Methods : A retrospective analysis of the gastrointestinal symptoms and other clinical parameters of the first 138 patients with confirmed SARS admitted for a major outbreak in Hong Kong in March 2003 was performed. Intestinal specimens were obtained by colonoscopy or postmortem examination to detect the presence of coronavirus by electron microscopy, virus culture, and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results : Among these 138 patients with SARS, 28 (20.3%) presented with watery diarrhea and up to 38.4% of patients had symptoms of diarrhea during the course of illness. Diarrhea was more frequently observed during the first week of illness. The mean number of days with diarrhea was 3.7 ± 2.7, and most diarrhea was self-limiting. Intestinal biopsy specimens obtained by colonoscopy or autopsy showed minimal architectural disruption but the presence of active viral replication within both the small and large intestine. Coronavirus was also isolated by culture from these specimens, and SARS-CoV RNA can be detected in the stool of patients for more than 10 weeks after symptom onset. Conclusions : Diarrhea is a common presenting symptom of SARS. The intestinal tropism of the SARS-CoV has major implications on clinical presentation and viral transmission.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.115628102,0.322604735,-0.216105373,-0.049802022,-0.038301966,-0.037555348,-0.079502031,-0.146906878,-0.123531062,0.031538066,0.008122707,0.007489053,0.004509316,0.024220062,0.092932264,-0.042175623,-0.00986488,0.02495753,0.014745466,0.067364912,0.018242746,-0.027789441,-0.082462908,0.001254124,-0.009337253,-0.040308486,-0.029624083,-0.014177241,-0.029737147,-0.002705077
Acute respiratory viral infections in pediatric cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy,"Abstract Objective to estimate the prevalence of infection by respiratory viruses in pediatric patients with cancer and acute respiratory infection (ARI) and/or fever. Methods cross-sectional study, from January 2011 to December 2012. The secretions of nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed in children younger than 21 years with acute respiratory infections. Patients were treated at the Grupo em Defesa da Criança Com Câncer (Grendacc) and University Hospital (HU), Jundiaí, SP. The rapid test was used for detection of influenza virus (Kit Biotrin, Inc. Ireland), and real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (FTD, Respiratory pathogens, multiplex Fast Trade Kit, Malta) for detection of influenza virus (H1N1, B), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parechovirus, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, and human coronavirus. The prevalence of viral infection was estimated and association tests were used (χ2 or Fisher's exact test). Results 104 samples of nasopharyngeal aspirate and blood were analyzed. The median age was 12 ± 5.2 years, 51% males, 68% whites, 32% had repeated ARIs, 32% prior antibiotic use, 19.8% cough, and 8% contact with ARIs. A total of 94.3% were in good general status. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (42.3%) was the most prevalent neoplasia. Respiratory viruses were detected in 50 samples: rhinoviruses (23.1%), respiratory syncytial virus AB (8.7%), and coronavirus (6.8%). Co-detection occurred in 19% of cases with 2 viruses and in 3% of those with 3 viruses, and was more frequent between rhinovirus and coronavirus 43. Fever in neutropenic patients was observed in 13%, of which four (30.7) were positive for viruses. There were no deaths. Conclusions the prevalence of respiratory viruses was relevant in the infectious episode, with no increase in morbidity and mortality.

Orchitis in a Cat Associated with Coronavirus Infection,"Abstract A case of severe, pyogranulomatous and necrotizing orchitis in a cat, which later succumbed to systemic feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), is described. The 3·5-year-old cat, positive for feline immunodeficiency virus infection, presented with a left testicular enlargement. A few months after castration the animal was humanely destroyed due to declining health. Post-mortem examination revealed inflammatory lesions in abdominal organs and in the brain compatible with FIP. Infection was confirmed with a reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction test and by immunohistochemical demonstration of coronavirus antigen in the affected tissues, including the left testicle. FIP is usually a systemic disease. However, lesions and presenting clinical signs in a single organ system such as the brain are not uncommon.

Pathological Changes in Masked Palm Civets Experimentally Infected by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus,"Summary Masked palm civets are highly susceptible to infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Infected animals become less aggressive and develop pyrexia, lethargy and diarrhoea. The present study describes the spectrum of histopathological changes in the lung, spleen, lymph node, liver, small intestine, kidney and cerebrum of civets infected experimentally with SARS-CoV. In-situ hybridization (ISH) with probes specific for the RNA polymerase gene demonstrated viral RNA in the lung, small intestine and cerebrum only. In-situ labelling was employed in order to demonstrate cellular apoptosis in the cerebrum, but there was no evidence of apoptosis within the myocardium. These results indicate that SARS-CoV causes multi-organ pathology in civets, similar to that observed in human SARS patients. These parallels suggest that civets may be used as an animal model of this infection to gain insight into the pathogenesis of SARS and for evaluation of candidate vaccines and antiviral drugs.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.040427771,0.356230526,-0.206760547,-0.022296489,-0.061830023,0.033289366,-0.029730961,-0.19752961,-0.010692073,0.019861185,0.011164122,-0.03509397,0.021773426,0.02165234,0.049643386,-0.001913876,-0.038855023,0.012038416,0.002065754,0.049651832,0.02879693,-0.003152666,0.011619728,0.025268891,0.009689621,-0.041523807,-0.05948581,0.005769129,0.002153523,0.005167837
Systemic Toxoplasmosis and Concurrent Porcine Circovirus-2 Infection in a Pig,"Summary Systemic toxoplasmosis and concurrent infection with porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2) was diagnosed in a fattening pig. Clinical examination of the herd showed that up to 30% of the pigs of this weight group suffered from severe respiratory signs including sneezing and coughing, with a mortality rate of up to 5%. Gross necropsy examination revealed severe interstitial pneumonia and generalized lymphadenopathy. On microscopical examination there was necrotizing inflammation of the lung, adrenal glands and lymph nodes, associated with lymphoid depletion, cytoplasmic basophilic botryoid inclusion bodies and protozoal microorganisms. Infection with Toxoplasma gondii was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Polymerase chain reaction analysis, in-situ hybridization and IHC confirmed systemic PCV-2 infection. These findings, associated with the respiratory signs and lesions in lymphoid tissues, are characteristic for post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). In this case, immunosuppression by PCV-2 may have triggered systemic toxoplasmosis, or immune stimulation caused by coinfection with T. gondii may have caused extensive replication of PCV-2.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.030071005,-0.00178517,-0.028906996,-0.136813016,-0.022373502,0.030245443,0.011510643,-0.00069613,0.004072789,-0.015805483,0.046525026,-0.011599069,-0.011642978,0.010714333,0.053801854,-0.029295408,-0.016029907,0.010987626,-0.038420548,0.052679881,-0.000237772,-0.011835842,-0.032136477,-0.043727182,0.050301334,-0.016588039,-0.064422148,0.006743222,-0.012658529,-0.05384387
Rhinitis and Meningitis in Two Shelter Cats Caused by Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus,"Summary In the past 6 years there have been increasing reports describing outbreaks of a severe fatal respiratory disease associated with Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus (SEZ) in dogs maintained in shelters, research facilities and kennels. Although SEZ appears to be an emerging pathogen of dogs kept in intensively housed environments, this bacterium has not been reported as a cause of death in intensively housed cats. This report describes fatal SEZ infection in two adult cats housed in separate animal shelter facilities. Both cats had acute onset of illness, which progressed to death in less than 24h. Post-mortem examination revealed rhinitis and meningitis and SEZ was demonstrated in the nasal cavity and brain. Polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis of a 500 base pair region of the 16S rRNA gene confirmed the identity of the bacterium.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.00703469,-0.012727762,0.01833952,-0.149291,0.021725187,0.030711891,0.015963385,0.002529221,-0.006873566,-0.077435756,0.18524001,-0.0615647,0.109261293,-0.086754878,-0.034194285,-0.037946336,-0.009296251,-0.005324827,-0.002022838,0.034826701,0.062352874,-0.003523084,-0.036248953,-0.009204836,0.05434025,-0.028200499,-0.067745137,0.033135441,0.017261277,-0.01355592
Pathology and Tissue Distribution of Turkey Coronavirus in Experimentally Infected Chicks and Turkey Poults,"Summary Twenty 1-day-old specific pathogen free chicks and 20 1-day-old commercially derived turkey poults were inoculated with a Brazilian strain of turkey coronavirus (TCoV) to study the pathogenicity and virus distribution up to 14 days post-inoculation by histopathology, immunohistochemistry, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. At 2–14 dpi, TCoV antigens were detected in the paranasal sinus and lachrymal accessory gland (Harderian gland) of infected chicks and in the ileum, ileocaecal junction and caecum of infected poults. Lymphocytic inflammation was present in these tissues. TCoV was re-isolated from pooled tissue suspensions of nasal concha, Harderian gland and paranasal sinus from chicks, as well as from the ileum, ileocaecal junction and caecum of poults, after three consecutive passages in 28-day-old embryonated turkey eggs. Viral RNA corresponding to the spike gene region (1178–2073 genome position) was amplified from the upper respiratory tract of chickens and from the intestinal tract of poults and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the identity as TCoV. This is the first description of TCoV antigens and mRNA in upper respiratory tissues in experimentally infected chickens.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.020022579,-0.023774392,0.013510409,-0.091743477,0.06054059,0.006363245,-0.05199096,-0.032060407,0.044028462,0.035348332,0.028786334,-0.017872258,-0.004907463,0.019990594,0.033710624,0.006297161,-0.003147707,-0.010460438,0.006991531,-0.005039897,-0.00678747,-0.020542802,-0.004147215,-0.022994401,0.01492503,0.005227967,-0.040279525,-0.010114434,0.005863169,0.006367363
An Investigation of the Pathology and Pathogens Associated with Porcine Respiratory Disease Complex in Denmark,"Summary Respiratory infections are among the most important diseases of growing pigs. In order to elucidate the multifactorial aetiology of porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) in Denmark, lungs from 148 finishing pigs with cranioventral bronchopneumonia (case group) and 60 pigs without lung lesions (control group) were collected from abattoirs. The pathogens involved in PRDC and their interactions were identified and linked to the histopathological diagnosis. The lung samples were cultured for bacteria and tested by multiplex polymerase chain reaction for presence of swine influenza virus (type A), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (both European and US type), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), porcine respiratory coronavirus, porcine cytomegalovirus, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Mycoplasma hyorhinis. All cases had cranioventral lobular bronchopneumonia consistent with PRDC. There was a broad range of microscopical lesions and the cases were characterized as acute (n =10), subacute (n =24) or chronic (n =114) bronchopneumonia. Five bacterial species, five viruses and two Mycoplasma spp. were detected in different combinations. PCV2, M. hyopneumoniae, M. hyorhinis and Pasteurella multocida were detected most frequently among the PRDC affected swine and the diversity and number of pathogens were higher in these animals compared with controls. No clear-cut associations were detected between pathogens and histological lesions or histopathological diagnoses. PRDC occurs more frequently than enzootic pneumonia among Danish finishing pigs and has complex and varied histopathology.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.094706703,-0.039023084,0.000232229,-0.060537657,0.040994821,0.038895185,0.0257494,0.002122336,-0.047082193,0.026204136,0.027646689,-0.007985923,-0.041276024,-0.003217318,0.159146512,-0.12056665,-0.011948103,-0.040967474,-0.00548812,0.077393157,-0.05277272,-0.008949558,0.046870272,-0.027150335,0.064304248,0.004697192,-0.081963931,0.021453147,0.019205168,-0.098415029
A Histopathological Study of Bovine Ganglia,"Summary One hundred and sixty-eight ganglia from 54 cattle aged 10 days to 10 years were examined microscopically. Samples from six autonomic ganglia and one sensory ganglion were represented. Thirteen animals were clinically normal and 41 were submitted for post-mortem examination. Neuronal vacuolation, spheroid formation, lipofuscin accumulation and central chromatolysis were observed sporadically and were of varying magnitude. Neuronal vacuolation and spheroid formation were not age-related changes, while lipofuscin accumulation was more common in older animals and central chromatolysis was more common in younger cattle. Non-suppurative inflammation and neuronophagia were also common findings (23 out of 54 animals, 42.6%) in autonomic ganglia that did not contain herpesvirus DNA as determined by polymerase chain reaction. Renaut bodies, features of peripheral nerves, were most commonly noted in the vagus. None of the histopathological findings were related to any particular disease in which loss of autonomic nervous system function might be expected.

Enteric Colonization by Staphylococcus delphini in Four Ferret Kits with Diarrhoea,"Summary Four, 1-to 4-week-old ferret kits were submitted to the Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health at Michigan State University for post-mortem examination. Grossly, multiple bowel loops in all ferret kits were distended by mucoid faecal material. Microscopically, there was no evidence of inflammation or notable alteration to the normal mucosal morphology. Gram-positive coccoid bacteria colonized variable segments of the small intestine. These bacteria were identified as Staphylococcus delphini by phenotypic and molecular analyses. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of Staphylococcus enterotoxins was positive and polymerase chain reaction detected the gene for Staphylococcus enterotoxin E in the isolates. The hypersecretory diarrhoea in these ferret kits may have been associated with colonization of the small intestine by S. delphini, cultures of which were shown in vitro to be potentially capable of producing enterotoxin E. The condition described in these ferrets is similar to ‘sticky’ kit syndrome in mink.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.007689922,0.003161836,0.043991218,-0.082872662,0.000920981,0.01132159,0.023254958,0.005576173,-0.016970104,-0.006317863,0.003978317,0.004812818,-0.002334559,-0.035801116,0.019099547,-0.022550457,-0.008539744,-0.015897816,-0.015720602,-0.018290903,0.002827954,-0.003522941,0.026339541,-0.01238523,0.00586443,-0.008275991,-0.021875736,-0.005495076,0.016085171,-0.028591482
Neospora caninum: the First Demonstration of the Enteroepithelial Stages in the Intestines of a Naturally Infected Dog,"Summary A 1.5-month-old Kangal breed puppy from a dairy cattle farm died after showing severe diarrhoea and incoordination. Necropsy examination revealed multifocal pulmonary consolidation and necrosis and fibrinohaemorrhagic enteritis. Microscopically, there was necrotic and purulent bronchopneumonia, myocarditis and non-purulent encephalitis. In the jejunum and ileum there was villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia with oocyst-like and schizont-like structures in the epithelia. Immunohistochemically, Neospora caninum antigen was detected in association with the intestinal protozoal structures, degenerative neurons and areas of necrosis in the lungs and heart. Polymerase chain reaction confirmed that the organism was N. caninum and not Toxoplasma gondii. The seroprevalence for N. caninum was 74.2% (49/66 animals) for the cattle and 57.1% (4/7 animals) for dogs on this farm. This report documents fatal systemic neosporosis and enteroepithelial stages of N. caninum in a naturally infected puppy.

An Outbreak of Fatal Bordetella bronchiseptica Bronchopneumonia in Puppies,"Summary Twenty-two newborn puppies that did not receive colostrum exhibited acute respiratory signs and died at a breeding facility. Pathological examinations were performed on four of the puppies. At necropsy examination, the lungs were firm and mottled dark red, consistent with acute bronchopneumonia. Histopathologically, there was marked infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the bronchi and alveoli, and gram-negative coccobacilli were attached diffusely to the cilia of bronchial mucosa. Immunohistochemistry for Bordetella bronchiseptica antigen revealed positive labelling of the bacterial agents. On electron microscopy, a large number of coccobacilli were observed attaching to the cilia of bronchial epithelial cells. Real-time polymerase chain reaction amplified a B. bronchiseptica gene from the affected lung tissue. Based on these findings, the four puppies were diagnosed with fatal B. bronchiseptica bronchopneumonia.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.00295517,-0.001834856,0.018868119,-0.102963824,-0.025515327,0.020584977,-0.001233237,-0.014778548,0.00793685,-0.015274308,0.001739633,-0.015508209,-0.002946015,0.012972038,0.037931193,-0.005218307,-0.005468538,-0.028392159,-0.001065522,-0.0249693,0.045311387,0.000970394,-0.013760132,-0.048993884,0.02425752,0.001136447,-0.058008402,0.021424891,0.005246398,-0.043760195
Detection of nucleic acids of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in the lungs of naturally infected piglets as determined by in-situ hybridization,"Summary Replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was studied in formalin-fixed paraffin wax-embedded lung tissues from seven naturally infected piglets by in-situ hybridization with a non-radioactive digoxigenin-labelled probe. A 433 base pair cDNA probe for the viral RNA encoding the nucleocapsid proteins of a Korean PRRSV isolate was generated by the polymerase chain reaction. All seven piglets infected with PRRSV showed a distinct, positive signal, scattered throughout the alveolar septa and spaces. Positive cells typically exhibited dark brown staining deposits in the cytoplasm without background staining. In-situ hybridization demonstrated that PRRSV replicated primarily in interstitial and alveolar macrophages, and occasionally in type 2 pneumocytes. The bronchial or bronchiolar epithelium did not exhibit a hybridization signal for PRRSV nucleic acids. The anterior and middle lobes of the lung were more reliable than the caudal or accessory lobes for the detection of PRRSV nucleic acids. The in-situ hybridization technique used was rapid, specific and sensitive, and may prove useful for the diagnosis of PRRSV infection in routinely fixed and processed tissues.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.063865733,-0.008946671,0.04722657,-0.060912218,-0.036368609,0.002965043,-0.017504985,-0.023229458,0.036904709,-0.003257123,-0.017570708,-0.041649158,-0.003867235,0.041459455,0.110682777,-0.079610259,0.016684206,-0.044181909,-0.03628153,0.073669628,-0.065880671,-0.022547011,0.04578392,-0.102318616,0.032827676,0.053174381,-0.036532112,-0.01173051,-0.121967276,0.067022997
Comparative analysis of selected genes from Diachasmimorpha longicaudata entomopoxvirus and other poxviruses,"Abstract The Diachasmimorpha longicaudata entomopoxvirus (DlEPV) is the first symbiotic EPV described from a parasitic wasp. The DlEPV is introduced into the tephritid fruit fly larval host along with the wasp egg at oviposition. We sequenced a shotgun genomic library of the DlEPV DNA and analyzed and compared the predicted protein sequences of eight ORFs with those of selected poxviruses and other organisms. BlastP searches showed that five of these are homologous to poxvirus putative proteins such as metalloprotease, a putative membrane protein, late transcription factor-3, virion surface protein, and poly (A) polymerase (PAP) regulatory small subunit. Three of these are similar to those of other organisms such as the gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) of Arabidopsis thaliana, eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) of Caenorhabditis briggsae and lambda phage integrase ( λ -Int) of Enterococcus faecium. Transcription motifs for early (TGA,A/T,XXXXA) or late (TAAATG, TAAT, or TAAAT) gene expression conserved in poxviruses were identified with those ORFs. Phylogenetic analysis of multiple alignments of five ORFs and 20 poxvirus homologous sequences and of a concatenate of multiple alignments suggested that DlEPV probably diverged from the ancestral node between the fowlpox virus and the genus B, lepidopteran and orthopteran EPVs, to which Amsacta moorei and Melanoplus sanguinipes EPV, respectively, belong. The DlEPV putative GGT, eIF4A, and λ -Int contained many conserved domains that typified these proteins. These homologues may be involved in either viral pathogenicity or enhancing parasitism via the gamma-glutamyl cycle and compensation of eIF4A levels in the parasitized fly, or via the integration of a portion of the viral genome into the wasp and/or parasitized fly.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.141929653,-0.051126615,-0.013143847,-0.058954335,0.032277434,-0.001305608,-0.028335371,-0.017581028,0.019563371,-0.02784572,-0.115714598,-0.032469724,0.029544317,-0.0397571,-0.068111673,-0.074755767,0.075111969,-0.044412453,-0.015648619,0.025142484,-0.029477834,0.031562813,-0.057566055,-0.016801354,-0.005780457,0.001841088,0.021118729,-0.018981701,-0.007328504,0.021356191
Association of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 gene A/G polymorphism and elevated blood pressure in Chinese patients with metabolic syndrome,"To establish whether angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene A/G single nucleotide polymorphism is associated with hypertension in Chinese patients with metabolic syndrome. The study was conducted in 353 patients with metabolic syndrome. The alleles of the ACE2 A/G polymorphism, which is located on the X chromosome, were detected using polymerase chain reaction and subsequent cleavage by Alu I restriction endonuclease. G allele frequencies in patients with metabolic syndrome were 36.6% in female subjects and 43.4% in male subjects, respectively. Female patients with metabolic syndrome who carry the GG genotype had a significantly higher diastolic blood pressure compared with other genotypes. Multivariate logistic regression showed that female gender (P = 0.019) and carrying only the G allele (odds ratio 2.83 [95% CI 1.36 to 5.91]; P = 0.005) were significantly associated with increased diastolic blood pressure. It is concluded that the ACE2 A/G polymorphism is associated with hypertension in patients with metabolic syndrome.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.045800947,0.006563571,-0.052685373,-0.148890903,-0.034694998,-0.009732391,-0.040402057,0.027104309,-0.081744928,-0.027847261,-0.031075602,0.05883005,-0.030177478,0.021088609,-0.065995434,0.037264079,-0.020505151,-0.013498228,-0.003221916,-0.009743854,-0.004171982,-0.040026867,0.014041812,0.052677446,-0.022887327,-0.03384115,-0.007894174,-0.100067246,-0.044049801,-0.016686981
The Palm Subdomain-based Active Site is Internally Permuted in Viral RNA-dependent RNA Polymerases of an Ancient Lineage,"Abstract Template-dependent polynucleotide synthesis is catalyzed by enzymes whose core component includes a ubiquitous αβ palm subdomain comprising A, B and C sequence motifs crucial for catalysis. Due to its unique, universal conservation in all RNA viruses, the palm subdomain of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) is widely used for evolutionary and taxonomic inferences. We report here the results of elaborated computer-assisted analysis of newly sequenced replicases from Thosea asigna virus (TaV) and the closely related Euprosterna elaeasa virus (EeV), insect-specific ssRNA+ viruses, which revise a capsid-based classification of these viruses with tetraviruses, an Alphavirus-like family. The replicases of TaV and EeV do not have characteristic methyltransferase and helicase domains, and include a putative RdRp with a unique C–A–B motif arrangement in the palm subdomain that is also found in two dsRNA birnaviruses. This circular motif rearrangement is a result of migration of ∼22 amino acid (aa) residues encompassing motif C between two internal positions, separated by ∼110aa, in a conserved region of ∼550aa. Protein modeling shows that the canonical palm subdomain architecture of poliovirus (ssRNA+) RdRp could accommodate the identified sequence permutation through changes in backbone connectivity of the major structural elements in three loop regions underlying the active site. This permutation transforms the ferredoxin-like β1αAβ2β3αBβ4 fold of the palm subdomain into the β2β3β1αAαBβ4 structure and brings β-strands carrying two principal catalytic Asp residues into sequential proximity such that unique structural properties and, ultimately, unique functionality of the permuted RdRps may result. The permuted enzymes show unprecedented interclass sequence conservation between RdRps of true ssRNA+ and dsRNA viruses and form a minor, deeply separated cluster in the RdRp tree, implying that other, as yet unidentified, viruses may employ this type of RdRp. The structural diversification of the palm subdomain might be a major event in the evolution of template-dependent polynucleotide polymerases in the RNA–protein world.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.171753956,-0.041595641,-0.058222138,0.07752893,0.034079345,-0.036442272,0.031731673,0.024987092,-0.060329711,0.024365616,0.042369171,0.113558342,-0.051819427,-0.110187419,-0.055639066,-0.064903253,0.067611406,-0.040504388,-0.042112833,-0.045293658,0.045065712,-0.040266107,0.003975259,-0.012819351,-0.014312317,0.032326229,-0.007554992,0.025631779,0.024048915,-0.017491067
Respiratory Viruses in Laryngeal Croup of Young Children,"Objectives To determine the viral cause of laryngeal croup by use of highly sensitive methods, and including recently recognized viruses in the analysis. Study design One hundred forty-four consecutive children with hoarse voice and inspiratory stridor attending the emergency department were enrolled. Age- and season-matched children presenting with a wheezing illness served as control subjects (n = 76). Nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction for rhinovirus and enterovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), influenza A and B virus, human bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Results Virus infection was documented in 80% of patients with croup and 71% of control subjects. Children with croup had significantly more positive test results for PIV 1 and 2 (31% vs 4% and 6% vs 0%, respectively) and significantly fewer positive test results for RSV (15% vs 28%) than wheezing children. Rhinoviruses and enteroviruses were present equally in both groups (21% vs 25%). There was no significant difference in the frequency of influenza A virus or human bocavirus. Few subjects with adenovirus or M. pneumoniae were detected. Conclusion Acute laryngeal croup is most often associated with PIV, RSV, rhinovirus, and enterovirus. Rhinovirus and enterovirus appeared equally often in croup and in wheezing illness. During late fall, they were found in 39% and 40%, respectively, of the tested samples.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.237169046,-0.14659792,-0.08812626,0.052595198,0.043902875,-0.052422376,0.011237039,-0.080542436,0.038802409,-0.040930762,0.008546545,-0.06378974,-0.073297407,-0.042688335,-0.015567672,-0.003938917,-0.013373901,-0.032635405,0.026681245,-0.027806038,-0.029526565,-0.002357116,0.057965098,0.032534094,0.015353516,0.006237208,0.079325108,0.086754637,-0.020822477,0.021564245
Outbreak of Necrotizing Enterocolitis Caused by Norovirus in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit,"Objectives To investigate an outbreak of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and to identify the etiology, describe illness risk factors, and develop control measures. Study design A retrospective case-control study was performed including newborns with NEC and newborns without NEC, examining demographic factors and exposures to medications, staff members, and procedures before illness. Stool samples from affected newborns were collected and tested for bacteria, parasites, and viruses. Results We confirmed a NEC outbreak in the NICU in January 1998 with 8 cases, including 2 deaths, clustered in time and space. Norovirus-like particles were identified in all available stools from cases; norovirus (NoV) was confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 4 of 6 samples. NEC cases were younger, had lower Apgar scores, and received antibiotics longer than 25 control subjects. Three NICU health care personnel had more contact with cases than control subjects; 1 staff member recalled having gastroenteritis symptoms around the time of the outbreak. Conclusions This report associates NoV with NEC. NoV appeared to precipitate NEC in predisposed infants. Spatial clustering and epidemiologic links between cases and a health care worker with gastroenteritis suggests that NoV should be investigated among the etiologies of NEC outbreaks and that interventions targeted to interruption of NoV transmission should be considered.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.076581997,0.007300745,-0.014598784,-0.083968888,-0.003238643,0.02616973,-0.001173157,0.053155182,-0.010552614,-0.02850779,0.029709381,0.047576148,-0.05590975,-0.086427404,0.05786589,0.01364145,-0.031976002,-0.002770408,0.015747777,-0.013515093,-0.000195728,0.041103855,-0.140603951,-0.011469427,0.021851261,0.008761886,0.018114164,0.058260057,-0.010924203,-0.020740854
Respiratory Pathogens in Children with and without Respiratory Symptoms,"Objectives To investigate the occurrence of respiratory pathogens in samples from children with and without respiratory symptoms and to identify whether age and/ or coinfections modify the impact of respiratory pathogens on symptoms. Study design In a prospective longitudinal study, 18 children were sampled biweekly for respiratory pathogens, irrespective of respiratory symptoms. Polymerase chain reaction was performed for 13 respiratory pathogens. Episodes were defined “asymptomatic” if no symptoms of any respiratory tract illness were present between 1 week before and 1 week after sampling. Results A total of 230 samples were collected. In 56% of the symptomatic episodes, a pathogen was detected, compared with 40% of the asymptomatic episodes (P = .03). Rhinovirus and coronaviruses were most prevalent in both symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes. In the youngest children, 9% of the pathogen-positive episodes were asymptomatic, compared with 36% in the oldest children (P = .01). Multiple pathogens were found in 17% of the symptomatic episodes and in 3% of the asymptomatic episodes (P = .02). Conclusions Respiratory pathogens are frequently detected in samples from children with no respiratory symptoms. Symptomatic cases occurred more often in younger children and with detections of more than 1 respiratory pathogen.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.238961043,-0.101581412,-0.090540779,-0.000267634,0.076076206,-0.136081733,0.081326283,-0.062011194,0.090091779,0.021087037,0.021802571,-0.038208338,-0.020074929,-0.077625214,0.064619258,-0.005206907,-0.016294855,-0.109541208,0.086459883,-0.05352608,-0.054777869,-0.019183186,-0.0447616,0.007154426,0.065068447,0.069598762,-0.054431101,0.039723355,0.094588378,-0.087121326
Association of Human Metapneumovirus with Radiologically Diagnosed Community-Acquired Alveolar Pneumonia in Young Children,"Objectives To determine the involvement of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in childhood community-acquired alveolar pneumonia (CAAP) and compare the demographic, clinical, and laboratory features of HMPV-associated CAAP and CAAP associated with other respiratory viruses. Study design Nasopharyngeal wash specimens obtained prospectively over a 4-year period from children age < 5 years evaluated in the emergency department with radiologically diagnosed CAAP and from healthy controls were tested for HMPV by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, influenza and parainfluenza viruses by direct immunofluorescence and culture. Results HMPV was detected in 108 of 1296 patients (8.3%) versus RSV in 23.1%, adenovirus in 3.4%, influenza A virus in 2.9%, and parainfluenza viruse in 2.9%. During the period of peak activity (November to May), HMPV was detected in 95 of 1017 patients (9.3%) and in 3 of 136 controls (2.2%) (P = .005). The patients with HMPV were older than those with RSV (P < .001) with a more common history of acute otitis media requiring tympanocentesis (P = .032), wheezing (P = .001) and gastrointestinal symptoms (P < .001) and a lower hospitalization rate (P = .005). Conclusions The high detection rate suggests an important role for HMPV in childhood CAAP.

Viral Respiratory Tract Infections in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: The VIRIoN-I Study,"Objective To determine the frequency of respiratory viral infections among infants who were evaluated for late-onset sepsis in the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) of Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Texas; and Women & Infants Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island. Study design Prospective cohort study conducted from January 15, 2012 to January 31, 2013. Infants in the NICU were enrolled if they were inborn, had never been discharged home, and were evaluated for sepsis (at >72 hours of age) and antibiotic therapy was initiated. Infants had a nasopharyngeal specimen collected for detection of respiratory viruses by multiplex polymerase chain reaction within 72 hours of the initiation of antibiotic therapy. Their medical records were reviewed for demographic, clinical, radiographic, and laboratory data until NICU discharge. Results During the 13-month study, 8 of 100 infants, or 8 (6%) of the 135 sepsis evaluations, had a respiratory virus detected by polymerase chain reaction (2, enterovirus/rhinovirus; 2, rhinovirus; 2, coronaviruses; and 2, parainfluenza-3 virus). By bivariate analysis, the infants with viral detection were older (41 vs 11 days; P = .007), exposed to individuals with respiratory tract viral symptoms (37% vs 2%; P = .003), tested for respiratory viruses by provider (75% vs 11%; P < .001), and had lower total neutrophil counts (P = .02). In multivariate regression analysis, the best predictor of viral infection was the caregivers' clinical suspicion of viral infection (P = .006). Conclusions A total of 8% of infants, or 6% of all NICU sepsis evaluations, had a respiratory virus detected when evaluated for bacterial sepsis. These findings argue for more respiratory viral testing of infants with suspected sepsis using optimal molecular assays to establish accurate diagnoses, prevent transmission, and inform antibiotic stewardship efforts.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.162902177,-0.072213873,-0.058674202,-0.003691854,-0.00571525,-0.064773519,0.045480744,0.0102918,0.02574516,0.037038026,0.00360833,-0.03621406,-0.009452985,-0.034939675,0.061157267,0.033802467,0.037752256,-0.046964253,0.07611284,0.000560316,-0.043828334,-0.105511191,-0.08408857,-0.009202561,0.080328819,-0.029501269,0.02331116,-0.007767315,-0.004378036,-0.065487015

"Polymerase chain reaction–based detection of rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and coronavirus in otitis media with effusion","Abstract Objectives: To study the association of human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human coronavirus infections in children aged 6 months to 12 years with otitis media with effusion (OME). To determine how long HRV RNA can be detected after HRV infection. Methods: Middle ear effusion (MEE) samples collected at the time of tympanostomy tube placement from 100 children with OME were examined. Viral RNA was detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. For HRV the results were compared with virus isolation in cell culture. In vitro studies of the persistence of HRV infectivity and RNA were conducted by combining ~105 median cell culture infectious doses of HRV with pooled MEE at 37°C and assaying serial samples for 12 weeks. Results: Virus RNA was detected in 30 children. HRV was detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 19 children with OME and by virus isolation in 5 children. RSV RNA was found in 8 and HCV in 3 children with OME. No dual viral infection was found. Bacterial pathogens were isolated from 35 MEE samples and were associated with viral RNA in 11 cases, most often with HRV (9 cases). Under in vitro conditions, HRV culture positivity declined rapidly (<2 days), but RNA was detectable for up to 8 weeks. Conclusions: These results suggest that virus infection, particularly HRV infection, either alone or concurrent with bacteria, is present in a larger percentage of children with OME than previously suspected. It remains to be determined how often the presence of viral RNA in MEE represents persistent RNA, ongoing viral replication, or recurrent infection.

Ultrafiltration attenuates cardiopulmonary bypass–induced acute lung injury in a canine model of single-lung transplantation,"Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass and ultrafiltration on graft function in a canine single-lung transplantation model. Methods Fifteen left single-lung transplantations were done in weight-mismatched canine pairs. The animals were divided into 3 groups: group 1, in which transplantation was done without cardiopulmonary bypass; group 2, in which transplantation was done with cardiopulmonary bypass and in which the cardiopulmonary bypass flow was decreased slowly with controlled pulmonary artery pressure; and group 3, in which transplantation was done with cardiopulmonary bypass and ultrafiltration. Hemodynamic parameters and lung function were monitored for 6 hours after reperfusion. The grafts were harvested for histologic studies, myeloperoxidase assay, and real-time quantitive reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction of mRNA encoding interleukin 6. Results The hemodynamic parameters were similar among the 3 groups. In group 1 Pao 2 and alveolar to arterial gradient for O2 levels were excellent throughout the 6-hour observation period, but in group 2 they progressively deteriorated. However, ultrafiltration significantly (P = .02) improved the Pao 2 level in group 3. On histology, interstitial edema and polynuclear cell infiltration were most marked in group 2 and significantly worse than in groups 1 and 3. Myeloperoxidase assay and real-time quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction showed increased myeloperoxidase activity and interleukin 6 gene expression in group 2 grafts compared with group 1 grafts. Myeloperoxidase activity and interleukin 6 gene expression were suppressed with ultrafiltration. Conclusions Cardiopulmonary bypass had negative effects on the graft, but ultrafiltration attenuated acute lung dysfunction by reducing the inflammatory response.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.014903623,-0.005900513,0.02195851,-0.12819033,-0.023656116,0.011702423,0.014801251,-0.027469408,-0.016115559,-0.06088264,-0.030032605,-0.015002301,-0.069659713,0.059642674,-0.027715577,-0.011718657,-0.004886227,-0.028388213,0.018315715,-0.015068062,0.047019358,-0.071199827,-0.018820309,-0.01235949,-0.021889358,-0.059017436,-0.009560365,-0.030460848,-0.012158367,-0.030532201
Luteolin suppresses inflammation-associated gene expression by blocking NF-κB and AP-1 activation pathway in mouse alveolar macrophages,"Abstract Luteolin, a plant flavonoid, has potent anti-inflammatory properties both in vitro and in vivo. However, the molecular mechanism of luteolin-mediated immune modulation has not been fully understood. In this study, we examined the effects of luteolin on the production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), as well as the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in mouse alveolar macrophage MH-S and peripheral macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. Luteolin dose-dependently inhibited the expression and production of these inflammatory genes and mediators in macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Semi-quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay further confirmed the suppression of LPS-induced TNF- α, IL-6, iNOS and COX-2 gene expression by luteolin at a transcriptional level. Luteolin also reduced the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in LPS-activated macrophages. Moreover, luteolin blocked the degradation of IκB-α and nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 subunit. In addition, luteolin significantly inhibited the LPS-induced DNA binding activity of activating protein-1 (AP-1). We also found that luteolin attenuated the LPS-mediated protein kinase B (Akt) and IKK phosphorylation, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In sum, these data suggest that, by blocking NF-κB and AP-1 activation, luteolin acts to suppress the LPS-elicited inflammatory events in mouse alveolar macrophages, and this effect was mediated, at least in part, by inhibiting the generation of reactive oxygen species. Our observations suggest a possible therapeutic application of this agent for treating inflammatory disorders in lung.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.07862413,-0.018849677,0.020713352,-0.120376627,-0.083560953,0.048772586,0.035629127,-0.043074777,0.04945583,-0.067348334,-0.058233552,-0.012464864,-0.031249082,0.081377125,-0.03533558,0.026353566,0.008325756,-0.048220519,-0.033395305,-0.054679236,0.02883725,-0.039349229,0.031549157,-1.90E-05,-0.007005947,-0.003668951,-0.00120523,0.041042781,0.062089754,-0.04639087
Molecular diagnosis of respiratory viruses,"Summary The increasing availability of nucleic acid amplification tests since the 1980s has revolutionised our understanding of the pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory aspects of known and novel viral respiratory pathogens. High-throughput, multiplex polymerase chain reaction is the most commonly used qualitative detection method, but utilisation of newer techniques such as next-generation sequencing will become more common following significant cost reductions. Rapid and readily accessible isothermal amplification platforms have also allowed molecular diagnostics to be used in a ‘point-of-care’ format.

Epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infection in a large teaching hospital in Singapore,"Summary Aims We undertook this study to define the incidence of toxigenic Clostridium difficile in our hospital and to characterise the isolates. Methods All unformed stool was tested for the presence of Toxin A (TcdA) and Toxin B (TcdB), and cultured for C. difficile. Culture filtrates were also tested for TcdA and TcdB. Detection of tcdA and tcdB genes was carried out for A2B+ strains by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of metronidazole, vancomycin and clindamycin for all isolates were tested using the Etest. PCR ribotyping was carried out on all isolates. Results The incidence of Clostridium difficile associated disease (CDAD) was 3.2 cases per 1000 admissions or discharges and 53.8 cases per 100000 patient days. Most cases occurred in renal and haematology patients. CDAD was more common in patients aged over 50 years and of male gender. The Indian population was under-represented. Fourteen (11.8%) isolates were A-B+. All strains were susceptible to metronidazole but one strain showed intermediate resistance to vancomycin. Only 12.8% of the isolates were susceptible to clindamycin. Thirty-five isolates had PCR ribotype A, of which 29 (83%) had a clindamycin MIC >256mg/L.

A clinicopathological study of three cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),"Summary Aims The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused a large outbreak of atypical pneumonia in Beijing, China from early March 2003. We report the pathological features from three patients who died of SARS. Methods Autopsies were performed on three patients who died 9–15 days after the onset of the illness, and the clinical and laboratory features reviewed. Tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and in situ reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) on lung sections was performed using SARS coronavirus-specific primers. Results The typical gross pathological change in the lungs was diffuse haemorrhage on the lung surface. Histopathological examination revealed serous, fibrinous and haemorrhagic inflammation in most pulmonary alveoli, with capillary engorgement and some capillary microthrombosis. The pulmonary alveoli were thickened with interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, diffuse alveolar damage, desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline-membrane formation; fibrinoid material and erythrocytes were present in alveolar spaces. There were thromboemboli in some bronchial arterioles. Haemorrhagic necrosis and reduced numbers of lymphocytes were observed in lymph nodes and spleen. In situ RT–PCR detected SARS coronavirus RNA in type II alveolar cells, interstitial cells and bronchiolar epithelial cells from all three patients Conclusions Severe immunological damage in lung tissue is responsible for the clinical features of SARS.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.05181569,0.229614978,-0.098097655,-0.084145922,-0.078378357,-0.01769115,-0.088780436,-0.164657531,-0.121099194,-0.003329362,-0.013867082,-0.010741968,0.006893666,0.101256557,0.024446586,0.002013437,-0.004113139,0.026669779,-0.0415627,0.038459131,0.061789602,-0.007304986,-0.035342011,-0.021658233,-0.008053194,-0.010786961,-0.03573559,0.056794654,-0.026607317,-0.054192147
Health service impact of testing for respiratory pathogens using cartridge-based multiplex array versus molecular batch testing,"Summary There is increasing demand for access to rapid microbiological testing, with a view to improving clinical outcomes. The possibility of rapid testing has been facilitated by development of cartridge-based random access molecular technologies that are now widely available. Whether the expense of cartridge-based assays is justified in terms of clinical or laboratory cost savings is controversial. This prospective study evaluated the impact of the Biofire FilmArray Respiratory Panel (‘FilmArray’), a cartridge-based random access molecular test, compared with standard batched molecular testing using an ‘in-house’ respiratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on laboratory and health service outcomes for adult patients at a tertiary-level adult hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Laboratory result turnaround time was significantly reduced with the FilmArray (median 4.4 h) compared to a standard validated in-house respiratory PCR assay (median 21.6 h, p < 0.0001) and there was a significant increase in diagnostic yield with the Filmarray (71/124, 57.3%) compared to in-house PCR (79/200; 39.5%; p = 0.002). Despite improved result turnaround time and increased diagnostic yield from testing, there was no corresponding reduction in hospital length of stay or use of isolation beds. Although cartridge-based molecular testing reduced turnaround time to result for respiratory pathogen testing, it did not impact on health service outcomes such as hospital length of stay. Further work is warranted to determine whether cartridge-based tests at the point of care can improve clinical and health service impacts.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.106740425,0.027859122,0.069696439,-0.010555952,-0.07471019,-0.013384287,0.005484369,0.061982371,-0.022813078,0.049150242,-0.034576859,0.004986841,0.051306617,-0.061461942,-0.001901311,0.001612989,-0.010063077,0.015854374,-0.015923841,-0.075940832,0.038452784,-0.081237028,0.028720434,-0.125490313,-0.016193454,-0.020902517,0.000674774,-0.071760268,0.004381666,0.002278594
Effect of experimental Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale infection along with live infectious bronchitis vaccination in broiler chickens,"ABSTRACT Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT), a bacterium causing respiratory tract infection, has led to a significant problem in the intensive poultry production in Egypt. Polymerase chain reaction-amplified 784-bp specific ORT DNA fragments were found in 7 ORT isolates from lungs, air sacs, and tracheas of commercial broilers or layers in Egypt in 2015. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of the live variant IBV 4/91 with ORT infection. A total of 120 14-d-old broiler chickens (Cobb 500) were equally divided into 4 groups for experimental infection in a complete randomized design. Group 1 was infected with ORT strain and live infectious bronchitis vaccine (IBV 4/91) simultaneously; group 2 was infected with the bacterial strain alone; group 3 was vaccinated only with IBV 4/91, and group 4 was the non-vaccinated and non-infected control group. The respiratory signs, post-mortem lesions (tracheitis and pneumonia) and histopathological findings of lungs, trachea, and air sacs in the experimentally infected broiler chickens appeared to be more prominent in the chickens of group 1 than group 2. With respect to body weight, weight gain, feed conversion rate, and Ornithobacterium re-isolation, there was a difference (P ≤ 0.05) among the chickens of group 1 and the other groups. This reveals that the use of live infectious bronchitic vaccines, which is a common practice in the local Egyptian field of production, may concomitantly increase the pathogenicity of ORT in broiler chickens.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.010451807,-0.035592953,0.032641379,-0.153824479,0.104365033,0.068513918,-0.086993899,-0.059794877,0.046711162,0.197354241,0.07461633,-0.007167726,-0.086317019,0.02606137,-0.073107195,0.093010297,-0.02089316,0.00936309,0.015313531,0.061363897,-0.055182792,-0.053304762,-0.003494673,-0.046246653,0.006888611,-0.016108941,-0.060507666,-0.017615844,-0.032119836,-0.018045723
Simultaneous and visual detection of infectious bronchitis virus and Newcastle disease virus by multiple LAMP and lateral flow dipstick,"ABSTRACT Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are both important viruses seriously affecting poultry industry worldwide. In this study, reverse-transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) was combined with lateral flow dipstick (LFD) forming a novel detection tool which could simultaneously detect IBV and NDV visually. Primers targeted the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of IBV genome and the conserved region of NDV large polymerase gene (LP). The specificity and sensitivity of this multiple reverse transcription-LAMP-LFD (mRT-LAMP-LFD) assay were compared with those of conventional RT-PCR, nested RT-PCR (nRT-PCR), quantification RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and RT-LAMP monitored by electrophoresis. No non-specific amplifications were observed when the assays were tested with unrelated viruses. According to the sensitivity study, when detecting IBV or NDV alone, the lowest detection limits of mRT-LAMP-LFD were 100.8 IBV RNA copies/reaction and 100.7 NDV RNA copies/reaction. Furthermore, when detecting IBV and NDV simultaneously, the lowest detection limit was the same as that of the single detection assays. In the clinical sample study, mRT-LAMP-LFD performed the best among these assays. When tested with IBV or NDV single infected samples, the mean detection rates were 98.65% and 97.25%, respectively. In the IBV and NDV co-infected sample study, the mean detection rates of IBV and NDV were both 95%. This study showed that mRT-LAMP-LFD was a promising qualitative detection tool suitable for field single or multiple IBV and NDV detection.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.000459512,0.060030777,0.278703492,0.039498038,0.078653923,-0.026247999,-0.114246008,-0.068603062,0.059348603,0.187944005,0.035609205,0.027404241,-0.097728358,0.088489677,-0.169735946,0.153561583,0.05546792,0.017007623,-0.032036858,0.036765351,-0.11924814,-0.034066757,-0.049686015,0.099342259,0.071882095,0.039857887,-0.053785343,0.052518683,0.020319147,-0.047967653
Molecular characterization of a unique variant of avian infectious bronchitis virus in Tunisia,"ABSTRACT Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is responsible of significant economic losses for poultry industry around the world, through evolution of its pathogenicity, inadequacy of vaccines, and virus evasion. Such evasion is related to the unstable nature of its RNA, in particular the S glycoprotein encoding gene, which raises great challenges with regard to the control of the disease, along with the lack of proof reading mechanisms of the RNA polymerase. The emergence of new variants might be a reason for the endemic outbreaks that are being reported in Tunisia, in addition to poor vaccination techniques and ineffective prophylactic programs. In the present study, partial nucleotide sequences of the S1 glycoprotein gene and the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of 2 Tunisian isolates, TN1011/16 and TN1012/16, identified in 2016, were determined. Specific mutations were found in S1 gene as well as in 3′UTR region. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 nucleotide sequences showed that both isolates are closely related to the Algerian strains, and formed a common cluster within the genotype I. In addition, these isolates were non-recombinant ones, confirming that they are unique variants. Based on their S1 gene sequences, TN1011/16 and TN1012/16 strains were distant from the H120 vaccine strain, commercially used in Tunisia along with the variant vaccine 793B type (4/91). A comparison between nucleotide sequences of their 3′UTR region and S1 gene showed a difference in IBV classification. The obtained results have confirmed that the IBVsequence continues to drift and brings valuable information in relation with its evolution, vaccine development and better control of the disease.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.109429497,-0.022800873,0.057691824,-0.093934053,0.202009512,0.093781847,-0.123906414,-0.037280135,0.070315269,0.189792563,0.01950586,0.043005075,-0.050248764,-0.067604493,-0.075413054,0.016177438,-0.049614799,0.021497265,-0.019205944,0.028156324,0.043296432,-0.019123282,0.019236116,0.067284294,-0.049706254,-0.028218167,0.035041871,0.00691598,0.019654975,0.039803253
Comparative analysis on the 5′-untranslated region of bovine viral diarrhea virus isolated in Korea,"Abstract Samples of 249 bovine abortuses, one intestine, and four diarrheal stools from 254 cows were collected, and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Subsequently, virus isolation was preformed with PCR-positive samples, and then PCR product of 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of BVDV isolate was sequenced and analyzed. Among the samples collected, 20 (from 17 bovine abortuses, one intestine, and two diarrheal stools) were positive for BVDV RT-PCR; four BVDVs (from two bovine abortuses, one intestine, and one diarrheal stool) were isolated. When the four isolates were biotyped in cell culture, one BVDV isolate from a bovine abortus was cytopathic and the others were non-cytopathic. In addition, three isolates were genotyped as BVDV-1 and one isolate from a diarrheal stool as BVDV-2. In phylogenetic analysis, it suggested that the BVDV-2 isolate in Korea is closer to the North American strains than Asian strains. This is the first report on the identification and isolation of BVDV-2 in Korea.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.009470912,0.016387856,0.103244605,-0.07346329,0.05525056,0.01064749,-0.023588396,-0.020259818,-0.011350732,-0.003411549,0.03312354,0.034508901,-0.041667272,0.02385773,0.069015695,-0.038374529,0.026054479,0.016380584,0.009904181,-0.062375666,0.024898446,0.040091488,-0.02304887,0.007742612,0.033890279,0.003699273,0.024475449,-0.060187426,0.033575712,-0.003757763
"Development of an optimized protocol for the detection of classical swine fever virus in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues by seminested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and comparison with in situ hybridization","Abstract An optimized protocol was developed for the detection of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues obtained from experimentally and naturally infected pigs by seminested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results for seminested RT-PCR were compared with those determined by in situ hybridization. The results obtained show that the use of deparaffinization with xylene, digestion with proteinase K, extraction with Trizol LS, followed by seminested RT-PCR is a reliable detection method. An increase in sensitivity was observed as amplicon size decreased. The highest sensitivity for RT-PCR on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues RNA was obtained with amplicon sizes less than approximately 200 base pairs. An hybridization signal for CSFV was detected in lymph nodes from 12 experimentally and 12 naturally infected pigs. The sensitivity of seminested RT-PCR compared with in situ hybridization was 100% for CSFV.

Systemic fatal type II coronavirus infection in a dog: Pathological findings and immunohistochemistry,"Abstract A case of fatal systemic coronavirus infection is described in a 53-day-old Pekinese dog. Pathological findings and immunohistochemical identification using a monoclonal anti-canine Coronavirus antibody are included. Visceral lesions consisted of extensive fibrinopurulent bronchopneumonia, multiple renal cortical infarcts, severe coalescing centrilobular hepatic fatty change with minimal random hepatic necrosis, and multifocal splenic haemorrhage with lymphoid depletion. Moderate chronic diffuse enteritis was associated with intraluminal adult ascarids. Identification of type I and type II coronavirus in this subject had been previously confirmed by genotype-specific real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays of the intestinal contents, while only Coronavirus type II was detected in visceral organs.

Oxidative stress indices in gastroenteritis in dogs with canine parvoviral infection,"Abstract Gastroenteritis of viral origin has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in dogs during the last two decades. Amongst the viral etiologies responsible for gastroenteritis in dogs, canine parvovirus (CPV) is considered as the most pathogenic. The disease is characterized by hemorrhagic enteritis, bloody diarrhoea and myocarditis in young pups. The present study was carried out to examine alterations in oxidative stress indices in the erythrocytes from dogs suffering from gastroenteritis with or without canine parvoviral infection as confirmed by CPV-DNA amplification from faeces using specific primers for CPV-2 as well as CPV-2a and CPV-2b variants by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The present investigation utilized clinical cases of dogs with signs of acute diarrhea (n =56), and 14 more apparently healthy dogs of similar age group. Erythrocytic oxidative stress indices such as lipid peroxides level and antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase and catalase activity, and blood micro-mineral (iron, copper, cobalt and zinc) status were analyzed in each dog (n =70). The acute cases of gastroenteritis in dogs were associated with altered erythrocytic lipid peroxidation as evident by estimation of malonaldehyde (MDA) concentration. The activities of antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase, the first line of antioxidant defense against damaging effects of free radicals, were also altered. The alterations in oxidative stress indices were more pronounced in cases with involvement of canine parvovirus as compared to parvo-negative cases. Our results also revealed decreased blood zinc level in diarrhoea in dogs irrespective of involvement of canine parvovirus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.000382169,-0.006670832,0.061584618,-0.113977263,-0.002513466,0.022276356,0.034017783,-0.002230311,-0.023293479,-0.04316994,0.062551428,0.040823101,-0.040403422,-0.062766862,0.050505166,-0.026085854,-0.042486576,-0.072926993,0.110585749,0.00372389,0.201738818,0.151372774,-0.139387079,-0.049404984,0.185228339,-0.159361427,-0.126711412,-0.003257674,-0.069884219,0.100294254
Transient inhibition of foot-and-mouth disease virus replication by siRNAs silencing VP1 protein coding region,"Abstract Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is the causative agent of foot-and-mouth disease, a severe, clinically acute, vesicular disease of cloven-hoofed animals. RNA interference (RNAi) is a mechanism for silencing gene expression post-transcriptionally that is being exploited as a rapid antiviral strategy. To identify efficacious small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to inhibit the replication of FMDV, candidate siRNAs corresponding to FMDV VP1 gene were designed and synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase. In reporter assays, five siRNAs showed significant sequence-specific silencing effects on the expression of VP1-EGFP fusion protein from plasmid pVP1-EGFP-N1, which was cotransfected with siRNA into 293T cells. Furthermore, using RT-qPCR, viral titration and viability assay, we identified VP1-siRNA517, VP1-siRNA113 and VP1-siRNA519 that transiently acted as potent inhibitors of FMDV replication when BHK-21 cells were infected with FMDV. In addition, variations within multiple regions of the quasispecies of FMDV were retrospectively revealed by sequencing of FMDV genes, and a single nucleotide substitution was identified as the main factor in resistance to RNAi. Our data demonstrated that the three siRNA molecules synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase could have transient inhibitory effects on the replication of FMDV.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.125364437,-0.027091218,0.015168783,-0.021953456,-0.060038717,0.012394943,0.001411288,-0.026409666,0.037245043,-0.008882493,-0.01473428,-0.020938744,-0.015195993,0.058336101,0.017271466,-0.005446696,-0.033756049,0.023853531,0.005465839,-0.001188723,0.047631456,0.006228007,0.005955859,0.058148201,-0.022375037,0.01685875,0.044726369,0.005796255,-0.006589305,0.009772397
Experimental infection of IS/885/00-like infectious bronchitis virus in specific pathogen free and commercial broiler chicks,"Abstract Pathogenesis of an IS/885/00-like (IS/885) strain of variant infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was examined in one day old specific pathogen free (SPF) and commercial broiler chicks. Chicks were humanely euthanized at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 21 and 28days post infection (dpi) for necropsy examination, and tissues were collected for histopathology and virus detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Respiratory clinical signs and gross lesions consisting of tracheal caseous exudate and plugs, and swollen kidneys (with or without) urate deposits were observed in SPF and broiler chicks. The onset of disease developed more slowly and were of lesser severity in broiler compared to SPF chicks, reflecting the inhibitory effects of the IBV maternal-antibodies in the broiler chicks or genetic/strain susceptibility, or both.

Detection of virus particles resembling circovirus and porcine circovirus 2a (PCV2a) sequences in feces of dogs,Abstract During routine electron microscopy of fecal samples from diarrheic dogs dated from 2000 virus particles resembling circovirus in shape and size were detected in two samples (V2177/00; V3374/00). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers specific for porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) amplified DNA recovered from both samples. Sequencing of PCR amplificates (V2177/00) obtained with PCV2-specific primer pairs revealed a genome size of 1768bp. The nucleotide sequence was highly similar (98% nucleotide identity) to the PCV2a reference sequence.,0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.041975884,0.008736615,0.126829347,-0.063520869,0.089403651,-0.005814661,-0.042258422,-0.019328174,-0.01808833,-0.005581284,0.027273396,0.021497286,-0.03415546,-0.023725477,0.09585756,-0.072213228,0.000914074,-0.020542604,0.003252459,-0.069896122,0.057874649,0.046745938,-0.005154674,0.000637561,0.041301276,-0.052278844,-0.050431557,-0.015039887,-0.019145362,0.035027072
Oral Mutian®X stopped faecal feline coronavirus shedding by naturally infected cats,"Abstract Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is common among cats living indoors in groups. In about 10% of infected cats, a potentially lethal disease, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) occurs. Virus transmission is faecal-oral. Mutian® X is a product marketed to treat cats with FIP but is also being used to stop virus shedding, although no clear guidelines exist for its use for this purpose. The aim of this study was to establish the minimum dose and treatment duration required to ensure viral clearance from the faeces of asymptomatic virus-shedding cats. In five multicat households, 29 cats naturally infected with FCoV and actively shedding virus in the faeces were given Mutian X pills. Virus shedding was monitored using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) controlled for faecal inhibitors to ensure sensitivity. Mutian X given orally cleared the virus in 29 cats; although four cats required a repeated course to finally stop virus shedding. A dose of 4 mg/kg q24 h for four days was found to be the optimal treatment protocol: 2 mg/kg cleared only 80% of cats. Post-treatment using a sensitive RT-qPCR test was essential to ensure that virus clearance had been achieved, since failure to clear even one cat can result in re-infection of the others. Records of virus shedding by cats before treatment provided a retrospective control: significantly more cats stopped shedding virus after Mutian X than recovered from infection during the control period (p < .00001). This is the first report of the successful elimination of faecal FCoV shedding in chronically infected cats.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.01080832,-0.010491993,0.080308394,-0.162080913,-0.018039054,0.050010953,0.03696492,0.004012681,-0.032312826,-0.166299062,0.46448792,-0.17621216,0.241494958,-0.00951369,-0.106610613,-0.037390716,0.049693296,0.028352485,0.00751258,0.123387532,-0.057146369,-0.042181327,0.029483757,0.042491112,-0.029918907,0.051422232,0.03752736,0.018698093,0.019634408,-0.00112175
Preliminary studies on feline coronavirus distribution in naturally and experimentally infected cats,"Abstract The shedding, tissue distribution and quasispecies composition of feline coronaviruses were studied in naturally and experimentally infected cats. The infection remained subclinical, but the majority of the animals shed the virus via faeces throughout the experiment. Sequences corresponding to the viral nucleocapsid region were amplified by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction from the cortex, dura mater, pancreas, lungs, third eyelid, and the heart muscle in four cases. Interestingly, the ORF7b viral region – a supposed virulence factor – was detected in fewer organs, raising the possibility that this region can be affected by deletions during virus replication in vivo. It is demonstrated that the composition of the viral quasispecies differs between organs, and that genomic regions with different functions undergo distinct processes of selection, which should be considered during the evolution of feline coronaviruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.075540379,-0.030926376,0.005165272,-0.074107918,0.055786696,0.018855099,0.021894396,-0.007754012,-0.010459914,-0.03940261,0.166627478,-0.086294491,0.106985993,-0.001274942,-0.022362093,-0.02154769,0.009346216,-0.002128967,-0.02318003,0.072926927,-0.013133042,-0.005022747,-0.026834406,0.047257449,-0.010739191,-0.007742189,0.017609336,0.006405314,-0.021186204,0.013054455
Identification of a Noncanonical Signal for Transcription of a Novel Subgenomic mRNA of Mouse Hepatitis Virus: Implication for the Mechanism of Coronavirus RNA Transcription,"Abstract Subgenomic RNA transcription of coronaviruses involves the interaction between the leader (or antileader) and the intergenic (IG) sequences. However, it is not clear how these two sequences interact with each other. In this report, a previously unrecognized minor species of subgenomic mRNA, termed mRNA5–1, was identified in cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains JHM2c, JHM(2), JHM(3), A59, and MHV-1. Sequence analysis revealed that the leader-body fusion site of the mRNA is located at approximately 150 nucleotides (nt) downstream of the consensus IG sequence for mRNA 5 and did not have sequence homology with any known IG consensus sequences. To determine whether this sequence functions independently as a promoter, we cloned a 140-nt sequence (from ≈70 nt upstream to ≈70 nt downstream of the fusion site) from viral genomic RNA and placed it in front of a reporter gene in the defective-interfering (DI) RNA-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter vector. Transfection of the reporter RNA into MHV-infected cells resulted in synthesis of a CAT-specific subgenomic mRNA detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The strength of this promoter was similar to that of the IG7 (for mRNA 7) as measured by the CAT activity. Deletion analysis showed that the sequence as few as 13 nt was sufficient to initiate mRNA transcription, while mutations within the 13-nt abolished mRNA transcription. In vitro translation study confirmed that the envelope (E) protein was translated from mRNA5–1, which encodes the open reading frame (ORF) 5b at its 5′-end, indicating that mRNA5–1 is a functional message. Furthermore, when the ORF5b was replaced with the CAT gene and placed in the DI in the context of viral mini-genome, CAT was expressed not only from the first ORF of mRNA5–1 but also from the second and third ORF of mRNA5 and genomic DI RNA, respectively, suggesting that more than one mechanism is involved in regulation of ORF5b expression. Our findings thus support the notion that base-pairing between the leader (or antileader) and the IG is not the sole mechanism in subgenomic RNA transcription.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.253462392,-0.077563883,-0.026100898,0.00214758,0.11197581,-0.157398018,-0.247429501,0.047086416,-0.009323851,-0.140683004,-0.06589091,-0.153149652,0.087578085,0.001181891,0.057927945,0.061919081,-0.09513757,0.074820771,-0.013726227,-0.028422118,0.042458217,-0.0074625,0.022164254,0.055921039,0.036851263,-0.02769531,0.007303587,-0.005715652,0.146691801,0.001798829
Emergence of a coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus mutant with a truncated 3b gene: functional characterization of the 3b protein in pathogenesis and replication,"Abstract The subgenomic RNA 3 of IBV has been shown to be a tricistronic mRNA, encoding three products in IBV-infected cells. To explore if the least expressed ORF, ORF 3b, which encodes a nonstructural protein, is evolutionarily conserved and functionally indispensable for viral propagation in cultured cells, the Beaudette strain of IBV was propagated in chicken embryonated eggs for three passages and then adapted to a monkey kidney cell line, Vero. The 3b gene of passage 3 in embryonated eggs and passages 7, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 50, and 65 in Vero cells were amplified by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The results showed that viral RNA extracted from passages 35, 50, and 65 contained a single A insertion in a 6A stretch of the 3b gene between nucleotides 24075 and 24080, whereas the early passages carried the normal 3b gene. This insertion resulted in a frameshift event and therefore, if expressed, a C-terminally truncated protein. We showed that the frameshifting product, cloned in a plasmid, was expressed in vitro and in cells transfected with the mutant construct. The normal product of the 3b gene is 64 amino acids long, whereas the frameshifting product is 34 amino acids long with only 17 homogeneous amino acid residues at the N-terminal half. Immunofluorescent studies revealed that the normal 3b protein was localized to the nucleus and the truncated product showed a “free” distribution pattern, indicating that the C-terminal portion of 3b was responsible for its nuclear localization. Comparison of the complete genome sequences (27.6 kb) of isolates p20c22 and p36c12 (from passages 20 and 36, respectively) revealed that p36c12 contains three amino acid substitutions, two in the 195-kDa protein (encoded by gene 1) and one in the S protein, in addition to the frameshifting 3b product. Further characterization of the two isolates demonstrated that p36c12 showed growth advantage over p20c22 in both Vero cells and chicken embryos and was more virulent in chicken embryos than p20c22. These results suggest that the 3b gene product is not essential for the replication of IBV.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.161020464,-0.052289755,0.017147026,-0.096201837,0.083042157,0.005948359,-0.169121751,-0.065978443,0.08341426,0.070828132,-0.067399362,-0.025029863,-0.021713549,0.00014346,-0.094863677,-0.015564817,0.055735952,-0.013076059,0.033987373,0.024249113,-0.023276446,-0.010036866,0.02762268,-0.014194697,-0.009872894,0.07224777,0.010470943,0.005876061,-0.036516907,0.007939154
Detection of a group 2 coronavirus in dogs with canine infectious respiratory disease,"Abstract An investigation into the causes of canine infectious respiratory disease was carried out in a large rehoming kennel. Tissue samples taken from the respiratory tract of diseased dogs were tested for the presence of coronaviruses using RT–PCR with conserved primers for the polymerase gene. Sequence analysis of four positive samples showed the presence of a coronavirus with high similarity to both bovine and human coronavirus (strain OC43) in their polymerase and spike genes, whereas there was a low similarity to comparable genes in the enteric canine coronavirus. This canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCV) was detected by RT–PCR in 32/119 tracheal and 20/119 lung samples, with the highest prevalence being detected in dogs with mild clinical symptoms. Serological analysis showed that the presence of antibodies against CRCV on the day of entry into the kennel decreased the risk of developing respiratory disease.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.074293226,0.051906475,0.096825206,-0.038571077,0.171970557,-0.043168393,-0.0273699,-0.032524568,0.039117816,-0.004060332,0.04455717,0.038373023,0.055771336,0.030698683,0.05449969,-0.089114048,0.031650483,-0.04274697,0.087406553,-0.031953859,0.171528228,0.062319051,-0.108387934,0.031178678,0.167684221,-0.087873766,-0.068085589,-0.035668519,-0.004006376,-0.023760278
Down-regulation of transcription of the proapoptotic gene BNip3 in cultured astrocytes by murine coronavirus infection,"Abstract Murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) causes encephalitis and demyelination in the central nervous system of susceptible rodents. Astrocytes are the major target for MHV persistence. However, the mechanisms by which astrocytes survive MHV infection and permit viral persistence are not known. Here we performed DNA microarray analysis on differential gene expression in astrocyte DBT cells by MHV infection and found that the mRNA of the proapoptotic gene BNip3 was significantly decreased following MHV infection. This finding was further confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and BNip3-promoter-luciferase reporter system. Interestingly, infection with live and ultraviolet light-inactivated viruses equally repressed BNip3 expression, indicating that the down-regulation of BNip3 expression does not require virus replication and is mediated during cell entry. Furthermore, treatment of cells with chloroquine, which blocks the acidification of endosomes, significantly inhibited the repression of the BNip3 promoter activity induced by the acidic pH-dependent MHV mutant OBLV60, which enters cells via endocytosis, indicating that the down-regulation of BNip3 expression is mediated by fusion between viral envelope and cell membranes during entry. Deletion analysis showed that the sequence between nucleotides 262 and 550 of the 588-base-pair BNip3 promoter is necessary and sufficient for driving the BNip3 expression and that it contains signals that are responsible for MHV-induced down-regulation of BNip3 expression in DBT cells. These results may provide insights into the mechanisms by which MHV evades host antiviral defense and promotes cell survival, thereby allowing its persistence in the host astrocytes.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.117773893,-0.048857012,-0.010419708,-0.07449767,-0.055139341,0.013714759,-0.035633095,-0.023383259,0.056749623,-0.05455937,-0.070514447,-0.086458969,0.025252798,0.088044583,0.039119249,0.056176443,-0.053591632,-0.001629571,-0.023146349,-0.014272922,0.054414045,-0.017629724,0.042681172,0.050809501,0.067813695,0.060583817,0.006549462,-0.000732956,-0.015163093,-0.021747845
Attenuation of SARS coronavirus by a short hairpin RNA expression plasmid targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,"Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious and sometimes a lethal disease, which spread over five continents in 2002–2003. Laboratory analysis showed that the etiologic agent for SARS is a new type of coronavirus. Currently, there is no specific treatment for this disease. RNA interference (RNAi) is a recently discovered antiviral mechanism in plant and animal cells that induces a specific degradation of double-stranded RNA. Here, we provide evidences that RNAi targeting at coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression plasmids can specifically inhibit expression of extraneous coronavirus RDRP in 293 and HeLa cells. Moreover, this construct significantly reduced the plaque formation of SARS coronaviruses in Vero-E6 cells.

Comparison of four regions in the replicase gene of heterologous infectious bronchitis virus strains,"Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) produces six subgenomic (sg) mRNAs, each containing a 64 nucleotide (nt) leader sequence, derived from the 5′ end of the genome by a discontinuous process. Several putative functional domains such as a papain-like proteinase (PLpro), main protease (Mpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and RNA helicase encoded by the replicase gene are important for virus replication. We have sequenced four regions of the replicase genes corresponding to the 5′-terminal sequence, PLpro, Mpro, and RdRp domains from 20 heterologous IBV strains, and compared them with previously published coronavirus sequences. All the coronavirus 5′-termini and PLpro domains were divergent, unlike the Mpro and the RdRp domains that were highly conserved with 28% and 48% conserved residues, respectively. Among IBV strains, the 5′ untranslated region including the leader sequence was highly conserved (>94% identical); whereas, the N-terminal coding region and the PLpro domains were highly variable ranging from 84.6% to 100%, and 77.6% to 100% identity, respectively. The IBV Mpro and RdRp domains were highly conserved with 82.7% and 92.7% conserved residues, respectively. The BJ strain was the most different from other IBVs in all four regions of the replicase. Phylogeny-based clustering based on replicase genes was identical to the antigen-based classification of coronaviruses into three groups. However, the IBV strain classification based on replicase gene domains did not correlate with that of the type-specific antigenic groups. The replicase gene sequences of many IBVs recovered from infected chickens were identical to those of vaccine viruses irrespective of serotype, suggesting that either there has been an exchange of genetic material among vaccine and field isolates or that there is a convergent evolution to a specific replicase genotype. There was no correlation between the genotype of any region of the replicase gene and pathotype, suggesting that the replicase is not the sole determinant of IBV pathogenicity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.205457525,-0.034718739,0.009179226,-0.01371205,0.201307426,-0.009051373,-0.16461226,-0.047134442,0.041427995,0.186349099,0.042358953,0.098599293,-0.056292406,-0.074897177,-0.155067073,0.011446857,0.063026951,-0.015026302,0.016463149,0.013033349,-0.008045932,-0.026739278,0.023956709,-0.049913511,0.036605428,0.031608147,0.002707997,0.022719016,0.039219077,0.01828258
A highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus generated from an infectious cDNA clone retains the in vivo virulence and transmissibility properties of the parental virus,"Abstract The nucleotide sequence of a highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was determined. Transfection of MARC-145 cells with capped in vitro transcripts derived from a full-length cDNA clone of the viral genome resulted in infectious PRRSV with growth characteristics similar to that of the parental virus. Primer extension analysis revealed that during replication, the viral polymerase corrected the two nonviral guanosine residues present at the 5′ terminus of the transfected transcripts. Animal studies showed that the cloned virus induced hyperthermia, persistent viremia, and antibody response, similar to that observed with the parental virus. Contact transmission occurred rapidly within 3 days of introduction of naı̈ve pigs into the group of clone virus-inoculated pigs.

"Expression, purification, and characterization of SARS coronavirus RNA polymerase","Abstract The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is essential for viral replication and a potential target for anti-SARS drugs. We report here the cloning, expression, and purification of the N-terminal GST-fused SARS-CoV RdRp and its polymerase catalytic domain in Escherichia coli. During purification, the full-length GST-RdRp was found to cleave into three main fragments: an N-terminal p12 fragment, a middle p30 fragment, and a C-terminal p64 fragment comprising the catalytic domain, presumably due to bacterial proteases. Biochemical assays show that the full-length GST-RdRp has RdRp activity and the p64 and p12 fragments form a complex that exhibits comparable RdRp activity, whereas the GST-p64 protein has no activity, suggesting that the p12 domain is required for polymerase activity possibly via involvement in template-primer binding.

Molecular characterization of a novel coronavirus associated with epizootic catarrhal enteritis (ECE) in ferrets,"Abstract A novel coronavirus, designated as ferret enteric coronavirus (FECV), was identified in feces of domestic ferrets clinically diagnosed with epizootic catarrhal enteritis (ECE). Initially, partial sequences of the polymerase, spike, membrane protein, and nucleocapsid genes were generated using coronavirus consensus PCR assays. Subsequently, the complete sequences of the nucleocapsid gene and the last two open reading frames at the 3′ terminus of the FECV genome were obtained. Phylogenetic analyses based on predicted partial amino acid sequences of the polymerase, spike, and membrane proteins, and full sequence of the nucleocapsid protein showed that FECV is genetically most closely related to group 1 coronaviruses. FECV is more similar to feline coronavirus, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and canine coronavirus than to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and human coronavirus 229E. Molecular data presented in this study provide the first genetic evidence for a new coronavirus associated with clinical cases of ECE.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.089995344,0.036893456,0.01495644,-0.080694309,0.167085225,0.009852241,-0.05112972,-0.009327561,0.021849403,-0.048924324,-0.015870604,0.004518,0.10306354,-0.060505356,0.00942597,-0.126537971,0.052788393,0.016249922,0.00352676,0.062831428,0.003447767,0.019846142,-0.040825341,0.009469102,0.04456458,0.005652564,0.031867636,-0.032833544,-0.050225734,0.011921979
Genomic characterization of the unclassified bovine enteric virus Newbury agent-1 (Newbury1) endorses a new genus in the family Caliciviridae,"Abstract The pathogenic bovine enteric virus, Newbury agent-1 (Bo//Newbury1/1976/UK), first identified in 1976, was characterized as a possible calicivirus by morphology, buoyant density in CsCl and the presence of a single capsid protein but genomic sequence could not be obtained. In the present study, the complete genome sequence of Newbury1 was determined and classified Newbury1 in a new genus of the Caliciviridae. The Newbury1 genome, of 7454 nucleotides, had two predicted open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encoded the non-structural and contiguous capsid proteins. ORF2 encoded a basic protein characteristic of the family Caliciviridae. Compared to the 4 recognized Caliciviridae genera, Norovirus, Sapovirus, Lagovirus and Vesivirus, Newbury1 had less than 39% amino acid (47% nucleotide) identity in the complete 2C-helicase, 3C-protease, 3D-polymerase and capsid regions but had 89% to 98% amino acid (78% to 92% nucleotide) identity to the recently characterized NB virus in these regions. By phylogenetic analyses, Newbury1 and NB viruses formed a distinct clade independent of the 4 recognized genera. However, amino acid identities showed that Newbury1 and the NB virus were distinct polymerase types (90% amino acid identity), but their complete capsid proteins were almost identical (98% amino acid identity). Analyses of contemporary viruses showed that the two polymerase genotypes, Newbury1 and NB, were circulating in UK cattle and antibody to Newbury1-like viruses was common in cattle sera. The present study defined the existence of a new genus in the Caliciviridae that we propose be named Becovirus or Nabovirus to distinguish the new clade from bovine noroviruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.09515039,-0.037316999,0.010614649,-0.052786988,0.080558231,0.01225445,-0.012864354,-0.002003562,-0.005312235,-0.014948093,-0.057278538,0.032405574,0.016751166,-0.115667648,-0.011865581,-0.088888035,0.038572765,0.007104436,0.018230238,0.009200843,0.021855163,-0.002791244,-0.038598725,0.024653787,0.00337997,0.0252467,0.023252833,-0.043477069,-0.03565486,-0.008898264
Molecular diversity of coronaviruses in bats,"Abstract The existence of coronaviruses in bats is unknown until the recent discovery of bat-SARS-CoV in Chinese horseshoe bats and a novel group 1 coronavirus in other bat species. Among 309 bats of 13 species captured from 20 different locations in rural areas of Hong Kong over a 16-month period, coronaviruses were amplified from anal swabs of 37 (12%) bats by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis of RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (pol) and helicase genes revealed six novel coronaviruses from six different bat species, in addition to the two previously described coronaviruses. Among the six novel coronaviruses, four were group 1 coronaviruses (bat-CoV HKU2 from Chinese horseshoe bat, bat-CoV HKU6 from rickett's big-footed bat, bat-CoV HKU7 from greater bent-winged bat and bat-CoV HKU8 from lesser bent-winged bat) and two were group 2 coronaviruses (bat-CoV HKU4 from lesser bamboo bats and bat-CoV HKU5 from Japanese pipistrelles).

Genetic diversity in the yellow head nidovirus complex,"Abstract Penaeus monodon shrimp collected from across the Indo-Pacific region during 1997–2004 were screened for the presence of yellow head-related viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of amplified ORF1b gene segments identified at least six distinct genetic lineages (genotypes). Genotype 1 (YHV) was detected only in shrimp with yellow head disease. Genotype 2 (GAV) was detected in diseased shrimp with the less severe condition described as mid-crop mortality syndrome and in healthy shrimp from Australia, Thailand and Vietnam. Other genotypes occurred commonly in healthy shrimp. Sequence comparisons of structural protein genes (ORF2 and ORF3), intergenic regions (IGRs) and the long 3′-UTR supported the delineation of genotypes and identified both conserved and variant structural features. In putative transcription regulating sequences (TRSs) encompassing the sub-genomic mRNA 5′-termini, a core motif (5′-GUCAAUUACAAC-3′) is absolutely conserved. A small (83 nt) open reading frame (ORF4) in the 3′-UTR of GAV is variously truncated in all other genotypes and a TRS-like element preceding ORF4 is invariably corrupted by a A > G/U substitution in the central core motif (5′-UU(G/U)CAAC-3′). The data support previous evidence that ORF4 is a non-functional gene under construction or deconstruction. The 3′-UTRs also contain predicted 3′-terminal hairpin-loop structures that are preserved in all genotypes by compensatory nucleotide substitutions, suggesting a role in polymerase recognition for minus-strand RNA synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.116116352,-0.037362619,-0.019716378,-0.055958949,0.093248732,-0.023156055,-0.048358782,0.001314673,-0.010563973,-0.039486542,-0.046728569,0.039936321,0.000862673,-0.067423118,-0.048645498,-0.040794537,0.016336795,4.74E-05,-0.023525825,-0.042437024,0.014200999,-0.009064937,-0.037772551,0.050759966,-0.051421654,-0.064050743,-0.020125849,0.007856938,0.065707047,-0.016400585
Rhesus angiotensin converting enzyme 2 supports entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in Chinese macaques,"Abstract Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) utilizes for target cell entry and, therefore, plays an important role in SARS pathogenesis. Since Chinese rhesus (rh) macaques do not usually develop SARS after SARS-CoV infection, it has been suggested that rh-ACE2 probably does not support viral entry efficiently. To determine the role of rh-ACE2 in early lung pathogenesis in vivo, we studied eleven Chinese rhesus monkeys experimentally infected with a pathogenic SARS-CoVPUMC01 strain. Rh-ACE2 genes were amplified from all animals by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and their function was studied in vitro using a pseudovirus entry assay. Many natural non-synonymous (NS) changes were found in rh-ACE2 genes. Compared to human (hu) ACE2, thirty-eight consensus NS changes were found in rh-ACE2. Since these changes do not interact with the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV, rh-ACE2 in general is as effective as human homolog in supporting viral entry. Rh-ACE2, however, is more polymorphic than hu-ACE2. Additional sporadic NS substitutions in clone Rh11-7 reduced the level of rh-ACE2 protein expression and did not support viral entry effectively. Further mutagenesis analysis showed that a natural mutation Y217N dramatically alters ACE2 expression and entry efficiency. Moreover, introduction of the Y217N mutation into hu-ACE2 caused the down-regulation of expression and reduced viral entry efficiency. These results indicate that the Y217N mutation plays a role in modulating SARS-CoV infection. Our results provide insights for understanding the role of rh-ACE2 in SARS lung pathogenesis in a non-human primate model.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.050626948,0.158360585,-0.094738541,-0.063810309,-0.055247228,0.043353264,0.007850111,-0.126724522,0.008436464,-0.022868551,-0.030719059,-0.007874982,-0.001910756,-0.002934987,0.013290209,0.009231922,-0.016620557,-0.025167436,-0.024599568,-0.014300016,0.02766319,0.000444022,-0.010221069,0.026271639,-0.010689703,-2.47E-05,0.001253966,0.003217111,0.016495975,-0.041542358
Molecular characterization of genome segment 2 encoding RNA dependent RNA polymerase of Antheraea mylitta cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus,"Abstract Genome segment 2 (S2) from Antheraea mylitta cypovirus (AmCPV) was converted into cDNA, cloned and sequenced. S2 consisted of 3798 nucleotides with a long ORF encoding a 1116 amino acid long protein (123kDa). BLAST and phylogenetic analysis showed 29% sequence identity and close relatedness of AmCPV S2 with RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of other insect cypoviruses, suggesting a common origin of all insect cypoviruses. The ORF of S2 was expressed as 123kDa soluble His-tagged fusion protein in insect cells via baculovirus recombinants which exhibited RdRp activity in an in vitro RNA polymerase assay without any intrinsic terminal transferase activity. Maximum activity was observed at 37°C at pH 6.0 in the presence of 3mM MgCl2. Site directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of the conserved GDD motif.

Identification of aromatic amino acid residues in conserved region VI of the large polymerase of vesicular stomatitis virus is essential for both guanine-N-7 and ribose 2'-O methyltransferases,"Abstract Non-segmented negative-sense RNA viruses possess a unique mechanism for mRNA cap methylation. For vesicular stomatitis virus, conserved region VI in the large (L) polymerase protein catalyzes both guanine-N-7 (G-N-7) and ribose 2'-O (2'-O) methyltransferases, and the two methylases share a binding site for the methyl donor S-adenosyl-l-methionine. Unlike conventional mRNA cap methylation, the 2'-O methylation of VSV precedes subsequent G-N-7 methylation. In this study, we found that individual alanine substitutions in two conserved aromatic residues (Y1650 and F1691) in region VI of L protein abolished both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylation. However, replacement of one aromatic residue with another aromatic residue did not significantly affect the methyltransferase activities. Our studies provide genetic and biochemical evidence that conserved aromatic residues in region VI of L protein essential for both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylations. In combination with the structural prediction, our results suggest that these aromatic residues may participate in RNA recognition.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.111177437,-0.048871604,-0.030304423,-0.026167903,-0.019657124,-0.016778999,-0.010649519,0.014547208,-0.032383805,-0.00979701,-0.027032611,0.031628713,-0.007362505,-0.044204623,-0.056120423,-0.042348906,0.043443657,-0.032182622,-0.051693489,0.016529272,0.009870511,0.023291617,0.055340234,0.018564798,0.055474739,-0.010754168,-0.029222562,0.014959756,0.098574438,0.001119063
Full genome analysis of a novel adenovirus from the South Polar skua (Catharacta maccormicki) in Antarctica,"Abstract Adenoviruses have been identified in humans and a wide range of vertebrate animals, but not previously from the polar region.

The interaction of nonstructural protein 9 with retinoblastoma protein benefits the replication of genotype 2 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in vitro,"Abstract The nonstructural protein 9 (Nsp9) of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that plays a vital role in viral replication. This study first demonstrated that the Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV interacted with cellular retinoblastoma protein (pRb), and Nsp9 co-localized with pRb in the cytoplasm of PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells and pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Next, the overexpression of truncated pRb was shown to inhibit the PRRSV replication and silencing the pRb gene could facilitate the PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells. Finally, the pRb level was confirmed to be down-regulated in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells, and Nsp9 was shown to promote the pRb degradation by proteasome pathway. These findings indicate that the interaction of Nsp 9 with pRb benefits the replication of genotype 2 PRRSV in vitro, helping to understand the roles of Nsp9 in the replication and pathogenesis of PRRSV.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14515262,-0.051991403,-0.046358641,-0.019772244,-0.078959595,-0.004097289,0.008976141,-0.034504236,0.051171895,-0.006131416,-0.006932382,-0.008706307,-0.037020331,0.105805729,0.057473804,-0.065176191,0.057337161,-0.07905274,-0.001419192,0.087232494,-0.052669563,0.026738689,0.043611179,-0.11775016,0.040944728,0.084035426,0.006008763,-0.033612818,-0.118571561,0.084774251
"NS5B induces up-regulation of the BH3-only protein, BIK, essential for the hepatitis C virus RNA replication and viral release","Abstract Hepatitis C virus (HCV) induces cytopathic effects in the form of hepatocytes apoptosis thought to be resulted from the interaction between viral proteins and host factors. Using pathway specific PCR array, we identified 9 apoptosis-related genes that are dysregulated during HCV infection, of which the BH3-only pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, BIK, was consistently up-regulated at the mRNA and protein levels. Depletion of BIK protected host cells from HCV-induced caspase-3/7 activation but not the inhibitory effect of HCV on cell viability. Furthermore, viral RNA replication and release were significantly suppressed in BIK-depleted cells and over-expression of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, NS5B, was able to induce BIK expression. Immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation assays showed co-localization and interaction of BIK and NS5B, suggesting that BIK may be interacting with the HCV replication complex through NS5B.

Pathogenicity and pathogenesis of a United States porcine deltacoronavirus cell culture isolate in 5-day-old neonatal piglets,"Abstract Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was first identified in Hong Kong in 2009–2010 and reported in United States swine for the first time in February 2014. However, diagnostic tools other than polymerase chain reaction for PDCoV detection were lacking and Koch׳s postulates had not been fulfilled to confirm the pathogenic potential of PDCoV. In the present study, PDCoV peptide-specific rabbit antisera were developed and used in immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry assays to assist PDCoV diagnostics. The pathogenicity and pathogenesis of PDCoV was investigated following orogastric inoculation of 5-day-old piglets with a plaque-purified PDCoV cell culture isolate (3×104 TCID50 per pig). The PDCoV-inoculated piglets developed mild to moderate diarrhea, shed increasing amount of virus in rectal swabs from 2 to 7 days post inoculation, and developed macroscopic and microscopic lesions in small intestines with viral antigen confirmed by immunohistochemistry staining. This study experimentally confirmed PDCoV pathogenicity and characterized PDCoV pathogenesis in neonatal piglets.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.016119845,0.002228797,0.051726541,-0.075463019,-0.020013227,0.039005737,0.017688447,-0.004773179,0.010701148,-0.020604789,0.00325686,0.023205726,-0.039602012,-0.011550208,0.079317241,-0.028700268,-0.00773443,0.010950676,-0.02902034,0.007314924,-0.035228253,-0.022123855,0.002922435,-0.020777854,0.017221408,0.015106111,-0.027180287,-0.000205512,0.005503612,-0.013881794
Arterivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase: Vital enzymatic activity remains elusive,"Abstract All RNA viruses encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which in arteriviruses is expressed as the C-terminal domain of nonstructural protein 9 (nsp9). Previously, potent primer-dependent RdRp activity has been demonstrated for the homologous polymerase subunit (nsp12) of the distantly related coronaviruses. The only previous study focusing on the in vitro activity of nsp9 of an arterivirus (equine arteritis virus; EAV) reported weak de novo polymerase activity on homopolymeric RNA templates. However, this activity was not retained when Mn2+ ions were omitted from the assay or when biologically relevant templates were supplied, which prompted us to revisit the biochemical properties of this polymerase. Based on the properties of active-site mutants, we conclude that the RNA-synthesizing activities observed in de novo and primer-dependent polymerase and terminal transferase assays cannot be attributed to recombinant EAV nsp9-RdRp.

Involvement of a joker mutation in a polymerase-independent lethal mutagenesis escape mechanism,"Abstract We previously characterized a foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) with three amino acid replacements in its polymerase (3D) that conferred resistance to the mutagenic nucleoside analogue ribavirin. Here we show that passage of this mutant in the presence of high ribavirin concentrations resulted in selection of viruses with the additional replacement I248T in 2C. This 2C substitution alone (even in the absence of replacements in 3D) increased FMDV fitness mainly in the presence of ribavirin, prevented an incorporation bias in favor of A and U associated with ribavirin mutagenesis, and conferred the ATPase activity of 2C decreased sensitivity to ribavirin-triphosphate. Since in previous studies we described that 2C with I248T was selected under different selective pressures, this replacement qualifies as a joker substitution in FMDV evolution. The results have identified a role of 2C in nucleotide incorporation, and have unveiled a new polymerase-independent mechanism of virus escape to lethal mutagenesis.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.070701888,-0.034495578,0.000450606,-0.037144063,-0.026980289,0.04665482,0.057619473,0.002686197,0.003493868,0.007360878,0.018175382,0.049480068,-0.024747486,-0.051944811,0.002957154,-0.001282067,-0.016106474,0.018194472,-0.015632795,-0.019751336,0.0655612,-0.05954212,0.021174256,0.088189747,-0.003052239,0.034324817,0.007098726,-0.023833369,-0.035300145,-0.050605109
Coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus non-structural proteins 8 and 12 form stable complex independent of the non-translated regions of viral RNA and other viral proteins,"Abstract The cleavage products from coronavirus polyproteins, known as the non-structural proteins (nsps), are believed to make up the major components of the viral replication/transcription complex. In this study, several nsps encoded by avian gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were screened for RNA-binding activity and interaction with its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, nsp12. Nsp2, nsp5, nsp8, nsp9 and nsp10 were found to bind to untranslated regions (UTRs), while nsp8 was confirmed to interact with nsp12. Nsp8 has been reported to interact with nsp7 and functions as a primase synthesizing RNA primers for nsp12. Further characterization revealed that nsp8-nsp12 interaction is independent of the UTRs of viral RNA, and nsp8 interacts with both the N- and C-terminal regions of nsp12. These results have prompted a proposal of how the nsp7-nsp8 complex could possibly function in tandem with nsp12, forming a highly efficient complex that could synthesize both the RNA primer and viral RNA during coronavirus infection.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.178964729,-0.008105395,-0.075880593,0.089315599,-0.009615138,-0.057274287,-0.015964057,-0.002506965,-0.012065065,0.062881562,0.101747231,0.057185577,-0.038338086,0.014504682,-0.047319044,0.02800555,0.069756885,-0.057990347,-0.008787813,0.02617448,-0.064069633,0.020967521,0.001179647,-0.099928372,0.040227346,0.010776501,-0.068159456,0.027956685,-0.004420053,0.033988799
Synthesis of the Putative Red Clover Necrotic Mosaic Virus RNA Polymerase by Ribosomal Frameshifting in Vitro,"Abstract The red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) genome is split between two single-stranded RNA species termed RNA-1 and RNA-2. RNA-1 directs the synthesis of 88-kDa (p88), 57-kDa (p57), 37-kDa (p37), and 27-kDa (p27) polypeptides and RNA-2 a 35-kDa (p35) polypeptide in vitro. The coding order of the RNA-1 products was determined to be 5′-p27-p57-p37-3′. Antibodies to synthetic peptides representing the carboxyl terminal portions of p27 and p57 immunoprecipitated their respective polypeptides in addition to p88, suggesting that p88 is a fusion protein. A frameshift heptanucleotide sequence element has been identified in RCNMV RNA-1. In addition, a stable stem-loop secondary structure adjacent to the heptanucleotide sequence is predicted. Together, these sequence elements suggest that a ribosomal frameshifting event occurs which allows translational readthrough of the p27 open reading frame into the p57 open reading frame, generating the observed p88 product. An RNA-1 expression construct fusing the p57 and the CP open reading frame was engineered to investigate the ribosomal frameshifting event. CP antibodies immunoprecipitated a fusion protein of the predicted size containing the carboxyl portion of CP. Site-directed mutagenesis of the frameshift element indicates that in vitro, p88 can also be expressed alternatively by suppression of an amber termination codon. Based on these data, we propose that the putative RCNMV RNA polymerase is an 88-kDa polypeptide expressed by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism similar to those utilized by retroviruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.224770032,-0.064421375,-0.047325186,0.025200072,0.054685763,-0.111302688,-0.1252487,0.039347374,-0.0103813,-0.077195662,-0.080861317,-0.011091055,0.02961816,-0.101244516,-0.055582892,-0.072565174,0.07334037,-0.000346343,0.021281404,-0.031932572,-0.044333388,-0.034246942,-0.061019237,-0.028592883,-0.065835742,-0.02949279,-0.006822764,0.001731708,0.040019583,-0.058479615
"Molecular Characterization of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus, a Member of the Arterivirus Group","Abstract Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)-specific cDNA clones spanning the 3′ terminal 5 kb of the genomic RNA were isolated, sequenced, and used as probes for identification of PRRSV-specific RNAs. The PRRSV genome is a positive-stranded polyadenylated RNA of about 15 kb. In infected cells, a 3′ coterminal nested set of six major subgenomic mRNAs could be demonstrated. Within the 3′ terminal 3.5 kb of the PRRSV genome, six overlapping reading frames (ORFs) were identified, each most likely expressed by one of the subgenomic mRNAs. Amino acid sequence comparisons revealed that the most 3′ terminal ORF (ORF7) encodes the PRRSV nucleocapsid protein with a calculated molecular weight of 14 kDa. It displays 44.8% amino acid identity with the capsid protein of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) and 23.6% with that of equine arteritis virus (EAV). The product of ORF6, the second 3′ terminal ORF, represents a putative membrane protein and exhibits 53.2 and 27.2% amino acid identity with the corresponding LDV and EAV polypeptides, respectively. Similar to EAV, ORFs 2 through 5 might encode glycosylated viral proteins. The polypeptide deduced from the most 5′ ORF (ORF1b) contains two conserved domains common to EAV and coronavirus polymerases.

Nucleotide Sequence of the Human Coronavirus 229E RNA Polymerase Locus,"Abstract The nucleotide sequence of the human coronavirus 229E (HCV 229E) RNA polymerase gene and the 5′ region of the genome has been determined. The polymerase gene is comprised of two large open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, that contain 4086 and 2687 codons, respectively. ORF1b overlaps ORF1a by 43 bases in the (-1) reading frame. The in vitro translation of SP6 transcripts which include HCV 229E sequences encompassing the ORF1a/ORF1b junction show that expression of ORF1b can be mediated by ribosomal frame-shifting. The predicted translation products of ORF1a (454,200 molecular weight) and ORF1a/1b (754,200 molecular weight) have been compared to the predicted RNA polymerase gene products of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and conserved structural features and putative functional domains have been identified.

Leader-mRNA Junction Sequences Are Unique for Each Subgenomic mRNA Species in the Bovine Coronavirus and Remain So Throughout Persistent Infection,"Abstract The common leader sequence on bovine coronavirus subgenomic mRNAs and genome was determined. To examine leader-mRNA junction sequences on subgenomic mRNAs, specific oligodeoxynucleotide sets were used in a polymerase chain reaction to amplify junction sequences from either the positive-strand mRNA (eight of nine total identified species) or the negative-strand anti-mRNA (six of the nine species), and sequenced. The mRNA species studied were those for the N, M, S, and HE structural proteins and the 9.5-, 12.7-, 4.8-, and 4.9-kDa putative nonstructural proteins. By defining the leader-mRNA junction sequence as the sequence between (i) the point of mismatch between the leader and genome and (ii) the 3′ end of the consensus heptameric intergenic sequence [(U/A)C(U/C)AAAC)], or its variant, a unique junction sequence was found for each subgenomic mRNA species studied. In one instance (mRNA for the 12.7-kDa protein) the predicted intergenic sequence UCCAAAC was not part of the junction region, and in its place was the nonconforming sequence GGTAGAC that occurs just 15 nt downstream in the genome. Leader-mRNA junction sequences found after 296 days of persistent infection were the same as those found during acute infection (<18 hr postinfection). These data indicate that, in contrast to the closely related mouse hepatitis virus, the bovine coronavirus maintains a stable leader-mRNA junction sequence for each mRNA. Interestingly, this stability may be related to the fact that a UCUAA sequence element, postulated by others to be a regulator of the leader-mRNA fusion event, occurs only once within the 3′ flanking sequence of the genomic leader donor and once at intergenic sites in the bovine coronavirus genome, whereas it occurs two to four times at these sites in the mouse hepatitis coronavirus.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.160184135,-0.048856523,-0.021975879,-0.064088111,0.106797062,-0.079506298,-0.14705299,0.02917381,-0.012355718,-0.114867636,-0.095815124,-0.086918929,0.082273601,-0.055864802,0.028407962,0.037573156,-0.049658985,0.028362864,-0.01876483,-0.023205787,0.031812988,0.000257129,-0.03329141,0.039896669,0.020426044,-0.084780356,-0.026929244,0.013306331,0.163892108,-0.001968327
Characterization of a Replicating and Packaged Defective RNA of Avian Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus,"Abstract The Beaudette strain of IBV was passaged 16 times in chick kidney cells. Total cellular RNA was analyzed by Northern hybridization and was probed with 32 P-labeled cDNA probes corresponding to the first 2 kb of the 5′ end of the genome, but excluding the leader, and to the last 1.8 kb of the 3′ end of the genome. A new, defective IBV RNA species (CD-91) was detected at passage 6. The defective RNA, present in total cell extract RNA and in oligo-(dT)30-selected RNA from passage 15, was amplified by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to give four fragments. The oligonucleotides used were selected such that CD-91 RNA, but not the genomic RNA, would be amplified. Cloning and sequencing of the PCR products showed that CD-91 comprises 9.1 kb and has three regions of the genome. It contains 1133 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the genome, 6322 from gene 1b corresponding to position 12,423 to 18,744 in the IBV genome, and 1626 from the 3′ end of the genome. At position 749 one nucleotide, an adenine residue, was absent from CD-91 RNA.

Determinants of the p28 Cleavage Site Recognized by the First Papain-like Cysteine Proteinase of Murine Coronavirus,"Abstract The murine coronavirus polymerase gene is 22 kb in length with the potential to encode a polyprotein of approximately 750 kDa. The polyprotein has been proposed to encode three proteinase domains which are responsible for the processing of the polyprotein into mature proteins. The proteolytic activity of the first proteinase domain has been characterized and resembles the papain family of cysteine proteinases. This proteinase domain acts autoproteolytically to cleave the amino terminal portion of the polymerase polyprotein, releasing a 28-kDa protein designated p28. To identify the cleavage site of this papain-like cysteine proteinase, we isolated the peptide adjacent to p28 and determined the amino terminus sequence by Edman degradation reaction. We report that proteolysis occurs between the Gly-247 and Val-248 dipeptide bond. To determine the role of the amino acid residues surrounding the cleavage site, we introduced a total of 42 site-specific mutations at the residues spanning the P5 to P3′ positions and assessed the effects of the mutations on the processing of p28 in an in vitro transcription and translation system. The substitutions of Gly-247 at the P1 position or Arg-246 at the P2 position resulted in a dramatic decrease of proteolytic activity, and the mutations of Arg-243 at P5 position also led to considerable reduction in p28 cleavage. In contrast, the substitutions of amino acids Gly-244 (P4), Tyr-245 (P3), Val-248 (P1′), Lys-249 (P2′), and Pro-250 (P3′) had little or no effect on the amount of p26 that was released. This work has identified Gly-247-Val-248 as the cleavage site for the release of p28, the amino-terminal protein of the murine coronavirus polymerase polyprotein. Additionally, we conclude that the Gly-247 and Arg-246 are the major determinants for the cleavage site recognition by the first papain-like cysteine proteinase of murine coronavirus.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.141233622,-0.045246027,-0.026241509,-0.056677796,0.009178357,-0.013297388,-0.072175648,-0.015972122,0.036896822,-0.068231113,-0.087315795,0.045439283,0.016896397,-0.108096959,-0.060360984,-0.083732804,0.094386776,-0.00977899,0.024035833,0.008907026,-0.002427374,-0.021877839,0.006730416,-0.0341892,0.102114168,0.137246197,-0.014386121,-0.018694571,-0.044638445,-0.053326132
Experimental Evidence of Recombination in Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus,"Abstract Embryonated eggs were coinfected with two strains of the coronavirus avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), IBV-Beaudette and IBV-M41, to investigate whether recombination between the two strains would occur. Virions were isolated from the allantoic fluid of the coinfected eggs and putative hybrid RNAs were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using strain-specific oligonucleotides. PCR products, of the expected sizes, were obtained as predicted from potential recombination events between the nucleoprotein (N) gene and the 3′-untranslated region of the two IBV genomes. Sequencing confirmed that they corresponded to hybrid RNAs. Virus produced as a result of the mixed infection was treated with an M41-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody and passaged in Vero cells, in which IBV-Beaudette, but not IBV-M41, replicated. Hybrid RNA was still detectable after three serial passages. Since no IBV-M41 was detectable this confirmed that infectious recombinant genomes had been produced in the embryonated eggs. These findings not only support the circumstantial evidence, from sequencing studies of IBV field strains, that recombination occurs during replication of IBV and contributes to the diversity of IBV, but also show that coronavirus RNA recombination is not limited to mouse hepatitis virus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.113194628,-0.022943705,0.090732275,-0.086259579,0.22188801,0.06774515,-0.227944841,-0.091696096,0.121383822,0.401044564,0.122284385,0.004257351,-0.062932625,0.071422838,-0.129986253,0.209443966,-0.030807054,0.031087353,0.020623126,0.040532951,-0.031673648,-0.016762723,0.024661907,-0.043121745,0.005119495,0.037726203,0.013966634,0.025236689,-0.003724654,0.009978395
Evolution of Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) during Chronic Infection: Quasispecies Nature of the Persisting MHV RNA,"Abstract Coronavirus infection of mice has been used extensively as a model for the study of acute encephalitis and chronic demyelination. To examine the evolution of coronavirus RNA during chronic demyelinating infection, we isolated RNA from intracerebrally inoculated mice at 4, 6, 8, 13, 20, and 42 days postinfection and used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification methods (RT-PCR) to detect viral sequences. RNA sequences from two viral structural genes, the spike gene and the nucleocapsid gene, were detected throughout the chronic infection. In contrast, infectious virus was not detectable from brain homongenates beyond 13 days postinfection. These results indicate that coronavirus RNA persists in the brain at times when infectious virus is not detected. To determine if genetic changes were occurring during viral replication in the host, we cloned and sequenced the RT-PCR products from the spike and nucleocapsid regions and analyzed the sequences for mutations. Sequencing of the cloned products revealed that a variety of mutant forms of viral RNA persisted in the CNS, including point mutants, deletion mutants, and termination mutants. The mutations accumulated during persistent infection in both the spike and the nucleocapsid sequences, with greater than 65% of the mutations encoding amino acid changes. These results show that a diverse population or quasispecies consisting of mutant and deletion variant viral RNAs (which may not be capable of producing infectious virus particles) persists in the central nervous system of mice during chronic demyelinating infection. The implications of these results for the role of persistent viral genetic information in the pathogenesis of chronic demyelination are discussed.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.106617252,-0.007291279,0.011532733,0.0291974,0.051882505,-0.032755549,-0.046621364,0.005285732,-0.00487182,0.061592947,0.041276369,-0.05886597,0.036056475,0.046943142,0.023241731,0.002535695,-0.030030274,0.006791004,-0.048361146,0.041657658,0.00994851,-0.012890996,-0.030669517,0.064381188,-0.039564047,-0.012488363,0.066587363,-0.049162096,-0.065233583,0.039685752
The Molecular Genetics of Feline Coronaviruses: Comparative Sequence Analysis of the ORF7a/7b Transcription Unit of Different Biotypes,"Abstract Feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) have been subdivided into feline enteric coronaviruses (FECVs) and feline infectious peritonitis viruses (FIPVs) on the basis of pathogenic properties. Serologically, a distinction has been made between type I and II FCoVs, the latter of which more closely resemble canine coronavirus (CCV). To gain more insight into the genetic relationships between different FCoV biotypes, we determined the nucleotide sequences of the ORF7a/7b transcription unit of nine strains. The following observations were made: (i) The sequences are 87-100% identical. In this part of the genome, type I and II FCoVs are more closely related to each other than to CCV. To explain the genetic and antigenic differences between the spike genes of type I and II FCoVs, we postulate that type II FCoVs have arisen by an RNA recombination event between a type I FCoV and CCV. (ii) The avirulent ""FECV"" strains UCD and 79-1683 are more similar to virulent ""FIPV"" strains than to each other. Our findings thus support the notion that FECV and FIPV are not different species but merely virulence variants. (iii) In contrast to FECV 79-1683, FECV UCD contains an intact ORF7b, indicating that ORF7b deletions are not a universal distinguishing property of FECVs. (iv) ORF7b deletions readily occur in vitro, correlating with loss of virulence.

Characterization of proteins encoded by ORFs 2 to 7 of Lelystad virus,"Abstract The genome of Lelystad virus (LV), a positive-strand RNA virus, is 15 kb in length and contains 8 open reading frames (ORFs) that encode putative viral proteins. ORFs 2 to 7 were cloned in plasmids downstream of the Sp6 RNA polymerase promoter, and the translation of transcripts generated in vitro yielded proteins that could be immunoprecipitated with porcine anti-LV serum. Synthetic polypeptides of 15 to 17 amino acids were selected from the amino acid sequences of ORFs 2 to 7 and antipeptide sera were raised in rabbits. Antisera that immunoprecipitated the in vitro translation products of ORFs 2 to 5 and 7 were obtained. Sera containing antibodies directed against peptides from ORFs 3 to 7 reacted positively with LV-infected alveolar lung macrophages in the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay. Using these antipeptide sera and porcine anti-LV serum, we identified three structural proteins and assigned their corresponding genes. Virions were found to contain a nucleocapsid protein of 15 kDa (N), an unglycosylated membrane protein of 18 kDa (M), and a glycosylated membrane protein of 25 kDa (E). The N protein is encoded by ORF7, the M protein is encoded by ORF6, and the E protein is encoded by ORF5. The E protein in virus particles contains one or two N-glycans that are resistant to endo-β-N-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase H. This finding indicates that the high-mannose glycans are processed into complex glycans in the Golgi compartment. The protein composition of the LV virions further confirms that LV is evolutionarily related to equine arteritis virus, simian hemorrhagic fever virus, and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.160834187,-0.057318627,-0.028252815,-0.025916957,0.011417365,-0.033552227,-0.099473734,-0.017425364,0.035993841,-0.05392566,-0.105985507,-0.03984116,0.023308379,-0.041777919,-0.029969874,-0.135143794,0.114662032,-0.034056513,0.031543809,0.075156818,-0.065357957,0.01951245,-0.015343445,-0.050253238,0.019379447,0.091467444,0.039545172,-0.056516159,-0.069332873,0.029814425
Molecular Characterization of Transmissible Gastroenteritis Coronavirus Defective Interfering Genomes: Packaging and Heterogeneity,"Abstract Three transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) defective RNAs were selected by serial undiluted passage of the PUR46 strain in ST cells. These RNAs of 22, 10.6, and 9.7 kb (DI-A, DI-B, and DI-C, respectively) were detected at passage 30, remained stable upon further passage in cell culture, and significantly interfered with helper mRNA synthesis. RNA analysis from purified virions showed that the three defective RNAs were efficiently packaged. Virions of different densities containing either full-length or defective RNAs were sorted in sucrose gradients, indicating that defective and full-length genomes were independently encapsidated. DI-B and DI-C RNAs were amplified by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and sequenced. DI-B and DI-C genomes are formed by three and four discontinuous regions of the wild-type genome, respectively. DI-C contains 2144 nucleotides (nt) from the 5′-end of the genome, two fragments of 4540 and 2531 nt mostly from gene 1b, and 493 nt from the 3′ end of the genome. DI-B and DI-C RNAs include sequences with the pseudoknot motif and encoding the polymerase, metal ion binding, and helicase motifs. DI-B RNA has a structure closely related to DI-C RNA with two main differences: it maintains the entire ORF 1b and shows heterogeneity in the size of the 3′ end deletion. This heterogeneity maps at the beginning of the S gene, where other natural TGEV recombination events have been observed, suggesting that either a process of template switching occurs with high frequency at this point or that the derived genomes have a selective advantage.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.187780408,-0.067349344,-0.020563158,0.011551746,0.080604611,-0.141548545,-0.209487699,0.061964948,-0.031254801,-0.09918806,-0.020245224,-0.123151566,0.047164572,-0.006997679,0.21074405,0.214780583,-0.259900623,0.138169718,-0.006940903,-0.020226769,0.102087259,-0.046580372,0.103375331,0.031453801,0.087959374,0.085898534,0.0295216,-0.030391123,0.105049472,-0.020839071
The Production of Recombinant Infectious DI-Particles of a Murine Coronavirus in the Absence of Helper Virus,"Abstract We have studied the production and release of infectious DI-particles in vaccinia-T7-polymerase recombinant virus-infected L cells that were transfected with five different plasmids expressing the synthetic DI RNA MIDI-HD and the four structural proteins (M, N, S, and E) of the murine coronavirus MHV-A59. The DI cDNA contains the hepatitis delta ribozyme sequences to generate in the transfected cells a defined 3′ end. In EM studies of transfected cells virus-like particles (VLP) were observed in vesicles. Release of the particles into the medium was studied by immunoprecipitations of proteins released into the culture supernatant. Particle release was independent of S or N, but required M and E. Coexpression of E and M was sufficient for particle release. Coexpression of the structural proteins and the MIDI-HD RNA resulted in the production and release of infectious DI-particles. Infectivity of the DI-particles was determined by adding helper virus MHV-A59 to the medium containing the VLPs and using this mixture to infect new L cells. Intracellular RNA of several subsequent undiluted passages was isolated to detect the MIDI-HD RNA. Passage of the MIDI-HD RNA was dependent on the expression of the structural proteins of MHV-A59 in the transfected cells. In the absence of either E or M, MIDI-HD RNA could not be passaged to fresh L cells. We have thus developed a system in which we can produce coronavirus-like particles and an assay to test their infectivity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.206505267,-0.057908918,-0.029007321,0.03128196,-0.012253299,-0.083044497,-0.136795223,0.012828919,0.011863876,-0.055994989,-0.011258524,-0.135461779,0.039411485,0.088133798,0.173774578,0.156543584,-0.159410073,0.078656712,0.032203745,0.00651707,0.048637349,-0.007969031,0.110983936,-0.023161202,0.112188877,0.166935162,0.025092786,-0.008169208,-0.053912332,-0.008676489
Characterization of a 105-kDa Polypeptide Encoded in Gene 1 of the Human Coronavirus HCV 229E,"Abstract Gene 1 of the human coronavirus HCV 229E encompasses approximately 20.7 kb and contains two overlapping open reading frames, ORF 1a and ORF 1b. The downstream ORF 1b is expressed by a mechanism involving (−1) ribosomal frameshifting. Translation of mRNA 1, which is thought to be equivalent to the viral genomic RNA, results in the synthesis of two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. These polyproteins contain motifs characteristic of papain-like and 3C-like proteinases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helicases, and metal-binding proteins. In this study, we have produced pp1ab-specific monoclonal antibodies and have used them to detect an intracellular, 105-kDa viral polypeptide that contains the putative RNA polymerase domain. Furthermore, usingtranscleavage assays with bacterially expressed HCV 229E 3C-like proteinase, we have demonstrated that the 105-kDa polypeptide is released from pp1ab by cleavage at the dipeptide bonds Gln-4068/Ser-4069 and Gln-4995/Ala-4996. These data contribute to the characterization of coronavirus 3C-like proteinase-mediated processing of pp1ab and provide the first identification of an HCV 229E ORF 1ab-encoded polypeptide in virus-infected cells.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.184336356,-0.053199268,-0.041123378,0.021505292,0.031394342,-0.07188723,-0.087285897,0.00517911,0.048907541,-0.055260654,-0.106068366,0.029927574,0.100094468,-0.034951722,-0.063304842,-0.090824963,0.101202612,0.09797097,0.167110361,-0.033467466,-0.082713048,-0.012285511,0.008056243,-0.021595046,-0.037011478,-0.015178626,-0.026656613,0.01097737,-0.071345122,-0.089340807
Persistence and Evolution of Feline Coronavirus in a Closed Cat-Breeding Colony,"Abstract Feline coronavirus (FCoV) persistence and evolution were studied in a closed cat-breeding facility with an endemic serotype I FCoV infection. Viral RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the feces and/or plasma of 36 of 42 cats (86%) tested. Of 5 cats, identified as FCoV shedders during the initial survey, 4 had detectable viral RNA in the feces when tested 111 days later. To determine whether this was due to continuous reinfection or to viral persistence, 2 cats were placed in strict isolation and virus shedding in the feces was monitored every 2–4 days. In 1 of the cats, virus shedding continued for up to 7 months. The other animal was sacrificed after 124 days of continuous virus shedding in order to identify the sites of viral replication. Viral mRNA was detected only in the ileum, colon, and rectum. Also in these tissues, FCoV-infected cells were identified by immunohistochemistry. These findings provide the first formal evidence that FCoV causes chronic enteric infections. To assess FCoV heterogeneity in the breeding facility and to study viral evolution during chronic infection, FCoV quasispecies sampled from individual cats were characterized by RT-PCR amplification of selected regions of the viral genome followed by sequence analysis. Phylogenetic comparison of nucleotides 7–146 of ORF7b to corresponding sequences obtained for independent European and American isolates indicated that the viruses in the breeding facility form a clade and are likely to have originated from a single founder infection. Comparative consensus sequence analysis of the more variable region formed by residues 79–478 of the S gene revealed that each cat harbored a distinct FCoV quasispecies. Moreover, FCoV appeared to be subject to immune selection during chronic infection. The combined data support a model in which the endemic infection is maintained by chronically infected carriers. Virtually every cat born to the breeding facility becomes infected, indicating that FCoV is spread very efficiently. FCoV-infected cats, however, appear to resist superinfection by closely related FCoVs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.047643239,-0.016196631,0.04891024,-0.117885301,0.047914918,7.89E-05,0.017667929,0.003407108,-0.040877633,-0.122538824,0.360960152,-0.155163045,0.198146518,0.007742178,-0.078131954,-0.046112342,0.039236746,0.008260401,-0.01564198,0.093402276,-0.037245674,0.003568808,-0.005398718,0.059977146,-0.041966741,0.011451532,0.037624596,0.009359951,0.009413872,0.02991067
Further Requirements for Cleavage by the Murine Coronavirus 3C-like Proteinase: Identification of a Cleavage Site within ORF1b,"Abstract The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) encodes a 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) that is proposed to be responsible for the majority of the processing events that take place within the replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. In this study we demonstrate that the Q939↓S940 peptide bond, located between the polymerase and Zn-finger regions of pp1ab (the POL↓Zn site), is processed by the 3CLpro, albeit inefficiently. Mutagenesis of the POL↓Zn site, as well as the previously identified HD1↓3C site in the 1a region of pp1a and pp1ab, demonstrated that the amino acid residues at the P2 and P1 positions of the cleavage site, occupied by L and Q, respectively, were important determinants of 3CLpro substrate specificity. Finally, a direct comparison of the 3CLpro-mediated cleavages at the HD1↓3C and POL↓Zn sites was made by determining the rate constants using synthetic peptides. The results show that while a larger polypeptide substrate carrying the HD1↓3C site was processed more efficiently than a polypeptide substrate carrying the POL↓Zn site, cleavage of the synthetic peptide substrates containing these two cleavage sites occurred at similar efficiencies. This indicates that the overall conformation of a large polyprotein substrate is important in the accessibility of the cleavage site to the proteinase.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.114843526,-0.038153833,-0.007438999,-0.047404384,-0.001516366,-0.014339781,-0.047040123,-0.006196513,0.025348045,-0.062172088,-0.05942515,0.034522722,0.00448459,-0.076634724,-0.034409199,-0.01468765,0.046071608,-0.001844726,-0.007635849,-0.018222064,0.000394113,-0.023545583,-0.005615399,0.003040213,0.097520659,0.078240831,-0.037291488,-0.000490817,-0.033082711,-0.086883525
Inhibition of white spot syndrome virus in Litopenaeus vannamei shrimp by sequence-specific siRNA,"Abstract RNA interference (RNAi) is a sequence-specific, post-transcriptional process of mRNA degradation. Here, we described specific silencing of five white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) genes in Litopenaeus vannamei in vivo with sequence-specific siRNAs. These genes included DNA polymerase (dnapol), ribonucleotide reductase small subunit (rr2), thymidine kinase and thymidylate kinase (tk-tmk), vp24 and vp28. At 6 days post-challenged, the relative survival rates of shrimp injected with siDNApol, siRR2, siTK-TMK, siVP24 and siVP28 (siRNAs for dnapol, rr2, tk-tmk, vp24 and vp28 genes) reached 50%, 50%, 66%, 33% and 33%, respectively. Specific siRNAs of the five WSSV genes could result in suppression of the target genes and a significant reduction in the viral proliferation. In negative controls, sequence-independent siRNA (mutant siRNA) could not inhibit expression of these five genes or viral replication. Consequently, injection of sequence-dependent siRNA could induce anti-WSSV activity in shrimp. These results suggest that siRNA can suppress WSSV efficiently in shrimp, and it may provide a potential approach to the therapy of aquaculture viral disease.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.102786342,-0.03038049,-0.005001648,-0.069754406,-0.047184015,0.028719615,0.005709502,-0.012845127,0.029550984,-0.013520389,-0.053043865,-0.025529837,0.000664269,0.032316323,-0.000850553,-0.01193377,-0.028511864,-0.013861779,-0.024319483,-0.032548858,0.016719852,0.000797575,-0.012487212,0.04294272,-0.086070088,-0.060840171,0.024593154,0.018533828,0.052408786,-0.013405781
Lung pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): a study of 8 autopsy cases from Singapore,"Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious condition caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a new member in the family Coronaviridae. To evaluate the lung pathology in this life-threatening respiratory illness, we studied postmortem lung sections from 8 patients who died from SARS during the spring 2003 Singapore outbreak. The predominant pattern of lung injury in all 8 cases was diffuse alveolar damage. The histology varied according to the duration of illness. Cases of 10 or fewer days’ duration demonstrated acute-phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), airspace edema, and bronchiolar fibrin. Cases of more than 10 days’ duration exhibited organizing-phase DAD, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, multinucleated giant cells, and acute bronchopneumonia. In acute-phase DAD, pancytokeratin staining was positive in hyaline membranes along alveolar walls and highlighted the absence of pneumocytes. Multinucleated cells were shown to be both type II pneumocytes and macrophages by pancytokeratin, thyroid transcription factor-1, and CD68 staining. SARS-CoV RNA was identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 7 of 8 cases in fresh autopsy tissue and in 8 of 8 cases in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue, including the 1 negative case in fresh tissue. Understanding the pathology of DAD in SARS patients may provide the basis for therapeutic strategies.

Rna Viruses Redirect Host Factors to Better Amplify Their Genome,"Publisher Summary This chapter provides an updated view of the host factors that are, at present, believed to participate in replication/transcription of RNA viruses. One of the major hurdles faced when attempting to identify host factors specifically involved in viral RNA replication/transcription is how to discriminate these factors from those involved in translation. Several of the host factors shown to affect viral RNA synthesis are factors known to be involved in protein synthesis, for example, translation factors. In addition, some of the factors identified to date appear to influence viral RNA amplification as well as viral protein synthesis, and translation and replication are frequently tightly associated. Several specific host factors actively participating in viral RNA transcription/replication have been identified and the regions of host protein/replicase or host protein/viral RNA interaction have been determined. The chapter centers exclusively on those factors that appear functionally important for viral amplification. It presents a list of the viruses for which a specific host factor associates with the polymerase, affecting viral genome amplification. It also indicates the usually accepted cell function of the factor and the viral polymerase or polymerase subunit to which the host factor binds.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.197180578,-0.081606383,-0.081469734,0.109913214,-0.099763228,-0.040011567,0.07480073,0.00540168,-0.004146554,0.054820875,-0.013753868,-0.085098373,0.02930895,0.101716882,-0.026017962,0.003070485,0.014237329,-0.070473128,-0.037003679,0.114322891,-0.106626933,0.105321574,-0.120964011,-0.006580643,-0.009380998,-0.085266546,0.040213907,-0.066682628,-0.035168363,0.078384444
The Molecular Biology of Coronaviruses,"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the manipulation of clones of coronavirus and of complementary DNAs (cDNAs) of defective-interfering (DI) RNAs to study coronavirus RNA replication, transcription, recombination, processing and transport of proteins, virion assembly, identification of cell receptors for coronaviruses, and processing of the polymerase. The nature of the coronavirus genome is nonsegmented, single-stranded, and positive-sense RNA. Its size ranges from 27 to 32 kb, which is significantly larger when compared with other RNA viruses. The gene encoding the large surface glycoprotein is up to 4.4 kb, encoding an imposing trimeric, highly glycosylated protein. This soars some 20 nm above the virion envelope, giving the virus the appearance-with a little imagination-of a crown or coronet. Coronavirus research has contributed to the understanding of many aspects of molecular biology in general, such as the mechanism of RNA synthesis, translational control, and protein transport and processing.

Clinical Virology of Rhinoviruses,"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the various aspects of the clinical virology of rhinoviruses. Some attributes of the virus and epidemiology of disease that have clinical relevance, the efficiency of methods for detecting the presence of the virus in the human respiratory tract, and the means by which symptomatic illness is produced by rhinovirus infection of the respiratory tract are described Rhinoviruses cause more infections in humans than any other microorganism. The chapter also discusses the attributes of virus and the epidemiology of disease. These acid-sensitive picornaviruses infect epithelial cells following inoculation onto the nasal mucosa and are detected reliably in nasopharyngeal secretions. Rhinovirus colds occur year round, with a peak of illness in the fall. Type-specific serum antibody correlates with protection against infection. The fact that there are at least 100 different immunotypes makes development of an effective vaccine unlikely.

The Molecular Biology of Coronaviruses,"Publisher Summary Coronaviruses have recently emerged as an important group of animal and human pathogens that share a distinctive replicative cycle. Some of the unique characteristics in the replication of coronaviruses include generation of a 3' coterminal-nested set of five or six subgenomic mRNAs, each of which appears to direct the synthesis of one protein. Two virus-specific RNA polymerase activities have been identified. Many of the distinctive features of coronavirus infection and coronavirus-induced diseases may result from the properties of the two coronavirus glycoproteins. The intracellular budding site, which may be important in the establishment and maintenance of persistent infections, appears to be due to the restricted intracytoplasmic migration of the E1 glycoprotein, which acts as a matrix-like transmembrane glycoprotein. E1 also exhibits distinctive behavior by self-aggregating on heating at 100°C in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and by its interaction with RNA in the viral nucleocapsid. The E1 of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is an O-linked glycoprotein, unlike most other viral glycoproteins. Thus, the coronavirus system may be a useful model for the study of synthesis, glycosylation, and transport of O-linked cellular glycoproteins.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.119547244,-0.023611535,-0.058369519,0.028839379,0.013825761,-0.035961748,-0.001056772,-0.002913889,0.018051951,0.009350875,-0.008952941,-0.042159429,0.059019341,0.0236364,0.033108628,0.003564903,0.004179832,0.019554441,0.000935108,0.048862409,-0.019241337,-0.018274048,-0.030228072,-0.005134151,0.083558658,0.021917336,-0.020186329,-0.027048425,-0.017271758,-0.015862088
Chapter Three The Nonstructural Proteins Directing Coronavirus RNA Synthesis and Processing,"Abstract Coronaviruses are animal and human pathogens that can cause lethal zoonotic infections like SARS and MERS. They have polycistronic plus-stranded RNA genomes and belong to the order Nidovirales, a diverse group of viruses for which common ancestry was inferred from the common principles underlying their genome organization and expression, and from the conservation of an array of core replicase domains, including key RNA-synthesizing enzymes. Coronavirus genomes (~26–32 kilobases) are the largest RNA genomes known to date and their expansion was likely enabled by acquiring enzyme functions that counter the commonly high error frequency of viral RNA polymerases. The primary functions that direct coronavirus RNA synthesis and processing reside in nonstructural protein (nsp) 7 to nsp16, which are cleavage products of two large replicase polyproteins translated from the coronavirus genome. Significant progress has now been made regarding their structural and functional characterization, stimulated by technical advances like improved methods for bioinformatics and structural biology, in vitro enzyme characterization, and site-directed mutagenesis of coronavirus genomes. Coronavirus replicase functions include more or less universal activities of plus-stranded RNA viruses, like an RNA polymerase (nsp12) and helicase (nsp13), but also a number of rare or even unique domains involved in mRNA capping (nsp14, nsp16) and fidelity control (nsp14). Several smaller subunits (nsp7–nsp10) act as crucial cofactors of these enzymes and contribute to the emerging “nsp interactome.” Understanding the structure, function, and interactions of the RNA-synthesizing machinery of coronaviruses will be key to rationalizing their evolutionary success and the development of improved control strategies.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.20118527,0.025102969,-0.13572408,0.143986833,0.024492019,-0.080677922,0.022891233,0.035422447,-0.031588936,0.041554026,0.039146231,0.0331774,0.038144685,-0.050652928,-0.039151412,-0.025225253,0.058904022,-0.057116126,-0.032424588,0.036259987,-0.040979876,-0.008709371,-0.030317917,-0.050509096,-0.011188597,-0.022181864,-0.059617267,0.00901975,-0.003403529,-0.083731286
Conventional and nonconventional roles of the nucleolus,"Abstract As the most prominent of subnuclear structures, the nucleolus has a well-established role in ribosomal subunit assembly. Additional nucleolar functions, not related to ribosome biogenesis, have been discovered within the last decade. Built around multiple copies of the genes for preribosomal RNA (rDNA), nucleolar structure is largely dependent on the process of ribosome assembly. The nucleolus is disassembled during mitosis at which time preribosomal RNA transcription and processing are suppressed; it is reassembled at the end of mitosis in part from components preserved from the previous cell cycle. Expression of preribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) is regulated by the silencing of individual rDNA genes via alterations in chromatin structure or by controlling RNA polymerase I initiation complex formation. Preribosomal RNA processing and posttranscriptional modifications are guided by a multitude of small nucleolar RNAs. Nearly completed ribosomal subunits are exported to the cytoplasm by an established nuclear export system with the aid of specialized adapter molecules. Some preribosomal and nucleolar components are transiently localized in Cajal bodies, presumably for modification or assembly. The nonconventional functions of nucleolus include roles in viral infections, nuclear export, sequestration of regulatory molecules, modification of small RNAs, RNP assembly, and control of aging, although some of these functions are not well established. Additional progress in defining the mechanisms of each step in ribosome biogenesis as well as clarification of the precise role of the nucleolus in nonconventional activities is expected in the next decade.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.146627567,-0.045003627,-0.023822121,0.009575898,-0.051676907,-0.026689758,0.020038722,0.013864183,0.006943869,-0.021664947,-0.016474832,-0.00296506,-0.011458805,0.022573574,0.004314341,0.030536223,-0.005586776,-0.036244252,-0.050894327,-0.013477172,-0.019641436,0.016444361,-0.051256719,-0.044953592,-0.015612539,-0.05514127,-0.022007584,0.027173417,0.066220999,-0.035398723
Effectiveness of hand hygiene and provision of information in preventing influenza cases requiring hospitalization,"Abstract Background The objective of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions in preventing cases of influenza requiring hospitalization. Methods We performed a multicenter case-control study in 36 hospitals, in 2010 in Spain. Hospitalized influenza cases confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and three matched controls (two hospital and one community control) per case were selected. The use of non-pharmacological measures seven days before the onset of symptoms (frequency of hand washing, use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers and handwashing after touching contaminated surfaces) was collected. Results We studied 813 cases hospitalized for influenza and 2274 controls. The frequency of hand washing 5-10 times (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=0.65) and >10 times (aOR=0.59) and handwashing after contact with contaminated surfaces (aOR=0.65) were protective factors and were dose-responsive (p<0.001). Alcohol-based hand sanitizers were associated with marginal benefits (aOR=0.82).

Structure of the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Polymerase Complex,"Summary Numerous interventions are in clinical development for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, including small molecules that target viral transcription and replication. These processes are catalyzed by a complex comprising the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and the tetrameric phosphoprotein (P). RSV P recruits multiple proteins to the polymerase complex and, with the exception of its oligomerization domain, is thought to be intrinsically disordered. Despite their critical roles in RSV transcription and replication, structures of L and P have remained elusive. Here, we describe the 3.2-Å cryo-EM structure of RSV L bound to tetrameric P. The structure reveals a striking tentacular arrangement of P, with each of the four monomers adopting a distinct conformation. The structure also rationalizes inhibitor escape mutants and mutations observed in live-attenuated vaccine candidates. These results provide a framework for determining the molecular underpinnings of RSV replication and transcription and should facilitate the design of effective RSV inhibitors.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.049117566,-0.105093484,-0.087621367,0.126513334,-0.05696084,-0.054713559,0.067847589,-0.0886421,0.122452497,-0.041404007,0.062992443,-0.058711081,-0.152501964,-0.038274385,-0.087003104,-0.015761944,-0.014315196,0.080733158,-0.05228794,0.021128524,0.013674471,-0.119935109,-0.012771675,-0.074188131,0.136848784,-0.198956026,0.243491391,0.1105491,-0.034992119,0.038611642
Detection and monitoring of virus infections by real-time PCR,"Abstract The employment of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques for virus detection and quantification offers the advantages of high sensitivity and reproducibility, combined with an extremely broad dynamic range. A number of qualitative and quantitative PCR virus assays have been described, but commercial PCR kits are available for quantitative analysis of a limited number of clinically important viruses only. In addition to permitting the assessment of viral load at a given time point, quantitative PCR tests offer the possibility of determining the dynamics of virus proliferation, monitoring of the response to treatment and, in viruses displaying persistence in defined cell types, distinction between latent and active infection. Moreover, from a technical point of view, the employment of sequential quantitative PCR assays in virus monitoring helps identifying false positive results caused by inadvertent contamination of samples with traces of viral nucleic acids or PCR products. In this review, we provide a survey of the current state-of-the-art in the application of the real-time PCR technology to virus analysis.

Postexposure protection of non-human primates against a lethal Ebola virus challenge with RNA interference: a proof-of-concept study,"Summary Background We previously showed that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV) RNA polymerase L protein formulated in stable nucleic acid-lipid particles (SNALPs) completely protected guineapigs when administered shortly after a lethal ZEBOV challenge. Although rodent models of ZEBOV infection are useful for screening prospective countermeasures, they are frequently not useful for prediction of efficacy in the more stringent non-human primate models. We therefore assessed the efficacy of modified non-immunostimulatory siRNAs in a uniformly lethal non-human primate model of ZEBOV haemorrhagic fever. Methods A combination of modified siRNAs targeting the ZEBOV L polymerase (EK-1 mod), viral protein (VP) 24 (VP24-1160 mod), and VP35 (VP35-855 mod) were formulated in SNALPs. A group of macaques (n=3) was given these pooled anti-ZEBOV siRNAs (2 mg/kg per dose, bolus intravenous infusion) after 30 min, and on days 1, 3, and 5 after challenge with ZEBOV. A second group of macaques (n=4) was given the pooled anti-ZEBOV siRNAs after 30 min, and on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 after challenge with ZEBOV. Findings Two (66%) of three rhesus monkeys given four postexposure treatments of the pooled anti-ZEBOV siRNAs were protected from lethal ZEBOV infection, whereas all macaques given seven postexposure treatments were protected. The treatment regimen in the second study was well tolerated with minor changes in liver enzymes that might have been related to viral infection. Interpretation This complete postexposure protection against ZEBOV in non-human primates provides a model for the treatment of ZEBOV-induced haemorrhagic fever. These data show the potential of RNA interference as an effective postexposure treatment strategy for people infected with Ebola virus, and suggest that this strategy might also be useful for treatment of other emerging viral infections.

Development of robust in vitro RNA-dependent RNA polymerase assay as a possible platform for antiviral drug testing against dengue,"Abstract NS5 is the largest and most conserved protein among the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. It has been the target of interest for antiviral drug development due to its major role in replication. NS5 consists of two domains, the N-terminal methyltransferase domain and C-terminal catalytic RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain. It is an unstable protein and is prone to inactivation upon prolonged incubation at room temperature, thus affecting the inhibitor screening assays. In the current study, we expressed and purified DENV RdRp alone in Esherichia coli (E. coli) cells. The N-terminally His-tagged construct of DENV RdRp was transformed into E. coli expression strain BL-21 (DE3) pLysS cells. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 0.4mM. The induced cultures were then grown for 20h at 18°C and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000xg for 15min at 4°C. The recombinant protein was purified using HisTrap affinity column (Ni-NTA) and then the sample was subjected to size exclusion chromatography, which successfully removed the degradation product obtained during the previous purification step. The in vitro polymerase activity of RdRp was successfully demonstrated using homopolymeric polycytidylic acid (poly(rC)) RNA template. This study describes the high level production of enzymatically active DENV RdRp protein which can be used to develop assays for testing large number of compounds in a high-throughput manner. RdRp has the de novo initiation activity and the in vitro polymerase assays for the protein provide a platform for highly robust and efficient antiviral compound screening systems.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.223876816,-0.029646825,-0.040730516,0.067984814,-0.118239963,-0.010384022,0.05921736,-0.025541619,0.008698192,0.00564155,0.011238076,0.11893318,-0.082395961,-0.008255428,-0.103987532,-0.074612557,0.099434512,-0.047363968,0.02791822,-0.048949206,0.028119955,-0.023581311,0.090869357,-0.07946112,0.083900071,0.169691562,0.060515754,0.000532266,0.037244902,0.091892434

Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's swine influenza (H1N1) pneumonia diagnostic weighted point score system for hospitalized adults with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) and negative rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs),"Background In spring 2009, a novel strain of influenza A originating in Veracruz, Mexico, quickly spread to the United States and throughout the world. This influenza A virus was the product of gene reassortment of 4 different genetic elements: human influenza, swine influenza, avian influenza, and Eurasian swine influenza. In the United States, New York was the epicenter of the swine influenza (H1N1) pandemic. Hospital emergency departments (EDs) were inundated with patients with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) requesting screening for H1N1. Our ED screening, as well as many others, used a rapid screening test for influenza A (QuickVue A/B) because H1N1 was a variant of influenza A. The definitive laboratory test i.e., RT-PCR for H1N1 was developed by the Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, GA) and subsequently distributed to health departments. Because of the extraordinary volume of test requests, health authorities restricted reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Hence most EDs, including our own, were dependent on rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) for swine influenza. A positive rapid influenza A test was usually predictive of RT-PCR H1N1 positivity, but the rapid influenza A screening test (QuickVue A/B) was associated with 30% false negatives. The inability to rely on RIDTs for H1N1 diagnosis resulted in underdiagnosing H1N1. Confronted with adults admitted with ILIs, negative RIDTs, and restricted RT-PCR testing, there was a critical need to develop clinical criteria to diagnose probable swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia. Methods During the pandemic, the Infectious Disease Division at Winthrop-University Hospital developed clinical criteria for adult admitted patients with ILIs and negative RIDTs. Similar to the one developed for the clinical diagnosis of legionnaire's disease. The Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's diagnostic weighted point score system for swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia is based on key clinical and laboratory features. Results During the “herald” wave of the swine influenza H1N1 pandemic, the diagnostic weighted point score system accurately identified probable swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia and accurately differentiated swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia from ILIs and other viral and bacterial community-acquired pneumonias. Conclusion In hospitalized adults with ILIs and negative RIDTs, the diagnostic weighted diagnostic point score system, may be used to make a presumptive clinical diagnosis of swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.162502485,-0.053311721,0.054408815,0.197153454,-0.065443333,0.357070587,-0.221264995,0.061698655,-0.118053589,-0.109291699,0.000200724,0.04685183,0.024186617,-0.018185542,-0.014601435,0.012294726,0.009832097,0.054430849,-0.107644546,-0.042897453,-0.009721679,0.017402285,0.016972961,-0.095883741,-0.060403317,0.037261956,-0.049131445,0.003326617,0.03939382,0.095502055
Rapid clinical diagnosis in fatal swine influenza (H1N1) pneumonia in an adult with negative rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs): Diagnostic swine influenza triad,"Background The “herald wave” of the H1N1 pandemic spread from Mexico to the United States in spring 2009. Initially, the epicenter of H1N1 in the United States was in the New York area. Our hospital, like others, was inundated with large numbers of patients who presented at the Emergency Department (ED) with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) for swine influenza testing and evaluation. Methods The Winthrop-University Hospital ED used rapid influenza (QuickVue A/B) tests to screen for H1N1 infection. Patients who were rapid influenza A test-positive were also reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive for H1N1. In our ED, 30% of patients with ILIs and possible H1N1 pneumonia had negative rapid influenza A screening tests. Because H1N1 RT-PCR testing was restricted, there was no laboratory test to confirm or rule out H1N1. Other rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs), e.g., the respiratory fluorescent antibody (FA) viral panel test, were used to identify H1N1 patients with negative RIDTs. Results Unfortunately, there was not a good correlation between RIDT results and RT-PCR results. There was a critical need to develop a clinical syndromic approach for diagnosing hospitalized adults with probable H1N1 pneumonia with negative RIDTs. Early in the pandemic, the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division developed a diagnostic weighted point score system to diagnose H1N1 pneumonia clinically in RIDT-negative adults. The point score system worked well, but was time-consuming. As the “herald wave” of the pandemic progressed, our ED staff needed a rapid, simplified method to diagnose probable H1N1 pneumonia in hospitalized adults with negative RIDTs. A rapid and simplified diagnosis was based on the diagnostic weighted point score system, which we simplified into a triad of key, nonspecific laboratory indicators. In adults hospitalized with an ILI, a fever >102°F with severe myalgias, and a chest x-ray without focal segmental/lobar infiltrates, the presence of three indicators, i.e., otherwise unexplained relative lymphopenia, elevated serum transaminases, and an elevated creatinine phosphokinase, constituted the diagnostic swine influenza triad. The Infectious Disease Division's diagnostic swine flu triad was used effectively as the pandemic progressed, and was not only useful in correctly diagnosing probable H1N1 pneumonia in hospitalized adults with negative RIDTs, but was also in ruling out mimics of swine influenza, e.g., exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, asthma, or congestive heart failure, as well as bacterial community-acquired pneumonias (CAPs), e.g., legionnaire's disease. Conclusion Clinicians can use the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's Diagnostic swine influenza triad to make a rapid clinical diagnosis of probable H1N1 pneumonia in hospitalized adult patients with negative RIDTs.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.165450469,-0.019511096,0.040981816,0.090945226,-0.092255283,0.202457401,-0.1667903,0.083944062,-0.129377417,-0.047444283,-0.012573219,0.044416336,0.031372799,-0.009968172,-0.024070068,0.021690599,0.006098141,0.069928223,-0.109356442,-0.040660456,-0.001552072,-0.008178856,-0.002926226,-0.114340241,-0.059117749,0.049439085,-0.03921898,0.003034615,0.013379807,0.11038088
Rapid clinical diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease during the “herald wave” of the swine influenza (H1N1) pandemic: The Legionnaires' disease triad,"Background In adults hospitalized with atypical community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), Legionnaires' disease is not uncommon. Legionnaire's disease can be differentiated from typical CAPs and from other atypical CAPs based on its characteristic pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement. The first clinically useful diagnostic weighted point score system for the clinical diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was developed by the Infectious Disease Division at Winthrop-University Hospital in the 1980s. It has proven to be diagnostically accurate and useful for more than two decades, but was time-consuming. Because Legionella spp. diagnostic tests are time-dependent and problematic, a need was perceived for a rapid, simple way to render a clinical, syndromic diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease pending Legionella test results. During the “herald wave” of the swine influenza (H1N1) pandemic in the New York area, our hospital, like others, was inundated with patients who presented to the Emergency Department with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) for H1N1 testing/evaluation. Most patients with ILIs did not have swine influenza. Hospitalized patients with ILIs who tested positive with rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) were placed on influenza precautions and treated with oseltamivir. Unfortunately, approximately 30% of adult patients admitted with an ILI had negative RIDTs. Because the definitive laboratory diagnosis of H1N1 pneumonia by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR), testing was restricted by health departments, resulted in clinical and infection control dilemmas in determining which RIDT-negative patients did, in fact, have H1N1 pneumonia. Objective Accordingly, a diagnostic weighted point score system was developed for H1N1 pneumonia patients, based on RT-PCR positivity by the Infectious Disease Division at Winthrop-University Hospital. This diagnostic point score system for hospitalized adults with negative RIDTs was time-consuming. As the pandemic progressed, a simplified diagnostic swine influenza (H1N1) triad was developed for the rapid clinical diagnosis of probable H1N1 pneumonia, which also differentiated it from its mimics as well as from bacterial pneumonia, eg, Legionnaires' disease. During the “herald wave” of the H1N1 pandemic, we noticed an unexplained increase in Legionnaires' disease CAPs. Because clinical resources were stressed to the maximum during the pandemic, it was critically important to rapidly identify patients rapidly with Legionnaire's disease who did not require influenza precautions or oseltamivir, but who did require anti-Legionella antimicrobial therapy. Methods Based on the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's diagnostic weighted point score system for Legionnaires' disease (modified), key indicators were identified and became the basis for the diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad. The diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad was used to make a clinical diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease until the results of Legionella diagnostic tests were reported. The diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad diagnosed Legionnaires' disease in hospitalized adults with CAPs with extrapulmonary findings (atypical CAP) and relative bradycardia, accompanied by any three (ie, a triad) of the following: otherwise unexplained relative lymphopenia, early/mildly elevated serum transaminases (SGOT/SGPT), highly increased ferritin levels (≥2 × n), or hypophosphatemia. The diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad provides clinicians with a rapid way to clinically diagnose Legionnaires' disease, pending Legionella test results. Results The accuracy of the diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad was confirmed in our 9 cases of Legionnaires' disease by subsequent Legionella diagnostic testing. Conclusions The diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad is particularly useful in situations where a rapid clinical syndromic diagnosis is needed, ie, during an H1N1 pandemic.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.108705835,-0.008376651,0.041758392,0.006535122,-0.089750516,0.11691282,-0.076515424,0.070410198,-0.092608195,0.006785183,-0.019163208,0.026553316,0.045216693,-0.044547561,-0.027946552,0.019491043,-0.015556456,0.072228351,-0.09536615,-0.017082968,0.014944763,-0.008936406,0.016868038,-0.094000669,-0.0144164,0.009888102,-0.02788586,-0.000645766,0.018603233,0.059414394
"Natural bovine lentiviral type 1 infection in Holstein dairy cattle. I. Clinical, serological, and pathological observations","Abstract Clinical, serological, and pathological abnormalities observed in Holstein cows naturally infected with bovine lentivirus 1 bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) and other infections were progressive and most commonly associated with weight loss, lymphoid system deficiency, and behavioral changes. Clinical evidence of meningoencephalitis was dullness, stupor, and occasional head or nose pressing postures. The polymerase chain reactions associated the BIV provirus with the lesions in the central nervous system and lymphoid tissues. Multiple concurrent infections developed in retrovirally infected cows undergoing normal stresses associated with parturition and lactation. A major functional correlate of the lymphoreticular alterations was the development of multiple secondary infections which failed to resolve after appropriate antibacterial therapy. The chronic disease syndrome in dairy cows associated with BIV may be useful as a model system for investigation of the pathogenesis of the nervous system lesions and lymphoid organ changes that occur in humans with lentiviral infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.005329759,-0.018025633,0.001143336,-0.08970685,-0.035775017,0.018291566,0.039501884,-0.013944078,0.027911145,0.014610844,0.019219936,-0.011762939,0.027708995,-0.022740557,0.043207443,-0.000321008,-0.032084278,0.016009199,-0.018472083,0.015787545,0.028526839,-0.029663874,-0.046669478,0.007787762,0.036019951,-0.021647789,-0.033546943,-0.051528383,0.022270568,-0.016239866
Prevalence of Leishmania infantum and co-infections in stray cats in northern Italy,"Abstract Stray cats in the city of Milan, Italy, were tested for Leishmania infantum and other selected infections. Twenty-seven cats (30.0%) were seroreactive by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), with an antibody titer of 1:40 for 16 (17.7%) cats and 1:80 (cut-off for feline L. infantum infection) for 11 (12.2%) cats. One blood (1.1%) and one popliteal lymph node (1.1%) sample tested positive by real-time polymerase chain reaction; no oculoconjunctival swabs tested positive. Feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukemia virus, and feline coronavirus (FCoV) seroprevalence determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was 6.1, 6.1, and 39.0%, respectively. Toxoplasma gondii, Bartonella henselae, and Chlamydophila felis prevalence determined by IFAT was 29.3, 17.1, and 17.1%, respectively. The frequency of seroreactivity to L. infantum was significantly higher in FCoV-seropositive cats (OR=4.4, P =0.04). L. infantum-infected stray cats in Milan have a high seropositivity rate, comparable to that of cats in areas endemic for leishmaniosis.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.01316055,-0.009747118,0.079399511,-0.188133029,0.012835925,0.026583923,0.038167211,-0.004524354,-0.053342549,-0.197464234,0.45791141,-0.152550546,0.234865637,-0.047084365,-0.125414429,-0.048763812,0.05309004,-0.017525177,0.036817931,0.089912779,-0.020764855,-0.037602996,0.072137642,0.004541298,-0.025194796,0.067376184,-0.000578704,0.053715316,0.008323804,-0.012283519
Viral interference between H9N2-low pathogenic avian influenza virus and avian infectious bronchitis virus vaccine strain H120 in vivo,"Abstract The interaction between a low pathogenic avian influenza virus (A/CK/TUN/145/2012), a H9N2 Tunisian isolate, and a vaccine strain (H120) of avian infectious bronchitis, administered simultaneously or sequentially three days apart to chicks during 20 days, was evaluated using ELISA antibody levels, quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses and histopathology examination. First, the in vivo replication interference of avian influenza virus (AIV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was evaluated using qRT-PCR to detect accurately either AIV or IBV genomes or viral copy numbers during dual infections. Second, we have determined the amount of specific antibodies in sera of chick’s infected with AIV alone, IBV alone, mixed AIV + IBV, IBV then AIV or AIV IBV 3 days later using an ELISA test. Finally, histopathological analyses of internal organs from inoculated chicks were realized. Quantitative results of AIV and IBV co-infection showed that interferences between the two viruses yielded decreased viral growth. However, in the case of super-infection, the second virus, either AIV or IBV, induced a decrease in the growth of the first inoculated virus. According to our results, vaccine application was safe and do not interfere with AIV H9N2 infection, and does not enhance such infection. In conclusion, co-infection of chicks with AIV and IBV, simultaneously or sequentially, affected the clinical signs, the virus replication dynamics as well as the internal organ integrity. The results proposed that infection with heterologous virus may result in temporary competition for cell receptors or competent cells for replication, most likely interferon-mediated.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.028377046,-0.038125511,0.067592406,-0.062961164,0.078802024,0.132520741,-0.146916172,-0.083710199,0.116081334,0.29671358,0.09760825,-0.0360465,-0.064236156,0.107554744,-0.10092726,0.15213768,0.014445766,-0.011093126,0.020061382,0.036584175,-0.049155794,-0.017339283,0.006011498,-0.058646611,-0.005014956,0.022891827,-0.022915759,0.012452877,0.020168593,-0.019024219
Persistence of Viruses in Upper Respiratory Tract of Children with Asthma,"Abstract Objectives: Nasopharyngeal swabs of 50 asthmatic children in the symptom-free period were examined for the presence of adenoviruses, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses. A control group of 20 healthy individuals was included in this study. Methods: A polymerase chain reaction was used to detect adenovirus DNA and rhinovirus and coronavirus complementary DNA. The fragments of amplified genetic material were visualized with the use of agarose gel electrophoresis. Results: Adenovirus DNA was found in 78.4% of asthmatic children, rhinovirus RNA in 32.4% and coronavirus RNA in 2.7%. Adenovirus DNA was detected in one of the 20 nasopharyngeal swabs of healthy controls; the rest of the control samples were negative.

Unique reassortant of influenza A(H7N9) virus associated with severe disease emerging in Hong Kong,"Summary Objective Human infections caused by avian influenza virus A(H7N9) re-emerged in late 2013. We reported the first Hong Kong patient without risk factors for severe A(H7N9) disease. Methods Direct sequencing was performed on the endotracheal aspirate collected from a 36-year-old female with history of poultry contact. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to compare the current strain and previous A(H7N9) isolates. Results The influenza A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 virus strain was detected in a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome, deranged liver function and coagulation profile, cytopenia, and rhabdomyolysis. The HA, NA and MP genes of A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 cluster with those of other human A(H7N9) strains. The PB1, PB2 and NS genes are most closely related to those of A/Guangdong/1/2013 strain identified in August 2013, but are distinct from those of other human and avian A(H7N9) strains. The other internal genes NP and PA genes are more closely related to those of non-A(H7N9) avian influenza A viruses. A unique PA L336M mutation, associated with increased polymerase activity, was found. The patient required salvage by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Conclusions The A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 virus is a novel reassortant derived from A/Guangdong/1/2013 virus.

Identifcation of differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs in CD4+ T cells response to latent tuberculosis infection,"Summary Objective To identify differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in CD4+ T cells triggered upon latent tuberculosis (TB) infection. Methods Expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in CD4+ T cells from individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI), active TB and healthy controls were analyzed by microarray assay and four lncRNAs were selected for validation using real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway based approaches were used to investigate biological functions and signaling pathways affected by the differentially expressed mRNAs. Results LncRNAs and mRNAs in CD4+ T cells were involved in LTBI and active TB disease. Compared with healthy controls, 449 lncRNAs and 461 mRNAs were deregulated in LTBI group, 1,113 lncRNAs and 1,490 mRNAs were deregulated in active TB group, as well as 163 lncRNAs and 187 mRNAs were differentially expressed in both LTBI and active TB group. It was worth noting that 41 lncRNAs and 60 mRNAs were deregulated between three groups. Most deregulated lncRNAs were from intergenic regions (∼50%), natural antisense to protein-coding loci (∼20%), or intronic antisense to protein-coding loci (∼10%). Significantly enriched signaling pathways based on deregulated mRNAs were mainly involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, etc. Conclusions The study was the first report of differentially expressed lncRNAs in CD4+ T cells response to TB infection and indicated that some lncRNAs may be involved in regulating host immune response to TB infection. Future studies are needed to further elucidate potential roles of these deregulated lncRNAs in LTBI and its reactivation.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.062731213,-0.028876753,0.009410394,-0.098246941,-0.04557825,0.024118549,0.00546643,-0.018280452,0.032168286,-0.057212827,-0.054657115,-0.026516356,-0.01435524,0.03419774,-0.015664806,0.015883805,-0.002842111,-0.037670527,-0.010184474,-0.018919627,0.004951687,-0.002235549,-0.003488979,-0.009368666,-0.01075787,-0.022832666,0.004380437,0.001682853,0.032013056,-0.015749197
Genotype shift in human coronavirus OC43 and emergence of a novel genotype by natural recombination,"Summary Background Human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 is the most prevalent HCoV in respiratory tract infections. Its molecular epidemiological characterization, particularly the genotyping, was poorly addressed. Methods The full-length spike (S), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and nucleocapsid (N) genes were amplified from each respiratory sample collected from 65 HCoV-OC43-positive patients between 2005 and 2012. Genotypes were determined by phylogenetic analysis. Recombination was analyzed based on full-length viral genome sequences. Clinical manifestations of each HCoV genotype infection were compared by reviewing clinical records. Results Sixty of these 65 samples belong to genotypes B, C and D. The remaining five strains had incongruent positions in the phylogenetic trees of the S, RdRp and N genes, suggesting a novel genotype emerging, designated as genotype E. Whole genome sequencing and bootscan analysis indicated that genotype E is generated by recombination between genotypes B, C and D. Temporal analysis revealed a sequential genotype replacement of C, B, D and E over the study period with genotype D being the dominant genotype since 2007. The novel genotype E was only detected in children younger than three years suffering from lower respiratory tract infections. Conclusions Our results suggest that HCoV-OC43 genotypes are evolving. Such genotype shift may be an adapting mechanism for HCoV-OC43 maintaining its epidemic.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.023619517,-0.040844548,-0.061595294,-0.031543659,0.183542287,-0.0733908,0.058951777,-0.041848315,0.083605531,-0.027357377,-0.005351369,0.371821876,0.211622196,0.113453995,0.004976638,0.030949358,-0.074585,-0.00907459,-0.052970787,-0.015671731,0.036379662,-0.027713097,0.043192988,-0.0074594,-0.033130812,-0.051469216,0.080336061,-0.002797055,0.010532981,0.08105609
Aetiology of febrile pharyngitis in children: Potential of myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) as a biomarker of viral infection,"Summary Objectives Besides group A streptococcus (GAS), microbial causes of pharyngitis in children are not well known. We aimed to document the viral and bacterial aetiology of pharyngitis and to assess the pathogenic role of viruses by determining the myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) in the blood as a marker of interferon response. Methods In this prospective observational study, throat swabs and blood samples were collected from children (age 1–16 years) presenting to the emergency department with febrile pharyngitis. Microbial cause was sought by bacterial culture, polymerase chain reaction, and serology. Blood MxA level was determined. Results A potential pathogen was detected in 88% of 83 patients: GAS alone in 10%, GAS and viruses in 13%, group C or G streptococci alone in 2% and together with viruses in 3%, and viruses alone in 59% of cases. Enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, and adenoviruses were the most frequently detected viruses. Blood MxA levels were higher in children with viral (880 [245–1250] μg/L; median [IQR]) or concomitant GAS-viral (340 [150–710] μg/L) than in those with sole GAS (105 [80–160] μg/L) infections. Conclusions Detection of respiratory viruses simultaneously with elevated blood MxA levels supports the causative role of viruses in the majority of children with pharyngitis.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.093665319,-0.078126681,-0.036236935,-0.033241793,0.001709894,-0.038162427,0.066402535,-0.024123862,-0.028324891,0.023185083,0.007345642,-0.042599578,-0.008006012,-0.021985658,0.004814916,-0.020838047,-0.01334104,-0.058523413,0.017926529,-0.019320317,-0.039122813,0.081218939,0.013148545,0.052279341,-0.046432712,0.036361494,-0.004502137,-0.020982366,0.006547705,-0.043939117
Early inhibitors of human cytomegalovirus: State-of-art and therapeutic perspectives,"Abstract Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is associated with severe morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals, mainly transplant recipients and AIDS patients, and is the most frequent cause of congenital malformations in newborn children. To date, few drugs are licensed for the treatment of HCMV infections, most of which target the viral DNA polymerase and suffer from many drawbacks, including long-term toxicity, low potency, and poor bioavailability. In addition, the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains is becoming an increasing problem for disease management. Finally, none of the current anti-HCMV drugs have been approved for the treatment of congenital infections. For all these reasons, there is still a strong need for new anti-HCMV drugs with novel mechanisms of action. The first events of the virus replication cycle, including attachment, entry, immediate-early gene expression, and immediate-early functions—in particular that of Immediate-Early 2 protein—represent attractive targets for the development of novel antiviral compounds. Such inhibitors would block not only the expression of viral immediate-early proteins, which play a key role in the pathogenesis of HCMV infection, but also the host immunomodulation and the changes to cell physiology induced by the first events of virus infection. This review describes the current knowledge on the initial phases of HCMV replication, their validation as potential novel antiviral targets, and the development of compounds that block such processes.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.052495493,-0.035282713,-0.047401101,-0.026385576,-0.136049105,0.103250996,0.11498616,-0.026965621,0.069483828,0.06687138,-0.036651392,-0.008770407,0.056215888,0.028489922,-0.002557325,-0.016983027,-0.032919437,0.098233082,0.018065302,0.054459254,-0.001695342,0.048496344,-0.084554695,0.061382055,0.037009827,0.00265067,0.057924444,-0.058314015,0.064061849,0.037244839
Antibody and cytokine responses in kittens during the development of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP),"Abstract Two recombinant FIPV spike proteins were assessed for their immunogenic properties in 8-week-old kittens, which were then challenged intranasally with FIPV 79-1146. Humoral responses were assessed by ELISA and serum neutralisation test. Changes in PBMC cytokine mRNA levels were detected by a reverse transcription, semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-sqPCR), assessing IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IFNγ. All of the kittens developed clinical signs typical of FIP, which were confirmed on gross post mortem examination. The recombinant proteins induced little or no specific antibody response prior to challenge, and failed to alter the course of disease compared to controls. One week after virus challenge, the stimulated PBMCs showed small increases in the expression of IL-6 and IFNγ mRNA, which correlated with a transient pyrexia. After this time expression of IL-6 mRNA remained unaltered but, as FIP developed, mRNA levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and IFNγ became markedly depressed.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.035396998,-0.011487383,0.040720384,-0.158428111,-0.080869281,0.01905334,0.008647398,-0.0484958,0.044980024,-0.116851082,0.013049635,-0.071520817,-0.011817981,0.097066007,-0.067693493,0.023369372,0.011186946,-0.070348063,-0.033344508,-0.062358861,0.020692659,-0.072337212,0.066452113,0.005978955,-0.045211685,-0.050501306,0.064635573,0.045112649,0.076753641,-0.016204967
Quantitative real-time PCR for the measurement of feline cytokine mRNA,"Abstract We have developed real-time PCR systems to quantitate feline cytokine gene expression. The method is based on the cleavage of fluorescent dye-labelled probes by the 5′–3′ exonuclease activity of the Taq DNA polymerase during PCR and measurement of fluorescence intensity by a Sequence Detection System. The feline-specific TaqMan probes were designed to encompass an intron, thus allowing differentiation of complementary DNA versus genomic DNA amplification products. Quantitative analysis of cytokine cDNA concentrations was performed in comparison to feline GAPDH. Messenger RNA (mRNA) from the universally expressed housekeeping gene GAPDH proved to be useful as an amplification control and allowed for correction of variations in the efficiencies of RNA extraction and reverse transcription. GAPDH mRNAs were readily detectable in cDNAs prepared from unstimulated feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and from frozen cell pellets, while cytokines (Interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-12 p35, IL-12 p40, IFNγ, IL-16) were expressed at variable amounts. IFNγ transcription was found to be upregulated in stimulated PBMCs and feline cell lines. The synthesis of cDNA and the performance of the PCR in separate tubes proved to be of superior sensitivity compared to a single-tube based system. The assays described are highly reproducible, require no post-PCR manipulation of the amplicons and permit the analysis of several hundred PCR reactions per day. With this method it is possible to detect and quantify cytokine mRNA expression reliably in small amounts of cells even after storage of samples for at least 5 years.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.073123151,0.028648154,0.156343065,-0.072688798,-0.064035779,-0.033904499,-0.015351584,-0.042711663,0.013994182,-0.099112917,0.040155876,-0.11808614,0.090848574,0.070243085,-0.073399964,0.018934266,-0.002764022,-0.070567703,-0.013024499,-0.0950852,-0.004028967,-0.027546042,0.108550751,-0.021878305,-0.085549988,-0.08429223,0.014046965,0.058285265,0.029534079,0.040705386
Avian influenza A (H5N1) infection: targets and strategies for chemotherapeutic intervention,"In an avian flu pandemic, which drugs could be used to treat or prevent infection with influenza A (H5N1) virus? Foremost are the viral neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, which have already been used to treat human influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B virus infections. The use of the M2 ion channel blockers amantadine and rimantadine is compounded by the rapid development of drug resistance. Although formally approved for other indications (i.e. treatment of hepatitis C), ribavirin and pegylated interferon might also be useful for controlling avian flu. Combined use of the currently available drugs should be taken into account and attempts should be made to develop new strategies directed at unexplored targets such as the viral proteins hemagglutinin, the viral polymerase (and endonuclease) and the non-structural protein NS1. As has been shown for other viral infections, RNA interference could be a powerful means with which to suppress the replication of avian H5N1.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.03122468,-0.078444385,-0.034922148,0.144319127,-0.11657848,0.244948751,-0.007071534,-0.016604507,0.022898337,0.043342157,-0.000762811,-0.009398153,0.071878867,-0.00389871,0.00447795,-0.016599791,-0.02049212,0.10063384,0.012270801,0.061631521,-0.001986552,0.033672282,-0.079055854,0.054585696,-0.009227016,0.020439324,0.02430456,-0.086331042,0.080277822,0.073457574
"Recombinase polymerase amplification: Basics, applications and recent advances","Abstract Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is a highly sensitive and selective isothermal amplification technique, operating at 37–42°C, with minimal sample preparation and capable of amplifying as low as 1–10 DNA target copies in less than 20 min. It has been used to amplify diverse targets, including RNA, miRNA, ssDNA and dsDNA from a wide variety of organisms and samples. An ever increasing number of publications detailing the use of RPA are appearing and amplification has been carried out in solution phase, solid phase as well as in a bridge amplification format. Furthermore, RPA has been successfully integrated with different detection strategies, from end-point lateral flow strips to real-time fluorescent detection amongst others.

LAMP-on-a-chip: Revising microfluidic platforms for loop-mediated DNA amplification,"Abstract Nucleic acid amplification for the detection of infectious diseases, food pathogens, or assessment of genetic disorders require a laboratory setting with specialized equipment and technical expertise. Isothermal deoxyribonucleic acid amplification methods, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), exhibit characteristics ideal for point-of-care (POC) applications, since their instrumentation is simpler in comparison with the standard method of polymerase chain reaction. Other key advantages of LAMP are robustness and the production of pyrophosphate in the presence of the target gene, enabling to detect the reaction products using the naked eye. Polymerase inhibitors, presented in clinical samples, do not affect the amplification process, making LAMP suitable for a simple sample-to-answer diagnostic systems with simplified sample preparation. In this review, we discuss the trends in miniaturized LAMP techniques, such as microfluidic, paper-based, and digital with their advantages and disadvantages, especially for POC applications alongside our opinion of the future development of miniaturized LAMP.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.011456022,0.060214033,0.247108736,0.041645274,-0.101667957,-0.02336307,0.06525558,0.016896251,-0.008671442,0.005855692,-0.098522674,0.038095692,0.059522061,-0.123561221,-0.097057396,0.100305099,-0.029738207,0.090096214,-0.179626462,0.039004535,-0.177749862,-0.130654762,-0.072988301,0.131802284,0.117662526,-0.014642558,-0.170979405,0.126211206,-0.124865854,0.037497599

A rapid RT-PCR method to differentiate six established genotypes of rabies and rabies-related viruses using TaqMan™ technology,"Abstract A rapid and sensitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay incorporating TaqMan™ probes has been developed that can distinguish among the six established rabies and rabies-related virus genotypes. TaqMan™ probes were designed and validated against 106 rabies and rabies-related virus isolates, one isolate of the Australian bat Lyssaviruses (genotype 7), and 18 other non-rabies viruses important in the veterinary field. The N gene was used as the target for the probes as it is well conserved and has been intensively used to genotype rabies isolates. Additionally, it was found to contain regions specific to each genotype conducive to probe design. The RT-PCR assay described amplifies a portion of the nucleoprotein gene of all 107 rabies and rabies-related viruses, but none of the other viruses tested. Inclusion of TaqMan™-genotype-specific probes in the RT-PCR assay permits rapid identification of the virus present.

Evaluation of the NucliSens® Basic Kit assay for detection of Norwalk virus RNA in stool specimens,"Abstract Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) are a genetically diverse group of human caliciviruses that are the most common cause of epidemic gastroenteritis and are detected typically in stool by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR or electron microscopy (EM). The application of a rapid nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) assay for the detection of NLV RNA in stool is described using the NucliSens® Basic Kit. Primers and probes for the NLV Basic Kit assay were based on the RNA polymerase region of the prototype NLV, Norwalk virus (NV) genome and could consistently detect 104 RT-PCR detectable units of NV RNA in a stool filtrate. When compared directly with RT-PCR on a dilution series of NV stool filtrate, the NucliSens® Basic Kit assay was equally sensitive. Cross-reactivity studies with a representative panel of other enteric pathogens were negative. When applied to 15 stool specimens from NV-challenged volunteers, the NASBA Basic Kit application for NV detection yielded 100% sensitivity, 50% specificity, and 67% concordance, using RT-PCR as the ‘gold standard’. Despite the specificity of the NASBA primer/probe sequences for NV, other representatives from both NLV genogroups I and II could be detected by the Basic Kit assay in outbreak stool specimens, although the results were inconsistent. Our results suggest that the NucliSens® Basic Kit assay provides a rapid and sensitive alternative to RT-PCR for detecting NV RNA in stool specimens. However, improvements in test specificity and primer design will be needed before the assay can be used routinely in the clinical setting.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.002681327,0.069589988,0.185494192,0.072629797,0.005156187,-0.07193806,-0.010450094,0.008109228,-0.04106622,-0.03220962,0.006977879,0.022637464,-0.02015462,0.028147332,0.006729886,-0.02243783,0.036575957,0.013818835,0.001435334,-0.059011826,0.008755091,0.010381617,-0.004865657,0.004128469,0.002729771,-0.009967332,0.016900084,-0.01147567,-0.004839921,-0.013749935
Expression and purification of turkey coronavirus nucleocapsid protein in Escherichia coli,"Abstract Purification of turkey coronavirus (TCoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein, expressed in a prokaryotic expression system as histidine-tagged fusion protein is demonstrated in the present study. Turkey coronavirus was partially purified from infected intestine of turkey embryo by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and RNA was extracted. The N protein gene was amplified from the extracted RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and cloned. The recombinant expression construct (pTri-N) was identified by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis. Expression of histidine-tagged fusion N protein with a molecular mass of 57kd was determined by Western blotting analysis. By chromatography on nickel-agarose column, the expressed N protein was purified to near homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The protein recovery could be 2.5mg from 100ml of bacterial culture. The purified N protein was recognized by antibody to TCoV in Western blotting assay. The capability of the recombinant N protein to differentiate positive serum of turkey infected with TCoV from normal turkey serum was evident in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). These results indicated that the expressed N protein is a superior source of TCoV antigen for development of antibody-capture ELISA for detection of antibodies to TCoV.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.117930667,-0.010767234,0.033710364,-0.086114716,-0.020804206,-0.013816028,-0.062948622,-0.054710062,0.051803518,-0.031984957,-0.078050737,-0.036698176,0.015099212,0.03174467,-0.051145316,-0.090278436,0.08297517,-0.056593667,-0.002415277,-0.030478001,-0.005938066,0.009175999,0.06188716,-0.039656661,0.040568902,0.098550775,0.037630912,-0.05209363,-0.048644296,0.080052535
Development of Taqman RT-nested PCR system for clinical SARS-CoV detection,"Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute newly emerged infectious respiratory illness. The etiologic agent of SARS was named ‘SARS-associated coronavirus’ (SARS-CoV) that can be detected with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. In this study, 12 sets of nested primers covering the SARS-CoV genome have been screened and showed sufficient sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV in RNA isolated from virus cultured in Vero 6 cells. To optimize further the reaction condition of those nested primers sets, seven sets of nested primers have been chosen to compare their reverse transcribed efficiency with specific and random primers, which is useful to combine RT with the first round of PCR into a one-step RT-PCR. Based on the sensitivity and simplicity of results, the no. 73 primer set was chosen as the candidate primer set for clinical diagnoses. To specify the amplicon to minimize false positive results, a Taqman RT-nested PCR system of no. 73 nested primer set was developed. Through investigations on a test panel of whole blood obtained from 30 SARS patients and 9 control persons, the specificity and sensitivity of the Taqman RT-nested PCR system was found to be 100 and 83%, respectively, which suggests that the method is a promising one to diagnose SARS in early stages.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.055085484,0.422887821,0.014763082,0.086468412,-0.00393885,-0.061139386,-0.099455216,-0.22891846,-0.074952333,-0.023979182,0.018186089,-0.017196576,0.001358677,0.067048333,0.026896431,0.000565708,0.057839981,0.005743863,-0.014871549,-0.056031929,0.001040069,0.023165869,-0.000329777,0.06790406,0.040382717,-0.01990957,-0.008632051,-0.018387704,0.019131533,0.003711324
Quantitation of canine coronavirus RNA in the faeces of dogs by TaqMan RT-PCR,"Abstract A TaqMan® fluorogenic reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed for the detection and quantitation of canine coronavirus (CCoV) RNA in the faeces of naturally or experimentally infected dogs. The CCoV fluorogenic RT-PCR assay, which targeted the ORF5 (M gene), was more sensitive than a conventional RT-PCR assay targeting the same gene, showing a detection limit of 10 copies of CCoV standard RNA, and was linear from 10 to 108 copies, allowing quantitation of samples with a wide range of CCoV RNA loads. A total of 78 faecal samples of diarrhoeic dogs were tested simultaneously by conventional and fluorogenic RT-PCR: 29 were negative by both techniques, whereas 27 tested positive by conventional RT-PCR and 48 by the established CCoV fluorogenic assay. One sample, which was positive by conventional RT-PCR, gave no signal in the fluorogenic assay. In addition, by the fluorogenic assay CCoV shedding in the faecal samples of an experimentally infected dog was monitored for 28 days. The high sensitivity, simplicity and reproducibility of the CCoV fluorogenic RT-PCR assay, combined with its wide dynamic range and high throughput, make this method especially suitable for efficacy trials on CCoV vaccines.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.009865484,0.090527414,0.234690496,0.039643776,0.006257148,-0.057871452,-0.014182436,-0.003373514,-0.027077644,-0.071082548,0.058819292,0.019552937,-0.059143919,0.093588725,0.012950458,-0.014616364,0.047718038,-0.000464461,0.030724972,-0.056736241,0.065455351,0.081189859,-0.027654617,0.015464753,0.047525322,-0.025922035,0.021342226,-0.037284335,0.022546929,0.034860401
Detection of economically important viruses in boar semen by quantitative RealTime PCR™ technology,"Abstract The objective of this study was to develop quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (ReTi-PCR) tests for the detection of five economically important viruses in swine semen namely, pseudorabies virus (PRV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Each ReTi-PCR test was validated for specificity, analytical sensitivity (detection limits), and experimental infection studies were performed to compare the conventional virus isolation methods with the newly developed ReTi-PCR tests. All five developed ReTi-PCR tests are very rapid compared to virus isolation, highly specific, and even more sensitive (lower detection limits) than conventional virus isolation methods for the detection of mentioned viruses in semen. In semen of experimentally infected boars, viruses were detected much earlier after infection and more frequently by ReTi-PCR tests than by virus isolations. The high throughput of these rapid ReTi-PCR tests makes it possible to screen large number of semen samples for the presence of viruses prior to insemination. This is a substantial advantage, in particular for boar semen the quality of which deteriorates quickly after storage. In general, the newly developed ReTi-PCR tests are valuable tools for the early, reliable and rapid detection of five economically important viruses, namely PRV, CSFV, FMDV, SVDV, and PRRSV in boar semen.

A mRNA PCR for the diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis,"Abstract A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of feline coronavirus (FCoV) messenger RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is described. The assay is evaluated as a diagnostic test for feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). It is based on a well-documented key event in the development of FIP: the replication of virulent FCoV mutants in monocytes/macrophages. To detect most feline coronavirus field strains, the test was designed to amplify subgenomic mRNA of the highly conserved M gene. The test was applied to 1075 feline blood samples (424 from healthy, 651 from sick cats suspected of FIP) and returned 46% of the diseased cats as positive for feline coronavirus mRNA in their peripheral blood cells; of the healthy cats, 5% tested positive. Of a group of 81 animals in which FIP had been confirmed by post-mortem examination, 75 (93%) tested positive, whereas 17 cats with different pathologies (non-FIP cases) all tested negative. In view of the low rate of false-positive results (high specificity) the mRNA RT-PCR may be a valuable addition to the diagnostic arsenal for FIP.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.019083458,0.046587229,0.145246383,-0.15208981,0.012889781,0.001652754,-0.009446419,0.002528423,-0.063652764,-0.194511169,0.458838203,-0.157274555,0.240417932,0.006748888,-0.137615754,-0.041724624,0.060791241,0.002231533,-0.018943893,0.058010227,-0.03932095,0.005094548,0.04839633,0.021731791,-0.014826522,0.030429984,-0.005017446,0.039602471,0.038846562,-0.02986382
Effects of cold storage on detection of avian infectious bronchitis virus in chicken carcasses and local antibodies in tracheal washes,"Abstract In order to test the survivability of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in dead chicken carcasses during 24h of cold storage, 7 week-old specific-pathogen-free chickens were infected with virulent IBV Massachusetts strain M41, and were killed humanely 10 days later. Carcasses were stored in a cold room at 4°C. After 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 or 24h of storage, necropsies were carried out. Trachea, lung, kidney and rectum were collected for virus isolation by tracheal organ culture (TOC) or embryonated chicken eggs (ECE), and detection by nested reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). IBV was detected by RT-PCR at all sampling times, except for 1 and 6h of storage in kidney and 9h of storage in kidney and rectum. For ECE, isolation was obtained at all sampling points, except at 1 and 24h of storage in lungs. Isolation by tracheal organ cultures was less successful, except from rectum. In addition to sampling for virus, tracheal washes were collected from each carcass to measure the ability to detect local antibodies after storage. Levels of IgA in tracheal washes remained high for up to 9h of storage, suggesting that accurate sampling for research purposes when required must be carried out within this time.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.00509484,0.015572583,0.104308103,-0.074095016,0.05381161,0.037469691,-0.072580885,-0.047726234,0.044517451,0.142458651,0.0572056,-0.009492633,-0.044233817,0.042057062,-0.038028854,0.085788226,0.016876074,-0.002396121,0.008675131,-0.020273422,-0.028921638,-0.006890352,0.003176148,-0.046021112,0.018576874,0.039469395,-0.013211523,-0.001220412,0.015850839,-0.019796611
Two RT-PCR based assays to detect human metapneumovirus in nasopharyngeal aspirates,"Abstract Two sensitive and specific RT-PCR assays were standardised for testing the presence of human metapneumovirus. A total of 300 nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from infants suffering from bronchiolitis since October 2000 to June 2003 and shown previously as negative to common respiratory viruses were examined. Matrix and polymerase viral genes, which show a low rate of variation, were chosen to design amplification assays to ensure that any genotype of the human metapneumovirus could be detected. A RT-PCR followed by a reverse line blotting hybridisation was developed for viral polymerase gene. For the matrix gene, after the RT-PCR assay, a subsequent nested PCR was carried out. Both assays had similar sensitivity, equivalent to 0.1 TCID50 of human metapneumovirus strain NL/1/99 which was used as the positive control. The human metapneumovirus was present in 16.6% of the specimens studied. The approaches described below are not only a robust method for rapid diagnosis of the human metapneumovirus, but also to establish an etiological surveillance tool for epidemiological studies. Based on the results obtained, human metapneumovirus infections in Madrid followed a seasonal pattern, with most of the infections occurring between February and April.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.108254715,0.035786594,0.151927074,0.102135427,0.045553966,-0.054637564,0.02285664,-0.047862166,0.067387316,-0.005127969,-0.017258037,-0.00722024,0.03994515,0.061373948,0.008894038,-0.047280794,0.051416198,0.033314057,-0.040161372,-0.048181126,0.060277558,0.028221738,-0.003904784,0.056211562,-0.014486322,0.007769358,0.017780912,-0.021760464,0.027014235,-0.048864832
"Differential detection of turkey coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus, and bovine coronavirus by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction","Abstract The objective of the present study was to develop a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for differential detection of turkey coronavirus (TCoV), infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV), and bovine coronavirus (BCoV). Primers were designed from conserved or variable regions of nucleocapsid (N) or spike (S) protein gene among TCoV, IBV, and BCoV and used in the same PCR reaction. Reverse transcription followed by the PCR reaction was used to amplify a portion of N or S gene of the corresponding coronaviruses. The PCR products were detected on agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Two PCR products, a 356-bp band corresponding to N gene and a 727-bp band corresponding to S gene, were obtained for TCoV isolates. In contrast, one PCR product of 356bp corresponding to a fragment of N gene was obtained for IBV strains and one PCR product of 568bp corresponding to a fragment of S gene was obtained for BCoV. There were no PCR products with the same primers for Newcastle disease virus, Marek's disease virus, turkey pox virus, pigeon pox virus, fowl pox virus, reovirus, infectious bursal disease virus, enterovirus, astrovirus, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Mycoplasma gallisepticum. Performance of the assay with serially diluted RNA demonstrated that the multiplex PCR could detect 4.8×10−3 μg of TCoV RNA, 4.6×10−4 μg of IBV RNA, and 8.0×10−2 μg of BCoV RNA. These results indicated that the multiplex PCR as established in the present study is a rapid, sensitive, and specific method for differential detection of TCoV, IBV, and BCoV in a single PCR reaction.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.044788904,0.040545,0.197395492,-4.56E-05,0.147393939,-0.025503773,-0.168580299,-0.069257025,0.058183362,0.19805043,0.041310779,-0.047286147,-0.002470746,0.060830582,-0.06764845,0.035613671,0.069517131,0.001946919,0.044762105,-0.076503737,-0.016762519,0.029339032,0.060899791,-0.05546844,0.001599906,0.018380686,0.034199978,-0.06702387,0.041420764,0.043104478
A long distance RT-PCR able to amplify the Pestivirus genome,"Abstract A method to amplify long genomic regions (up to ∼12.3kb) from pestiviruses in one RT-PCR is described. The difficulty in designing conserved Pestivirus primers for the amplification of genomes from highly divergent isolates simply by means of overlapping segments is demonstrated using new bioinformatic tools. An alternative procedure consisting of optimizing the length of the genomic cDNA fragments and their subsequent amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a limited set of specific primers is described. The amplification of long DNA fragments from a variety of sources, including genomic, mitochondrial, and viral DNAs as well as cDNA produced by reverse transcription (RT) has been achieved using this methodology, known as long distance PCR. In the case of viruses, it is necessary to obtain viral particles from infected cells prior to RT procedures. This work provides improvements in four steps of long distance RT-PCR (L-RT-PCR): (i) preparation of a viral stock, (ii) preparation of template RNA, (iii) reverse transcription and (iv) amplification of the cDNA by LD-PCR. The usefulness of L-RT-PCR is discussed in the light of current knowledge on pestivirus diversity.

Evaluation of the efficacy of disinfectants against Puumala hantavirus by real-time RT-PCR,"Abstract Puumala virus, a hantavirus belonging to the Bunyaviridae family, causes a human disease known as nephropathia epidemica, a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The implementation of effective decontamination procedures is critical in hantavirus research to minimize the risk of personnel exposure. This study investigated the efficacy of Clidox®, Dettol®, ethanol, Halamid-d®, peracetic acid, sodium hypochloride and Virkon®S for inactivating Puumala virus. A real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to quantify Puumala virus before and after treatment with these products. Inactivation of Puumala virus was effective after 10min with all products except ethanol. Inactivation with absolute ethanol was effective only after 30min. Using the qRT-PCR method, this study has shown that the commercially available products Clidox®, Halamid-d® and Virkon®S in particular represent a rapid and safe way to decontaminate surfaces with possible Puumala virus contamination. These products can be used in solutions of 1–2%, with contact times greater than 10min, for inactivating effectively Puumala virus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.000314085,0.016914091,0.082989478,0.005536419,-0.033006104,0.040339631,0.003042486,-0.003805853,0.030599622,0.034250659,0.000250981,-0.037273605,0.034820913,-0.006161537,0.040928827,-0.006964616,0.004966192,0.025725672,-0.012660076,-0.019660301,-0.016894458,-0.008142353,0.002802905,-0.03144753,-0.024689813,0.035221394,0.029147741,-0.020652741,-0.017049823,0.006382846
Comparison of the “ProDect BCS RV CHIP” assay with the combination of shell vial cell culture and immunofluorescence antibody test for the detection of respiratory viruses,"Abstract In the present study, a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction combined with a chip hybridization assay (ProDect BCS RV CHIP) was evaluated as an alternative to the combination of immunofluorescent antibody test and shell vial cell culture considered as gold standard for the detection of respiratory viruses. Among 100 specimens, 40 were positive using the combination of immunofluorescent antibody test and shell vial cell culture assay in which 9 of them were infected by two different viruses (27 parainfluenza virus type 3, 10 adenovirus, 9 respiratory syncytial virus, 2 influenza type B, and 1 influenza type A). ProDect BCS RV CHIP detected only 10 positive specimens in which one of them was infected by two different viruses (5 respiratory syncytial virus, 3 parainfluenza virus type 3, 2 adenovirus, and 1 influenza virus type B). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and diagnostic accuracy of ProDect BCS RV CHIP were 25.0%, 100%, 100%, 66.6%, and 70.0%, respectively, compared to the combination of shell vial cell culture and immunofluorescent antibody test.

Detection of bovine coronavirus using a TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR assay,"Abstract A real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) RNA in clinical samples is described. The assay is based on TaqMan technology, consisting of two primers and one probe labeled with the reporter dye 6-carboxyfluorescein that binds selectively to the transmembrane-protein gene of BCoV. The BCoV real-time RT-PCR assay was able to detect the tested BCoV and BCoV-like viruses (canine respiratory coronavirus and bubaline coronavirus), whereas other common viral pathogens of cattle were not recognised by the established oligonucleotide set, thus showing that the test was specific for bovine-like CoVs. The detection limit of the assay was 20 BCoV RNA copies (1-log higher with respect to traditional gel-based RT-PCR) and the reproducibility was satisfactory, thus allowing for a sensitive and accurate measurement of the viral RNA load in clinical samples. Two hundred and twenty clinical specimens (92 rectal, 82 nasal and 46 ocular swabs) were subjected to gel-based and real-time RT-PCR. By conventional amplification, 43 rectal, 54 nasal and 34 ocular samples tested positive, whereas the TaqMan assay was able to detect the BCoV nucleic acid in 49 rectal, 60 nasal and 37 ocular swabs.

Detection of human metapneumovirus by direct antigen test and shell vial cultures using immunofluorescent antibody staining,"Abstract Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) has emerged as an important etiologic agent of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, especially in young children. Although rapid and simple diagnostic methods for hMPV are needed in clinical laboratories, routine diagnostic tests are not readily available. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a commercial anti-hMPV monoclonal antibody for a direct antigen test and a shell vial culture of hMPV. In the pilot study, 15 nasopharyngeal aspirates from 15 children with acute respiratory tract infections positive for hMPV by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were tested. Both direct antigen test and shell vial culture detected hMPV in 14 of 15 (93.3%) nasopharyngeal aspirates at initial diagnosis. In the larger group prospective study, nasopharyngeal aspirates from 92 children with acute respiratory tract infections were tested for hMPV with RT-PCR, direct antigen test, and shell vial culture. Both direct antigen test and shell vial culture showed positivity for 4 out of 5 specimens positive by RT-PCR.

Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification for the detection of highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus,"Abstract A reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay targeting the open reading frames 1a of highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus genome was developed. The 10 reference strains, 1 clinical isolation strain and 122 positive samples were tested. Positive reactions were confirmed for all strains and specimens by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification and nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Rapid molecular detection of the H275Y oseltamivir resistance gene mutation in circulating influenza A (H1N1) viruses,"Abstract In early 2008, drug susceptibility surveillance of influenza viruses in Europe revealed that some influenza A viruses (subtype H1N1) circulating during the winter season of 2007 and 2008 were resistant to the neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir. This resistance arises due to a histidine to tyrosine substitution in the neuraminidase active site (H275Y in N1 nomenclature). Current methods to detect this mutation involve an end-point reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction followed by nucleotide sequencing. While accurate, this approach has the limitation of being time-consuming, labour-intensive and expensive. Herein we describe a one-step allelic discrimination assay which rapidly (2h) detects this resistance mutation. The sensitivity of the assay was as low as 10 copies per reaction and is capable of detecting the antiviral resistance mutation in a mixture of wild type H275 and mutant H275Y targets.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.006901349,-0.020609957,0.069468003,0.112341296,-0.050730373,0.168328337,-0.012658348,-0.006056684,-0.017857903,-0.037609533,0.003161754,0.061851039,-0.011122757,-0.041894281,0.001536584,0.003494126,-0.044461633,0.025607669,0.002498532,-0.00238541,0.05472022,-0.008647689,0.020082955,0.079865855,-0.045159131,0.01456359,0.025734292,-0.01370566,0.007323372,-0.017208418
Absolute quantitation of infectious salmon anaemia virus using different real-time reverse transcription PCR chemistries,"Abstract Routine laboratory diagnosis of infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) infection is primarily by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) because of the high sensitivity and rapid turnaround time of the test. This paper describes methods for highly reproducible absolute viral load measurements using external standard curves generated with either ISAV recombinant plasmid DNA (pDNA) standards or transcribed RNA standards prepared by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase, and using a two tube real-time or quantitative (q)RT-PCR with SYBR® Green I chemistry and a single tube qRT-PCR with TaqMan® probe chemistry. When applied to virus samples of known virus titer for the highly pathogenic ISAV strain NBISA01 and the low pathogenic ISAV strain RPC/NB-04-085-1, both methods showed a 100-fold lower detectable titer for RPC/NB-04-085-1 but with a higher number of viral RNA molecules compared to NBISA01. Overall, the SYBR® Green I method overestimated copy numbers in samples having equivalent Ct values with the TaqMan® probe method. Taken together, the findings suggest that the TaqMan® probe method with the in vitro transcribed RNA standard curve is the preferred method for reliable and rapid quantitation of ISAV in samples.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.025049304,0.062094625,0.180406651,0.084100842,-0.021134547,-0.068435488,-0.024614264,-0.001342633,-0.021576454,0.016964913,0.040452852,-0.027398937,0.002947184,0.068814991,0.018275647,0.004745135,0.006916809,-0.014901984,-0.005406168,-0.075770879,-0.021448487,0.035566526,0.007039758,-0.012374488,-0.027683535,-0.025022674,0.029565959,-0.0332184,-0.032903113,0.068158705
A new generic real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay for vesiviruses; vesiviruses were not detected in human samples,"Abstract Different viruses belonging to the genus Vesivirus infect a broad range of animals, and cause gastroenteritis, vesicular skin lesions, hemorrhagic disease, respiratory diseases and other conditions. A recent report on Vesivirus viremia, as detected by PCR, in samples from patients with hepatitis of unknown etiology in the USA suggested a zoonotic potential for vesiviruses. These results have not been confirmed by another laboratory. In order to do so, a generic PCR assay on the RNA polymerase region was developed, and validated with RNA from 69 different Vesivirus species. Except SMSV serotype-8, all species tested were detected, including the ones that were suggested to be involved in zoonotic transmission in the USA (SMSV serotype-5). The generic Vesivirus assay was used on RNA extracted from serum samples from patients with hepatitis, stool samples from patients with gastroenteritis, throat-swab specimens of patients with rash illnesses, throat-swab and nose-swabs of patients with acute respiratory diseases, and cell cultures with cytopathologic effect from enterovirus surveillance in which no pathogen was found. None were found positive. In this study a generic Vesivirus assay was developed and it was concluded that vesiviruses are an unlikely cause of common illnesses in humans in the Netherlands.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.092170459,0.029865269,0.01519929,0.00816786,0.052815356,-0.058052759,0.007758451,0.086351489,-0.141586128,0.039900681,0.00044424,-0.000665021,0.000211455,0.107160474,0.018862261,-0.054996917,0.01854492,0.030332555,0.070577647,-0.014841605,0.084987271,-0.024973391,-0.045772277,-0.024040403,-0.012977363,-0.001667139,-0.002271929,0.028973748,-0.022739949,-0.033932254
Degenerate primers based RT-PCR for rapid detection and differentiation of airborne chicken Newcastle disease virus in chicken houses,"Abstract Airborne Newcastle disease (ND) viruses in the air of five chicken houses were detected and differentiated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using degenerate primers. Fifteen air samples were collected with All Glass Impinger-30 (AGI-30) air samplers in each house. Airborne ND viruses were also isolated and virulence identified by in vivo tests. Avirulent viruses were detected both in air samples and swab samples in four houses by degenerate primers based RT-PCR. Virulent viruses were detected only in the air samples by degenerate primers based RT-PCR in two houses. Seven strains viruses were isolated from the RT-PCR positive air samples. Of the seven strains, three strains were virulent viruses and four strains were avirulent viruses identified by in vivo tests. The results showed that it was feasible to detect and differentiate NDV in the air samples using degenerate primers based RT-PCR. This technique could decrease the time it required identify NDV infected flocks while distinguishing between virulent and avirulent viruses. It will help effectively to control Newcastle disease.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.046447612,0.031975873,0.172609481,0.020223864,0.101691237,0.01524561,-0.020445937,-0.016187194,-0.033449762,0.05247217,0.056801921,0.022876981,-0.034183771,0.068613262,0.038482194,-0.036159979,0.037000993,-0.033509157,-0.001523204,-0.06617963,0.034788205,0.07357084,-0.032879702,0.079875835,0.036393771,0.007171739,0.021615991,-0.028867747,0.004646336,-0.035552952
Gene optimization leads to robust expression of human respiratory syncytial virus nucleoprotein and phosphoprotein in human cells and induction of humoral immunity in mice,"Abstract Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the major pathogen leading to respiratory disease in infants and neonates worldwide. An effective vaccine has not yet been developed against this virus, despite considerable efforts in basic and clinical research. HRSV replication is independent of the nuclear RNA processing constraints, since the virus genes are adapted to the cytoplasmic transcription, a process performed by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This study shows that meaningful nuclear RNA polymerase II dependent expression of the HRSV nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) proteins can only be achieved with the optimization of their genes, and that the intracellular localization of N and P proteins changes when they are expressed out of the virus replication context. Immunization tests performed in mice resulted in the induction of humoral immunity using the optimized genes. This result was not observed for the non-optimized genes. In conclusion, optimization is a valuable tool for improving expression of HRSV genes in DNA vaccines.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.096965318,-0.056175002,-0.026283494,0.03697879,-0.044579648,-0.00933417,0.023894063,-0.028604281,0.060674475,0.021672709,-0.03233217,-0.048353905,0.000987106,0.065406212,0.018932171,-0.014013343,0.008617741,-0.046710518,-0.018246608,0.011904308,0.024139197,-0.009414941,-0.008540478,-0.011493712,-0.030016205,-0.042772964,0.000600585,0.028527856,0.003279195,-0.054344997
"Development of SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR for rapid detection, quantitation and diagnosis of unclassified bovine enteric calicivirus","Abstract Unclassified bovine enteric calicivirus (BECV) is a newly recognized bovine enteric calicivirus that differs from bovine norovirus, and which causes diarrhea in the small intestines of calves. To date, methods such as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have not been developed for the rapid detection, quantitation and diagnosis of BECV. Presently, a BECV-specific SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR assay was evaluated and optimized. Diarrheic specimens (n =118) collected from 2004 to 2005 were subjected to RT-PCR, nested PCR and SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR. By conventional RT-PCR and nested PCR, 9 (7.6%) and 59 (50%) samples tested positive, respectively, whereas the SYBR Green assay detected BECV in 91 (77.1%) samples. Using BECV RNA standards generated by in vitro transcription, the SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR assay sensitively detected BECV RNA to 1.1×100 copies/μl (correlation coefficiency=0.98). The detection limits of the RT-PCR and nested PCR were 1.1×105 and 1.1×102 copies/μl, respectively. These results indicate that the SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR assay is more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR and nested PCR assays, and has potential as a reliable, reproducible, specific, sensitive and rapid tool for the detection, quantitation and diagnosis of unclassified BECV.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.052298287,0.13029812,0.310911299,0.085056433,0.012227263,-0.093091859,-0.034589774,-0.011432594,-0.021898738,-0.04998631,0.033914329,0.016548577,-0.051733148,0.134476105,0.016511479,-0.034804929,0.098444125,0.005812588,0.015351405,-0.121204104,0.028646525,0.082348225,-0.003119237,-0.000330359,0.007726999,0.018118118,0.08524759,-0.097118469,0.094255541,-0.013817702

A low density oligonucleotide microarray for the detection of viral and atypical bacterial respiratory pathogens,"Abstract Acute respiratory tract infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and exert a considerable economic burden on healthcare systems. Acute respiratory tract infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract are caused by a wide variety of viral and bacterial pathogens, which require comprehensive laboratory investigations. Conventional serological and immunofluorescence-based diagnostic methods for acute respiratory tract infections lack sensitivity when compared to polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approaches and the development of new diagnostic methodologies is required, to provide accurate, sensitive and rapid diagnoses. In the present study, a PCR-based low density oligonucleotide microarray was developed for the detection of 16 viral and two atypical bacterial pathogens. The performance of this DNA microarray-based analysis exhibited comparable sensitivities and specificities to multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (rtPCRs) confirming the potential diagnostic utility of the method. In contrast to routine multiplex PCR, the microarray incorporates an intrinsic redundancy as multiple and non-identical probes per target on the array allow direct intra-assay confirmation of positives. This study demonstrates that microarray technology provides a viable alternative to conventional serological-based approaches and multiplex PCR for pathogen identification in acute respiratory tract infections.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.150803398,0.023769797,0.114940523,0.079860419,-0.0472608,-0.066703336,0.071219236,-0.028936681,0.032017821,0.132289964,-0.04878392,-0.044177309,0.12959297,-0.046551408,0.058901629,-0.054954521,0.005689448,-0.034300897,-0.01092718,-0.068085961,0.01516129,-0.06910558,0.049092343,-0.062815252,0.026826696,-0.034540157,-0.050738337,-0.04997375,0.078219679,-0.030868396
Specific real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for detection and quantitation of turkey coronavirus RNA in tissues and feces from turkeys infected with turkey coronavirus,"Abstract Turkey coronavirus (TCoV) infection causes acute atrophic enteritis in the turkey poults, leading to significant economic loss in the U.S. turkey industry. Rapid detection, differentiation, and quantitation of TCoV are critical to the diagnosis and control of the disease. A specific one-step real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) assay for detection and quantitation of TCoV in the turkey tissues was developed using a dual-labeled fluorescent probe. The fluorogenic probe labeled with a reporter dye (FAM, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamin) and a quencher dye (AbsoluteQuencher™) was designed to bind to a 186 base-pair fragment flanked by the two PCR primers targeting the 3′ end of spike gene of TCoV. The assay was performed on different avian viruses and bacteria to determine the specificity as well as serial dilutions of TCoV for the sensitivity. Three animal trials were conducted to further validate the assay. Ten-day-old turkey poults were inoculated orally with 100 EID50 of TCoV. Intestinal tissues (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum), feces from the cloacal swabs, or feces from the floor were collected at 12h, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and/or 14 days post-inoculation (DPI). RNA was extracted from each sample and subjected to the RRT-PCR. The designed primers and probe were specific for TCoV. Other non-TCoV avian viruses and bacteria were not amplified by RRT-PCR. The assay was highly sensitive and could quantitate between 102 and 1010 copies/μl of viral genome. The viral RNA in the intestine segments reached the highest level, 6×1015 copies/μl, in the jejunum at 5 DPI. Eighty-four intestine segments assayed by the developed RRT-PCR and immunofluorescence antibody assay (IFA) revealed that there were 6 segments negative for TCoV by both assays, 45 positive for TCoV by IFA, and 77 positive for TCoV by RRT-PCR. Turkey coronavirus was detected in the feces from the cloacal swabs or floor 1–14 DPI; however, the viral RNA load varied among different turkey poults at different intervals from different trials. The highest amount of viral RNA, 2.8×1010 copies/μl, in the feces was the one from the cloacal swab collected at 1 DPI. The average amount of TCoV RNA in the cloacal fecal samples was 10 times higher than that in the fecal droppings on the floor. Taken together, the results indicated that the developed RRT-PCR assay is rapid, sensitive, and specific for detection, differentiation, and quantitation of TCoV in the turkey tissues and should be helpful in monitoring the progression of TCoV induced acute enteritis in the turkey flocks.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.015095709,0.040249625,0.124615982,0.000902415,0.022341713,-0.023741053,-0.025186182,0.000214483,-0.000652661,0.010743309,0.02959403,-0.014893827,-0.033028579,0.041749058,0.022846579,-0.015881816,0.016763545,-0.030794535,0.019204572,-0.050373778,-0.017297912,0.027051462,0.013358589,-0.021344613,-0.017927753,-0.00494084,0.006346626,-0.03821193,0.00374576,0.035447057
One-step real-time RT-PCR for pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1) 2009 matrix gene detection in swine samples,"Abstract In the spring of 2009, a novel (H1N1) influenza A virus began to spread among humans worldwide. Although the 2009 H1N1 is related genetically to swine influenza viruses, human infection has not been connected to pig exposure. Because the virus is now circulating widely in the human population, swine herds are at increased risk of becoming infected. In order to investigate potential outbreaks of the 2009 pandemic virus in pigs, a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for the detection of the (H1N1) 2009 RNA in clinical specimens was developed. To evaluate the applicability of the test as a diagnostic tool in the screening of field specimens from swine, 64 field isolates of North American swine, 5 equine and 48 avian influenza viruses collected during diagnostic investigations were analyzed retrospectively as well as samples collected during an experimental in vivo infection with two novel H1N1 isolates, A/California/04/2009 (H1N1)v virus and A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1)v. The sensitivity of the qRT-PCR was shown to be higher with respect to standard techniques such as virus isolation and the reproducibility was satisfactory. The present unique and highly sensitive assay is able to detect as little as 1×101 copies of RNA per μl of template and it represents a rapid and useful approach for the screening and quantitation of (H1N1) 2009 RNA in porcine specimens.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.057364038,-0.010833825,0.106851745,0.153150627,0.007779081,0.193035594,-0.092740476,0.021134561,-0.04737341,-0.042752077,0.037978261,0.043717681,0.002481832,0.02308186,0.091018739,-0.021473227,-0.014056531,0.008659267,-0.051012031,-0.055216241,-0.000766675,0.001065607,-0.016478149,-0.071657713,-0.113107498,0.047422127,-0.036102233,0.02231564,-0.007860865,0.068830162
Multiplex nested RT-PCR for the detection of porcine enteric viruses,"Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine group A rotavirus (PRV-A) are major viruses causing enteric diseases of piglets. A multiplex nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (multiplex nested RT-PCR) was developed for the detection of these viruses in field samples from piglets with diarrhea. A mixture of (1) three external pairs of primers, yielding in the amplification step two different amplicons with sizes of 950bp and 317bp and (2) three pairs of internal primers in a second round of PCR (nested PCR), yielding two different amplicons with sizes of 792bp and 208bp for TGEV and porcine PRV-A, respectively. The genome of PEDV was not detected after the amplification step but it was detected in the second round of PCR, yielding amplicon with size of 291bp. Multiplex nested RT-PCR can detect TGEV, PRV-A, and PEDV up to concentration 102 TCID50/mL, 101 TCID50/mL, and 27.2μg/μl of RNA, respectively. A total of 175 field samples were collected from swine with diarrhea from January 2005 until July 2007. The samples were tested for the presence of three viruses by a multiplex nested RT-PCR. Dual infections with PEDV and PRV-A were identified in seven specimens (4%) (n =6). Twenty-one (25%) infections were caused by PEDV and thirty-four infections (41%) were caused by PRV-A. The genome of TGEV was not detected in any of these field samples, however TGEV was detected in piglets infected experimentally.

Optimisation of reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for rapid detection of Macrobrachium rosenbergii noda virus and extra small virus in Macrobrachium rosenbergii,"Abstract The standardisation and optimisation of a one step single tube reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) procedure is described for rapid diagnosis of white tail disease, a viral disease caused by Macrobrachium rosenbergii noda virus (MrNV) and extra small virus (XSV), in giant fresh water prawn, M. rosenbergii. Time, temperature and quantity of each reagent were optimised for the detection of the two viruses. This method was more sensitive than the conventional reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detecting the two viruses. The RT-LAMP reaction is highly suited for disease diagnosis in developing countries. Amplification of DNA can be detected without the use of agarose gel electrophoresis, by the production of a whitish precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate as a by-product. The cost of RT-LAMP for one reaction is nearly 4 times less than that of RT-PCR.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.050414757,0.118220512,0.359811094,0.149199024,-0.058686078,-0.083378703,0.010772821,-0.017897731,-0.007161814,-0.022765248,-0.024797735,0.007155983,0.003961133,0.081806931,-0.086294513,0.066102594,0.070330714,0.09082847,-0.19152213,0.030417682,-0.148778587,-0.040579907,-0.129292644,0.240380314,0.113925228,0.033974921,-0.066687417,0.084851261,-0.050666646,-0.026687896
SYBR Green based real-time RT-PCR assay for detection and genotype prediction of bovine noroviruses and assessment of clinical significance in Norway,Abstract A novel SYBR Green based real-time RT-PCR assay for detection of genogroup III bovine noroviruses (BoNoV) was developed and the assay applied to 419 faecal samples from calves with and without diarrhoea. The samples were obtained from 190 Norwegian dairy and beef herds. BoNoV was detected in 49.6% of the samples from 61.1% of the herds indicating that BoNoV is ubiquitous in Norway. The overall prevalence was not significantly different in diarrhoea and non-diarrhoea samples. Analyses of polymerase gene sequences revealed both genotype III/1 and III/2 with genotype III/2 (Newbury2-like) being the most prevalent. Detected capsid sequences were restricted to Newbury2-like and the chimeric Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK strain. The RNA polymerase genotypes of the circulating BoNoVs in Norway were predicted by melting temperature analysis. Additional data from a challenge experiment suggest that a high proportion of young calves are shedding low levels of BoNoV for a prolonged time after recovering from the associated diarrhoea. The findings may explain some of the discrepancies in detection rates from previous studies and explain why some studies have failed to detect significant prevalence differences between calves with and without diarrhoea. It may also shed new light on some epidemiological aspects of norovirus infections.,0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.007502797,0.01822891,0.117900951,-0.045160198,0.076909191,-0.01309618,0.018143309,-0.023633341,-0.017861727,-0.033407687,0.02822419,0.054160036,-0.03041142,-0.00363494,0.036069942,-0.038791794,-0.014300626,-0.017174544,0.034255859,-0.0532991,0.046509433,0.025220724,-0.044225815,0.041792112,0.00895913,-0.043410297,0.016170463,-0.072530676,0.047455428,-0.014368546
Development of universal SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR for the rapid detection and quantitation of bovine and porcine toroviruses,"Abstract Toroviruses (ToVs) are a group of emerging viruses that cause gastroenteritis in domestic animals and humans. Currently, methods such as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) have not yet been developed for the rapid detection and quantitation of bovine (BToV) and porcine (PToV) toroviruses. Using BToV and PToV RNA standards generated by in vitro transcription, the detection limit of the SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR assay was 2.54×102 BToV and 2.17×103 PToV copies/reaction (correlation coefficiency=0.99 and 0.97, respectively), whereas those of RT-PCR and nested PCR were 2.54×105 and 2.54×104 (BToV) and 2.17×107 and 2.17×105 (PToV) cRNA viral copies/reaction, respectively. Archived diarrhea specimens of calves (n =121) and piglets (n =86) were subjected to RT-PCR, nested PCR and SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR. By conventional RT-PCR, 1 (0.8%) bovine and 7 (8.1%) porcine samples tested positive to BToV and PToV, respectively. With nested PCR, 13 (10.7%) bovine and 17 (19.8%) porcine samples tested positive. SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR assay detected BToV and PToV in 22 of 121 (18.2%) bovine and 31 of 86 (36.0%) porcine samples. These results indicate that SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR (P <0.05) is a more sensitive assay, which can be reproduced as a reliable, sensitive, and rapid tool for the detection and quantitation of toroviruses.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.089521903,0.138456372,0.331959919,0.083902231,0.035781461,-0.096287694,-0.039747282,-0.006338049,-0.040715911,-0.061834535,0.040080213,0.016845861,-0.079148742,0.159200739,0.053858324,-0.07972326,0.101825701,-0.007387409,0.032708585,-0.094278725,0.012922934,0.091031637,-0.0115592,-0.004659007,-0.004402172,0.020645981,0.095100625,-0.105307565,0.097720612,-0.028848149
Development of a SYBR Green based real-time PCR assay for detection and quantitation of canine parvovirus in faecal samples,"Abstract The present study describes the development of SYBR Green based real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) for detection and quantitation of canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV 2) in faecal samples of dogs. In this assay, the primers were designed and custom-synthesized based on nucleotide sequence of VP2 gene of CPV 2. A standard curve was plotted using 10-fold serial dilution of standard plasmid DNA and Ct value. The standard curve was found to be linear over a 10−7 dilution. The real-time PCR results were expressed as the number of DNA copies of CPV 2 per mg of faecal samples and showed range of 1.0×103 to 7.0×109 copies of viral DNA per mg of stool samples. The analytical sensitivity of the SYBR Green based real-time PCR was shown to be equivalent to 10 copies. Faecal samples (47) from dogs suspected of CPV 2 infection were analyzed by real-time PCR, haemagglutination (HA) assay and by a conventional PCR and 24, 20 and 22 samples were found positive for CPV 2, respectively. Comparison between the results of three different assays revealed that real-time PCR is more sensitive than HA and conventional PCR and allow the detection of low titers of CPV 2 in infected dogs.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.041680167,0.088835318,0.267772228,-0.000240316,0.000585219,-0.048288449,0.004068097,-0.004064509,-0.02906053,-0.042313461,0.036355798,-0.004062055,-0.028361387,0.021820276,0.030693879,-0.035732698,-0.003472264,-0.092055854,0.146291015,-0.09412697,0.168400656,0.141254102,-0.015876282,-0.088201525,0.021673456,-0.104594981,-0.034124604,-0.033561644,-0.031017097,0.111515953
Immunogenic characterization and epitope mapping of transmissible gastroenteritis virus RNA dependent RNA polymerase,"Abstract Coronavirus RNA synthesis is a sophisticated process performed by a viral multienzymatic replicase complex, together with cellular factors. A key enzyme of this replication complex is the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). To study the replication of coronavirus genome, six monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) RdRp were generated and characterized. His-tagged RdRp was expressed in baculovirus, purified and used as immunogen to produce mAbs. The TGEV RdRp was recognized by these mAbs in the context of virus infection by immunofluorescence analysis and Western blot. Epitope mapping by Pepscan indicated that RdRp mAbs recognized four non-overlapping linear epitopes located in a 62-amino acid region of the N-terminal domain, suggesting that this region may constitute an immunodominant domain. The availability of TGEV RdRp mAbs will be instrumental to study coronavirus replication and to analyze the function of RdRp in pathogenesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.193825178,-0.028159294,-0.070810576,0.067240303,-0.020009858,-0.058264102,0.028914147,-0.00027651,-0.033422975,0.009072569,0.082716703,0.137310951,-0.085970192,-0.048191931,-0.035060493,-0.066501246,0.088893818,-0.061873735,-0.019644818,-0.010853653,0.044990942,-0.0373223,0.072937352,-0.073716022,0.088592974,0.092185057,0.02615496,0.003706199,-0.001148047,0.083331975
Design and validation of consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primers for broad and sensitive detection of corona- and toroviruses,"Abstract The ssRNA+ family Coronaviridae includes two subfamilies prototyped by coronaviruses and toroviruses that cause respiratory and enteric infections. To facilitate the identification of new distantly related members of the family Coronaviridae, we have developed a molecular assay with broad specificity. The consensus-degenerated hybrid oligonucleotide primer (CODEHOP) strategy was modified to design primers targeting the most conserved motifs in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase locus. They were evaluated initially on RNA templates from virus-infected cells using a two-step RT-PCR protocol that was further advanced to a one-step assay. The sensitivity of the assay ranged from 102 to 106 and from 105 to 109 RNA copy numbers for individual corona-/torovirus templates when tested, respectively, with and without an excess of RNA from human cells. This primer set compared to that designed according to the original CODEHOP rules showed 10–103 folds greater sensitivity for 5 of the 6 evaluated corona-/torovirus templates. It detected 57% (32 of 56) of the respiratory specimens positive for 4 human coronaviruses, as well as stool specimens positive for a bovine torovirus. The high sensitivity and broad virus range of this assay makes it suitable for screening biological specimens in search for new viruses of the family Coronaviridae.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.047191561,0.033424134,0.0915525,0.132608302,0.039467523,-0.081533132,0.024595353,0.008023848,-0.025021428,-0.02038081,0.024805027,0.017076542,-0.007244185,0.063194703,0.014581407,-0.032782943,0.041162648,0.005795992,0.055295121,-0.019303911,0.018027727,0.003060191,-0.008830319,0.01397562,-0.026244239,-0.010754565,0.000482628,0.010620054,0.000601449,-0.04707489
Development of a combined canine distemper virus specific RT-PCR protocol for the differentiation of infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA) and genetic characterization of the hemagglutinin gene of seven Chinese strains demonstrated in dogs,"Abstract A combined reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method was developed for the detection and differentiation of wild-type and vaccine strains of the canine distemper virus (CDV). A pair of primers (P1/P2) was used to detect both CDV wild-type strains and vaccines. Another pair (P3/P4) was used to detect only CDV wild-type strains. A 335bp fragment was amplified from the genomic RNA of the vaccine and wild-type strains. A 555bp fragment was amplified specifically from the genomic RNA of the wild-type strains. No amplification was achieved for the uninfected cells, cells infected with canine parvovirus, canine coronavirus, or canine adenovirus. The combined RT-PCR method detected effectively and differentiated the CDV wild-type and vaccine strains by two separate RT-PCRs. The method can be used for clinical detection and epidemiological surveillance. The phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin gene of the local wild-type CDV strains revealed that the seven local isolates all belonged to the Asia-1 lineage, and were clustered closely with one another at the same location. These results suggested that the CDV genotype Asia-1 is circulating currently in domestic dogs in China.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.049664436,0.029984224,0.175759734,-0.033258845,0.097260568,0.034973096,-0.037793741,-0.035291662,-0.010032152,0.000686619,0.053766339,0.085734847,-0.060985093,0.005449221,0.049245594,-0.032237579,-0.0588585,-0.022271814,0.052144964,0.021823295,0.256606688,0.147800475,-0.053764998,0.075676126,0.217261233,-0.116466919,-0.046500236,-0.003797955,-0.082215546,0.118315663
Generation of a mouse scFv library specific for porcine aminopeptidase N using the T7 phage display system,"Abstract Porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) is a common cellular receptor for swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). To investigate single-chain fragment variable (scFv) repertoire against pAPN, the genes encoding the immunoglobulin light chain variable region (VL) and heavy chain variable region (VH) were amplified by reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a series of degenerate primers from the spleen of BABL/c mice immunized with native pAPN. The VL and VH amplicons were combined randomly by a 12 amino acid flexible linker by splicing by overlap extension PCR (SOE-PCR), which produced the scFv gene repertoire. After ligation of the scFv gene repertoire into the T7Select10-3b vector, a mouse scFv phage library specific for pAPN was produced through in vitro packaging. The primary scFv library against pAPN contained 2.0×107 recombinant phage clones, and the titer of the amplified library was 3.6×109 pfu/mL. BstNI restriction analysis and DNA sequencing revealed that 28 phage clones from the primary pAPN scFv library showed excellent diversity. The effectiveness of the scFv library against pAPN was verified further by phage ELISA using the recombinant protein of the pAPN C subunit as coating antigen. The construction and evaluation of a murine scFv library against the common receptor pAPN of porcine coronaviruses TGEV and PEDV using the T7 phage display system are described.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.063550029,0.003246778,0.102779556,-0.075197357,0.050435621,0.02028467,-0.054049373,-0.03024983,0.02046632,-0.043329528,-0.037128862,0.020911143,-0.051560438,0.005406496,0.096755176,-0.113412699,0.013052282,0.012153292,-0.033328157,0.05006065,-0.055335414,-0.024161968,0.072727827,0.00027547,-0.003028226,0.030837876,0.013134941,-0.014607769,0.008857749,0.038931501
Reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification for the detection of rodent coronaviruses,"Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is one of the most prevalent viruses detected in laboratory mouse colonies. Enterotropic strains predominate in natural infections, and molecular techniques for the detection of MHV shedding in feces are powerful enough to diagnose active infections. A reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) technique was developed for the detection of rodent coronaviruses within 90min. The specificity of this technique was confirmed by its ability to detect all 17 different strains of MHV and 6 strains of rat coronaviruses as well as its failure to detect human, bovine, and porcine coronaviruses nonspecifically. The sensitivity of RT-LAMP was 3.2-fold higher than that of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 31.6-fold lower than that of nested RT-PCR. An evaluation of the diagnostic performance of RT-LAMP performed in duplicate using mouse fecal specimens showed that the sensitivity and specificity with respect to nested RT-PCR were 85.7% and 100%, respectively.

Development of a real-time RT-PCR method for detection of porcine rubulavirus (PoRV-LPMV),"Abstract In order to provide a rapid and sensitive method for detection of the Porcine rubulavirus La Piedad-Michoacan-Mexico Virus (PoRV-LPMV), we have developed a specific real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. The detection of PoRV-LPMV, represents a diagnostic challenge due to the viral RNA being present in very small amounts in tissue samples. In this study, a TaqMan® real-time PCR assay was designed based on the phosphoprotein gene of PoRV-LPMV, to allow specific amplification and detection of viral RNA in clinical samples. Assay conditions for the primers and probe were optimized using infected PK15 cells and ten-fold serial dilutions of a plasmid containing the whole P-gene. The sensitivity of the developed TaqMan® assay was approximately 10 plasmid copies per reaction, and was shown to be 1000 fold better than a conventional nested RT-PCR. The performance of this real-time RT-PCR method enables studies of various aspects of PoRV-LPMV infection.

Development of a multiplex one step RT-PCR that detects eighteen respiratory viruses in clinical specimens and comparison with real time RT-PCR,"Abstract Rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral respiratory infections is crucial for patient management. Multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) is used increasingly to diagnose respiratory infections and has shown to be more sensitive than viral culture and antigen detection. Objective of the present study was to develop a one-step mRT-PCR that could detect 18 respiratory viruses in three sets. The method was compared with real time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) for its sensitivity and specificity. Clinical specimens from 843 pediatric patients with respiratory symptoms were used in the study. 503 (59.7%) samples were detected positive by mRT-PCR. Of these 462 (54.8%) exhibited presence of a single pathogen and 41 (4.9%) had multiple pathogens. rRT-PCR detected 439 (52.1%) positive samples, where 419 (49.7%) exhibited one virus and 20 (2.4%) showed co-infections. Concordance between mRT-PCR and rRT-PCR was 91.9% and kappa correlation 0.837. Sensitivity and specificity of mRT-PCR were 99.5% and 83.7% while that of rRT-PCR was 86.9% and 99.4% respectively. Rhinovirus (17.2%) was the most frequently detected virus followed by respiratory syncytial virus B (15.4%), H1N1pdm09 (8.54%), parainfluenza virus-3 (5.8%) and metapneumovirus (5.2%). In conclusion, mRT-PCR is a rapid, cost effective, specific and highly sensitive method for detection of respiratory viruses.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.201661947,0.042969177,0.177426485,0.136295898,0.023915804,-0.085739849,-0.021594211,0.000178604,0.011520378,0.0870268,0.033450989,-0.066562806,0.054037079,0.083912293,0.06812984,-0.086655948,0.095526013,-0.036875755,0.025678541,-0.127060709,0.013802924,-0.007035942,0.05267546,-0.043123492,0.019753561,0.01027887,-0.012215161,-0.08205618,0.020248458,-0.038787127
A new approach for diagnosis of bovine coronavirus using a reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay,"Abstract Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is an economically significant cause of calf scours and winter dysentery of adult cattle, and may induce respiratory tract infections in cattle of all ages. Early diagnosis of BCoV helps to diminish its burden on the dairy and beef industry. Real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of BCoV has been described, but it is relatively expensive, requires well-equipped laboratories and is not suitable for on-site screening. A novel assay, using reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA), for the detection of BCoV is developed. The BCoV RT-RPA was rapid (10–20min) and has an analytical sensitivity of 19 molecules. No cross-reactivity with other viruses causing bovine gastrointestinal and/or respiratory infections was observed. The assay performance on clinical samples was validated by testing 16 fecal and 14 nasal swab specimens and compared to real-time RT-PCR. Both assays provided comparable results. The RT-RPA assay was significantly more rapid than the real-time RT-PCR assay. The BCoV RT-RPA constitutes a suitable accurate, sensitive and rapid alternative to the common measures used for BCoV diagnosis. In addition, the use of a portable fluorescence reading device extends its application potential to use in the field and point-of-care diagnosis.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.087271408,0.126935149,0.326454021,0.111156798,-0.039248427,-0.099401837,0.015904073,0.019770263,-0.001411202,-0.08326844,-0.039020804,0.05625648,-0.041892194,0.015803954,-0.040836588,0.045523828,0.009728358,-0.031754072,0.134004836,0.127394831,0.100568193,-0.005563738,-0.056818868,-0.034812021,-0.022778215,0.067728789,0.091693432,-0.070892163,0.152689313,-0.09154285
Detection and differentiation of field and vaccine strains of canine distemper virus using reverse transcription followed by nested real time PCR (RT-nqPCR) and RFLP analysis,"Abstract Canine distemper virus (CDV) is the cause of a severe and highly contagious disease in dogs. Practical diagnosis of canine distemper based on clinical signs and laboratory tests are required to confirm CDV infection. The present study aimed to develop a molecular assay to detect and differentiate field and vaccine CDV strains. Reverse transcription followed by nested real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-nqPCR) was developed, which exhibited analytical specificity (all the samples from healthy dogs and other canine infectious agents were not incorrectly detected) and sensitivity (all replicates of a vaccine strain were positive up to the 3125-fold dilution – 100.7 TCID50). RT-nqPCR was validated for CDV detection on different clinical samples (blood, urine, rectal and conjunctival swabs) of 103 animals suspected to have distemper. A total of 53 animals were found to be positive based on RT-nqPCR in at least one clinical sample. Blood resulted in more positive samples (50 out of 53, 94.3%), followed by urine (44/53, 83.0%), rectal (38/53, 71%) and conjunctival (27/53, 50.9%) swabs. A commercial immunochromatography (IC) assay had detected CDV in only 30 conjunctival samples of these positive dogs. Nucleoprotein (NC) gene sequencing of 25 samples demonstrated that 23 of them were closer to other Brazilian field strains and the remaining two to vaccine strains. A single nucleotide sequences difference, which creates an Msp I restriction enzyme digestion, was used to differentiate between field and vaccine CDV strains by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The complete assay was more sensitive than was IC for the detection of CDV. Blood was the more frequently positive specimen and the addition of a restriction enzyme step allowed the differentiation of vaccine and Brazilian field strains.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.036959919,0.057199681,0.196368509,-0.053542456,0.076950144,0.011491748,-0.028371693,-0.01899319,-0.025704998,-0.001095588,0.083497605,0.079332448,-0.070790355,-0.015297078,0.043399287,-0.054390792,-0.028308365,-0.03371546,0.106427743,0.019270827,0.197716636,0.115035213,-0.072347041,0.027989319,0.205065112,-0.119728461,-0.055244124,-0.025428832,-0.045371459,0.093237797
Simultaneous detection of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of novel influenza A (H7N9) by duplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction,"Abstract A novel reassortant influenza A (H7N9) virus emerged recently in China. In this study, a duplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay was developed for the simultaneous detection of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of H7N9 influenza viruses. The sensitivity of the assay was determined to be 10 RNA copies per reaction for both HA and NA genes. No cross-reactivity was observed with other influenza virus subtypes or respiratory tract viruses. One hundred and forty-six clinical and environmental specimens were tested and compared with reference methods and were found to be consistent.

Development and evaluation of reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for the detection of the fathead minnow nidovirus,"Abstract Fathead minnow nidovirus (FHMNV) is a serious baitfish-pathogenic virus in North America. Studies to trace the spread of the virus and determine its host range are hampered by the absence of reliable diagnostic assays. In this study, a one-step, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed that targets a region in the FHMNV spike protein gene. The assay was optimized, and the best results were obtained at 8mM of Mg2+ with an incubation time of 40min at 63°C in the presence of calcein. The analytical sensitivity of the RT-LAMP method was estimated to be as low as 5 viral copies and was 1000-fold more sensitive than the conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the developed RT-LAMP assay versus the RT-PCR assay was 100% and 95.7%, respectively. A quantitative RT-LAMP of FHMNV with a high correlation coefficient (r 2 =0.9926) was also developed and the result of quantitation of viral copies in tissue samples of infected fish showed that the viral loads of the infected fish tissue samples reached up to 4.7×1010 copies per mg.

Rapid and real-time detection of Porcine Sapelovirus by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay,"Abstract The present study describes the development and validation of a one-step, single-tube, and real-time reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) detecting Porcine Sapelovirus. RT-LAMP characterized by one strand displacement reaction with the specific stem-loop structure and Bst DNA polymerase could be finished in 60min under isothermal condition at 63°C. RT-LAMP assay showed higher sensitivity with 101 copies/μL than RT-PCR for the detection of Sapelovirus. The specificity of RT-LAMP assay was validated by the absence of any cross-reaction with other closely related virus in Picornaviridae group and other common virus causing porcine diarrhea. 7 positive Sapelovirus infection out of 63 fecal samples were identified using RT-LAMP, while 5 positive samples were determined by a conventional RT-PCR.

Rapid detection of equine coronavirus by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification,"Abstract A reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed for the rapid detection of equine coronavirus (ECoV). This assay was conducted at 60°C for 40min. Specificity of the RT-LAMP assay was confirmed using several equine intestinal and respiratory pathogens in addition to ECoV. The novel assay failed to cross-react with the other pathogens tested, suggesting it is highly specific for ECoV. Using artificially synthesized ECoV RNA, the 50% detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was 101.8 copies/reaction. This is a 50-fold greater sensitivity than conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, but a 4-fold lower sensitivity than quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays. Eighty-two fecal samples collected during ECoV outbreaks were analyzed. ECoV was detected in 59 samples using the RT-LAMP assay, and in 30 and 65 samples using RT-PCR or qRT-PCR assays, respectively. Although the RT-LAMP assay is less sensitive than qRT-PCR techniques, it can be performed without the need for expensive equipment.

Development of a nanoparticle-assisted PCR assay for detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus,"Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an important pig pathogen that can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration, leading to serious damage to the swine industry worldwide. In this study, a nanoparticle-assisted polymerase chain reaction (nanoPCR) assay targeting the N gene of PEDV was developed and the sensitivity and specificity were investigated. Under the optimized conditions for detection of PEDV RNA, the nanoPCR assay was 100-fold more sensitive than a conventional RT-PCR assay. The lower detection limit of the nanoPCR assay was 2.7×10−6 ng/μL of PEDV RNA and no cross-reaction was observed with other viruses.

Development of a duplex real-time RT-PCR for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus and rat theilovirus,"Abstract Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and rat theilovirus (RTV), the member of the genus Cardiovirus, are widespread in laboratory mice and rats, and are potential contaminants of biological materials. Cardioviruses infection may cause serious complications in biomedical research. To improve the efficiency of routine screening for Cardioviruses infection, a duplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed for simultaneous detection and differentiation of TMEV and RTV. The duplex assay was specific for reference strains of TMEV and RTV, and no cross-reaction was found with seven other rodent viruses. The limits of detection of both TMEV and RTV were 4×101 copies RNA/reaction. Reproducibility was estimated using standard dilutions, with coefficients of variation <3.1%. 439 clinical samples were evaluated by both duplex real-time RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR. For 439 clinical samples，95 samples were positive for TMEV and 72 samples were positive for RTV using duplex real-time RT-PCR approach, whereas only 77 samples were positive for TMEV and 66 samples were positive for RTV when conventional RT-PCR was applied.

Real-time isothermal detection of Abalone herpes-like virus and red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus using recombinase polymerase amplification,"Abstract Abalone herpes-like virus (AbHV) and Red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) are two serious viruses that infect animal populations in aquaculture. Both viruses cause diseases associated with high mortality rates, resulting in dramatic economic losses in the aquaculture industry. There are currently no effective treatments for either of these two viral diseases. Thus, early, rapid, and accurate diagnosis plays a fundamental role in disease prevention and control in aquaculture. Traditional methods of diagnosis, such as virus culture, enzyme-linked immunoassay, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are either time consuming or require sophisticated temperature control devices. In this study, one sets of specific primers and probes were designed for the real-time quantitative recombinase polymerase amplification (qRPA) detection of AbHV and RGNNV separately. The sensitivity and specificity of detection were evaluated by comparison with detection by conventional PCR and quantitative PCR. The optimal reaction temperature and time for virus detection is 37°C for 20min. The detection limit is 100 copies per reaction, making this approach faster and more sensitive than qPCR in this study. In a field application, the detection percentage of qRPA was higher than that of qPCR for both AbHV and NNV. Additionally, good correlation was found between qRPA and qPCR detection (R2 >0.8). The methods presented here can be used as alternatives to qPCR for quick and quantitative detection of pathogens infecting aquaculture species.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.070508743,0.059958554,0.260251263,0.081238148,-0.056275695,-0.014455358,0.069638623,-0.001274773,-0.021621479,0.067068858,-0.049241898,-0.048024185,0.049514565,-0.03584964,0.028597758,-0.005603472,-0.036780373,-0.054929039,-0.011363893,-0.033163593,-0.024836136,-0.024335057,0.051765525,-0.011299425,-0.038492698,-0.019609144,0.011012137,-0.023812637,-0.043675906,0.001301581
"Development of a one-step RT-PCR assay for detection of pancoronaviruses (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-coronaviruses) using newly designed degenerate primers for porcine and avian `fecal samples","Abstract Coronaviruses (CoVs) are critical human and animal pathogens because of their potential to cause severe epidemics of respiratory or enteric diseases. In pigs, the newly emerged porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) and re-emerged porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) reported in the US and Asia, as well as the discovery of novel CoVs in wild bats or birds, has necessitated development of improved detection and control measures for these CoVs. Because the previous pancoronavirus (panCoV) RT-PCR established in our laboratory in 2007–2011 did not detect deltacoronaviruses (δ-CoVs) in swine fecal and serum samples, our goal was to develop a new panCoV RT-PCR assay to detect known human and animal CoVs, including δ-CoVs. In this study, we designed a new primer set to amplify a 668 bp-region within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene that encodes the most conserved protein domain of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-CoVs. We established a one-step panCoV RT-PCR assay and standardized the assay conditions. The newly established panCoV RT-PCR assay was demonstrated to have a high sensitivity and specificity. Using a panel of 60 swine biological samples (feces, intestinal contents, and sera) characterized by PEDV, PDCoV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus-specific RT-PCR assays, we demonstrated that sensitivity and specificity of the newly established panCoV RT-PCR assay were 100%. 400 avian fecal (RNA) samples were further tested simultaneously for CoV by the new panCoV RT-PCR and a one-step RT-PCR assay with the δ-CoV nucleocapsid-specific universal primers. Four of 400 avian samples were positive for CoV, three of which were positive for δ-CoV by the conventional RT-PCR. PanCoV RT-PCR fragments for 3 of the 4 CoVs were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of one γ-CoV and two δ-CoV in the sequenced samples. The newly designed panCoV RT-PCR assay should be useful for the detection of currently known CoVs in animal biological samples.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0070286,0.29284345,0.210424975,0.137523529,0.184370884,-0.003430795,0.091409615,0.036860906,-0.02557333,-0.073083961,0.022852027,-0.00232624,-0.140908673,0.160883379,0.040042935,-0.093057555,0.10212294,0.060645411,-0.029625513,0.00037328,-0.053621213,0.027242222,0.090864732,0.038764423,0.058919955,0.049136787,0.022250331,-0.066799715,0.119532898,-0.013250643
Rapid detection of transmissible gastroenteritis virus in swine small intestine samples using real-time reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification,"Abstract A rapid and specific real-time reverse-transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay (RT-RPA) was developed to detect the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in this study. The primers and exo probe were designed to be specific for a portion of spike (S) gene conserved in TGEV, but absent in the closely related porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). The amplification was performed at 40 °C for 20 min. The assay could only detect the TGEV, and there was no cross-reaction with other pathogens tested. Using the in vitro transcribed TGEV RNA as template, the limit of detection of the developed RT-RPA was 100 copies per reaction. The assay performance was evaluated by testing 76 clinical samples by RT-RPA and a real-time RT-PCR. Fourteen samples were TGEV RNA positive in RT-RPA (18.4%, 14/76), which were also positive in the real-time RT-PCR. The diagnostic agreement between the two assays was 100% (76/76). The R2 value of RT-RPA and real-time RT-PCR was 0.959 by linear regression analysis.

Evaluation of an incubation instrument-free reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay for rapid and point-of-need detection of canine distemper virus,"Abstract Canine distemper, caused by Canine distemper virus (CDV), is a highly contagious and fatal systemic disease in free-living and captive carnivores worldwide. Accurate, rapid and simple detection of CDV is critical to improve disease management and prevent outbreaks. In this study, a visible and incubation instrument-free reverse-transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay combined with lateral flow strip (LFS RT-RPA) was developed to detect CDV using primers and lateral flow (LF) probe specific for the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene. The CDV LFS RT-RPA assay was performed in a closed fist using body heat for 15 min, and the products were visible to the naked eyes on the LFS within 5 min. The assay could detect CDV, and there was no cross-reaction with the other viruses tested. Using the in vitro transcribed CDV RNA as template, the analytical sensitivity was 9.4 × 101 copies per reaction, which was the same result as that of a real-time RT-PCR. The assay performance was further evaluated by testing 32 nasal/oropharyngeal swab samples, and CDV RNA positive rate was 62.0% (20/32) by LFS RT-RPA, which was the same result as that of the real-time RT-PCR assay. The performance of the LFS RT-RPA was comparable to real-time RT-PCR, while the LFS RT-RPA assay was much faster and easier to perform. The novel CDV LFS RT-RPA assay provides an attractive and promising tool for rapid and reliable detection of CDV in the underequipped laboratory and point-of-need facility, which is of great significance in CD control in low resource settings.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.01724888,0.109273824,0.306454893,0.078524792,-0.037259223,-0.070481461,0.00689641,0.023271677,-0.019905921,-0.10570156,-0.015438195,0.068646473,-0.088055177,0.013573227,-0.052743623,0.058590038,-0.014804702,-0.083172146,0.178501439,0.181753978,0.207593405,0.093543805,-0.081194009,-0.023372452,0.058443774,0.006131882,0.047325562,-0.014988376,0.070851566,0.00659766
A novel multiplex PCR-electronic microarray assay for rapid and simultaneous detection of bovine respiratory and enteric pathogens,"Abstract Respiratory and enteric diseases continue to be two major causes of economic losses to the cattle industry worldwide. Despite their multifactorial etiology, the currently available diagnostic tests for bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) and bovine enteric disease (BED) are single-pathogen-tests. DNA microarray when combined with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a powerful tool in detection and differentiation of multiple pathogens in a single sample. This study reports development and initial validation of two independent highly sensitive and specific multiplex PCR-electronic microarray assays, one for the detection and differentiation of pathogens of the BRDC and the other for detection and differentiation of pathogens of the BED. The BRDC multiplex PCR-microarray assay was able to detect and differentiate four bacteria (Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Pasteurella multocida, and Mycoplasma bovis) and five viruses [bovine parainfluenza virus-3, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine herpesvirus-1, bovine coronavirus (BCoV), and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV)] associated with BRDC. The BED multiplex PCR- microarray- assay was able to detect and differentiate four bacteria (Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica Dublin, and Salmonella enterica Typhimurium), three protozoa (Eimeria zuernii, Eimeria bovis, and Cryptosporidium parvum), and four viruses (bovine torovirus, bovine rotavirus, BCoV, and BVDV) associated with the BED. Both assays detected their respective targets individually or in combination when present. The limit-of-detection of each assay at the PCR amplification and DNA microarray levels was determined using previously titrated laboratory amplified target pathogens or using quantified synthetic nucleotides. Both assays showed very high analytical sensitivity and specificity, and were validated using a limited number of clinical samples. The BRDC and BED multiplex PCR- microarray-assays developed in this study, with further clinical validation, could be used in veterinary diagnostic laboratories for the rapid and simultaneous identification of pathogens to facilitate quick and accurate decision making for the control and treatment of these two economically important disease complexes. Furthermore, these assays could be very effective tools in epidemiological studies as well as for screening of healthy animals to identify carriers that may potentially develop BRDC or BED.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.065570504,0.033067439,0.186738393,0.038495879,-0.024857728,-0.034190543,0.047030992,-0.013048591,-0.009742099,0.064084187,-0.035324835,-0.021321457,0.065969514,-0.039461783,0.058498262,-0.056768167,-0.003798252,-0.030573046,0.041462356,-0.059208202,0.042797779,0.005761037,0.039721948,-0.02525963,0.038831728,-0.037821667,0.008500781,-0.094355661,0.05348237,-0.055893873
Development of a SYBR green-based real-time RT-PCR assay for rapid detection of the emerging swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus,"Abstract Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus which was associated with severe diarrhea disease in pigs. SADS-CoV was first detected and identified as the causative agent of a devastating swine disease outbreak in southern China in 2017. Routine monitoring and early detection of the source of infection is therefore integral to the prevention and control of SADS-CoV infection. In this study, a SYBR green-based real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) technique was established for rapid detection and monitoring of this emerging virus. Specific primers were designed based on the conserved region within the M gene of the viral genome. The lowest detection limit of the RT-qPCR assay was 10 copies/μL. This assay was specific and had no cross-reaction with other 11 swine viruses. The positive rate of 84 clinical samples for the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR and the conventional RT-PCR was 73.81% (62/84) and 53.57% (45/84), respectively. These results demonstrated that the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR technique was an effectively diagnostic method with higher sensitivity than probe-based RT-qPCR and gel-based RT-PCR for detection and epidemiological investigations of SADS-CoV.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.071326408,0.244898884,0.22792894,0.081246461,0.012956631,-0.040855769,-0.0212614,0.013656258,0.029810497,-0.032456773,0.00849152,0.005999324,-0.046988717,0.069789699,0.041274185,-0.060751879,0.040122313,-0.011993235,-0.044215275,-0.017192221,-0.040041587,0.042716926,0.000976547,0.067703668,0.014876799,0.017708272,0.053087241,-0.011213435,0.04739132,0.019338883
A multiplex real-time PCR assay for the detection and differentiation of the newly emerged porcine circovirus type 3 and continuously evolving type 2 strains in the United States,"Abstract A multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (mqPCR) assay was developed and validated for the detection and differentiation of porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) and type 2 (PCV2) strains. The assay coverage was 97.9% (184/188) for PCV3 and 99.1% (1889/1907) for PCV2 sequences that were available from the current GenBank database. The PCR amplification efficiencies were 98–99% for plasmids, and 92–96% for diagnostic samples, with correlation coefficients all greater than 0.99. The limit of detection (LOD) determined as plasmid copies per reaction was 17 for PCV3 and 14 for PCV2. The assay specifically detected the targeted viruses without cross reacting to each other or to other common porcine viruses. Among 336 swine clinical samples collected in 2018, 101 (30.1%) were PCV3 positive, 56 (16.7%) were PCV2 positive and 18 (5.4%) were co-positives. Sixty selected PCV3 positives were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and 53 of the 56 PCV2 positive samples were tested positive by another validated PCR assay.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.038683992,0.03007323,0.152901357,-0.025583805,0.027803148,-0.00370476,-0.001019042,-0.005047485,-0.019922844,-0.031415768,0.020793519,0.036483389,-0.061000541,0.007745142,0.081196483,-0.06852825,-0.00210637,-0.040327122,0.042888129,-0.023988044,0.029781418,0.023395807,0.027076122,-0.018279482,-0.003674572,-0.015903201,-0.029471966,0.002890853,-0.003513917,-0.010616285
A multiplex RT-PCR assay for rapid and simultaneous detection of four RNA viruses in swine,"Abstract A multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain rection (mRT-PCR) was developed for simultaneous detection of four RNA viruses in swine. The conserved target sequences directed to classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) were selected based on alignments of genomic sequences and then specific primers were designed. The mRT-PCR assay was developed and evaluated for its specificity and sensitivity. The expected product from the single viral template was amplified by mRT-PCR and no spurious PCR amplification occurred from the genomic RNA or DNA of other pathogens. For single virus or different combinations of two viruses the detection limit of mRT-PCR was consistent with a single RT-PCR wtith 1 × 103 copies. For different combinations of the three viruses or four viruses, sensitivity of PEDV detection partially decreased. All of positive clinical specimens by the mRT-PCR were identically confirmed using Taqman RT-qPCR. Therefore, the mRT-PCR is a useful tool for epidemiological studies and laboratory diagnosis of single virus and/or mixed infections in swine.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.03001069,0.055638843,0.229737135,0.134843909,0.04499543,-0.053582633,-0.035915397,-0.009170743,-0.025593739,0.024725045,0.030334098,-0.015093862,-0.02883998,0.08082865,0.167522932,-0.154874851,0.049023477,-0.00076848,-0.036884809,0.006238508,-0.083756803,0.002523464,0.069748674,-0.016384373,-0.041158433,-0.005477697,0.017862814,-0.05453271,0.018325793,0.005724838
Development of a recombinase polymerase amplification assay with lateral flow dipstick for rapid detection of feline parvovirus,"Abstract Feline panleukopenia caused by feline parvovirus (FPV), a single-stranded DNA virus, is typically highly contagious and often presents with lethal syndrome. The broad spectrum of possible hosts suggests its potential for transmission from animal to person through close contact with pets. FPV thus serves as an example of the importance of new rapid point-of-care field diagnostic tools for the control and prevention of transmission, especially among rare wild animals and pet cats. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), as a real-time and isothermal method, could be a more affordable alternative to PCR when combined with a lateral flow dipstick (LFD) indicator. In this study, we report a novel FPV lateral flow dipstick RPA (LFD-RPA) instant detection method capable of detecting a range of different FPV strains. The LFD-RPA assay consists of specific primers, probe, and nucleic acid strip. It is capable of detecting 102 copies of target nucleic acid per reaction, which is one order of magnitude higher than the sensitivity of traditional PCR. The most suitable reaction conditions for this assay are at 38 ℃ for 15 min.

Comparison of immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies and RT-PCR for the detection of human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 in cell culture,"Abstract Human coronaviruses, with two known serogroups named 229E and OC43, cause up to one third of common colds and may be associated with serious diseases such as nosocomial respiratory infections, enterocolitis, pericarditis and neurological disorders. Reliable methods of detection in clinical samples are needed for a better understanding of their role in pathology. As a first step in the design of such diagnostic procedures, the sensitivities and specificities of two viral diagnostic assays were compared in an experimental cell culture model: an indirect immuno-fluorescence assay using monoclonal antibodies and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification of viral RNA from infected cells. Immunofluorescence detected human coronaviruses in cells infected at a MOI as low as 10−2 (log TCID50/ml=4.25 for HCV-229E and 2.0 for HCV-OC43; log PFU/ml=4.83 for HCV-229E and 1.84 for HCV-OC43) versus 10−3 (HCV-OC43) or 10−4 (HCV-229E) for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification (log TCID50/ml=1.75 for HCV-229E and 1.5 for HCV-OC43; log PFU/ml=2.3 for HCV-229E and 1.34 for HCV-OC43). There were no false positive signals with other human respiratory pathogens: influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus. Moreover, each assay was coronavirus serogroup-specific. These results demonstrate the potential usefulness of immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction RNA amplification for the rapid detection of human coronaviruses in infected cell cultures. Both methods could be applied to clinical specimens for the diagnosis of human infections.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.018591956,-0.009612492,0.037332513,0.051093274,-0.021284858,-0.036964673,0.074093304,-0.03023967,0.081891368,-0.006828375,-0.049458501,0.126646294,0.170533779,0.099694475,-0.00462988,-0.053967979,0.022708681,0.239966325,0.319664951,-0.100784082,-0.090349233,-0.052397975,0.157137482,0.045632667,-0.068131405,-0.079936071,-0.103178049,0.105891969,-0.149973826,-0.057014119
One-tube fluorogenic reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for the quantitation of feline coronaviruses,"Abstract A one-tube reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for absolute feline coronavirus (FCoV) quantitation was developed. The assay is based on the 5′ nuclease activity of the Thermus flavus (Tfl) polymerase and a fluorogenic probe which generates fluorescence when it is cleaved. The fluorogenic probe, also called TaqMan™ probe (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, USA), is an oligonucleotide designed to bind between the two PCR primers to the target cDNA and is labeled with a reporter and a quencher dye. In the intact probe, the quencher dye suppresses the fluorescence of the reporter dye by Förster-type energy transfer. During the polymerase extension steps the Tfl exonuclease activity cleaves the hybridised probe resulting in the generation of fluorescent emission of the reporter dye. The threshold cycle (C T value) indicates the increase of reporter fluorescence and is directly related to the initial amount of target cDNA or RNA, respectively. Fluorescence is monitored in real time after each cycle by a Perkin-Elmer ABI Prism® 7700 Sequence Detector. After completion of amplification, the C T values of the samples are calculated back to a standard curve, generated by amplification of diluted standard molecules. The one-tube RT-PCR described below allows precise quantitation, is highly sensitive, rapid (no separate reverse transcription step and no post-amplification steps), easy to handle, allows for a high sample throughput, shows a very good reproducibility, and can be executed with a low risk of contamination. The design of the primers–probe combination enables the detection of all known FCoV strains and is also useful for the detection of canine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine respiratory coronavirus.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.032438132,0.061764443,0.181477477,0.028251744,-0.02233519,-0.031859795,-0.004292563,-0.007307798,-0.00702601,-0.043358142,0.04382272,-0.005626253,0.042498311,-0.001639307,-0.007489648,0.004788218,0.005007676,0.002952643,0.002345419,-0.01975986,-0.005259292,0.004480175,0.017536773,0.009922445,0.02366032,-0.023067108,-0.005418673,-0.001078073,-0.02136591,0.054236899
Quantitative sense-specific determination of murine coronavirus RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction,"Abstract In many applications, it is useful to know the sense and amount of viral RNAs present in a sample. In theory, sense-specific measurement of viral RNAs may be achieved by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays which utilize primers of defined polarity during the RT step. However, in practice, it has been shown that such assays are prone to artifacts, such as non-specific priming, which drastically diminish their reliability. Using murine coronavirus MHV-4 as a model, we describe and validate several modifications of the RT-PCR procedure which eliminate these artifacts. Key RT-PCR parameters which were optimized include the design of tagged primers, DNase treatment of in vitro transcribed RNA standards, specification of temperature differences between RT and PCR annealing steps, and use of competitive RNA templates for quantitative assays.

Inhibition of measles virus and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis virus by RNA interference,"Abstract Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare, but fatal outcome of measles virus (MeV) infection. SSPE develops after prolonged persistence of mutated MeV called SSPE virus. Although a combination therapy using interferon and inosiplex or ribavirin appears to prolong survival time to some extent, there is currently no effective treatment to completely cure SSPE and a new treatment strategy is greatly needed. In this study, we adopted RNA interference (RNAi) strategy and examined whether small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can be used to inhibit replication of MeV and SSPE virus. We report here that siRNAs targeted against L mRNA of MeV, either synthetic siRNAs or those generated by pcPUR+U6i-based expression plasmids, effectively and specifically inhibited replication of both MeV and SSPE virus without exhibiting any cytotoxic effect. The L protein of MeV is a major component of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is essential for viral RNA replication, and yet it is least abundant among all the MeV proteins expressed. Therefore, mRNA encoding the L protein would be a good target for RNAi strategy. The present results imply the possibility that our siRNAs against MeV L mRNA are among the potential candidates to be used to treat patients with SSPE.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.152134396,-0.051140464,-0.060311287,0.025461839,-0.113340111,-0.003178078,-0.005140967,0.012258849,0.011280278,0.021250082,-0.002629342,-0.059890496,0.023185028,0.092859425,0.022281122,-0.003058292,-0.021143705,0.029419099,0.02368987,0.038121021,0.011331907,0.026748482,-0.014192014,-0.009797409,-0.008382106,-0.0181914,0.041486462,-0.030096535,0.032509576,0.048167229
Rhinovirus chemotherapy,"Abstract Human rhinoviruses (HRV), members of the Picornaviridae family, are comprised of over 100 different virus serotypes. HRV represent the single most important etiological agents of the common cold [Arruda, E., Pitkaranta, A., Witek Jr., T.J., Doyle, C.A., Hayden, F.G., 1997. Frequency and natural history of rhinovirus infections in adults during autumn. J. Clin. Microbiol. 35, 2864–2868; Couch, R.B., 1990. Rhinoviruses. In: Fields, B.N., Knipe, D.M. (Eds.), Virology. Raven Press, New York, pp. 607–629; Turner, R.B., 2001. The treatment of rhinovirus infections: progress and potential. Antivir. Res. 49 (1), 1–14]. Although HRV-induced upper respiratory illness is often mild and self-limiting, the socioeconomic impact caused by missed school or work is enormous and the degree of inappropriate antibiotic use is significant. It has been estimated that upper respiratory disease accounts for at least 25 million absences from work and 23 million absences of school annually in the United States [Anzueto, A., Niederman, M.S., 2003. Diagnosis and treatment of rhinovirus respiratory infections. Chest 123 (5), 1664–1672; Rotbart, H.A., 2002. Treatment of picornavirus infections. Antivir. Res. 53, 83–98]. Increasing evidences also describe the link between HRV infection and more serious medical complications. HRV-induced colds are the important predisposing factors to acute otitis media, sinusitis, and are the major factors in the induction of exacerbations of asthma in adults and children. HRV infections are also associated with lower respiratory tract syndromes in individuals with cystic fibrosis, bronchitis, and other underlying respiratory disorders [Anzueto, A., Niederman, M.S., 2003. Diagnosis and treatment of rhinovirus respiratory infections. Chest 123 (5), 1664–1672; Gern, J.E., Busse, W.W., 1999. Association of rhinovirus infections with asthma. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 12 (1), 9–18; Pitkaranta, A., Arruda, E., Malmberg, H., Hayden, F.G., 1997.

Pediatrics 102, 291–295; Rotbart, H.A., 2002. Treatment of picornavirus infections. Antivir. Res. 53, 83–98]. To date, no effective antiviral therapies have been approved for either the prevention or treatment of diseases caused by HRV infection. Thus, there still exists a significant unmet medical need to find agents that can shorten the duration of HRV-induced illness, lessen the severity of symptoms, minimize secondary bacterial infections and exacerbations of underlying disease and reduce virus transmission. Although effective over-the-counter products have been described that alleviate symptoms associated with the common cold [Anzueto, A., Niederman, M.S., 2003.

Effective inhibition of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus replication in ST cells by shRNAs targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene,"Abstract Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is identified as one of the most important pathogenic agents during swine enteric infection, leading to high mortality in neonatal pigs and severe annual economic loss in swine-producing areas. Up to date, various vaccines developed against TGEV still need to be improved. To exploit the possibility of using RNA interference (RNAi) as a strategy against TGEV infection, two shRNA-expressing plasmids (pEGFP-U6/P1 and pEGFP-U6/P2) targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of TGEV were constructed and transfected into swine testicular (ST) cells. The cytopathic effect (CPE) and MTS assays demonstrated that both shRNAs were capable of protecting cells against TGEV invasion with very high specificity and efficiency. A real-time quantitative RT-PCR further confirmed that the amounts of viral RNAs in cell cultures pre-transfected with the two plasmids were reduced by 95.2% and up to 100%, respectively. Our results suggest that RNAi might be a promising new strategy against TGEV infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.090193995,-8.01E-05,0.051107888,-0.000114476,-0.029001327,-0.000912449,-0.02263916,-0.007093567,0.011856471,-0.029172872,0.016024582,0.015856004,-0.056994107,0.049896959,0.074690936,-0.028038933,-0.0232966,0.004184377,0.0271349,0.03004036,0.003607149,0.017018707,0.046074333,-0.003211262,0.030665367,0.013247582,0.027282725,-0.046815429,5.70E-05,0.04163453
T-705 (favipiravir) and related compounds: Novel broad-spectrum inhibitors of RNA viral infections,"Abstract A series of pyrazinecarboxamide derivatives T-705 (favipiravir), T-1105 and T-1106 were discovered to be candidate antiviral drugs. These compounds have demonstrated good activity in treating viral infections in laboratory animals caused by various RNA viruses, including influenza virus, arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Treatment has in some cases been effective when initiated up to 5–7 days after virus infection, when the animals already showed signs of illness. Studies on the mechanism of action of T-705 have shown that this compound is converted to the ribofuranosyltriphosphate derivative by host enzymes, and this metabolite selectively inhibits the influenza viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase without cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. Interestingly, these compounds do not inhibit host DNA and RNA synthesis and inosine 5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) activity. From in vivo studies using several animal models, the pyrazinecarboxamide derivatives were found to be effective in protecting animals from death, reducing viral burden, and limiting disease manifestations, even when treatment was initiated after virus inoculation. Importantly, T-705 imparts its beneficial antiviral effects without significant toxicity to the host. Prompt development of these compounds is expected to provide effective countermeasures against pandemic influenza virus and several bioweapon threats, all of which are of great global public health concern given the current paucity of highly effective broad-spectrum drugs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.074061284,-0.070171132,-0.062651303,0.133236965,-0.123241306,0.175898449,0.060509739,0.004763248,0.015902305,0.047797298,0.059037843,-0.017743898,0.026595414,0.029439254,0.033999212,-0.005361396,-0.044148539,0.099721152,0.053276565,0.047966292,-0.013066733,0.03752868,-0.071625147,0.045697535,0.00965523,-0.006077223,0.044676822,-0.031180804,0.040124637,0.045047643
Effective inhibition of hepatitis E virus replication in A549 cells and piglets by RNA interference (RNAi) targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,"Abstract RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural mechanism for suppressing or silencing expression of aberrant or foreign genes. It is a powerful antiviral strategy that has been widely employed to protect hosts from viral infection. Hepatitis E (HE) is an acute fulminant hepatitis in adults that has particularly high mortality in pregnant women. At this point in time, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment that is effective against the infectious agent, HEV. The nonstructural polyprotein region possesses an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that is responsible for the replication of the viral RNA genome. RdRp is therefore regarded as one of the most attractive candidates for RNA interference (RNAi). In the present study, the high efficiency and specificity of siRNA were evaluated by Real-Time quantitative PCR and Western blot assays. Protective effects against HEV infection were achieved in A549 cells and in piglets. In piglets treated with a shRNA-RdRp-1 expression plasmid prior to HEV inoculation, HEV antigens were significantly reduced in the liver, spleen, and kidneys, and the activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total bilirubin (TBIL) were clearly decreased. These results suggested that RNAi is a potentially effective antiviral strategy against HEV replication and infection.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.139349398,-0.020784504,-0.038404208,0.031516317,-0.096125405,-0.006574208,0.047919813,0.010717366,0.015753516,0.026628242,0.05612475,0.033773661,-0.049503708,0.047830526,0.001375701,-0.03313532,-0.003803967,0.036666096,0.049122315,-0.031973116,0.043102431,-0.014592392,0.01887026,-0.04628871,-0.02458464,0.02592412,0.046464387,-0.013859044,0.043864792,0.025777624
Expression of an antiviral protein from Lonomia obliqua hemolymph in baculovirus/insect cell system,"Abstract The control of viral infections, mainly those caused by influenza viruses, is of great interest in Public Health. Several studies have shown the presence of active properties in the hemolymph of arthropods, some of which are of interest for the development of new pharmacological drugs. Recently, we have demonstrated the existence of a potent antiviral property in the hemolymph of Lonomia obliqua caterpillars. The aim of this study was to produce an antiviral protein in a baculovirus/Sf9 cell system. The resulting bacmid contains the sequence coding for the antiviral protein previously described by our group. Total RNA from L. obliqua caterpillars was extracted with Trizol and used in the reverse transcription assay with oligo(d)T primer followed by polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) with specific primers for the cDNA coding for the antiviral protein, based on the sequence deposited in the GenBank database. Restriction sites were inserted in the cDNA for ligation in the donor plasmid pFastBac1™. The recombinant plasmid was selected in Escherichia coli DH5α and subsequently used in the transformation of E. coli DH10Bac for the construction of the recombinant bacmid. This bacmid was used for the expression of the antiviral protein in the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system. After identifying the protein by western blot, activity tests were performed, showing that the purified recombinant protein was able to significantly reduce viral replication (about 4 logs). Studies on the optimization of the expression system for the production of this antiviral protein in insect cells are in progress.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.13598713,-0.040202596,0.013782497,0.03039005,-0.085092053,0.064040382,-0.028750093,-0.052656241,0.068981689,-0.00321313,-0.071008492,-0.026122078,0.037118123,0.041420344,-0.036049229,-0.103175013,0.058142073,0.040071752,0.049036954,-0.006847001,-0.008609164,0.030278731,0.029939679,0.043120214,0.039266737,0.103210144,0.095626634,-0.071748985,0.001591191,0.100584859
dsRNA binding characterization of full length recombinant wild type and mutants Zaire ebolavirus VP35,"Abstract The Ebola viruses (EBOVs) VP35 protein is a multifunctional major virulence factor involved in EBOVs replication and evasion of the host immune system. EBOV VP35 is an essential component of the viral RNA polymerase, it is a key participant of the nucleocapsid assembly and it inhibits the innate immune response by antagonizing RIG-I like receptors through its dsRNA binding function and, hence, by suppressing the host type I interferon (IFN) production. Insights into the VP35 dsRNA recognition have been recently revealed by structural and functional analysis performed on its C-terminus protein. We report the biochemical characterization of the Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) full-length recombinant VP35 (rVP35)–dsRNA binding function. We established a novel in vitro magnetic dsRNA binding pull down assay, determined the rVP35 optimal dsRNA binding parameters, measured the rVP35 equilibrium dissociation constant for heterologous in vitro transcribed dsRNA of different length and short synthetic dsRNA of 8bp, and validated the assay for compound screening by assessing the inhibitory ability of auryntricarboxylic acid (IC50 value of 50μg/mL). Furthermore, we compared the dsRNA binding properties of full length wt rVP35 with those of R305A, K309A and R312A rVP35 mutants, which were previously reported to be defective in dsRNA binding-mediated IFN inhibition, showing that the latter have measurably increased K d values for dsRNA binding and modified migration patterns in mobility shift assays with respect to wt rVP35. Overall, these results provide the first characterization of the full-length wt and mutants VP35–dsRNA binding functions.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.11714954,-0.030945563,-0.011728668,-0.022819913,-0.06234833,0.022322963,0.047977412,-0.007960124,0.018994887,-0.011804838,-0.012412321,0.020061566,-0.03095272,0.007891214,-0.03263109,-0.008351391,0.01650297,-0.042196826,-0.029769816,-0.002497544,0.013680024,-3.30E-05,0.000494751,-0.008237561,-0.005632113,0.009594749,0.023871296,-0.007326402,-0.00802909,-0.001508938
Artificial microRNAs can effectively inhibit replication of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus,"Abstract Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus is a member of the alphavirus family and genus togaviridae. VEEV is highly infectious in aerosol form and has been weaponized in the past making it a potential biothreat agent. At present, there are no FDA approved antiviral treatments or vaccines for VEEV. Artificial microRNAs are small molecules which are expressed through endogenous microRNA machinery by RNA polymerase II. These artificial microRNAs effectively inhibit gene expression and are non-toxic to the host cell. VEEV RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is central to VEEV replication. Therefore, we hypothesize that targeted inhibition of VEEV RdRp using artificial microRNAs may efficiently inhibit VEEV replication. Five artificial microRNAs were tested in vitro in BHK cells. Three of these artificial miRNAs showed significant inhibition of VEEV replication. Further, these microRNAs were cloned into the expression vector in combination to see the synergistic effect on VEEV replication. Combination of more than one miRNA did not result in significant inhibition of virus replication. In conclusion, we have shown that RNAi through artificial microRNAs effectively inhibits VEEV replication and is significantly less toxic in comparison to siRNAs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.125297656,-0.038411844,-0.027600185,-0.011950932,-0.068443082,0.028727875,0.03998272,-0.008492059,0.017680429,0.00726122,0.02397808,0.014527524,-0.037652343,0.045465767,0.006902621,0.022017805,-0.005098958,0.001347442,0.013788603,-0.011643529,0.018519887,0.007536694,0.010090984,-0.014158036,0.0017439,0.013341244,0.00484796,-0.000932933,0.00196915,0.004968911
SARS-CoV ORF1b-encoded nonstructural proteins 12–16: Replicative enzymes as antiviral targets,"Abstract The SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic caused ten years ago by the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has stimulated a number of studies on the molecular biology of coronaviruses. This research has provided significant new insight into many mechanisms used by the coronavirus replication-transcription complex (RTC). The RTC directs and coordinates processes in order to replicate and transcribe the coronavirus genome, a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of outstanding length (∼27–32kilobases). Here, we review the up-to-date knowledge on SARS-CoV replicative enzymes encoded in the ORF1b, i.e., the main RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the helicase/triphosphatase (nsp13), two unusual ribonucleases (nsp14, nsp15) and RNA-cap methyltransferases (nsp14, nsp16). We also review how these enzymes co-operate with other viral co-factors (nsp7, nsp8, and nsp10) to regulate their activity. These last ten years of research on SARS-CoV have considerably contributed to unravel structural and functional details of one of the most fascinating replication/transcription machineries of the RNA virus world.

Inhibition of enterovirus 71 infection by antisense octaguanidinium dendrimer-conjugated morpholino oligomers,"Abstract Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) infections are generally manifested as mild hand, foot and mouth disease, but have been reported to cause severe neurological complications with high mortality rates. Treatment options remain limited due to the lack of antivirals. Octaguanidinium-conjugated morpholino oligomers (vivo-MOs) are single-stranded DNA-like antisense agents that can readily penetrate cells and reduce gene expression by steric blocking of complementary RNA sequences. In this study, inhibitory effects of three vivo-MOs that are complementary to the EV-71 internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) were tested in RD cells. Vivo-MO-1 and vivo-MO-2 targeting the EV-71 IRES showed significant viral plaque reductions of 2.5 and 3.5 log10PFU/ml, respectively. Both vivo-MOs reduced viral RNA copies and viral capsid expression in RD cells in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, vivo-MO-3 targeting the EV-71 RdRP exhibited less antiviral activity. Both vivo-MO-1 and 2 remained active when administered either 4h before or within 6h after EV-71 infection. Vivo-MO-2 exhibited antiviral activities against poliovirus (PV) and coxsackievirus A16 but vivo-MO-1 showed no antiviral activities against PV. Both the IRES-targeting vivo-MO-1 and vivo-MO-2 inhibit EV-71 RNA translation. Resistant mutants arose after serial passages in the presence of vivo-MO-1, but none were isolated against vivo-MO-2. A single T to C substitution at nucleotide position 533 was sufficient to confer resistance to vivo-MO-1. Our findings suggest that IRES-targeting vivo-MOs are good antiviral candidates for treating early EV-71 infection, and vivo-MO-2 is a more favorable candidate with broader antiviral spectrum against enteroviruses and are refractory to antiviral resistance.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.096572684,-0.040725425,-0.027829748,-0.01561753,-0.065804225,0.025492676,0.047590673,-0.00172436,0.017670017,0.009714882,0.030278921,0.036983357,-0.029084187,0.002347936,-0.000139441,0.00575308,-0.022565117,0.037651695,0.028770715,-0.027999715,0.031685589,-0.005242254,-0.005659047,0.028524978,-0.011052652,0.005617692,0.003090076,0.011388167,0.04053037,0.014804135
"Meeting report: 27th International conference on antiviral research, in Raleigh, NC, USA","Abstract The 27th International Conference on Antiviral Research (ICAR) was held in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA from May 12 to 16, 2014. This article summarizes the principal invited lectures. John Drach (Elion Award) described the early days of antiviral drugs and their novel modes of action. Piet Herdewijn (Holý Award) used evolutionary pressure to select DNA polymerases that accept nucleoside analogs. Replacing thymine by 5-chlorouracil led to the generation of a new form of Escherichia coli. Adrian Ray (Prusoff Award) demonstrated how prodrugs can markedly improve both the efficacy and safety of potential drugs. The keynote addresses, by David Margolis and Myron Cohen, tackled two emerging areas of HIV research, to find an HIV “cure” and to prevent HIV transmission, respectively. These topics were discussed further in other presentations – a cure seems to be a distant prospect but there are exciting developments for reducing HIV transmission. TDF-containing vaginal rings and GSK-744, as a long-lasting injection, offer great hope. There were three mini-symposia. Although therapy with TDF/FTC gives excellent control of HBV replication, there are only a few patients who achieve a functional cure. Myrcludex, an entry inhibitor, is active against both HBV and HDV. The recent progress with HBV replication in cell cultures has transformed the search for new antiviral compounds. The HBV capsid protein has been recognized as key player in HBV DNA synthesis. Unexpectedly, compounds which enhance capsid formation, markedly reduce HBV DNA synthesis.

The Herpes Simplex Virus-1 genome contains multiple clusters of repeated G-quadruplex: Implications for the antiviral activity of a G-quadruplex ligand,"Abstract Guanine-rich nucleic acids can fold into G-quadruplexes, secondary structures implicated in important regulatory functions at the genomic level in humans, prokaryotes and viruses. The remarkably high guanine content of the Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) genome prompted us to investigate both the presence of G-quadruplex forming sequences in the viral genome and the possibility to target them with G-quadruplex ligands to obtain anti-HSV-1 effects with a novel mechanism of action. Using biophysical, molecular biology and antiviral assays, we showed that the HSV-1 genome displays multiple clusters of repeated sequences that form very stable G-quadruplexes. These sequences are mainly located in the inverted repeats of the HSV-1 genome. Treatment of HSV-1 infected cells with the G-quadruplex ligand BRACO-19 induced inhibition of virus production. BRACO-19 was able to inhibit Taq polymerase processing at G-quadruplex forming sequences in the HSV-1 genome, and decreased intracellular viral DNA in infected cells. The last step targeted by BRACO-19 was viral DNA replication, while no effect on virus entry in the cells was observed. This work, presents the first evidence of extended G-quadruplex sites in key regions of the HSV-1 genome, indicates the possibility to block viral DNA replication by G-quadruplex-ligand and therefore provides a proof of concept for the use of G-quadruplex ligands as new anti-herpetic therapeutic options.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.106592704,-0.035759178,0.001884407,-0.023312436,-0.056136272,0.035423933,0.044842993,-0.009269771,0.026574635,0.023716523,-0.035429637,-0.024536798,0.040890281,-0.004210296,0.013262936,0.010982004,-0.033028192,0.017344128,-0.006412175,0.013865185,-0.011440292,0.034118044,-0.051074755,0.021569796,-0.015775065,-0.010110502,0.026063648,0.006616022,-0.003371514,0.02674351
Meeting report: 4th ISIRV antiviral group conference: Novel antiviral therapies for influenza and other respiratory viruses,"Abstract The International Society for Influenza and other Respiratory Virus Diseases (isirv) held its 4th Antiviral Group Conference at the University of Texas on 2–4 June, 2015. With emerging resistance to the drugs currently licensed for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza viruses, primarily the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu) and the M2 inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine, and the lack of effective interventions against other respiratory viruses, the 3-day programme focused on the discovery and development of inhibitors of several virus targets and key host cell factors involved in virus replication or mediating the inflammatory response. Virus targets included the influenza haemagglutinin, neuraminidase and M2 proteins, and both the respiratory syncytial virus and influenza polymerases and nucleoproteins. Therapies for rhinoviruses and MERS and SARS coronaviruses were also discussed. With the emerging development of monoclonal antibodies as therapeutics, the potential implications of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease were also addressed. Topics covered all aspects from structural and molecular biology to preclinical and clinical studies. The importance of suitable clinical trial endpoints and regulatory issues were also discussed from the perspectives of both industry and government. This meeting summary provides an overview, not only for the conference participants, but also for those interested in the current status of antivirals for respiratory viruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.052760117,-0.023674177,-0.096736544,0.183747909,-0.088166237,0.254591997,0.025856788,-0.00941193,0.065212619,0.052495669,0.00068006,-0.023015392,0.091261064,-0.034861195,0.021276523,-0.047271446,-0.004086408,0.063058799,0.045307942,0.073970355,-0.003167167,-0.043345634,-0.042201966,0.052190292,0.029111421,-0.022158712,0.012061447,-0.089645325,0.060113134,-0.042437192
Identification of a novel small-molecule compound targeting the influenza A virus polymerase PB1-PB2 interface,"Abstract The PB1 C-terminal domain and PB2 N-terminal domain interaction of the influenza A polymerase, which modulates the assembly of PB1 and PB2 subunits, may serve as a valuable target for the development of novel anti-influenza therapeutics. In this study, we performed a systematic screening of a chemical library, followed by the antiviral evaluation of primary hits and their analogues. Eventually, a novel small-molecule compound PP7 that abrogated the PB1-PB2 association and impaired viral polymerase activity was identified. PP7 exhibited antiviral activities against influenza virus subtypes A (H1N1)pdm09, A(H7N9) and A(H9N2) in cell cultures and partially protected mice against lethal challenge of mouse-adapted influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus. Surprisingly, a panel of other subtypes of influenza virus, including A(H5N1) and A(H7N7), showed various degrees of resistance to the compound. Biochemical studies revealed a similar pattern of resistance on the impairment of polymerase activity. Molecular docking analyses suggested a PP7-binding site that appeared to be completely conserved among the subtypes of the virus mentioned above. Thus, we propose that alternative/additional binding site (s) may exist for the regulation of PB1-PB2 subunits assembly of influenza A virus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.034799339,-0.090493523,-0.033827675,0.128865869,-0.071547347,0.283484204,-0.072583485,-0.010170293,-0.001830759,-0.070294976,-0.008847139,0.043611594,0.00560705,-0.027414139,-0.019348313,-0.01486295,0.022659984,0.013508439,-0.001806194,-0.012240326,0.02874626,-0.006461346,0.026793105,0.011293792,0.017370194,0.064632545,-0.013723726,0.00058022,0.050014697,0.024423604
Ribavirin inhibits Zika virus (ZIKV) replication in vitro and suppresses viremia in ZIKV-infected STAT1-deficient mice,"Abstract Zika fever, a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by Zika virus (ZIKV), is an epidemic disease for which no effective therapy has been established. The recent outbreaks of ZIKV in Brazil and French Polynesia have been linked to a considerable increase in the incidence of fetal microcephaly and other diseases such as Guillain-Barre syndrome. Because there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine, the early exploitation of a method to prevent expansion of ZIKV is a high priority. To validate commonly used antiviral drugs, we evaluated the effect of ribavirin, a drug used to treat hepatitis C with interferon-β (IFN-β), on ZIKV replication. In mammalian cells, we observed an inhibitory effect of ribavirin on ZIKV replication and ZIKV-induced cell death without cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, we found that STAT1-deficient mice, which lack type I IFN signaling, were highly sensitive to ZIKV infection and exhibited lethal outcome. Ribavirin abrogated viremia in ZIKV-infected STAT-1-deficient mice. These data suggest that the inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases may be effective for treatment of ZIKV infection. Our data provide a new insight into the mechanisms for inhibition of ZIKV replication and prevention of Zika fever.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.079488712,-0.02163104,-0.006569368,-0.039943996,-0.109097777,0.069409348,0.067279278,-0.002465157,0.045410226,0.034658065,0.010153558,-0.000932358,-0.00155394,0.023075186,0.01573782,0.024838328,-0.045652492,0.068398905,-0.002912573,0.031703777,0.004518287,-0.010575337,-0.019432915,0.029201004,0.036309929,0.010013079,0.014377375,-0.005170816,-0.029071027,0.015037494
Toward the identification of viral cap-methyltransferase inhibitors by fluorescence screening assay,"Abstract Two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses associated with severe respiratory syndromes emerged since the beginning of the century. The severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-coronavirus (CoV) spread first in southern China in 2003 with about 8000 infected cases in few months. Then in 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) emerged from the Arabian Peninsula giving a still on-going epidemic associated to a high fatality rate. CoVs are thus considered a major health threat. This is especially true as no vaccine nor specific therapeutic are available against either SARS- or MERS-CoV. Therefore, new drugs need to be identified in order to develop antiviral treatments limiting CoV replication. In this study, we focus on the nsp14 protein, which plays a key role in virus replication as it methylates the RNA cap structure at the N7 position of the guanine. We developed a high-throughput N7-MTase assay based on Homogenous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF®) and screened chemical libraries (2000 compounds) on the SARS-CoV nsp14. 20 compounds inhibiting the SARS-CoV nsp14 were further evaluated by IC50 determination and their specificity was assessed toward flavivirus- and human cap N7-MTases. Our results reveal three classes of compounds: 1) molecules inhibiting several MTases as well as the dengue virus polymerase activity unspecifically, 2) pan MTases inhibitors targeting both viral and cellular MTases, and 3) inhibitors targeting one viral MTase more specifically showing however activity against the human cap N7-MTase. These compounds provide a first basis towards the development of more specific inhibitors of viral methyltransferases.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.016002492,0.304242008,-0.19775644,0.077027234,-0.067125263,0.052323094,0.058180808,0.011519766,0.103129596,0.046745201,0.001077421,-0.001308029,0.001508346,-0.035689789,-0.024469995,-0.041068129,-0.021023829,0.033160201,0.021014733,0.091060943,-0.013989345,0.062780037,0.091110048,0.11067766,0.088842152,-0.01644175,-0.013563813,-0.003206142,0.103554618,0.036955694
"Prevention and treatment of respiratory viral infections: Presentations on antivirals, traditional therapies and host-directed interventions at the 5th ISIRV Antiviral Group conference","Abstract The International Society for Influenza and other Respiratory Virus Diseases held its 5th Antiviral Group (isirv-AVG) Conference in Shanghai, China, in conjunction with the Shanghai Public Health Center and Fudan University from 14-16 June 2017. The three-day programme encompassed presentations on some of the clinical features, management, immune responses and virology of respiratory infections, including influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H7N9) viruses, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, adenovirus Type 80, enterovirus D68, metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Updates were presented on several therapeutics currently in clinical trials, including influenza polymerase inhibitors pimodivir/JNJ6362387, S033188, favipiravir, monoclonal antibodies MHAA45449A and VIS410, and host directed strategies for influenza including nitazoxanide, and polymerase ALS-008112 and fusion inhibitors AK0529, GS-5806 for RSV. Updates were also given on the use of the currently licensed neuraminidase inhibitors. Given the location in China, there were also presentations on the use of Traditional Chinese Medicines. Following on from the previous conference, there were ongoing discussions on appropriate endpoints for severe influenza in clinical trials from regulators and clinicians, an issue which remains unresolved. The aim of this conference summary is to provide information for not only conference participants, but a detailed referenced review of the current status of clinical trials, and pre-clinical development of therapeutics and vaccines for influenza and other respiratory diseases for a broader audience.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.142683609,0.023256081,-0.116272876,0.167692988,-0.056266969,0.250545452,-0.03752587,0.000174498,0.092736744,-0.031016289,0.01136583,-0.022686306,0.034867831,-0.074140482,-0.002828344,-0.035904368,-0.033063432,0.086895152,0.013597689,0.017841005,0.01735684,-0.047340728,-0.020272461,0.002194339,0.042765471,-0.065114007,0.036634688,0.012658954,0.053118208,0.021731432
Broad spectrum antiviral remdesivir inhibits human endemic and zoonotic deltacoronaviruses with a highly divergent RNA dependent RNA polymerase,"Abstract The genetically diverse Orthocoronavirinae (CoV) family is prone to cross species transmission and disease emergence in both humans and livestock. Viruses similar to known epidemic strains circulating in wild and domestic animals further increase the probability of emergence in the future. Currently, there are no approved therapeutics for any human CoV presenting a clear unmet medical need. Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog with potent activity against an array of RNA virus families including Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae, and Orthocoronavirinae, through the targeting of the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed multiple assays to further define the breadth of RDV antiviral activity against the CoV family. Here, we show potent antiviral activity of RDV against endemic human CoVs OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and 229E (HCoV-229E) with submicromolar EC50 values. Of known CoVs, the members of the deltacoronavirus genus have the most divergent RdRp as compared to SARS- and MERS-CoV and both avian and porcine members harbor a native residue in the RdRp that confers resistance in beta-CoVs. Nevertheless, RDV is highly efficacious against porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV). These data further extend the known breadth and antiviral activity of RDV to include both contemporary human and highly divergent zoonotic CoV and potentially enhance our ability to fight future emerging CoV.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.093260747,0.198560285,-0.138873469,0.080881676,0.077501174,0.066979643,0.157296729,0.073140299,0.095687014,-0.001414264,0.031658143,0.159806309,0.030284607,0.025854887,-0.007060363,-0.012626025,-0.012146455,0.034527058,0.017980747,0.010448579,0.007898353,-0.011253949,0.097597094,0.036283463,0.027877336,0.011345005,0.019308338,0.002021392,0.065462093,0.05514417
Similarity relations of DNA and RNA polymerases investigated by the principal component analysis of amino acid sequences,"Abstract The principal component analysis based on the physicochemical properties of amino acid residues is applied to DNA and RNA polymerases to assign the sequence motifs for the polymerization activities of these proteins. After the reconfirmation of the sequence motifs of families A and B of DNA polymerases indicated previously, it elucidates the sequence motifs for the polymerization activity of DNA polymerase III (family C) by the similarity to the polymerization center of multimeric DNA dependent RNA polymerases. This identification proceeds to clarify the sequence motifs for polymerization activities of primases; eukaryotic and archaebacterial primases carry motifs similar to those of family C, while the motifs of eubacterial primase fall into the category of the motifs in family B DNA polymerases such as α, δ, ϵ and II. This finding means that DNA dependent RNA polymerases are also divided into groups corresponding to three families, A, B and C, because the monomeric DNA dependent RNA polymerases in phages are reconfirmed to carry sequence motifs similar to those of family A DNA polymerases. Furthermore, the three families of polymerization motifs are found to fall within the variation range of polymerization motifs displayed by many RNA dependent RNA polymerases, suggesting a close evolutionary relation between them. The sequence motifs for polymerization activities of reverse transcriptase and telomerase seem to be the intermediate between family A DNA polymerase and some RNA dependent RNA polymerases, e.g., from Leviviridae. On the contrary, the sequence fragments similar to the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily including DNA polymerase β are not found in any RNA dependent RNA polymerase, suggesting their other lineage of polymerization motifs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.16684683,-0.031887833,-0.013768229,0.02994232,0.005877096,-0.047693249,0.025571599,0.032983422,-0.045461091,-0.000492328,0.010154599,0.048842821,-0.010304994,-0.080080781,-0.0303852,0.008204986,-0.005769477,-1.45E-06,-0.01283605,-0.031039692,-0.007311626,-0.010891681,-0.022787331,-0.019326424,-0.046673112,-0.044170259,-0.054330211,0.043668923,0.005040204,0.011660249
Calf-level risk factors for neonatal diarrhea and shedding of Cryptosporidium parvum in Ontario dairy calves,"Abstract This work was conducted to investigate calf-level factors that influence the risk of neonatal diarrhea and shedding of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts in calves, on dairy farms in Ontario with histories of calf diarrhea or cryptosporidiosis. Fecal samples were collected weekly for 4 weeks from each of 1045 calves under 30 days of age on 11 dairy farms in south-western Ontario during the summer of 2003 and the winter of 2004. A questionnaire designed to gather information on calf-level management factors was administered on farm for each calf in the study. Samples were examined for C. parvum oocysts by microscopy, and a subset of specimens was also tested for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella, bovine rotavirus and bovine coronavirus. The consistency of each sample was scored and recorded at the time of collection in order to assess the presence or absence of diarrhea. In addition, a blood sample was taken from each calf upon enrolment in the study, for assessment of maternal antibody transfer and for polymerase chain reaction testing for persistent bovine viral diarrhea virus infection. Using the GLLAMM function in Stata 9.0, multilevel regression techniques were employed to investigate associations between management practices and the risk of C. parvum shedding or diarrhea. C. parvum oocysts were detected in the feces of 78% of the 919 calves from which all four fecal samples had been collected. Furthermore, 73% of the 846 calves for which all four fecal consistency scores had been recorded were diarrheic at the time of collection of at least one sample. Significant predictors of the calf-level risk of C. parvum shedding included the use of calf diarrhea prophylaxis in pregnant cows, and the type of maternity facilities in which the calves were born. Factors associated with an increased risk of diarrhea were leaving the calf with the dam for more than an hour after birth, and the birth of a calf in the summer as opposed to winter. Calves shedding C. parvum oocysts had 5.3 (95% CI 4.4, 6.4) times the odds of diarrhea than non-shedding calves, controlling for other factors included in the final multivariable model. Furthermore, infected calves shedding more than 2.2×105 oocysts per gram of feces were more likely to scour than infected calves shedding lower numbers of oocysts (OR=6.1, 95% CI 4.8, 7.8). The odds of diarrhea in calves shedding oocysts that had been allowed to remain with their dams for more than an hour were higher than the odds of diarrhea in shedding calves that had been separated from their dams within an hour after birth.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.007742858,-0.015676577,0.043829677,-0.132412034,0.012232904,0.021440467,0.026508275,-0.013424229,-0.022110189,-0.071124066,0.058494366,0.061999334,-0.06107978,-0.030651319,0.076034042,-0.009729202,-0.032501229,-0.028602611,0.012727304,-0.032754632,-0.062086404,0.003021543,-0.056378096,0.000783354,0.051729369,-0.057691333,-0.012600527,-0.166465523,0.006286997,-0.024090249
Molecular detection of canine parvovirus in flies (Diptera) at open and closed canine facilities in the eastern United States,"Abstract More than thirty years have passed since canine parvovirus (CPV) emerged as a significant pathogen and it continues to pose a severe threat to world canine populations. Published information suggests that flies (Diptera) may play a role in spreading this virus; however, they have not been studied extensively and the degree of their involvement is not known. This investigation was directed toward evaluating the vector capacity of such flies and determining their potential role in the transmission and ecology of CPV. Molecular diagnostic methods were used in this cross-sectional study to detect the presence of CPV in flies trapped at thirty-eight canine facilities. The flies involved were identified as belonging to the house fly (Mucidae), flesh fly (Sarcophagidae) and blow/bottle fly (Calliphoridae) families. A primary surveillance location (PSL) was established at a canine facility in south-central South Carolina, USA, to identify fly–virus interaction within the canine facility environment. Flies trapped at this location were pooled monthly and assayed for CPV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. These insects were found to be positive for CPV every month from February through the end of November 2011. Fly vector behavior and seasonality were documented and potential environmental risk factors were evaluated. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare the mean numbers of each of the three fly families captured, and after determining fly CPV status (positive or negative), it was determined whether there were significant relationships between numbers of flies captured, seasonal numbers of CPV cases, temperature and rainfall. Flies were also sampled at thirty-seven additional canine facility surveillance locations (ASL) and at four non-canine animal industry locations serving as negative field controls. Canine facility risk factors were identified and evaluated. Statistical analyses were conducted on the number of CPV cases reported within the past year to determine the correlation of fly CPV status (positive or negative) for each facility, facility design (open or closed), mean number of dogs present monthly and number of flies captured. Significant differences occurred between fly CPV positive vs. negative sites with regard to their CPV case numbers, fly numbers captured, and number of dogs present.

Heterologous expression of fused genes encoding the glycoprotein 5 from PRRSV: A way for producing functional protein in prokaryotic microorganism,"Abstract Based on the bioinformatics analysis of the gene encoding glycoprotein 5 (GP5) of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) isolate HH08, two gene fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), deleting the signal peptide and transmembrane sequences in GP5 gene. Both gene fragments were designated GP5a and GP5b, respectively. They were ligated with a linker and cloned into prokaryotic expression vector, pET-30a. Expression of the protein of interest was induced by isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. The purified protein was used as an immunogen to elicit antibody in rabbit. The immunoreactivity of the protein was determined using ELISA and Western blot. Biologically active GP5 and anti-GP5 antibody inhibited cell infection by PRRSV. Moreover, the antibody produced in this study was capable of detecting the cell infection by PRRSV and distinguishing this virus from other viruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.095890924,-0.023487797,0.038189527,-0.084614996,0.003617476,0.028899659,-0.07503307,-0.07974916,0.105204222,-0.025416239,-0.123655444,-0.090503732,0.036115296,0.061431585,0.024378804,-0.147517366,0.080145096,-0.072248919,0.004592221,0.025321827,-0.007039862,-0.02658295,0.096871556,-0.027840752,0.028400544,0.096889327,0.063224645,-0.060589393,-0.103494165,0.083156737
A recombinant Fab neutralizes dengue virus in vitro,"Abstract A recombinant Fab that recognizes a neutralizing epitope located in the (296–400) region of protein E of dengue virus was obtained from cloned hybridoma cells secreting the mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4E11. The Fd and light chain antibody genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, cloned into the phagemid vector pMad, expressed in bacteria to produce Fab fragments and sequenced. The mAb 4E11, in particular its light chain complementary-determining regions, shared homologies with two other anti-viral mAbs. The affinity of the parental mAb and the cloned Fab to the MalE-E(296–400) fusion protein were shown to be of the same magnitude, i.e. nanomolar. Fab 4E11 neutralization capacity was found between 8 and 4-times or less lower than that of mAb 4E11, depending on serotypes, thus the Fab could have a smaller antiviral activity than the mAb in vitro.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.084349283,-0.032471054,0.006204637,-0.073148037,-0.026037508,0.02154767,-0.029108324,-0.031080519,0.039338901,-0.02369039,-0.042291048,-0.000525086,0.003220214,-0.017078566,0.002742532,-0.032900938,0.021984375,0.002678128,0.002115201,-0.009470317,0.009605339,-0.005154791,0.040590964,0.01093127,0.044811998,0.076545021,0.020768681,-0.027840867,-0.033211086,0.049598025
Molecular confirmation of an adenovirus in brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula),"Abstract Partial genome characterisation of a non-cultivable marsupial adenovirus is described. Adenovirus-like particles were found by electron microscopy (EM) in the intestinal contents of brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) in New Zealand. Using degenerate PCR primers complementary to the most conserved genome regions of adenoviruses, the complete nucleotide sequence of the penton base gene, and partial nucleotide sequences of the DNA polymerase, hexon, and pVII genes were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis of the penton base gene strongly suggested that the brushtail possum adenovirus (candidate PoAdV-1) belongs to the recently proposed genus Atadenovirus. Sequence analysis of the PCR products amplified from the intestinal contents of brushtail possums originating from different geographical regions of New Zealand identified a single genotype.

Molecular characterization of noroviruses detected in diarrheic stools of Michigan and Wisconsin dairy calves: circulation of two distinct subgroups,"Abstract Noroviruses have emerged as the leading worldwide cause of acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis in humans. The presence of noroviruses in diarrheic stool samples from calves on Michigan and Wisconsin dairy farms was investigated by RT-PCR. Norovirus-positive samples were found on all eight farms studied in Michigan and on 2 out of 14 farms in Wisconsin. Phylogenetic analyses of partial polymerase and capsid sequences, derived for a subset of these bovine noroviruses, showed that these strains formed a group which is genetically distinct from the human noroviruses, but more closely related to genogroup I than to genogroup II human noroviruses. Examination of 2 full and 10 additional partial capsid (ORF2) sequences of these bovine strains revealed the presence of two genetic subgroups or clusters of bovine noroviruses circulating on Michigan and Wisconsin farms. One subgroup is “Jena-like”, the other “Newbury agent-2-like”.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.034185107,-0.002786846,0.062214953,-0.089433007,0.113893581,0.037697181,0.018111827,-0.007656149,-0.017147469,-0.012084505,0.015706005,0.07114728,-0.035857804,-0.018319224,0.038387031,-0.0461276,-0.010985998,0.020386914,0.019767502,-0.013063305,0.062275447,0.043523563,-0.065570183,0.046307823,0.028938796,-0.046341335,-0.005732207,-0.047843763,0.049574732,-0.014532054
Harmonising the virological surveillance of influenza in Europe: results of an 18-country survey,"Abstract The European influenza surveillance scheme (EISS) is based on a surveillance model that combines clinical and virological data in the general population. Eighteen countries in Europe report weekly influenza activity to EISS (http://www.eiss.org). A questionnaire on the virological data collection was sent electronically to the EISS members. Questions on the specimen collection, representativity, laboratory diagnosis of influenza, reporting of variants, testing for other respiratory infections, serological testing, near-patient tests and preparedness for a pandemic were included. The results of the survey showed that for the typing of influenza, the methods polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) methods are used most frequently. For the subtyping of influenza, HAI and PCR are used most often. An east-west divide was seen for the use of PCR in typing and subtyping (more PCR use in the west). Differences in the virological surveillance systems in Europe can make direct comparisons difficult because detection rates may differ by test. For the reporting of other respiratory infections besides influenza, many networks (68%) collect information on RSV. This is important because RSV causes similar clinical symptoms as influenza and can have a similar impact in terms of burden of disease. With the collection of RSV data, EISS is moving to a broader spectrum of viral respiratory diseases. The findings of this survey will be used to better harmonise laboratory methods in EISS in order to obtain more reliable and comparable information on influenza activity in Europe.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.130912278,-0.061543547,0.02164197,0.142330638,-0.032324049,0.180232951,-0.066168632,-0.018747232,0.023233844,-0.057691663,0.014822053,-0.02304575,0.001049144,-0.058811063,-0.020826915,-0.010679206,0.001020001,0.007205396,-0.02203413,-0.082051877,0.020729934,-0.081425125,0.026835139,-0.092882929,0.041371433,-0.058461602,0.058472665,0.025591834,0.002696857,0.035876495
Complete sequences of 3′ end coding region for structural protein genes of turkey coronavirus,"Abstract Overlapping fragments of genomic RNA spanning 6963 nucleotides from 5′ end of spike (S) protein gene to 3′ end of nucleocapsid (N) protein gene of turkey coronavirus (TCoV) were amplified by reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The primers were derived from the corresponding sequences of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The PCR products were cloned and sequenced and their nucleic acid structure and similarity to published sequences of other coronaviruses were analyzed. Sequencing and subsequent analysis revealed 9 open reading frames (ORFs) representing the entire S protein gene, tricistronic gene 3, membrane (M) protein gene, bicistronic gene 5, and N protein gene in the order of 5′–3′. The overall nucleic acid structures of these encoding regions of TCoV were very similar to the homologous regions of IBV. The consensus transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) of IBV, CT(T/G)AACAA, was highly conserved in TCoV genome at the levels of nucleotide sequence and location in regarding to the initiation codon of individual genes. Pair-wise comparison of gene 3, M gene, gene 5, or N gene sequences with their counterparts of IBV revealed high levels (82.1–92.0%) of similarity. Phylogenetic analysis based on the deduced amino acid sequences of S, M, or N protein demonstrated that TCoV was clustered within the same genomic lineage as the IBV strains while all the other mammalian coronaviruses were grouped into separate clusters corresponding to antigenic groups I or II. There were substantial differences of S protein sequence between TCoV and IBV with only 33.8–33.9% of similarity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.18520972,-0.011508347,0.090830914,-0.097071282,0.251501515,-0.000992373,-0.253600947,-0.06886806,0.107749322,0.169212265,-0.086807675,-0.038621149,0.012381986,-0.0458924,-0.182029505,-0.024122524,0.081155742,0.007509327,-0.003944768,0.001585842,-0.036260007,-0.001121356,0.003006371,-0.014396277,-0.01920835,0.023348388,0.055535666,-0.040402162,0.026249199,0.07245155
"Incorporation fidelity of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase: a kinetic, thermodynamic and structural perspective","Abstract Positive-strand RNA viruses exist as a quasi-species due to the incorporation of mutations into the viral genome during replication by the virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). Therefore, the RdRP is often described as a low-fidelity enzyme. However, until recently, a complete description of the kinetic, thermodynamic and structural basis for the nucleotide incorporation fidelity of the RdRP has not been available. In this article, we review the following: (i) the steps employed by the RdRP to incorporate a correct nucleotide; (ii) the steps that are employed by the RdRP for nucleotide selection; (iii) the structure-based hypothesis for nucleotide selection; (iv) the impact of sites remote from the active site on polymerase fidelity. Given the recent observation that RNA viruses exist on the threshold of error catastrophe, the studies reviewed herein suggest novel strategies to perturb RdRP fidelity that may lead ultimately to the development of antiviral agents to treat RNA virus infection.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.220953406,-0.045338781,-0.097908795,0.169905446,-0.020821862,-0.043692463,0.12704147,0.056245384,-0.102946352,0.09558972,0.185866888,0.183323595,-0.119125039,-0.090984303,-0.023258641,-0.023205704,0.005896643,-0.038892365,-0.094919514,-0.078468928,0.139676458,-0.10185508,0.08716042,0.048812212,-0.034445816,0.066493824,0.070754141,-0.020141165,-0.002614443,-0.032494473
De novo RNA synthesis and homology modeling of the classical swine fever virus RNA polymerase,"Abstract Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) non-structural protein 5B (NS5B) encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a key enzyme which initiates RNA replication by a de novo mechanism without a primer and is a potential target for anti-virus therapy. We expressed the NS5B protein in Escherichia coli. The rGTP can stimulate de novo initiation of RNA synthesis and mutation of the GDD motif to Gly–Asp–Asp (GAA) abolishes the RNA synthesis. To better understand the mechanism of viral RNA synthesis in CSFV, a three-dimensional model was built by homology modeling based on the alignment with several virus RdRps. The model contains 605 residues folded in the characteristic fingers, palm and thumb domains. The fingers domain contains an N-terminal region that plays an important role in conformational change. We propose that the experimentally observed promotion of polymerase efficiency by rGTP is probably due to the conformational changes of the polymerase caused by binding the rGTP. Mutation of the GDD to GAA interferes with the interaction between the residues at the polymerase active site and metal ions, and thus renders the polymerase inactive.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.235585798,-0.056752778,-0.079044962,0.107610432,-0.05866948,-0.065716785,0.001224234,0.019678178,-0.040086879,0.019096994,0.057379726,0.082815971,-0.049172703,-0.032587153,-0.035187866,-0.051479742,0.063679968,-0.001188105,0.009873089,-0.029242324,-0.022140164,-0.019251976,0.038608097,-0.050541682,0.0097656,0.043342385,-0.00483363,0.002038925,0.012335512,0.021173937
The complete sequence of the bovine torovirus genome,"Abstract Viruses in the family Coronaviridae have elicited new interest, with the outbreaks caused by SARS-HCoV in 2003 and the recent discovery of a new human coronavirus, HCoV-NL63. The genus Torovirus, within the family Coronaviridae, is less well characterized, in part because toroviruses cannot yet be grown in cell culture (except for the Berne virus). In this study, we determined the sequence of the complete genome of Breda-1 (BoTV-1), a bovine torovirus. This is the first complete torovirus genome sequence to be reported. BoTV-1 RNA was amplified using long RT-PCR and the amplicons sequenced. The genome has a length of 28.475kb and consisted mainly of the replicase gene (∼20.2kb) which contains two large overlapping ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, encoding polyproteins pp1a and pp1b, respectively. Sequence analysis identified conserved domains within the predicted sequences of pp1a and pp1b. Sequence alignments and protein secondary structure prediction data suggest the presence of a 3C-like serine protease domain with similarity to the arterivirus 3C-like serine protease and a single papain-like cysteine protease domain with similarity to the picornavirus leader protease. The ADRP (APPR-1″) domain – unique to the Coronaviridae – was also located in BoTV pp1a. In addition, several hydrophobic domains were identified that are typical of a nidovirus replicase. Within the pp1b sequence the polymerase and helicase domains were identified, as well as sequences predicted to be involved in ribosomal frameshifting, including the conserved slippery sequence UUUAAAC and two potential pseudoknot structures.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.15341946,0.004699149,-0.039918452,0.004061764,0.157406708,-0.055304159,-0.09189597,-0.042249384,0.021928441,-0.054916103,-0.122709825,0.11650841,0.141005645,-0.099456378,-0.060668597,-0.112230089,0.087426778,0.01997433,-0.008979852,0.013143789,-0.011908445,0.007761978,-0.063496447,-0.005621349,-0.019494861,0.018374064,0.0501076,-0.00682511,0.043161163,-0.067732241
Nidovirales: Evolving the largest RNA virus genome,"Abstract This review focuses on the monophyletic group of animal RNA viruses united in the order Nidovirales. The order includes the distantly related coronaviruses, toroviruses, and roniviruses, which possess the largest known RNA genomes (from 26 to 32kb) and will therefore be called ‘large’ nidoviruses in this review. They are compared with their arterivirus cousins, which also belong to the Nidovirales despite having a much smaller genome (13–16kb). Common and unique features that have been identified for either large or all nidoviruses are outlined. These include the nidovirus genetic plan and genome diversity, the composition of the replicase machinery and virus particles, virus-specific accessory genes, the mechanisms of RNA and protein synthesis, and the origin and evolution of nidoviruses with small and large genomes. Nidoviruses employ single-stranded, polycistronic RNA genomes of positive polarity that direct the synthesis of the subunits of the replicative complex, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and helicase. Replicase gene expression is under the principal control of a ribosomal frameshifting signal and a chymotrypsin-like protease, which is assisted by one or more papain-like proteases. A nested set of subgenomic RNAs is synthesized to express the 3′-proximal ORFs that encode most conserved structural proteins and, in some large nidoviruses, also diverse accessory proteins that may promote virus adaptation to specific hosts. The replicase machinery includes a set of RNA-processing enzymes some of which are unique for either all or large nidoviruses. The acquisition of these enzymes may have improved the low fidelity of RNA replication to allow genome expansion and give rise to the ancestors of small and, subsequently, large nidoviruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.201854475,-0.040997899,-0.062476017,0.101209508,0.043565365,-0.062973227,0.001938125,0.033732658,-0.040116693,0.013021988,0.013932409,0.003443349,0.011155834,-0.022060356,-0.015976245,-0.021863386,0.038061616,-0.034057329,-0.028130062,0.028337869,-0.030622214,-0.002037304,-0.04962554,-0.048065182,-0.045308276,-0.023057787,-0.021994239,-0.002407036,-0.035535485,-0.06954027
Sequence analysis of a reovirus isolated from the winter moth Operophtera brumata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) and its parasitoid wasp Phobocampe tempestiva (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae),"Abstract A reovirus was isolated from Operophtera brumata (ObRV) and its parasitoid wasp Phobocampe tempestiva. Each of the 10 dsRNA genome segments of ObRV was sequenced and shown to contain a single open reading frame (ORF). Conserved motifs ([+ve] 5′-AAATAAA … G/TAGGTT-3′) were found at the termini of each segment, with the exception of Seg-6 and Seg-8, where the 5′ termini were 5′-AACAAA…-3′. The putative proteins encoded by each segment were compared with those of other members of the family Reoviridae. Phylogenetic comparisons to published sequences for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes from other reoviruses indicated that ObRV is most closely related to members of the genus Cypovirus. However, unlike the cypoviruses, ObRV has a double-layered capsid structure. When the protein encoded by ObRV Seg-10 was expressed (by inserting the open reading frame into a baculovirus expression vector) no ‘occlusion bodies’ were observed in the recombinant baculovirus infected insect cell cultures. This suggests that unlike the cypoviruses, Seg-10 of ObRV does not contain a polyhedrin gene. Further phylogenetic comparisons also identified relationships between Seg-2 and Seg-10 of ObRV, and genes of Diadromus pulchellus Idnoreovirus 1 (DpIRV1), suggesting that ObRV represents a new species from the genus Idnoreovirus.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.171725278,-0.041005105,-0.015663919,-0.040639722,0.100358499,-0.026456271,-0.048998467,0.009743791,0.004318437,-0.057443564,-0.102373554,-0.025956161,0.006569081,-0.0406346,-0.037958078,-0.095074098,0.052507229,-0.00727812,0.032342724,-0.006294207,0.006394163,0.011689254,-0.028219899,0.01027039,-0.102714971,-0.003671923,0.053162172,0.003350657,-0.033954925,0.012801503
Comparative sequence analysis of the distal one-third of the genomes of a systemic and an enteric ferret coronavirus,"Abstract Ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV) infection is associated with an emerging, highly fatal disease of ferrets. Enhanced macrophage tropism and the resulting induction of pyogranulomatous lesions are shared with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) infection in cats, but are not features of ferret enteric coronavirus (FRECV) infection. Comparative sequence analysis of the distal one-third of the genomes of one FRSCV and one FRECV strain showed that these two ferret coronaviruses share >96% nucleotide sequence identities in the membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and non-structural protein genes (partial polymerase, open reading frames [ORFs] 3 and 7b). The envelope (E) protein gene showed a moderate nucleotide sequence similarity of 91.6%. In contrast, nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities observed with the spike (S) protein were only 79.5 and 79.6%, respectively. Twenty-one amino acid differences within a 195–199-amino acid C-terminal portion of the S protein were conserved between 3 strains each of FRSCV and FRECV. Both systemic and enteric strains were found to carry a single ORF 3 gene with truncated proteins observed in two out of three FRSCV strains examined. The two enteric strains analyzed each contained an intact ORF 3 gene.

Inhibition of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) replication in mini-pigs by shRNA,"Abstract Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is the causative agent of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), characterized by high mortality and severely retarded growth in piglets that dramatically affects the porcine industry. Previously, we have identified two shRNA-expressing plasmids pEGFP-U6/P1 and pEGFP-U6/P2 that target RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene of TGEV with more than 95% of virus inhibition in vitro. In this study, inhibition of the TGEV replication by pEGFP-U6/P1 and pEGFP-U6/P2 was tested in mini-pigs. SPF mini-pigs at 25 days old were injected with the shRNA-expressing plasmids and then infected with TGEV. The results from the analyses of clinical signs, histopathology, indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and RT-PCR show that the two shRNA-expressing plasmids could significantly decrease the quantity of TGEV in different organs and protect mini-pigs from TGEV infection. These findings illustrate the prospect for TGEV-specific shRNAs to be new anti-TGEV agents.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.07301879,-0.016913501,0.038489131,-0.051580974,0.001264288,0.008866601,-0.016020358,-0.014161606,0.003990722,-0.034839933,0.025803338,0.044387539,-0.084889949,0.016822547,0.081874562,-0.053977692,0.010696108,0.009400247,0.017644066,0.049914815,-0.017952113,-0.000259591,0.033754578,-0.000533213,0.064226153,0.017179181,-0.002124995,-0.048970361,0.012680245,0.028660675
The PRRSV replicase: Exploring the multifunctionality of an intriguing set of nonstructural proteins,"Abstract Our knowledge about the structure and function of the nonstructural proteins (nsps) encoded by the arterivirus replicase gene has advanced in recent years. The continued characterization of the nsps of the arterivirus prototype equine arteritis virus has not only corroborated several important functional predictions, but also revealed various novel features of arteriviral replication. For porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), based on bioinformatics predictions and experimental studies, a processing map for the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins has been developed. Crystal structures have been resolved for two of the PRRSV nonstructural proteins that possess proteinase activity (nsp1α and nsp4). The functional characterization of the key enzymes for arterivirus RNA synthesis, the nsp9 RNA polymerase and nsp10 helicase, has been initiated. In addition, progress has been made on nsp functions relating to the regulation of subgenomic mRNAs synthesis (nsp1), the induction of replication-associated membrane rearrangements (nsp2 and nsp3), and an intriguing replicative endoribonuclease (nsp11) for which the natural substrate remains to be identified. The role of nsps in viral pathogenesis and host immunity is also being explored, and specific nsps (including nsp1α/β, nsp2, nsp4, nsp7, and nsp11) have been implicated in the modulation of host immune responses to PRRSV infection. The nsp3–8 region was identified as containing major virulence factors, although mechanistic information is scarce. The biological significance of PRRSV nsps in virus-host interactions and the technical advancements in engineering the PRRSV genome by reverse genetics are also reflected in recent developments in the area of vaccines and diagnostic assays.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14425308,-0.040762797,-0.051859169,0.033771987,-0.052748488,-0.003644483,0.028960184,-0.017251772,0.035377877,0.016025467,-0.021376401,-0.010793186,0.007038648,0.026341899,0.01444035,-0.066137485,0.065524023,-0.065871492,-0.02949138,0.086762957,-0.072512574,0.023627283,-0.014402345,-0.105116804,0.053543791,0.037251783,-0.011284038,-0.02746364,-0.07727328,0.023933106
Intracerebral delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) using adenoviral vector protects mice against lethal peripheral rabies challenge,"Abstract To investigate the potential of RNA interference (RNAi) as antiviral agent against rabies, two small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting rabies virus (RABV) nucleoprotein (N) and polymerase (L) genes were designed and evaluated. Both siRNAs knockdown or silenced the target RABV genes as evaluated in a plasmid based transient expression model. For efficient delivery, adenoviruses expressing the siRNAs were constructed and antiviral potential of the delivered siRNAs was investigated in BHK-21 cells. When cells treated with adenoviruses expressing siRNAs were challenged with RABV, there was 88.35±2.4% and 41.52±9.3% reduction in RABV multiplication in infected cells with siRNAs targeting RABV-N and L genes, respectively. Relative quantification of RABV transcripts using real-time PCR revealed knockdown of both RABV-N and L gene transcripts, however, significant reduction was observed only with adenovirus expressing siRNA against RABV-N. When mice treated intracerebrally with adenoviruses expressing siRNAs were challenged peripherally with lethal RABV by the intramuscular route in masseter muscle, there was 66.6% and 33.3% protection with adenoviruses expressing siRNAs against RABV-N and L genes, respectively. These results demonstrated that adenovirus expressing siRNA against RABV-N efficiently inhibited the RABV multiplication both, in vitro and in vivo and conferred significant protection against lethal RABV challenge. This supported the hypothesis that RNAi, based on siRNA targeting RABV-N gene can prevent RABV infection and holds the potential of RNAi as an approach to prevent rabies infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.059876219,-0.021722734,0.013507833,-0.070815398,-0.038266409,0.03775441,0.014925066,-0.01357367,0.032851057,-0.026355758,-0.025040304,-0.009888533,-0.018079568,0.021221335,0.023415836,0.020920831,-0.029500754,0.006173937,0.008606103,-0.033239189,0.026514468,0.010813369,0.011953567,0.01107762,-0.02312062,-0.002473086,0.015038459,0.01248586,0.018819962,-0.006178594
Typing of canine parvovirus strains circulating in Brazil between 2008 and 2010,"Abstract Detection and characterisation of the canine parvovirus (CPV-2) strains that are currently circulating are essential for the understanding of viral evolution and the development of measures to control its spread. In the present study, stool samples from 144 dogs were analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for CPV-2, and 29.2% (42/144) of them were positive. From the 42 positive strains, 71.4% (30) of the dogs had signs of haemorrhagic gastroenteritis. The sequencing of the 583bp fragment of the VP2 gene from the positive strains identified 78.6% (33/42) of them as type 2c, 19% (8/42) as type 2b and 2.4% (1/42) as type 2a. A phylogenetic analysis of the variants circulating in the canine population of Brazil showed that they are very similar to those found in other countries and type 2c has become the predominant type circulating in Brazil.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.010646914,-0.002054594,0.084716815,-0.099221009,0.085123078,0.047702502,0.004101477,0.005765602,-0.025420499,0.005339602,0.05700777,0.078598799,-0.050310086,-0.042736487,0.047710725,-0.039601828,-0.044485082,-0.046912594,0.080135411,-0.003722692,0.185921315,0.119212428,-0.094963467,0.004955274,0.12945497,-0.120628025,-0.055993681,-0.008636307,-0.066649641,0.086719651
Genomic characterization of seven distinct bat coronaviruses in Kenya,"Abstract To better understand the genetic diversity and genomic features of 41 coronaviruses (CoVs) identified from Kenya bats in 2006, seven CoVs as representatives of seven different phylogenetic groups identified from partial polymerase gene sequences, were subjected to extensive genomic sequencing. As a result, 15–16kb nucleotide sequences encoding complete RNA dependent RNA polymerase, spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins plus other open reading frames (ORFs) were generated. Sequences analysis confirmed that the CoVs from Kenya bats are divergent members of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera. Furthermore, the CoVs BtKY22, BtKY41, and BtKY43 in Alphacoronavirus genus and BtKY24 in Betacoronavirus genus are likely representatives of 4 novel CoV species. BtKY27 and BtKY33 are members of the established bat CoV species in Alphacoronavirus genus and BtKY06 is a member of the established bat CoV species in Betacoronavirus genus. The genome organization of these seven CoVs is similar to other known CoVs from the same groups except for differences in the number of putative ORFs following the N gene. The present results confirm a significant diversity of CoVs circulating in Kenya bats. These Kenya bat CoVs are phylogenetically distant from any previously described human and animal CoVs. However, because of the examples of host switching among CoVs after relatively minor sequence changes in S1 domain of spike protein, a further surveillance in animal reservoirs and understanding the interface between host susceptibility is critical for predicting and preventing the potential threat of bat CoVs to public health.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.125224793,0.126325671,-0.082516291,-0.009489371,0.355166811,0.118493796,0.243547681,0.105003817,-0.095345903,-0.078978012,-0.144854228,-0.117627901,-0.047399248,0.021909925,-0.085363415,0.054671338,0.029396753,0.072983332,0.001417891,0.006884865,-0.04296985,-0.03309841,0.060257304,-0.059414069,0.038643827,0.035704539,-0.009161607,-0.031422427,0.027532754,0.022973898
A study of the virulence in mice of high copying fidelity variants of human enterovirus 71,"Abstract Polioviruses with a G64S mutation in the 3D polymerase have enhanced replication fidelity and are attenuated in animal models. Here we describe the mouse virulence properties of high replication fidelity 3D polymerase variants of human enterovirus 71 (HEV71), with mutations at positions 3D-S264L, 3D-G64R or at 3D-S264L plus 3D-G64R. Mouse-adapted strains (MP-G64R, MP-S264L and MP-S264L-G64R) were constructed in order to compare the virulence of the 3D polymerase variants with that of mouse-adapted parental virus (MP-26M). MP-S264L and MP-S264L-G64R were attenuated in mice (mean survival time 7.0 and 7.5 days p.i., respectively) compared to MP-G64R and MP-26M (mean survival time 6.5 and 6.0 days p.i., respectively). MP-26M and MP-G64R infection induced early onset, severe generalised necrotising myositis, whereas MP-S264L and MP-S264L-G64R infection induced a later onset, mild and focal skeletal muscle myositis. Our findings demonstrate that only the 3D-S264L mutation attenuates HEV71 in mice, suggesting that the high replication fidelity phenotype is not essential for virulence attenuation in this model.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.053239107,-0.026901048,-0.003757787,-0.062182009,-0.035763257,0.034083336,0.03250176,-0.001326545,0.002868245,-0.00582201,0.021583612,0.038681152,-0.0462609,-0.019490565,0.016276022,0.030337611,-0.025752184,-0.014550176,-0.046403996,-0.020185151,0.068146223,-0.046139403,0.016254036,0.035997983,-0.003884229,0.039881833,-0.006995138,-0.022519167,-0.03444525,-0.054099147
Retrospective on the all-in-one retroviral nucleocapsid protein,"Abstract This review aims at briefly presenting a retrospect on the retroviral nucleocapsid protein (NC), from an unspecific nucleic acid binding protein (NABP) to an all-in-one viral protein with multiple key functions in the early and late phases of the retrovirus replication cycle, notably reverse transcription of the genomic RNA and viral DNA integration into the host genome, and selection of the genomic RNA together with the initial steps of virus morphogenesis. In this context we will discuss the notion that NC protein has a flexible conformation and is thus a member of the growing family of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) where disorder may account, at least in part, for its function as a nucleic acid (NA) chaperone and possibly as a protein chaperone vis-à-vis the viral DNA polymerase during reverse transcription. Lastly, we will briefly review the development of new anti-retroviral/AIDS compounds targeting HIV-1 NC because it represents an ideal target due to its multiple roles in the early and late phases of virus replication and its high degree of conservation.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.170339659,-0.039640314,-0.019070856,0.051148136,-0.110892445,0.000824597,0.043348835,-0.023235257,0.027608704,0.042473239,-0.044211339,-0.02652462,0.056142403,-0.024458908,-0.032726411,-0.034818156,0.019959417,-0.002816619,-0.03160255,0.066062986,-0.087401864,0.041924943,-0.067524998,-0.033944219,0.029710458,0.022835762,0.025486928,-0.053613007,-0.053469384,0.092537759
Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infects and replicates in porcine alveolar macrophages,"Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea; consequently, the small intestine was believed to be its only target organ. In this study, we found that PEDV infected not only the small intestines, but also the respiratory tract. Infection and replication of PEDV in the respiratory tract from naturally PEDV-infected piglets were examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and virus re-isolation. Our observations were confirmed by experimental inoculation, and we found that PEDV infection in the respiratory tract was specifically associated with alveolar macrophages in the lung. Vero cell-adapted PEDV was able to replicate in both primary alveolar macrophages and continuous porcine alveolar macrophage cells. Sequencing analysis of the spike (S) glycoprotein revealed that mutations in S might be a potential determinant of auxiliary targets for PEDV.

Generation of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus by in vitro assembly of viral genomic cDNA fragments,"Abstract Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the causative agent for a swine disease affecting the pig industry worldwide. Infection with PRRSV leads to reproductive complications, respiratory illness, and weak immunity to secondary infections. To better control PRRSV infection, novel approaches for generating control measures are critically needed. Here, in vitro Gibson assembly (GA) of viral genomic cDNA fragments was tested for its use as a quick and simple method to recover infectious PRRSV in cell culture. GA involves the activities of T5-exonuclease, Phusion polymerase, and Taq ligase to join overlapping cDNA fragments in an isothermal condition. Four overlapping cDNA fragments covering the entire PRRSV genome and one vector fragment were used to create a plasmid capable of expressing the PRRSV genome. The assembled product was used to transfect a co-culture of 293T and MARC-145 cells. Supernatants from the transfected cells were then passaged onto MARC-145 cells to rescue infectious virus particles. Verification and characterization of the recovered virus confirmed that the GA protocol generated infectious PRRSV that had similar characteristics to the parental virus. This approach was then tested for the generation of a chimeric virus. By replacing one of the four genomic fragments with that of another virus strain, a chimeric virus was successfully recovered via GA. In conclusion, this study describes for the first time the use of GA as a simple, yet powerful tool for generating infectious PRRSV needed for studying PRRSV biology and developing novel vaccines.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.05553227,-0.033132999,0.033275639,-0.028523777,-0.025221751,0.028942776,-0.037205301,-0.034436148,0.061196259,0.034567905,-0.044061579,-0.067948506,0.031299232,0.020404504,0.089653482,-0.037553764,0.000930714,-0.034723138,-0.017737014,0.087169906,-0.046885486,-0.016142691,0.045999791,-0.076453305,0.013298115,0.075322525,0.012977669,-0.023921803,-0.134303007,0.078822266
"Insights into RNA synthesis, capping, and proofreading mechanisms of SARS-coronavirus","Abstract The successive emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs) such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 has stimulated a number of studies on the molecular biology. This research has provided significant new insight into functions and activities of the replication/transcription multi-protein complex. The latter directs both continuous and discontinuous RNA synthesis to replicate and transcribe the large coronavirus genome made of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of ∼30kb. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of SARS-CoV enzymes involved in RNA biochemistry, such as the in vitro characterization of a highly active and processive RNA polymerase complex which can associate with methyltransferase and 3′–5′ exoribonuclease activities involved in RNA capping, and RNA proofreading, respectively.

"Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus proteins VP2, VP3, VP4 and VP5 antagonize IFNa1 promoter activation while VP1 induces IFNa1","Abstract Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is one of the major viral pathogens causing disease in farmed Atlantic salmon worldwide. In the present work we show that several of the IPN proteins have powerful antagonistic properties against type I IFN induction in Atlantic salmon. Each of the five IPNV genes cloned into an expression vector were tested for the ability to influence activation of the Atlantic salmon IFNa1 promoter by the interferon promoter inducing protein one (IPS-1) or interferon regulatory factors (IRF). This showed that preVP2, VP3 and VP5 inhibited activation of both promoters, while VP4 only antagonized activation of the IFNa1 promoter. The viral protease VP4 was the most potent inhibitor of IFN induction, apparently targeting the IRF1 and IRF3 branch of the signaling cascade. VP4 antagonism is independent of its protease activity since the catalytically dead mutant VP4K674A inhibited activation of the IFNa1 promoter to a similar extent as wild type VP4. In contrast to the other IPNV proteins, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase VP1 activated the IFNa1 promoter. The ability to activate the IFN response was disrupted in the mutant VP1S163A, which has lost the ability to produce dsRNA. VP1 also exhibited synergistic effects with IRF1 and IRF3 in inducing an IFNa1-dependent antiviral state in cells. Taken together these results suggest that IPNV has developed multiple IFN antagonistic properties to prevent IFN-induction by VP1 and its dsRNA genome.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.125510677,-0.051450742,-0.025516692,-0.056943068,-0.087624533,0.040478003,0.035315725,-0.022737894,0.049585221,-0.008187231,-0.018067209,-0.018921459,-0.016709037,0.055183232,-0.014510742,-0.001646759,-0.003040047,-0.027828055,0.014343268,-0.000988565,0.040151204,0.006153691,0.002527061,0.018304504,0.012606507,0.011048616,0.026083662,0.004910758,-0.018622845,0.001243795
"Structure(s), function(s), and inhibition of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of noroviruses","Abstract Noroviruses belong to the Caliciviridae family of single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses. The genus Norovirus includes seven genogroups (designated GI-GVII), of which GI, GII and GIV infect humans. Human noroviruses are responsible for widespread outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis and represent one of the most common causes of foodborne illness. No vaccine or antiviral treatment options are available for norovirus infection. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of noroviruses is a key enzyme responsible for transcription and replication of the viral genome. Here, we review the progress made in understanding the structures and functions of norovirus RdRp and its use as a target for small molecule inhibitors. Crystal structures of the RdRp at different stages of substrate interaction have been determined, which shed light on its multi-step catalytic cycle. The in vitro assays and in vivo animal models that have been developed to identify and characterize inhibitors of norovirus RdRp are also summarized, followed by an update on the current antiviral research targeting different regions of norovirus RdRp. In the future, structure-based drug design and rational optimization of known nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors of norovirus RdRp may pave the way towards the next generation of direct-acting antivirals.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.150806128,-0.018196938,-0.052553791,0.094864287,-0.055870296,0.016060676,0.143758866,0.021271149,-0.030501996,0.062956968,0.107231127,0.154740896,-0.060025514,-0.078339618,-0.020242887,-0.061425808,0.003277628,0.06345982,0.020115307,-0.022252581,0.06982621,0.011695975,-0.042936425,0.027111976,0.027811848,-0.009295425,0.046601753,-0.016320102,0.137219284,0.031959731
Transcription and replication mechanisms of Bunyaviridae and Arenaviridae L proteins,"Abstract Bunyaviridae and Arenaviridae virus families include an important number of highly pathogenic viruses for humans. They are enveloped viruses with negative stranded RNA genomes divided into three (bunyaviruses) or two (arenaviruses) segments. Each genome segment is coated by the viral nucleoproteins (NPs) and the polymerase (L protein) to form a functional ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. The viral RNP provides the necessary context on which the L protein carries out the biosynthetic processes of RNA replication and gene transcription. Decades of research have provided a good understanding of the molecular processes underlying RNA synthesis, both RNA replication and gene transcription, for these two families of viruses. In this review we will provide a global view of the common features, as well as differences, of the molecular biology of Bunyaviridae and Arenaviridae. We will also describe structures of protein and protein-RNA complexes so far determined for these viral families, mainly focusing on the L protein, and discuss their implications for understanding the mechanisms of viral RNA replication and gene transcription within the architecture of viral RNPs, also taking into account the cellular context in which these processes occur. Finally, we will discuss the implications of these structural findings for the development of antiviral drugs to treat human diseases caused by members of the Bunyaviridae and Arenaviridae families.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.193849665,-0.063357948,-0.072948927,0.127539747,-0.039631723,-0.027181657,0.04475883,0.01145194,-0.000471016,0.076504964,-0.004307511,-0.045856237,0.052962119,0.03301744,-0.009931684,-0.060490599,0.02997082,-0.017969845,-0.026234234,0.068708562,-0.053745367,0.072060694,-0.091171258,-0.002864674,-0.018081582,-0.016079259,0.047684184,-0.056729059,-0.01172397,0.038144775
Nidovirus RNA polymerases: Complex enzymes handling exceptional RNA genomes,"Abstract Coronaviruses and arteriviruses are distantly related human and animal pathogens that belong to the order Nidovirales. Nidoviruses are characterized by their polycistronic plus-stranded RNA genome, the production of subgenomic mRNAs and the conservation of a specific array of replicase domains, including key RNA-synthesizing enzymes. Coronaviruses (26–34 kilobases) have the largest known RNA genomes and their replication presumably requires a processive RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and enzymatic functions that suppress the consequences of the typically high error rate of viral RdRps. The arteriviruses have significantly smaller genomes and form an intriguing package with the coronaviruses to analyse viral RdRp evolution and function. The RdRp domain of nidoviruses resides in a cleavage product of the replicase polyprotein named non-structural protein (nsp) 12 in coronaviruses and nsp9 in arteriviruses. In all nidoviruses, the C-terminal RdRp domain is linked to a conserved N-terminal domain, which has been coined NiRAN (nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyl transferase). Although no structural information is available, the functional characterization of the nidovirus RdRp and the larger enzyme complex of which it is part, has progressed significantly over the past decade. In coronaviruses several smaller, non-enzymatic nsps were characterized that direct RdRp function, while a 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease activity in nsp14 was implicated in fidelity. In arteriviruses, the nsp1 subunit was found to maintain the balance between genome replication and subgenomic mRNA production. Understanding RdRp behaviour and interactions during RNA synthesis and subsequent processing will be key to rationalising the evolutionary success of nidoviruses and the development of antiviral strategies.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.241705378,-0.029622155,-0.126843486,0.144438436,-0.002711914,-0.077929857,0.088615674,0.026281061,-0.077373678,0.036067739,0.102392799,0.141785621,-0.065206983,-0.060388235,-0.086031099,-0.047130524,0.095450736,-0.072653304,-0.050920632,-0.022788429,0.014618029,-0.045180773,0.047965154,-0.087610835,0.032292316,0.063400134,-0.016859008,0.022704001,0.04440105,-0.011612195
Enzootic bovine leukosis in a two-month-old calf,"Abstract A two-month-old calf was diagnosed with leukosis on the basis of the clinical sign of enlarged, superficial lymph nodes. Serological and genetic tests for bovine leukemia virus (BLV) were performed because the calf was born from a cow infected with BLV. The serum had a weakly positive BLV antibody, and the BLV provirus was detected within neoplastic cells on performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Analysis of the BLV provirus integration site using inverse PCR revealed that the BLV integration site location was identical on all chromosomes in all tumor tissues examined. Thus, the tumor cells monoclonally proliferated following BLV infection. The present study shows that enzootic bovine leukosis can occur in a young animal, as in the two-month-old calf in our study.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.015401836,-0.009967046,0.057453692,-0.095606295,-0.003373858,0.015017496,-0.000394987,-0.015409497,0.015184978,-0.034968985,0.027239105,-0.018101683,0.006059372,0.015917712,0.047806919,-0.00482907,0.003155576,-0.007988888,-0.006674493,-0.049952279,0.035079968,-0.008032007,0.016194328,-0.03560376,0.030816899,0.0080009,-0.016347996,-0.035702991,-0.002612175,-0.020080305
Detection of viromes of RNA viruses using the next generation sequencing libraries prepared by three methods,"Abstract Virome (viral megagenomics) detection using next generation sequencing has been widely applied in virology, but its methods remain complicated and need optimization. In this study, we detected the viromes of RNA viruses of one mock sample, one pooled duck feces sample and one pooled mink feces sample on the Personal Genome Machine platform using the sequencing libraries prepared by three methods. The sequencing primers were added through random hybridization and ligation to fragmented viral RNA using a RNA-Seq kit in method 1, through random reverse transcription (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in method 2 which was developed in our laboratory, and through hybridization and ligation to fragmented amplicons of random RT-PCR using a single primer in method 3. Although the results of these three samples (nine libraries) all showed that more classified viral families and genera were identified using methods 2 and 3 than using method 1, and more classified viral families and genera were identified using method 2 than using method 3, most of the differences were of no statistical significance.

Isolation and characterization of a novel mesonivirus from Culex mosquitoes in China,"Abstract A new insect nidovirus (named Yichang virus) from the family Mesoniviridae was isolated, identified, and characterized from Culex mosquitoes in Hubei, China. Results showed a high number of viral RNA copies (up to 1011 copies/ml) within 48h in C6/36 cells. In addition, the titers of the Yichang virus reached maximal levels of 107 PFU/mL at 6 d post-infection (dpi). The virus produced moderate cytopathic effects when the multiplicity of infection ranged from 0.001–0.1 at 6 dpi, but did not replicate in mammalian cells. Under electron microscopy, the virion of the Yichang virus appeared as spherical particles with diameters of ∼80nm and large club-shaped projections. Although subsequent genomic sequence analysis revealed that the Yichang virus had similar protein patterns as those of other mesoniviruses, the nucleotide acids shared less than 20% BLAST query coverage with known viruses in the family Mesoniviridae, and showed a maximum sequence identity of 67% for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The putative protein sequences showed slightly higher identity (28%–68%), and the most conserved domain was RdRp. Based on the phylogenetic and pairwise evolutionary distance analyses, the Yichang virus should be considered a new species belonging to a currently unassigned genus within the family Mesoniviridae.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.151683533,-0.043849378,-0.038266182,0.037111177,0.071983607,-0.009145161,0.014035432,0.00189748,-0.03070689,0.020067354,0.001743383,0.002220582,-0.040102696,0.000813337,0.007794219,-0.079638112,0.032194956,-0.008887402,0.006387222,0.025673753,0.036323854,0.007215458,0.013634568,0.006148875,-0.04114798,0.066275295,0.067776344,0.011938376,-0.062604391,0.0720395
Viruses associated with Antarctic wildlife: From serology based detection to identification of genomes using high throughput sequencing,"Abstract The Antarctic, sub-Antarctic islands and surrounding sea-ice provide a unique environment for the existence of organisms. Nonetheless, birds and seals of a variety of species inhabit them, particularly during their breeding seasons. Early research on Antarctic wildlife health, using serology-based assays, showed exposure to viruses in the families Birnaviridae, Flaviviridae, Herpesviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae circulating in seals (Phocidae), penguins (Spheniscidae), petrels (Procellariidae) and skuas (Stercorariidae). It is only during the last decade or so that polymerase chain reaction-based assays have been used to characterize viruses associated with Antarctic animals. Furthermore, it is only during the last five years that full/whole genomes of viruses (adenoviruses, anelloviruses, orthomyxoviruses, a papillomavirus, paramyoviruses, polyomaviruses and a togavirus) have been sequenced using Sanger sequencing or high throughput sequencing (HTS) approaches.

Identification of gammaherpesvirus infection in free-ranging black bears (Ursus americanus),"Abstract Herpesvirus infection was investigated in black bears (Ursus americanus) with neurological signs and brain lesions of nonsuppurative encephalitis of unknown cause. Visible cytopathic effects (CPE) could only be observed on days 3–5 post-infection in HrT-18G cell line inoculated with bear tissue extracts. The observed CPE in HrT-18G cells included syncytia, intranuclear inclusions, and cell detachments seen in herpesvirus infection in vitro. Herpesvirus-like particles were observed in viral culture supernatant under the electron microscope, however, capsids ranging from 60 nm to 100 nm in size were often observed in viral cultures within the first two passages of propagation. Herpesvirus infection in the bear tissues and tissue cultures were detected by PCR using degenerate primers specific to the DNA polymerase gene (DPOL) and glycoprotein B gene (gB). DNA sequencing of the amplicon revealed that the detected herpesvirus has 94–95% identity to Ursid gammaherpesvirus 1 (UrHV-1) DNA sequences of DPOL. Phylogenetic analysis of DPOL sequences indicates that black bear herpesviruses and UrHV-1 are closely related and have small distances to members of Rhadinovirus. Interestingly, black bear herpesvirus infections were also found in bears without neurological signs. The DPOL DNA sequence of black bear herpesviruses detected in neurological bears were similar to the those detected in the non-neurological bears. However, the gB DNA sequence detected from the neurological bear is different from non-neurological bear and has only 64.5%–70% identity to each other. It is possible that at least two different types of gammaherpesviruses are present in the U. americanus population or several gammaherpesviruses exist in ursine species.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.043338071,-0.030112716,0.037551658,-0.093652361,0.025077488,0.024018112,0.023578382,-0.015805644,0.00551248,-0.006384597,-0.014711889,-0.028359682,0.015733064,-0.002679746,0.013605436,0.006723983,-0.026475247,-0.009856495,0.017297048,-0.016298056,0.019161196,0.014918007,-0.002627199,0.017573283,-0.007842363,-0.022988571,-0.048914287,0.017546603,-0.037733895,0.019396049
Full genome characterization of two novel Alpha-coronavirus species from Italian bats,"Abstract Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been detected worldwide in several bat species, which are considered the main reservoir. The attention to the high diversity of CoVs hosted by bats has increased during the last decade due to the high number of human infections caused by two zoonotic Beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, that cause several respiratory diseases. Among coronaviruses, two Alpha-CoV strains (HuCoV-229E and HuCoV-NL63) cause mild respiratory disease that can change to severe disease in children, elderly and individuals affected by illnesses. Phylogenetic analysis conducted on bat Alpha-CoV strains revealed their evolutive correlation to human strains, suggesting their origin in bats. The genome of CoVs is characterized by a high frequency of mutations and recombination events, increasing their ability to switch hosts and their zoonotic potential. In this study, three strains of Alpha-CoV genera detected in Italian bats (Pipistrellus kuhlii) were fully sequenced by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and characterized. The complete genome analysis showed the correlation of the Italians strains with a Chinese strain detected in 2013 and, based on CoV molecular species demarcation, two new Alpha-CoV species were established. The analysis of a fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) showed the correlation of the Italian strains with CoVs that was only detected in the bat Pipistrellus genera (Pipistrellus kuhlii and Pipistrellus Pipistrellus) in European countries.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.045089992,0.237650186,-0.132889364,0.013183731,0.336295532,0.107935741,0.237100495,0.09748026,0.002161246,-0.020529262,-0.056034137,-0.047748467,-0.041665077,0.011890083,-0.034831142,0.05212241,-0.022792668,0.052990837,-0.000655961,0.010167797,0.016073114,-0.021175661,0.090355694,0.013913225,0.070925546,0.006134632,-0.036853826,-5.71E-05,0.021224857,0.06052374
"An epidemiological investigation of porcine circovirus 3 infection in dogs in the Guangxi Province from 2015 to 2017, China","Abstract Porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) is an emerging circovirus species associated with several diseases. The study aimed to investigate the frequency of porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) and its coinfection with canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) in dogs in the Guangxi province from 2015 to 2017, China, and to examine the genome diversity of PCV3. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing, 96 of 406 (23.6%)samples were positive for PCV3, 38 out of 406 (9.4%) samples were coinfected with both PCV3 and CPV-2. The CPV-positive rate was significantly higher in the PCV3-positive samples than in the non-PCV3 samples, and the difference was extremely significant (P < 0.01). The complete genome (n=4) and ten capsid genes (n=10) of PCV3 were sequenced. Multiple sequence alignment results showed that these sequences shared 98.5–100% nucleotide similarity with the reference genome sequence and 97.5–100% nucleotide similarity with the reference capsid gene sequence. PCV3 was classified into two different genotypes, according to phylogenetic analysis based on the whole genome. These strains were clustered in PCV3a, showing a close relationship with PCV3-US/SD2016. Surprisingly, we separately analyzed these PCV3 strains from the Guangxi province and found that the dog and pig PCV3 are from different branches. In summary, this was the first seroprevalence and genetic investigation of PCV3 in dogs in the Guangxi province, China, and the first complete genome PCV3 from dogs obtained in the world. The results provide insights into the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this important virus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.038632618,-0.005493156,0.057915375,-0.090275282,0.074548738,0.017623326,-0.000952351,-0.001748864,-0.018440908,-0.024113141,0.007157847,0.045888432,-0.038247552,-0.055358595,0.049633715,-0.039172696,-0.033394362,-0.022611992,0.024143813,-0.01578057,0.082982058,0.048131698,-0.045829483,0.004440572,0.027958517,-0.073229663,-0.027602488,0.010336514,-0.025272745,0.038250233
Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor X1 restricts porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus-2 replication by interacting with viral Nsp9,"Abstract Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes one of the most economically important diseases of swine worldwide. Current antiviral strategies provide only limited protection. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) X1 is unique among NLR proteins in its functions as a pro-viral or antiviral factor to different viral infections. To date, the impact of NLRX1 on PRRSV infection remains unclear. In this study, we found that PRRSV infection promoted the expression of NLRX1 gene. In turn, ectopic expression of NLRX1 inhibited PRRSV replication in Marc-145 cells, whereas knockdown of NLRX1 enhanced PRRSV propagation in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Mechanistically, NLRX1 was revealed to impair intracellular viral subgenomic RNAs accumulation. Finally, Mutagenic analyses indicated that the LRR (leucine-rich repeats) domain of NLRX1 interacted with PRRSV Nonstructural Protein 9 (Nsp9) RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase) domain and was necessary for antiviral activity. Thus, our study establishes the role of NLRX1 as a new host restriction factor in PRRSV infection.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.138097099,-0.055397761,-0.059038336,0.006436762,-0.077059937,0.024054483,0.035955227,-0.031559828,0.064502215,0.021353108,-0.028548088,-0.017598192,-0.014742753,0.07820911,0.061133049,-0.112549763,0.057713776,-0.04780552,-0.00173873,0.098369528,-0.051435319,0.002480186,0.041223484,-0.085179522,0.050773723,0.076859853,0.038937516,-0.049063158,-0.053663047,0.087650927
Identification of the polymerase polyprotein products p72 and p65 of the murine coronavirus MHV-JHM,"Abstract The RNA polymerase gene of murine coronavirus MHV-JHM encodes a polyprotein of greater than 750 kDa. This polyprotein is proposed to be processed by two papain-like cysteine proteinases, PCP-1 and PCP-2, and a poliovirus 3C-like proteinase domain, 3C-pro, to generate protein products. The amino-terminal product of the MHV polymerase polyprotein, p28, is generated by cleavage of the polyprotein by PCP-1. To identify the viral products downstream of p28, we generated a fusion-protein specific antiserum directed against the region adjacent to p28 and used the antiserum to detect virus-specific proteins from MHV-JHM infected cells. When this antiserum was used to immunoprecipitate radiolabeled proteins from MHV-JHM infected cell lysates, virus-specific proteins of 72 and 65 kDa were detected. Furthermore, pulse and chase experiments demonstrated that p72 is likely a precursor to the mature protein product, p65. To investigate which viral proteinase may be responsible for generating p72 and p65, we expressed the 5′-region of the MHV-JHM RNA polymerase gene including the two papain-like cysteine proteinase domains in an in vitro transcription/translation system and analyzed the translation products for proteolytic processing. We also cloned and expressed the 72 kDa region immediately downstream from p28, and tested the ability of in vitro translated PCP-1 and PCP-2 to cleave p72 to p65 in trans. Our results indicate that neither viral proteinase domain PCP-1 nor PCP-2 is capable of cleavage of p72 to produce p65 in vitro.

Experimental confirmation of recombination upstream of the S1 hypervariable region of infectious bronchitis virus,"Abstract Chimeric infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) genomes with cross-over sites in the S1 gene were generated by co-infection with two distinct IBV strains. Recombinant viruses were collected from chicken embryos, embryonic cultured cells and chickens co-infected with Ark99 and Mass41 strains and purified by differential centrifugation. The recombinant S1 genes were identified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) using heterologous primers and confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The recombinants with Ark99 5′ and Mass41 3′ sequences were identified following the in vitro, in ovo and in vivo co-infections. Mixed RNA extracted from Ark99 and Mass41 did not produce RTPCR products with these primers at the PCR conditions used. Cross-over sites within the amplified 580 (Mass41) or 604 (Ark99) bases of the 5′ S1 gene could only be detected between nucleotides 50 and 155. While this region, lying upstream of the S1 hypervariable region, corresponded with sites commonly identified in naturally occurring isolates, recombination sites identified in these studies could not be detected within the HVR of S1 of the genomes of chimeric viruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.087086011,-0.02893874,0.071667701,-0.059703299,0.181834576,0.030867414,-0.13853008,-0.046766538,0.069135204,0.171840163,0.025082844,-0.010450041,-0.037432794,0.029557396,-0.048266747,0.036117023,-0.017737061,0.00667303,0.010020822,0.001728003,0.028116344,-0.002522024,0.04461032,0.053405622,-0.013987306,0.012236066,0.019914904,0.032419898,-0.009124689,0.031306146
Phylogenetic analysis of a highly conserved region of the polymerase gene from 11 coronaviruses and development of a consensus polymerase chain reaction assay,"Abstract Viruses in the genus Coronavirus are currently placed in three groups based on antigenic cross-reactivity and sequence analysis of structural protein genes. Consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were used to obtain cDNA, then cloned and sequenced a highly conserved 922 nucleotide region in open reading frame (ORF) 1b of the polymerase (pol) gene from eight coronaviruses. These sequences were compared with published sequences for three additional coronaviruses. In this comparison, it was found that nucleotide substitution frequencies (per 100 nucleotides) varied from 46.40 to 50.13 when viruses were compared among the traditional coronavirus groups and, with one exception (the human coronavirus (HCV) 229E), varied from 2.54 to 15.89 when compared within these groups. (The substitution frequency for 229E, as compared to other members of the same group, varied from 35.37 to 35.72.) Phylogenetic analysis of these pol gene sequences resulted in groupings which correspond closely with the previously described groupings, including recent data which places the two avian coronaviruses—infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) of chickens and turkey coronavirus (TCV)—in the same group [Guy, J.S., Barnes, H.J., Smith L.G., Breslin, J., 1997. Avian Dis. 41:583–590]. A single pair of degenerate primers was identified which amplify a 251 bp region from coronaviruses of all three groups using the same reaction conditions.

"Macromolecular prodrugs of ribavirin: Polymer backbone defines blood safety, drug release, and efficacy of anti-inflammatory effects","Abstract Macromolecular (pro)drugs hold much promise as broad-spectrum antiviral agents as either microbicides or carriers for intracellular delivery of antiviral drugs. Intriguing opportunity exists in combining the two modes of antiviral activity in the same polymer structure such that the same polymer acts as a microbicide and also serves to deliver the conjugated drug (ribavirin) into the cells. We explore this opportunity in detail and focus on the polymer backbone as a decisive constituent of such formulations. Fourteen polyanions (polycarboxylates, polyphosphates and polyphosphonates, and polysulfonates) were analyzed for blood pro/anti coagulation effects, albumin binding and albumin aggregation, inhibitory activity on polymerases, cytotoxicity, and anti-inflammatory activity in stimulated macrophages. Ribavirin containing monomers were designed to accommodate the synthesis of macromolecular prodrugs with disulfide-exchange triggered drug release. Kinetics of drug release was fast in all cases however enhanced hydrophobicity of the polymer significantly slowed release of ribavirin. Results of this study present a comprehensive view on polyanions as backbone for macromolecular prodrugs of ribavirin as broad-spectrum antiviral agents.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.089335468,-0.026945931,-0.037878723,-0.032114121,-0.1494177,0.097240062,0.084394556,-0.009804258,0.046616964,0.007103601,0.016774947,0.058509709,-0.001624249,-0.01072135,-0.004060271,-0.000710391,-0.020193451,0.126110789,0.079957649,-0.021674987,0.014529762,0.015358494,-0.000512307,0.048123337,0.071463593,0.054070151,0.027584022,-0.018537425,0.092637557,-0.002816019
Intranasal delivery of adjuvant-free peptide nanofibers elicits resident CD8+ T cell responses,"Abstract Influenza vaccines that can be administered intranasally or by other needle-free delivery routes have potential advantages over injected formulations in terms of patient compliance, cost, and ease of global distribution. Supramolecular peptide nanofibers have been investigated previously as platforms for vaccines and immunotherapies and have been shown to raise immune responses in the absence of exogenous adjuvants and without measurable inflammation. However, at present it has not been tested whether the immunogenicity of these materials extends to the intranasal route. Here we investigated the extent to which self-assembled peptide nanofibers bearing an influenza peptide epitope elicit antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses when delivered intranasally, and we compared these responses with those elicited by subcutaneous immunization. Peptides containing an epitope from influenza acid polymerase (PA) and the Q11 self-assembly domain formed nanofibers that were avidly taken up by dendritic cells in lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes after intranasal immunization. Intranasally delivered nanofibers generated greater antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses in the lung-draining lymph nodes than subcutaneous immunizations while retaining the non-inflammatory character of the materials observed in other delivery sites. The CD8+ T cells elicited systemically were functional as assessed by their ability to produce IFN-γ ex vivo, lyse epitope-pulsed target cells in vivo, and diminish viral loads in infected mice. Compared to subcutaneously delivered nanofibers, intranasally delivered peptide nanofibers significantly increased the number of persisting antigen-specific tissue resident memory CD8+ T cells in the lung, allowing for a more rapid response to infection at 6 weeks post-vaccination. These results indicate that intranasally delivered self-assembled peptide nanofibers are immunogenic when delivering CD8+ epitopes without adjuvant or CD4+ epitopes, are non-inflammatory, and promote more lung-resident memory CD8+ T cells compared to subcutaneous immunization.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.043098139,-0.032597018,0.002064038,-0.068129052,-0.073698282,0.107195951,-0.013553167,-0.032944542,0.032292593,-0.046186076,-0.023515705,-0.021827749,-0.001675196,0.031396377,0.007809263,0.020640276,-0.016579619,-0.026369983,-0.02238763,-0.022037973,0.025763375,-0.032221303,0.022711067,-0.023441915,0.015735227,0.019978639,-0.022889912,0.011777937,-0.022507828,-0.011114104
Astroviruses,"Publisher Summary Human astroviruses are members of the Astroviridae family. They are non-enveloped viruses possessing a single-stranded RNA of positive polarity as their genome. The development of sensitive tests for the presence of astrovirus—for example, using group reactive monoclonal antibodies—has led to the conclusion that astroviruses are the cause of more cases of childhood diarrhea. Astroviruses have also been identified as the cause of major outbreaks of diarrhea and vomiting. Different serotypes of human astrovirus have been defined based on immune electron microscopy, neutralization tests, and type-specific enzyme immune assays (EIAs). Eight different serotypes have been identified and it has been shown that differences in the sequences of reverse transcription–polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) products from a region within open reading frame 2 (ORF2) correlated precisely with antigenic types determined by type-specific EIA.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.045318918,0.007395195,0.063365604,-0.022507461,0.062981523,-0.005788686,0.011756375,-0.000642266,-0.007886438,0.005303469,-0.019715081,0.000970645,0.017209486,-0.028563137,0.041679087,-0.064666613,0.021122554,0.013214417,-0.051407339,-0.026751427,0.014639404,0.025436329,-0.063253977,0.035273273,-0.034960014,-0.036566357,0.023906202,-0.040910814,-0.011056836,-0.034725966
Chapter 9 The Detection of Waterborne Viruses,"Publisher Summary Viruses in water are usually present in concentrations too low for detection by direct analysis. Virological investigation of water samples is always a multi-stage process involving concentration of viruses present followed by an appropriate detection procedure. There are several approaches to detection of viruses. Part or all of the concentrate may be inoculated into cell cultures to detect infectious cytopathogenic virus, and if this is done in a quantitative fashion the virus can be enumerated, the count being reported as plaque-forming units, the tissue culture infectious dose, or most probable number units. The virus may be isolated and identified from the cell cultures. Viruses that multiply without producing an identifiable cytopathic effect in culture may sometimes be detected by immunoperoxidase or immunofluorescence staining. The concentrate may also be analyzed by molecular biological procedures (usually polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time-PCR). The problem then is that such techniques do not usually detect the infectious virus, and novel approaches have been made recently to meet this challenge.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.022771276,-0.002851493,0.119846813,0.021488135,-0.012541137,0.037328282,0.04793399,-0.01993022,-0.008559254,0.107122674,-0.006885298,-0.067724349,0.067504385,0.005044943,0.067302284,-0.028842377,-0.004630521,-0.030493497,0.001652084,-0.06175102,0.018805947,0.026282942,0.046218664,0.000106378,-0.051039521,0.021489636,0.011298451,-0.003440875,-0.08117527,-0.041744111
Substituted imidazopyridines as potent inhibitors of HCV replication,"Background/Aims Following lead optimization, a set of substituted imidazopyridines was identified as potent and selective inhibitors of in vitro HCV replication. The particular characteristics of one of the most potent compounds in this series (5-[[3-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-isoxazolyl]methyl]-2-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-5H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine or GS-327073), were studied. Methods Antiviral activity of GS-327073 was evaluated in HCV subgenomic replicons (genotypes 1b, 1a and 2a), in the JFH1 (genotype 2a) infectious system and against replicons resistant to various selective HCV inhibitors. Combination studies of GS-327073 with other selective HCV inhibitors were performed. Results Fifty percent effective concentrations for inhibition of HCV subgenomic 1b replicon replication ranged between 2 and 50nM and were 100-fold higher for HCV genotype 2a virus. The 50% cytostatic concentrations were ⩾17μM, thus resulting in selectivity indices of ⩾340. GS-327073 retained wild-type activity against HCV replicons that were resistant to either HCV protease inhibitors or several polymerase inhibitors. GS-327073, when combined with either interferon α, ribavirin, a nucleoside polymerase or a protease inhibitor resulted in overall additive antiviral activity. Combinations containing GS-327073 proved highly effective in clearing hepatoma cells from HCV. Conclusions GS-327073 is a potent in vitro inhibitor of HCV replication either alone or in combination with other selective HCV inhibitors.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.109620829,-0.04637208,-0.025860175,-0.023836535,-0.12964239,0.060634933,0.072624685,-0.003542082,0.062573701,0.00323704,0.015239146,0.120369213,0.020874931,0.04025965,-0.038694842,-0.033623342,0.019694592,0.333765516,0.382253076,-0.135522274,-0.066710199,-0.002771346,0.111920045,0.107786286,-0.020752106,-0.066149794,-0.068185275,0.047647312,-0.042562849,-0.072837255
Modulation of host metabolism as a target of new antivirals,"Abstract The therapy for chronic hepatitis C (CH–C) started with interferon (IFN) monotherapy in the early 1990s and this therapy was considered effective in about 10% of cases. The present standard therapy of pegylated IFN with ribavirin achieves a sustained virologic response in about 50% of patients. However, about half of the CH–C patients are still at risk of fatal liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The other significant event in hepatitis C virus (HCV) research has been the development of a cell culture system. The subgenomic replicon system enables robust HCV RNA replication in hepatoma cells. And recently, the complete life cycle of HCV has been achieved using a genotype 2a strain, JFH1. These hallmarks have provided much information about the mechanisms of HCV replication, including information on the host molecules required for the replication. Anti-HCV reagents targeting HCV proteins have been developed, and some of them are now in clinical trials. However, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase frequently causes mutations in the HCV genome, which lead to the emergence of drug-resistant HCV mutants. Some of the cellular proteins essential for HCV RNA replication have already been discovered using the HCV cell culture system. These host molecules are also candidate targets for antivirals. Here, we describe the recent progress regarding the anti-HCV reagents targeting host metabolism.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.136657029,-0.053436637,-0.055514747,0.001584762,-0.148950047,0.021578264,0.067620456,0.026834012,0.027830494,0.039133532,-0.00923954,0.085554865,0.043415074,0.108520001,-0.038596822,-0.034679433,0.013592855,0.340543884,0.388799201,-0.10742047,-0.078020847,0.011953364,0.09406137,0.081002047,-0.081315381,-0.106788486,-0.056413458,0.060783867,-0.122410258,-0.074334407
Respiratory-syncytial-virus- and rhinovirus-related bronchiolitis in children aged <2 years in an English district general hospital,"Summary Background Bronchiolitis is the most common reason for hospitalization in young children. In addition to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), other viruses have been increasingly implicated. Guidance on testing has also changed. Aims To compare clinicopathological outcomes in young children admitted with bronchiolitis due to RSV in comparison with rhinovirus (RV), and identify associated risk/epidemiological factors. Methods Children aged less than two years admitted to hospital with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis with positive results for either RSV or RV were included in this study. Polymerase-chain-reaction-negative cases using an extended respiratory virus panel served as a control group. Retrospective data were collected on sex, risk factors, respiratory support, intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Outcomes such as length of stay (LOS) and need for transfer to the high-dependency unit/paediatric intensive care unit were included. Findings Two hundred and twenty-seven out of 437 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were positive for either RSV (N = 162) or RV (N = 65). The median age of cases was three months and 75% had at least one risk factor. Risk factors were higher in the RV group (P = 0.004). RV accounted for the majority of cases outside the RSV season (P < 0.01). RV-associated bronchiolitis had a longer LOS (more than seven days) (P < 0.05) and increased need for chest X-rays and/or antibiotics (P < 0.05). Use of intravenous fluids and respiratory support were higher in the RV group, but the difference was not significant. Conclusions RV is the second most common pathogen associated with bronchiolitis and is isolated all year round. This may be important in those with risk factors resulting in prolonged LOS. Further research is necessary to establish the exact role of RV in this common condition, particularly outside the traditional RSV season.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.182012048,-0.099902207,-0.085646612,-0.026069641,0.005728893,-0.091878405,0.037898871,-0.050479547,0.065617686,-0.06056088,0.018590283,-0.053204646,-0.133012151,-0.082881911,-0.028600848,0.060857862,0.025138886,0.039971573,-0.028767336,0.007216413,-0.029434187,-0.074338829,-0.026813496,-0.017672247,0.038839183,-0.120293427,0.162973558,0.036724147,-0.088437676,0.055036442
Molecular epidemiology and environmental contamination during an outbreak of parainfluenza virus 3 in a haematology ward,"Summary Background Although fomites or contaminated surfaces have been considered as transmission routes, the role of environmental contamination by human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hPIV-3) in healthcare settings is not established. Aim To describe an hPIV-3 nosocomial outbreak and the results of environmental sampling to elucidate the source of nosocomial transmission and the role of environmental contamination. Methods During an hPIV-3 outbreak between May and June 2016, environmental surfaces in contact with clustered patients were swabbed and respiratory specimens used from infected patients and epidemiologically unlinked controls. The epidemiologic relatedness of hPIV-3 strains was investigated by sequencing of the haemagglutinin–neuraminidase and fusion protein genes. Findings Of 19 hPIV-3-infected patients, eight were haematopoietic stem cell recipients and one was a healthcare worker. In addition, four had upper and 12 had lower respiratory tract infections. Of the 19 patients, six (32%) were community-onset infections (symptom onset within <7 days of hospitalization) and 13 (68%) were hospital-onset infections (≥7 days of hospitalization). Phylogenetic analysis identified two major clusters: five patients, and three patients plus one healthcare worker. Therefore, seven (37%) were classified as nosocomial transmissions. hPIV-3 was detected in 21 (43%) of 49 environmental swabs up to 12 days after negative respiratory polymerase chain reaction conversion. Conclusion At least one-third of a peak season nosocomial hPIV-3 outbreak originated from nosocomial transmission, with multiple importations of hPIV-3 from the community, providing experimental evidence for extensive environmental hPIV-3 contamination. Direct contact with the contaminated surfaces and fomites or indirect transmission from infected healthcare workers could be responsible for nosocomial transmission.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.085505733,-0.020459842,-0.059016684,-0.090571654,-0.013743357,0.0022745,-0.016959897,0.056367294,-0.031368738,0.008003944,-0.024825787,0.025730093,-0.01726847,0.021198935,0.024794039,0.001636579,-0.004819842,0.01580183,-0.009496475,0.020668507,0.021743327,-0.027945918,-0.058663817,-0.024541361,-0.022877267,0.024939515,-0.029113259,0.029043981,-0.03841858,-0.021320012
Molecular characterization of a nosocomial outbreak of influenza B virus in an acute care hospital setting,"Summary Aim To describe a hospital outbreak of influenza B virus (InfB) infection during season 2015/2016 by combining clinical and epidemiological data with molecular methods. Methods Twenty patients diagnosed with InfB from a hospital outbreak over a four-week-period were included. Nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) positive for InfB by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction were sent for lineage typing and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Medical records were reviewed retrospectively for data regarding patient characteristics, localization, exposure and outcome, and assembled into a timeline. In order to find possible connections to the hospital outbreak, all patients with a positive NPS for influenza from the region over an extended time period were also reviewed. Findings All 20 cases of InfB were of subtype B/Yamagata, and 17 of 20 patients could be linked to each other by either shared room or shared ward. WGS was successful or partially successful for 15 of the 17 viral isolates, and corroborated the epidemiological link supporting a close relationship. In the main affected ward, 19 of 75 inpatients were infected with InfB during the outbreak period, resulting in an attack rate of 25%. One probable case of influenza-related death was identified. Conclusion InfB may spread within an acute care hospital, and advanced molecular methods may facilitate assessment of the source and extent of the outbreak. A multi-faceted approach, including rapid diagnosis, early recognition of outbreak situations, simple rules for patient management and the use of regular infection control measures, may prevent nosocomial transmission of influenza virus.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.140186786,0.002208469,-0.034715028,-0.002451867,-0.036494113,0.113796786,-0.098332763,0.089307276,-0.061719058,-0.004383046,-0.003527116,0.011049801,0.007190367,-0.026008984,0.001508847,0.003635019,-0.011150395,0.028782811,-0.030881225,0.006424609,0.031457203,0.005291943,-0.070638178,-0.070389474,-0.057801415,0.005513384,0.011522168,0.072394862,-0.076410516,0.024293182
Implementation of the cobas Liat influenza point-of-care test into an emergency department during a high-incidence season: a retrospective evaluation following real-world implementation,"Summary The cobas Liat influenza A/B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) assay (Liat) was used in the adult emergency department of a large London hospital from 21st January 2018 to 14th April 2018. Influenza was detected in 308 of 1027 (30%) samples tested; influenza A in 157 (15.3%), influenza B in 149 (14.5%) and RSV in 28 (2.7%). When compared against Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 21 multiplex polymerase chain reaction and Cepheid Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV assay, Liat performance for the detection of influenza A or B was: sensitivity 85% [95% confidence interval (CI) 76–92)], specificity 98% (95% CI 97–99), negative predictive value 94% (95% CI 92–96) and positive predictive value 95% (95% CI 91–97).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.202505729,-0.10086687,0.009526344,0.12574703,0.000398579,0.125640392,-0.117925917,-0.049946352,-0.022276842,-0.199551643,0.019450818,0.047357835,-0.136232162,-0.085993407,-0.117472056,0.087200727,-0.072912793,-0.080655149,0.077734184,-0.044620245,-0.155949675,0.00249468,0.106496824,0.017940181,0.060121409,-0.134554308,0.058122739,-0.190515076,-0.109369955,-0.005470092
Establishing a clinical decision rule of severe acute respiratory syndrome at the emergency department,"Abstract Study objective In the absence of reliable rapid confirmatory tests during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) endemics, we designed a 2-phase cohort study to establish a scoring system for SARS and to evaluate whether it could improve the sensitivity and specificity of the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Methods According to the clinical characteristics and initial laboratory findings of 175 suspected cases defined by the WHO criteria (20 confirmed as cases of SARS) in 3 university teaching hospitals in Taipei between March 1 and April 20, 2003, the scoring system for SARS was designed by multivariate analysis and stepwise logistic regression as the simple arithmetic sum of point values assigned to 7 parameters. We thereafter applied the scoring system for SARS to the consecutive 232 patients (the validation group) who met the WHO criteria of suspected cases from April 21 to May 22, 2003. Final diagnosis of SARS was determined by the results of real-time polymerase chain reaction and paired serum. Results The scoring system for SARS was defined as radiographic findings of multilobar or bilateral infiltrates (3 points), sputum monocyte predominance (3 points), lymphocytopenia (2 points), history of exposure (1 point), lactate dehydrogenase more than 450 U/L (1 point), C-reactive protein more than 5.0 mg/dL (1 point), and activated partial prothrombin time more than 40 seconds (1 point). Of the validation group, 60 patients (group A) were confirmed as having cases of SARS, and the other 172 (group B) patients tested negative for SARS. The total points of the scoring system for SARS at initial presentation were significantly higher in the SARS group (median 9; range 6 to 11) than in the non-SARS group (median 4; range 3 to 7; P<.001). At the cutoff value of 6 points, the sensitivity and specificity of the scoring system for SARS in diagnosing SARS were 100% and 93%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values of the scoring system for SARS were 83% and 100%, respectively. Conclusion The scoring system for SARS can provide a rapid and reliable clinical decision to help emergency physicians detect cases of SARS more accurately in the endemic area.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.08607531,0.401701625,-0.179269078,-0.050314133,-0.079635838,-0.008086263,-0.101860229,-0.293675861,-0.203623914,-0.030647666,-0.028652851,0.004168766,-0.004758532,-0.064314668,0.001387691,0.035659088,-0.025829633,0.014277907,0.021087427,0.015917304,-0.008463518,-0.021741454,-0.040261906,-0.030773777,-0.051585846,-0.01974293,-0.005731291,-0.00043564,-0.042153575,-0.013577712
Sequential symptomatic analysis in probable severe acute respiratory syndrome cases,"Abstract Study objective Previous reports on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) described mainly its symptoms. However, the time sequence of symptom development was rarely discussed. The objective of this study is to chronologically document the time sequence of symptom development in probable SARS cases and compare that of the febrile non-SARS cases, thus providing valuable information for early recognition of the disease. Methods This prospective, descriptive, cohort study was conducted in an academic university hospital in Taipei, Taiwan, from March 14 through May 12, 2003. Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a temperature of at least 38.0°C (≥100.3°F) and exposure history were evaluated with a structured protocol. Detailed time sequences of individual symptoms were recorded, and chest radiography and laboratory test results were obtained. Probable SARS cases were determined by the Center of Disease Control Taiwan. Children younger than 15 years and suspected SARS patients with negative polymerase chain reaction results were excluded from final analysis. Results Seventy-nine SARS and 220 non-SARS cases were analyzed. The major clinical symptoms of SARS patients on ED presentation were myalgia, loose stool or diarrhea, nonproductive cough or dyspnea, headache, and chills. Upper airway symptoms, including rhinorrhea and sore throat, were rarely seen in the SARS patients but were common in the non-SARS group. Characteristic symptom sequence, consisting of initial fever accompanied by diarrhea and myalgia and then progressive respiratory symptoms, was identified in 55 SARS patients (69.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60 to 0.80) but only 7 (3.2%; 95% CI 0.008 to 0.05) non-SARS patients. Chest radiographic abnormality may precede lower respiratory tract symptoms in some SARS patients. Conclusion During an outbreak period, recognition of possible SARS cases depends on the heightened awareness of its clinical presentation. Aside from travel and contact history, the time sequence of the accompanying symptoms of SARS should help first-line physicians screen SARS patients at an early stage.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.157214262,0.354419172,-0.253976734,-0.076239327,-0.069256734,-0.039189802,-0.145477781,-0.263759867,-0.218076987,-0.013448041,-0.036455699,0.03674707,0.001442345,-0.063595452,0.001043028,0.038620548,-0.043379672,0.018935908,0.02362546,0.019278794,-0.009138832,-0.018248184,-0.090261821,-0.007624,-0.072859522,-0.012585579,-0.007919634,-0.03292074,-0.023955273,-0.023652383
Detection of viruses in used ventilation filters from two large public buildings,"Background Viral and bacterial pathogens may be present in the air after being released from infected individuals and animals. Filters are installed in the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems of buildings to protect ventilation equipment and maintain healthy indoor air quality. These filters process enormous volumes of air. This study was undertaken to determine the utility of sampling used ventilation filters to assess the types and concentrations of virus aerosols present in buildings. Methods The HVAC filters from 2 large public buildings in Minneapolis and Seattle were sampled to determine the presence of human respiratory viruses and viruses with bioterrorism potential. Four air-handling units were selected from each building, and a total of 64 prefilters and final filters were tested for the presence of influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial, corona, parainfluenza 1-3, adeno, orthopox, entero, Ebola, Marburg, Lassa fever, Machupo, eastern equine encephalitis, western equine encephalitis, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses. Representative pieces of each filter were cut and eluted with a buffer solution. Results Attempts were made to detect viruses by inoculation of these eluates in cell cultures (Vero, MDCK, and RK-13) and specific pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs. Two passages of eluates in cell cultures or these eggs did not reveal the presence of any live virus. The eluates were also examined by polymerase chain reaction or reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction to detect the presence of viral DNA or RNA, respectively. Nine of the 64 filters tested were positive for influenza A virus, 2 filters were positive for influenza B virus, and 1 filter was positive for parainfluenza virus 1. Conclusion These findings indicate that existing building HVAC filters may be used as a method of detection for airborne viruses. As integrated long-term bioaerosol sampling devices, they may yield valuable information on the epidemiology and aerobiology of viruses in air that can inform the development of methods to prevent airborne transmission of viruses and possible deterrents against the spread of bioterrorism agents.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.064939962,-0.068753165,0.016605642,0.097229348,0.012787031,0.121614119,-0.012710997,0.002404951,-0.02988285,0.045416632,0.012566703,-0.054261178,0.031215039,0.009011,0.0484288,-0.004602075,-0.013308992,-0.073304937,0.013922257,-0.002777656,-0.022122968,0.008393475,0.004604156,0.023964923,-0.009673449,0.011043009,-0.029534305,0.029297577,-0.050774141,-0.053434543
Detection of respiratory coinfections in pediatric patients using a small volume polymerase chain reaction array respiratory panel: More evidence for combined droplet and contact isolation,"Background In fall 2009, Children’s Hospital of Michigan (CHM) instituted combined isolation precautions (contact and droplet isolation) for pediatric inpatients with upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms to prevent health care-associated infection. Methods Pediatric patients with symptoms of URI had nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples obtained prospectively between January and April and September and December 2010 for small volume polymerase chain reaction (SVPCR) array respiratory panel (RP) multiplex nucleic acid testing. NP swabs or nasal washes were obtained for viral culture and rapid antigen testing (RAT). Results Of 499 evaluable SVPCR array RP samples, 344 (69%) tested positive for at least 1 of the 21 tested organisms. The most commonly identified pathogen was rhinovirus/enterovirus (181/344 [53%]) for which no RAT exists at CHM. Of 344 positive specimens, 57 (17%) had at least 2 identified pathogens; 8 (2%) of these had 3. In 11% of patients, molecular testing detected pathogens or pathogen combinations requiring both contact and droplet precautions. Conclusion SVPCR array RP testing detected respiratory pathogens in pediatric patients with URI at rates higher than that of RAT and viral culture. Because of the pathogens and pathogen combinations detected, the study findings suggest that combined contact and droplet isolation precautions may be warranted to prevent health care-associated infection in pediatric inpatients with URI. Further studies will be needed to confirm these results.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.162728585,-0.032261537,-0.024444526,-0.041147771,-0.01938649,-0.044199794,0.008160145,0.044898061,-0.038952005,0.056287778,-0.014983875,-0.002513233,0.021968539,-0.022788232,0.041638855,-0.024066101,0.004228518,-0.033141792,0.025154542,-0.049869284,0.008967072,-0.027888588,-0.014078077,-0.074416594,0.029200976,0.040820858,-0.038488796,0.012908065,-0.001032287,-0.042264386
"Seasonal variation of respiratory pathogen colonization in asymptomatic health care professionals: A single-center, cross-sectional, 2-season observational study","Background The purpose of this study was to determine the seasonal variance of potentially pathogenic bacterial and viral organisms in nasopharyngeal specimens obtained from asymptomatic health care professionals (HCPs) during the 2014 winter and summer months. Methods Nasopharyngeal specimens from 100 HCPs were collected from Huntsville Hospital (Huntsville, AL) during the winter and from 100 HCPs during the summer. All subjects were tested for 22 viruses and 19 bacteria using Target Enriched Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction. Both seasonal cohorts were composed of students, nurses, physicians, and residents. Results Of the 100 HCPs tested during the winter, 34 subjects were colonized with at least 1 bacterium, and 11 tested positive for at least 1 virus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Moraxella catarrhalis, and coronavirus were the most frequently detected potentially infectious agents. Of the 100 HCPs tested during the summer, 37 tested positive for at least 1 bacterium, and 4 tested positive for a viral agent. The most prevalent bacteria were MRSA and Klebsiella pneumonia. Conclusion Nasopharyngeal carriage among asymptomatic HCPs was common, but the frequency and presence of potential pathogens varied with each season. Understanding the colonization and infection potential of upper respiratory organisms is important, particularly for viruses. Although asymptomatic HCPs certainly harbor a number of different potentially infectious agents, future studies are needed to determine whether colonized pathogens are transmitted or initiate infection in at-risk patient populations.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.07755998,-0.040436973,-0.010009187,-0.030658544,0.004683755,-0.002238888,0.033155387,0.019007956,-0.014791491,0.030473722,0.009341883,0.00363955,0.001248544,-0.034402392,0.021120992,0.007902293,-0.01481967,-0.018954204,0.018399914,-0.015088192,-0.031307152,0.029089596,0.003553413,-0.007063012,0.04963021,0.012452228,-0.00167374,0.017713425,0.024578267,-0.03152693
Infection control and prevention practices implemented to reduce transmission risk of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus in a tertiary care institution in Saudi Arabia,"Background Transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) among health care workers (HCWs) and patients has been documented with mortality rate approximating 36%. We propose advanced infection control measures (A-IC) used in conjunction with basic infection control measures (B-IC) help reduce pathogen transmission. B-IC include standard and transmission-based precautions. A-IC are initiatives implemented within our center to enhance effectiveness of B-IC. Objective Study effectiveness of combining B-IC and A-IC to prevent transmission of MERS-CoV to HCWs. Methods A retrospective observational study was undertaken. A-IC measures include administrative support with daily rounds; infection control risk assessment; timely screening, isolation, and specimen analysis; collaboration; epidemic planning; stockpiling; implementation of contingency plans; full personal protective equipment use for advanced airway management; use of a real-time electronic isolation flagging system; infection prevention and control team on-call protocols; pretransfer MERS-CoV testing; and education. Results A total of 874 real-time polymerase chain reaction MERS-CoV tests were performed during the period beginning July 1, 2013, and ending January 31, 2015. Six hundred ninety-four non-HCWs were tested, of these 16 tested positive for MERS-CoV and their infection was community acquired. Sixty-nine percent of the confirmed MERS-CoV-positive cases were men, with an average age of 56 years (range, 19-84 years). Of the total tested for MERS-CoV, 180 individuals were HCWs with zero positivity.

Bacteria emitted in ambient air during bronchoscopy—a risk to health care workers?,"Background Health care workers are at risk of occupational infections, and some procedures are known to increase this risk. The aim of this study was to qualify and quantify bioaerosol concentrations during bronchoscopy to estimate the occupational risk. Methods Full-day sampling was conducted in 2 rooms while bronchoscopies were performed on patients. Two microbial air samplers were used, a wet wall cyclonic sampler and an impactor, on culture media. Identification of the culturable bacterial flora was performed with chromatographic analysis of cellular fatty acid of the isolated strain and additional biochemical tests if needed. Specific polymerase chain reaction analysis was completed on wet wall cyclonic samples for the detection of influenza A and B and Mycobacterium spp. Results A wide variety of bacteria were collected from the ambient air. All samples yielded at least 1 Staphylococcus species. Although most of the culturable bacteria identified were normal nonpathogenic flora, such as Streptococcus spp, Neisseria spp, and Corynebacterium spp, some opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, were found. Neither Mycobacterium spp nor influenza virus was detected with the polymerase chain reaction method during this study. Conclusions Culturable bacteria from oral, nasal, and pulmonary flora are aerosolized during bronchoscopy and could be inhaled by medical staff. The potential presence of pathogens in those aerosols could represent an occupational infection risk.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.097267316,-0.040175783,0.029290826,-0.04327013,-0.008457036,0.062917192,0.002655622,0.04560564,-0.083834517,0.038584479,-0.033328238,-0.00759794,-0.001817282,-0.062240556,0.031403176,-0.006380404,-0.022219788,-0.061147922,0.019269038,-0.034882422,-0.012428778,0.030968344,0.079661797,-0.021570446,0.070180979,-0.015662846,-0.035661307,0.004232641,0.024373452,-0.015397567

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus transmission among health care workers: Implication for infection control,"Background Many outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have occurred in health care settings and involved health care workers (HCWs). We describe the occurrence of an outbreak among HCWs and attempt to characterize at-risk exposures to improve future infection control interventions. Methods This study included an index case and all HCW contacts. All contacts were screened for MERS-CoV using polymerase chain reaction. Results During the study period in 2015, the index case was a 30-year-old Filipino nurse who had a history of unprotected exposure to a MERS-CoV–positive case on May 15, 2015, and had multiple negative tests for MERS-CoV. Weeks later, she was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and MERS-CoV infection. A total of 73 staff were quarantined for 14 days, and nasopharyngeal swabs were taken on days 2, 5, and 12 postexposure. Of those contacts, 3 (4%) were confirmed positive for MERS-CoV. An additional 18 staff were quarantined and had MERS-CoV swabs. A fourth case was confirmed positive on day 12. Subsequent contact investigations revealed a fourth-generation transmission. Only 7 (4.5%) of the total 153 contacts were positive for MERS-CoV. Conclusions The role of HCWs in MERS-CoV transmission is complex. Although most MERS-CoV–infected HCWs are asymptomatic or have mild disease, fatal infections can occur and HCWs can play a major role in propagating health care facility outbreaks. This investigation highlights the need to continuously review infection control guidance relating to the role of HCWs in MERS-CoV transmission in health care outbreaks, especially as it relates to the complex questions on definition of risky exposures, who to test, and the frequency of MERS-CoV testing; criteria for who to quarantine and for how long; and clearance and return to active duty criteria.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.076602488,0.344768952,-0.175213672,-0.04641093,-0.014320818,0.059520329,-0.033145072,0.426490673,0.339845829,-0.031679945,0.069403789,-0.026241511,-0.076933724,-0.059608319,0.019476574,0.012781765,-0.009622443,-0.086551252,-0.015781145,-0.021284224,-0.038124953,0.02807498,0.009897193,0.019105481,0.002608037,-0.011945489,-0.043894128,0.01458383,-0.015941728,0.027572954
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus intermittent positive cases: Implications for infection control,"Background Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to be reported from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Data on the phenomenon of intermittent positive results for MERS-CoV on reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with negative results in between are lacking. Here we describe cases with intermittent positive MERS-CoV test results and highlight the required number of tests to rule out or rule in MERS-CoV infection based on a large retrospective cohort of patients with confirmed MERS-CoV. Methods This analysis included cases admitted between January 2014 and December 2017. The included patients had a minimum of 3 nasopharyngeal MERS-CoV RT-PCR tests for confirmation and needed 2 negative samples for MERS-CoV evaluated 48 hours apart with clinical improvement or stabilization apart to ensure clearance. Results A total of 408 patients with positive MERS-CoV test results were treated at the referring hospital. We excluded 72 patients who had only 1 swab result available in the system and were treated in the initial years of the disease. Of the remaining 336 patients, 300 (89%) had a positive result after 1 swab, 324 (96.5%) had a positive result after 2 consecutive swabs, and 328 (97.6%) had a positive result after 3 consecutive swabs. Of the total cases, 46 (13.7%) had a positive MERS-CoV test then a negative test, followed by positive test results. Conclusions Our data indicate that 2 to 3 nasopharyngeal samples are needed to produce the highest yield of positive results for MERS-CoV. In addition, 2 negative results 48 hours apart with clinical improvement or stabilization are needed to clear patients from MERS-CoV. Evaluation of the yield of sputum samples is needed to assess the effectiveness against nasopharyngeal swabs.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.154096445,0.3528041,-0.144021982,-0.040268282,-0.014244568,-0.019167138,-0.096263526,0.439604807,0.233715265,-0.014678177,0.070610263,-0.007347105,-0.076485323,0.038840676,-0.016491094,-0.021580029,0.040267631,-0.056532074,-0.012901901,-0.048840264,-0.010518058,0.038285742,0.04408271,0.010771608,0.001074272,-0.011294361,-0.010811344,-0.011478899,-0.021485194,0.030417878
Nosocomial outbreak of influenza A H3N2 in an inpatient oncology unit related to health care workers presenting to work while ill,"Objective To describe an outbreak of influenza A in an oncology unit, highlighting infection control methods implemented, and examining reasons health care workers (HCWs) present to work with influenza-like illness (ILI). Methods Confirmed cases were defined by the presence of ILI and a positive nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction swab for influenza A H3. Probable cases were defined as exposed HCWs with ILI who were unavailable for polymerase chain reaction testing. Infection prevention measures included closing the ward for new admissions, oseltamivir prophylaxis for all exposed groups, and dismissal from work of HCWs with ILI until resolution of symptoms. An anonymous survey of the cases in our HCWs was conducted to better elucidate reasons behind presenteeism. Results Over the course of 8 days (November 16, 2017, to November 22, 2017), influenza was diagnosed in 7 of 10 inpatients on the oncology ward, 16 HCWs (14 confirmed, 2 probable), and 2 visitors. The suspected index case was an HCW. Of the surveyed HCWs, 64% presented to work despite feeling ill (ie, presenteeism). The most common reason was “sense of duty as a health care worker.” Conclusions This nosocomial outbreak of influenza highlights the challenges of protecting inpatients from viral respiratory tract infections. HCWs and patient visitors with ILI should avoid work or visiting until resolution of peak respiratory symptoms and adhere to strict respiratory etiquette.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.121669356,-0.034527303,-0.059739596,0.033101707,-0.023649199,0.150879872,-0.085063635,0.052120542,0.010480914,-0.071061302,0.018812177,0.015225588,-0.020752928,-0.058587439,0.018362306,0.03000694,-0.017388145,-0.023347804,-0.001290973,-0.033087468,-0.011750024,-0.037418652,-0.06862201,-0.065578017,0.004771039,0.016347485,-0.035392885,0.076517861,0.011956555,-0.024563605
Acquisition of respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogens among health care workers during the 2015 Hajj season,"Background Data on the risk of transmission of infection to health care workers (HCWs) serving ill pilgrims during the Hajj is scarce. Methods Two cohorts of HCWs, the first serving Hajj pilgrims in Mecca and the second serving patients in Al-Ahsa, were investigated for respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms and pathogen carriage using multiplex polymerase chain reaction before and after the 2015 Hajj. Results A total of 211 HCWs were enrolled of whom 92 were exposed to pilgrims (Mecca cohort), whereas 119 were not exposed (Al-Ahsa cohort). Symptoms were observed only in HCWs from the Mecca cohort, with 29.3% experiencing respiratory symptoms during the Hajj period or in the subsequent days and 3.3% having gastrointestinal symptoms. Acquisition rates of at least 1 respiratory virus were 14.7% in the Mecca cohort and 3.4% in the Al-Ahsa cohort (P = .003). Acquisition rates of at least 1 respiratory bacterium were 11.8% and 18.6% in the Mecca and Al-Ahsa cohorts, respectively (P = .09). Gastrointestinal pathogens were rarely isolated in both cohorts of HCWs and acquisition of pathogens after the Hajj was documented in only a few individuals. Conclusions HCWs providing care for pilgrims both acquire pathogens and present symptoms (especially respiratory symptoms) more frequently than those not working during Hajj.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.076982522,-0.026387038,-0.041409405,-0.053948443,-0.009929395,0.015290473,-0.002351996,0.050251193,0.024301563,0.000278865,0.000116537,0.011513827,-0.013005113,-0.038375551,0.039672074,0.023385518,-0.001194333,-0.041822766,0.023748392,-0.023030217,0.006515082,-0.069661485,-0.048971849,-0.018842661,0.036504873,0.007257903,-0.050824601,0.019952876,0.025002808,-0.067791351
Alveolar macrophages in allergic asthma: An expression signature characterized by heat shock protein pathways,"Abstract The implication of alveolar macrophages (AM) in asthma, a Th2 disease, has not been well characterized. Thus, the goal of this study is to better characterize AM phenotype of allergic asthmatic compared with normal subjects using genomic expression analyses. Microarray analyses were performed with AM isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage. Robust multiarray analysis (RMA) normalization and Smyth's moderated t test were used to select differentially expressed genes. Fifty differentially expressed genes were identified. Nineteen have been classified in categories linked to stress or immune responses and among them; nine are part of the heat shock protein (HSP) family. Difference of expression for three (HSPD1, PRNP, SERPINH1) of the five selected genes were validated using real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the protein level of heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), the protein encoded by HSPD1, and showed difference in AM protein level between allergic asthmatic and control subjects. In summary, this study suggests that HSP gene family, particularly HSP60, is involved in AM functions in a context of allergic asthma. These results also support the involvement of AM immune functions in the development of an allergic asthmatic response.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.066072287,-0.025170507,0.024528422,-0.114237311,-0.039744369,0.014469952,0.000914471,-0.037032167,0.044074664,-0.038179057,-0.114656231,-0.035127427,-0.009682975,0.027447253,-0.037070303,-0.059630613,0.048836572,-0.100340677,-0.025563942,-0.038792972,0.020115692,-0.051405748,0.001211965,0.02309524,-0.05565572,0.043554015,0.023495271,-0.016000471,0.051894628,0.032176857
"Discovery, synthesis, and optimization of an N-alkoxy indolylacetamide against HIV-1 carrying NNRTI-resistant mutations from the Isatis indigotica root","Abstract From an aqueous decoction of the traditional Chinese medicine “ban lan gen” (the Isatis indigotica root), an antiviral natural product CI - 39 was isolated as an NNRTI (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) (EC50 = 3.40 μM). Its novel structure was determined as methyl (1-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)acetamidobenzoate by spectroscopic data and confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Through synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) investigation of CI - 39 and 57 new derivatives (24 with EC50 values of 0.06–8.55 μM), two optimized derivatives 10f and 10i (EC50: 0.06 μM and 0.06 μM) having activity comparable to that of NVP (EC50 = 0.03 μM) were obtained. Further evaluation verified that 10f and 10i were RT DNA polymerase inhibitors and exhibited better activities and drug resistance folds compared to NVP against seven NNRTI-resistant strains carrying different mutations. Especially, 10i (EC50 = 0.43 μM) was more active to the L100I/K103N double-mutant strain as compared to both NVP (EC50 = 0.76 μM) and EFV (EC50 = 1.08 μM). The molecular docking demonstrated a possible binding pattern between 10i and RT and revealed activity mechanism of 10i against the NNRTI-resistant strains.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.058184713,-0.014712767,0.017955506,-0.047918634,-0.048305197,0.057199775,0.032544511,-0.016978012,0.012018381,-0.029366097,0.017097408,0.08790616,-0.04354526,-0.015435243,-0.030827637,0.020182669,-0.0130812,0.072778953,0.058650139,-0.035107365,-0.025003705,0.015909408,0.009316893,0.070755718,0.037797384,0.010792077,0.001086029,-0.033209641,0.03285136,0.00590719
Antiviral activity of Jinchai capsule against influenza virus,"Abstract Objective To evaluate the effect on influenza virus of Jinchai, a capsule made of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Methods Madin-darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were infected with the FM1 strain of influenza virus A (subtype H1N1) in vitro. They were used to explore how Jinchai affected cell adsorption, cell membrane fusion, transcription and replication of the influenza virus. Hemagglutinin (HA) protein, intracellular pH, and influenza virus protein acid (PA) polymerase subunit were detected with confocal microscopy and real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results Jinchai significantly reduced the expression of HA and PA polymerase subunit mRNA in infected MDCK cells. Jinchai also significantly decreased intracellular pH in infected cells. Conclusions Jinchai had strong anti-influenza activity against the influenza virus. It weakened the ability of the influenza virus to adsorb to cell wall and fuse with cell membranes in the early infection stage, and inhibited the transcription and replication of the virus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.025510369,-0.127203227,-0.020006164,0.141623622,-0.111351843,0.325673684,-0.157013678,-0.062334326,0.039888099,-0.117627604,-0.031972008,-0.078429408,0.012002195,0.146559427,0.018232314,0.009704153,0.031844881,-0.087173692,0.031262192,0.022139498,0.058361878,0.025397916,0.064961483,-0.021830062,0.027860871,0.040402218,-0.047415578,0.025526674,-0.089115226,0.068471191
Parent-collected respiratory specimens—A novel method for respiratory virus and vaccine efficacy research,"Summary Population-based respiratory research and vaccine efficacy studies have previously required clinic or home visits when a subject had an acute respiratory illness. This method may mean parents are unwilling to enrol their child or report an illness of interest. We conducted a community-based cohort study into respiratory illnesses in 234 pre-school aged children using parent-collected specimens. Between January 2003 and January 2004 there were 563 specimens collected from 730 identified illnesses and these were tested using a panel of respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays; 409 (73%) were positive for any virus. Specimens were not more likely to be positive when collected by a healthcare worker parent, when they included a throat swab, or when a very good collection technique was reported. A delay from illness onset to specimen collection of up to 5 days did not appear to impact on sensitivity of virus identification, but a delay of six or more days with minor delays in testing saw positivity fall. Combined with daily symptom diary completion and PCR testing, parent-collected specimens are an efficient and acceptable method for the conduct of future vaccine efficacy studies and other community-based respiratory virus research.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.158955962,-0.005931566,0.005487528,0.039226801,0.018238376,-0.02719914,-0.014372697,-0.019139982,0.020558333,0.017363195,0.026970262,0.002188652,0.007959048,-0.033653487,0.057389116,-0.004052342,-0.01504679,-0.051203975,0.029963408,-0.090639038,-0.01503975,-0.05220021,-0.019266449,-0.068682961,0.059647219,0.04227876,-0.036684932,-0.006894429,0.014187421,-0.072986752
"Effectiveness of the 2010–2011 seasonal influenza vaccine in preventing confirmed influenza hospitalizations in adults: A case–case comparison, case-control study","Abstract Introduction We estimated influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) to prevent laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in patients 18 years old or older during the 2010–2011 influenza season. Methods We conducted a prospective case-control study in five hospitals, in Valencia, Spain. Study subjects were consecutive emergency hospitalizations for predefined conditions associated with an influenza-like illness episode <8 days before admission. Patients were considered immunized if vaccinated ≥14 days before influenza-like illness onset. Cases were those with a real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive for influenza and controls were RT-PCR positive for other respiratory viruses. Adjusted IVE was estimated as 100×(1−adjusted odds ratio). To account for indication bias we computed adjusted IVE for respiratory syncytial virus related hospitalizations. Results Of 826 eligible hospitalized patients, 102 (12%) were influenza positive and considered cases, and 116 (14%) were positive for other respiratory viruses and considered controls. Adjusted IVE was 54% (95% confidence interval, 11–76%). By subgroup, adjusted IVE was 53% (4–77%) for those with high-risk conditions, 59% (16–79%) for those ≥60 years of age, and, 54% (4–79%) for those ≥60 years of age with high-risk conditions. No influenza vaccine effect was observed against respiratory syncytial virus related hospitalization. Conclusion Influenza vaccination was associated with a significant reduction on the risk of confirmed influenza hospitalization, irrespective of age and high-risk conditions.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.250924999,-0.091355806,-0.062977816,0.130306142,0.0074913,0.211210979,-0.180216229,0.030653232,-0.062018068,-0.130046605,0.034456644,0.045642134,-0.062072649,0.009855145,-0.054498066,0.045973548,0.011131973,-0.032638943,0.017275057,-0.007335494,-0.049259789,-0.005603028,-0.007009658,0.006906729,-0.00332737,-0.015481583,-0.033618213,-0.050718671,-0.007763327,-0.011610981
Effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccine against laboratory-confirmed influenza pneumonia among adults aged ≥65 years in Japan,"Abstract Background The effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) against laboratory-confirmed influenza pneumonia in older adults remains to be established. Methods Pneumonia patients aged ≥65 years who visited a study hospital in Chiba, Japan, were prospectively enrolled from February 2012 to January 2014. Sputum samples were collected from participants and tested for influenza virus by polymerase chain reaction assays. Influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against laboratory-confirmed influenza pneumonia was estimated by a test-negative design. Results Among a total of 814 pneumonia patients, 42 (5.2%) tested positive for influenza: 40 were positive for influenza A virus, and two were positive for influenza B virus. The IVE against laboratory-confirmed influenza pneumonia was 58.3% (95% confidence interval, 28.8–75.6%). The IVE against influenza pneumonia hospital admission, severe pneumonia, and death was 60.2% (95% CI, 22.8–79.4%), 65.5% (95% CI, 44.3–78.7%), and 71% (95% CI, −62.9% to 94.8%), respectively. In the subgroup analyses, the IVE against influenza pneumonia was higher for patients with immunosuppressive conditions (85.9%; 95% CI, 67.4–93.9%) than for those without (48.7%; 95% CI, 2.7–73%) but did not differ by patients’ statin use status.

Clinical characteristics and outcomes of respiratory syncytial virus infection in pregnant women,"Abstract Objective To describe the clinical presentation and laboratory diagnosis of pregnant women with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Methods Pregnant women in their second and third trimester were enrolled during the course of routine prenatal care visits when they were asymptomatic within the preceding two weeks (healthy controls) or when they reported symptoms of acute respiratory illness (ARI) of ≤7 days of duration (cases). Clinical outcomes were assessed at enrollment and two weeks after. Re-enrollment was allowed. Nasal-pharyngeal secretions were evaluated for respiratory pathogens by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sera were tested for RSV-specific antibody responses by Western Blot, microneutralization assay, and palivizumab competitive antibody assay. Results During the 2015–2016 respiratory virus season, 7 of 65 (11%) pregnant women with ARI at their initial enrollment and 8 of 77 (10%) pregnant women with ARI during the study period (initial or re-enrollment) had PCR-confirmed RSV infection. Four (50%) PCR-confirmed RSV ARI cases reported symptoms of a lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI), one was hospitalized. Combining PCR and serology data, the RSV attack rate at initial enrollment was 12% (8 of 65), and 13% (10 of 77) based on ARI episodes. Among healthy controls, 28 of 88 (32%) had a Western Blot profile suggestive of a recent RSV infection either in the prior and/or current season. Conclusion RSV had an attack rate of 10–13% among ambulatory pregnant women receiving routine prenatal care during the respiratory virus season. The serology results of healthy controls suggest a potentially higher attack rate. Future studies should be aware of the combined diagnostic strength of PCR and serology to identify RSV infection. As maternal RSV vaccine candidates are evaluated to protect young infants, additional priority should be placed on outcomes of pregnant women.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.183653098,-0.049932382,-0.023160307,0.018950059,-0.008715672,-0.061898153,0.005300797,-0.065168144,0.107699631,-0.0754904,0.043895648,-0.070584586,-0.106885986,-0.055585872,-0.037533686,0.005401872,-0.014152895,0.02113381,0.022206409,-0.071165966,-0.014585887,-0.131566468,-0.000206888,-0.079009536,0.089974029,-0.087993854,0.207961262,0.07869353,-0.026416402,0.035267026
Clinical presentation and outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome in dialysis patients,"Abstract There was a major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) affecting more than 300 patients occurring in a private housing estate in Hong Kong, in which an infected renal patient was suspected to be the primary source. It is unknown whether renal patients would represent a distinct group of patients who share some characteristics that could predispose them to have higher infectivity. In this context, we have encountered 4 dialysis patients contracting SARS in a minor outbreak, which involved 11 patients and 4 health care workers, in a medical ward of a regional hospital. Of these 4 dialysis patients, 1 patient was receiving hemodialysis while the other 3 patients were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Fever and radiological changes were their dominant presenting features. All were having positive results for SARS-associated coronavirus ribonucleic acid by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction performed on their nasopharyngeal aspirates or stool samples. It appeared that treatment with high-dose intravenous ribavirin and corticosteroids could only resolve the fever, but it could not stop the disease progression. All 4 patients developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation on days 9 through 12. At the end, all of the patients died from sudden cardiac arrest, which was associated with acute myocardial infarction in 2 cases. From this small case series, it appeared that dialysis patients might have an aggressive clinical course and poor outcome after contracting SARS. However, a large-scale study is required to further examine this issue, and further investigation into the immunologic abnormalities associated with the uremic state in this group of patients is also warranted.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.187786201,0.188535736,-0.209187871,-0.134169436,-0.094261604,-0.060336358,-0.135194832,0.00602473,-0.229909648,0.053464388,-0.04480637,0.035414915,0.016058703,0.077752625,-0.036217214,-0.001019488,0.013301946,0.096337543,-0.010284545,0.086507671,0.081082968,-0.097224106,-0.09399446,-0.021267867,-0.058429401,-0.031122526,-0.022251232,0.008115362,-0.092273821,-0.001566103
Gripe A (H1N1)v pandémica en UCI: ¿qué hemos aprendido?,"Resumen Las características de la gripe pandémica 2009 son diferentes de las de la gripe estacional. En Australia- Nueva Zelanda (ANZIC) se multiplicaron por 15 los ingresos en la unidad de cuidados intensivos (UCI) en el invierno austral. Se comparan las características de la serie española de los primeros ingresos en UCI en julio con las series publicadas en Canadá y ANZIC hasta octubre de 2009. A diferencia de lo observado en España, sólo la mitad de los ingresos en Canadá y ANZIC se debió a neumonía viral primaria, mientras que la neumonía bacteriana fue más frecuente en los primeros. En todas las series, los jóvenes, muchos de los cuales no tenían comorbilidad, fueron la población más afectada. La obesidad, la patología pulmonar crónica, el embarazo y la cardiopatía fueron las comorbilidades más frecuentes. El diagnóstico mediante rt-PCR puede presentar un 10% de falsos negativos. El shock y la insuficiencia renal aguda fueron más frecuentes en la serie española. El 10-30% de los afectados requieren ingreso a UCI y 6 de cada 10 ventilación mecánica (VM), con una alta frecuencia de fracaso de la ventilación no invasiva (75%). La mortalidad fue similar entre las series (14-25%), aunque mayor en los pacientes que requieren VM (30%). La administración precoz (< 48 h de inicio de los síntomas) de oseltamvir se ha asociado a una mejor evolución. Por ello, su administración precoz en pacientes con factores de riesgo, o en quienes aun sin ellos presentan signos de progresión clínica, podría reducir el ingreso en la UCI y la mortalidad. Abstract The characteristics of pandemic influenza 2009 differ from those of seasonal influenza. In Australia-New Zealand the number of admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) increased by 15-fold in the southern winter. We compared the characteristics of the Spanish series of the first ICU admissions in July with those of series published in Canada and Australia-New Zealand up to October 2009. Unlike the situation in Spain, only half the admissions in Canada and Australia-New Zealand were due to primary viral pneumonia but bacterial pneumonia was much more frequent. In all series, young people, many of whom had no comborbidities, were the most frequently affected population. The most common comorbidities were obesity, chronic pulmonary disease, pregnancy and heart disease. Diagnosis through reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction can have a false-negative rate of 10%. Shock and acute renal insufficiency were more frequent in the Spanish series. A total of 10-30% of patients required ICU admission and 6 of 10 patients required mechanical ventilation with a high frequency of failure of non-invasive ventilation (75%). Mortality was similar among the series (14-25%) but was higher in patients requiring mechanical ventilation (30%). Early oseltamivir administration (< 48h after symptom onset) has been associated with better outcome. Therefore, early administration of this drug in patients with risk factors or those who, although free from risk factors, show clinical progression, could reduce ICU admissions and mortality.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.046645685,-0.047864556,-0.020956884,-0.098723778,-0.052045425,0.034569041,-0.001365106,0.020752204,-0.015109898,-0.048586973,-0.014031488,0.056189895,-0.026412073,-0.131782793,0.240474036,0.359098196,0.492982711,0.127776611,-0.050266363,0.110720312,0.070694371,0.078274794,0.059577376,0.045580586,-0.126020559,-0.125939915,0.065509388,-0.000796164,-0.033745742,0.049512259
Revisión sobre las infecciones no bacterianas del aparato respiratorio: neumonías víricas,"Resumen Aunque las bacterias son los principales patógenos involucrados en la neumonía adquirida en la comunidad, algunos virus son responsables directos o en coinfección de un importante número de neumonías adquiridas en la comunidad. La clínica de estas neumonías puede ser muy similar, en el caso de los virus afectan más frecuentemente a la población infantil y geriátrica, con frecuencia no elevan la cifra de leucocitos, la fiebre es inconstante y frecuentemente se acompañan de síntomas de vías respiratorias altas. Característicamente no elevan la procalcitonina. Durante años el diagnóstico ha recaído en cultivos celulares y en detección de antígenos; desde la incorporación en la clínica de la PCR, la identificación de estos patógenos ha aumentado, descubriéndose nuevos microorganismos como el bocavirus. En general, el virus influenza A y el virus respiratorio sincitial siguen siendo los principales virus implicados. Sin embargo, la irrupción en los últimos años de epidemias con alta letalidad de coronavirus y de zoonosis de virus influenza hace que sea necesario mostrarse alerta ante estos nuevos patógenos emergentes. Los inhibidores de la neuraminidasa para neumonías víricas han demostrado disminuir la transmisión en casos expuestos y mejorar la evolución clínica en pacientes en Cuidados Intensivos; su uso en infecciones banales no está recomendado. La ribavirina ha sido utilizada en niños con infecciones por virus respiratorio sincitial, así como en inmunodeprimidos. Fuera de estos fármacos, ningún otro antiviral ha probado su eficacia. Las medidas de prevención con vacunación para virus influenza y con anticuerpos monoclonales para virus respiratorio sincitial podrían disminuir la incidencia de neumonía. Abstract Although bacteria are the main pathogens involved in community-acquired pneumonia, a significant number of community-acquired pneumonia are caused by viruses, either directly or as part of a co-infection. The clinical picture of these different pneumonias can be very similar, but viral infection is more common in the pediatric and geriatric populations, leukocytes are not generally elevated, fever is variable, and upper respiratory tract symptoms often occur; procalcitonin levels are not generally affected. For years, the diagnosis of viral pneumonia was based on cell culture and antigen detection, but since the introduction of polymerase chain reaction techniques in the clinical setting, identification of these pathogens has increased and new microorganisms such as human bocavirus have been discovered. In general, influenza virus type A and syncytial respiratory virus are still the main pathogens involved in this entity. However, in recent years, outbreaks of deadly coronavirus and zoonotic influenza virus have demonstrated the need for constant alert in the face of new emerging pathogens. Neuraminidase inhibitors for viral pneumonia have been shown to reduce transmission in cases of exposure and to improve the clinical progress of patients in intensive care; their use in common infections is not recommended. Ribavirin has been used in children with syncytial respiratory virus, and in immunosuppressed subjects. Apart from these drugs, no antiviral has been shown to be effective. Prevention with anti-influenza virus vaccination and with monoclonal antibodies, in the case of syncytial respiratory virus, may reduce the incidence of pneumonia.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.082100335,-0.089982528,-0.037126265,-0.006181638,-0.046616973,0.089870567,0.007220629,0.003080183,0.018984914,-0.006607459,-0.018973946,0.014068643,0.031816964,-0.153385447,0.275991825,0.335060209,0.499114813,0.118306304,-0.049621613,0.141787294,0.069935721,0.109490519,0.10535859,0.066932057,-0.082539567,-0.092229996,0.063639887,0.003998155,-0.019836584,0.023325594
"The relation between serum vitamin D levels, viral infections and severity of attacks in children with recurrent wheezing","Abstract Introduction and Objectives Vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased susceptibility to infections and wheezing. We aimed to evaluate the relation between vitamin D levels, viral infections and severity of attacks in children with recurrent wheezing. Materials and methods A total of 52 patients who applied with wheezing, at the ages of 12–60 months with a history of three or more wheezing attacks in the last year and 54 healthy children were included. Sociodemographic data, risk factors for recurrent wheezing, and the severity of the wheezing attacks were recorded. 25(OH)D3, calcium, phosphor, alkaline phosphatase and parathormone levels of all children were measured. Nasopharyngeal samples of the patients for viruses were studied by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Results For the patient group, being breastfed for six months or less, history of cesarean section, cigarette exposure, humid home environment, and family history of allergic disease were significantly higher compared with the control group. Serum vitamin D levels in the patient group were significantly lower compared to the control group. There was no significant relationship between vitamin D levels and hospitalization, oxygen or steroid therapy. Virus was detected in 38 patients (73%). Rhinovirus (63.2%) was the most frequently detected virus. Coinfection was found in 14 (36.8%) patients. There was no statistically significant difference between detection of virus and vitamin D levels. Conclusions Cigarette exposure, being breastfed six months or less, humid home environment, history of cesarean section, family history of allergic disease and vitamin D deficiency might be risk factors for recurrent wheezing.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.10934541,-0.059916807,-0.054031267,-0.100076113,-0.019325502,-0.053850575,0.032980239,-0.010177931,-0.019154724,-0.015176126,0.000199778,-0.024328149,-0.057519049,0.008047856,-0.013383923,0.02675163,0.004644132,-0.012633716,0.002760041,-0.010210871,-0.021348026,-0.044019033,-0.02910914,0.034398049,-0.052871315,-0.009760961,0.015926872,-0.053175275,-0.021694185,0.021133206
A follow-up of Beagle dogs intradermally infected with Leishmania chagasi in the presence or absence of sand fly saliva,"Abstract In this study, we compare the development of infection and/or disease in Beagle dogs intradermally infected with Leishmania chagasi, in the presence or absence of Lutzomyia longipalpis saliva, with those of intravenously infected animals. Spleen samples of all the animals inoculated with parasites had positive polymerase chain reaction tests for Leishmania DNA. Positive spleen cultures for Leishmania were detected earlier (P≤0.018) and were more frequent (five out of the five animals) in intravenously infected animals than in the intradermally infected animals, in presence (two out of the six animals) or absence (three out of the five animals) of salivary gland lysate of L. longipalpis. Significant increase in serum antibodies against Leishmania was observed only in the intravenously infected group (P=0.004). In addition, dogs with infection confirmed by isolation of amastigotes or detection of parasite DNA were, nevertheless, negative for anti-Leishmania antibodies up to 5 months or more after infection. Only animals of the intravenously infected group developed progressive decreases in hematocrit (Pearson r=−0.8076, P=0.0026) and hemoglobin (Pearson r=−0.8403, P=0.0012) during the infection period. No significant difference in the course of infection was observed between groups of intradermally infected animals. The data presented herein confirms that the intradermal inoculation of dogs with Leishmania produces an asymptomatic form of infection. It also fails to show an advantage in using L. longipalpis saliva as an infection-enhancing agent in experimental canine leishmaniasis.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.003723875,-0.005276747,0.036181142,-0.118334063,0.002466213,0.023842793,0.04722899,-0.009710996,0.00326555,-0.027160889,0.056163721,-0.021926582,-0.018239023,0.01350192,0.062892604,-0.007062878,-0.034505406,-0.015972933,0.037188523,0.017305808,0.053671211,0.019163686,-0.079210564,-0.03008631,0.08524022,-0.072000825,-0.093343272,-0.001763068,-0.081837915,0.063076797
Multiattribute evaluation of two simple tests for the detection of Cryptosporidium parvum in calf faeces,"Abstract There is a need for simple and inexpensive diagnostic and screening tests for the detection of Cryptosporidium parvum infection in calves. A sucrose wet mount test and a lateral immunochromatography test were evaluated for epidemiological sensitivity and specificity, cost per test, simplicity, test time and ease of batching. Polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) of the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) gene locus, with gel electrophoresis, was used as a gold standard. Cohen's kappa statistic of agreement (к) between the Ontario Veterinary College (OVC) sucrose wet mount test and COWP PCR–RFLP was 0.82, and the sensitivity and specificity of the OVC sucrose wet mount test were 88.6% and 93.8%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the lateral immunochromatography test were 78.3% and 93.3%, respectively, and agreement between this test and PCR–RFLP was good (к =0.73). There was substantial agreement between the OVC sucrose wet mount test and the lateral immunochromatography test (к =0.84). Both tests were inexpensive and easy to use; however, the lateral immunochromatography test was faster and simpler to perform than the sucrose wet mount test, and was generally more user-friendly. These tests provide practitioners and researchers with cheap, quick and accurate methods of detecting C. parvum infection in young calves.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.012740962,0.031513138,0.119955076,-0.050130031,-0.042147811,0.007309697,-0.0082692,0.005964524,-0.016401478,-0.026923222,-0.010362521,0.014359478,0.002917475,-0.056446095,-0.003148543,0.022014942,-0.001031811,0.001259128,-0.017866339,-0.058003904,-0.010389028,-0.017857272,0.031513691,-0.067362803,0.020304034,0.009797987,-0.009120775,-0.077555725,-0.020091859,0.007124971
"Molecular and immunohistochemical detection of assemblage E, Giardia duodenalis in scouring North Dakota calves","Abstract Despite many reports on the shedding of Giardia parasites by scouring calves, the role of Giardia as a cause of calf diarrhea is still controversial. To elucidate the role of Giardia duodenalis in calf scours, diagnostic samples from 189 scouring calves were tested by different assays during a 1-year-study period. Giardia antigens were detected in 22/189 scouring calves by a fecal-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and 10 of these were positive for assemblage E, G. duodenalis by polymerase chain reaction. Giardia trophozoites were demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in intestinal sections from five calves in which the parasites were spatially distributed in areas of microscopically detectable enteritis. Our data suggest that under certain circumstances, Giardia may cause intestinal lesions leading to calf scours.

Species identification of trichomonads and associated coinfections in dogs with diarrhea and suspected trichomonosis,"Abstract Trichomonads have been infrequently reported in the feces of dogs where their pathogenicity remains uncertain. It is currently unknown whether Tritrichomonas foetus or Pentatrichomonas hominis is identified more commonly in dogs with trichomonosis or how often these infections are accompanied by concurrent enteric infectious agents. The objective of this study was to determine the identity of trichomonads present in a series of 38 unsolicited canine diarrheic fecal samples submitted for T. foetus diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing between 2007 and 2010. We also examined each fecal sample for an association of trichomonosis with concurrent infection using a convenient real-time PCR panel for nine gastrointestinal pathogens. P. hominis, T. foetus, or both were identified by PCR in feces of 17, 1, and 1 dogs respectively. Feces from the remaining 19 dogs were PCR negative for T. foetus, P. hominis and using broader-spectrum Trichomonadida primers. The total number and specific identities of concurrent enteropathogens identified did not differ between fecal samples from dogs that were or were not identified by PCR as infected with trichomonads. These results suggest that P. hominis infection is more frequently identified than T. foetus infection in diarrheic dogs with trichomonosis and that concurrent enteropathogen infection is common in this population.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.049111817,0.017739361,0.107389866,-0.086398503,0.049878862,0.00026194,0.022750726,0.004267791,-0.024369444,0.000929722,0.055426014,0.012445149,-0.013789346,-0.006158364,0.093142928,-0.069344818,0.005919111,-0.029039638,0.067035048,-0.085369358,0.140184415,0.11202276,-0.074588566,-0.058948085,0.14980328,-0.104813011,-0.061588163,-0.051189071,-0.010421624,0.086413489
Exacerbations de l’asthme et identification virale associée à celle du Chlamydiae pneumoniae et du Mycoplasma pneumoniae : épidémiologie comparative entre nourrissons et enfants âgés de plus de deux ans,"Résumé Objectifs. – L’utilisation des nouvelles techniques d’identification par les méthodes moléculaires apporte de nouvelles données épidémiologiques. Patients et méthodes. – Cent dix-huit aspirations nasales pratiquées chez des enfants hospitalisés pour une exacerbation aiguë d’asthme ont été colligées. Les techniques conventionnelles ont associé la culture virale et l’immunofluorescence et les techniques moléculaires une polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Résultats. – L’utilisation des techniques conventionnelles a mis en évidence un virus dans 34 % des prélèvements respiratoires (40 cas sur 118), tandis que l’étude par PCR permet une identification positive sur 68 % des prélèvements (80 cas sur 118) et l’association des deux méthodes amène la positivité à 77 % (91 cas sur 118). Les co-infections ont concerné 23 % des prélèvements positifs. L’identification virale par les outils traditionnels est significativement plus fréquente chez les jeunes asthmatiques, ainsi que lors de l’utilisation des outils de biologie moléculaire de façon non significative. L’épidémiologie comparative retrouve la prépondérance dans les deux groupes d’âge du rhinovirus (45 %), puis du virus respiratoire syncytial (28 %) et de l’entérovirus (8,5 %). Chez les enfants âgés de moins de deux ans, rhinovirus et virus respiratoire syncytial ont une prévalence proche (42 et 36 % respectivement) sensiblement différente de celle des enfants âgés de plus de deux ans (66 et 27 % respectivement). L’identification par PCR de Chlamydia pneumoniae et de Mycoplasma pneumoniae reste rare (six cas sur 118 prélèvements). Conclusion. – La prééminence du rhinovirus et du virus respiratoire syncytial est retrouvée lors des exacerbations d’asthme chez le nourrisson tandis que C. pneumoniae et M. pneumoniae ne semblent pas particulièrement impliqués. L’identification est plus forte chez les jeunes asthmatiques avec probablement une charge virale plus importante, car la positivité de la culture virale est plus fréquente chez les enfants âgés de moins de deux ans. Abstract Purpose.– Molecular processes can have a different impact on epidemiological data. Patients and methods. – The study covers 118 nasal aspirate samples taken on children hospitalized for acute asthma exacerbation for 2 years. Conventional techniques associated viral culture and immunofluorescence while molecular techniques used polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results. – Virus presence was revealed with conventional techniques in 34% of the respiratory samples (40/118), while PCR study of viruses and genomes of Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae allowed positive identification in 68% of the samples (80/118). The combination of both techniques allowed identification of an infectious agent in 77% of cases (91/118). More than one pathogenic agent was isolated in 23% of positive samples. Epidemiological study shows prevalence of rhinovirus (45%), then respiratory syncytial virus (28%) and enterovirus (8.5%). In children under 2 years of age, rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus have a close prevalence (respectively 42 and 36%), which is not the same result as in older children (respectively 66 and 27%). Moreover, PCR techniques allowed the identification of just a few Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (6/118). Conclusion. – In this study, molecular techniques of identification demonstrate a clear advantage in sensitivity compared to performances of viral cultures or immunofluorescence. The importance of rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus is remarkable while Chlamydia pneumoniae an Mycoplasma pneumoniae do not seem to be particularly involved.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.078779843,-0.062201496,0.017562203,-0.049420444,-0.011680436,-0.031445184,0.041840653,-0.013437205,-0.001681175,0.043886686,-0.017335124,-0.010307645,0.036952944,-0.113821509,0.188244777,0.181154722,0.301766715,0.017146107,-0.038643549,-0.014411395,0.005371882,0.066933245,0.133724248,0.007969163,0.009465696,0.050304458,-0.026377824,-0.016167193,0.020456134,0.018766374
Diagnostic moléculaire en pathologie infectieuse: intérêt d'un diagnostic multiplex dans les pneumopathies atypiques,"Résumé Parmi les pathogènes responsables de pneumopathies atypiques, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, et Legionella pneumophila sont trois bactéries fréquentes pour lesquelles un diagnostic étiologique rapide est difficile à obtenir. L'amplification génique in vitro offre une possibilité de rendu de résultats dans la journée, mais souvent au détriment d'un temps de réalisation important du fait du manque d'automatisation. Cet inconvénient est réduit en cas d'utilisation de techniques d'amplification génique multiplex, dont un exemple de réalisation est présenté dans cet article. Abstract Among frequent potential respiratory pathogens, Mycoplasma pneumoniæ, Chlamydia pneumoniæ, and Legionella pneumophila are difficult to isolate with usual laboratory techniques (culture, serologic tests).

Étude des couples mère–enfant par la réalisation de trois prélèvements: vaginal et respiratoire chez la mère (VM et RM) lors du travail, gastrique chez le nouveau-né (GNN). Suivi clinique des nouveau-nés et des mères jusqu'à j3. Analyse virologique des échantillons par reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) en temps réel pour la recherche des HCoV 229-E et OC43. Résultats Cent cinquante-neuf couples mère–enfant ont été inclus de juillet 2003 à août 2005. Seul HCoV 229-E a été détecté dans 11 échantillons chez six couples mère–enfant. Pour deux couples, les trois prélèvements (VM, RM et GNN) étaient positifs (cas 1 et 2). Pour le cas 3, seuls le VM et GNN étaient positifs. Pour deux couples, seuls les RM étaient positifs (cas 4 et 5). Pour le cas 6, seul le VM était positif. Pour les trois GNN positifs, aucun enfant n'était symptomatique. Conclusion Une possible transmission verticale des HCoV est mise en évidence dans cette étude pilote qui nécessite désormais d'être poursuivie à plus large échelle. Il convient également d'inclure la recherche des coronavirus humains identifiés récemment, HCoV NL63 et HKU1, et d'analyser le profil génomique des HCoV détectés chez les trois couples mère–enfant positifs. Abstract Human coronaviruses (HCoV) have been implicated in neonatal nosocomial respiratory infection. Prior to our study, several cases of neonatal infection were observed in infants born at our hospital. This prospective pilot monocentric pilot study investigates the possibility of maternofetal transmission of HCoV responsible for cases of neonatal infection observed within the first 24 hours of life. Materials and methods Three samples from mother–child couples, maternal vaginal (VM) and respiratory (RM) samples during labor; newborn gastric sample (GNN), were assessed for viral analysis using real time RT-PCR for the detection of HCoV 229-E and OC43. Clinical follow-up of infants and mothers was up to Day 3 after birth. Results One hundred (and) fifty-nine mother–child couples were included between July 2003 and August 2005. HCoV 229-E only was detected in 11 samples from 6 mother–child couples. For 2 couples, all 3 samples (VM, RM and GNN) were tested positive (cases 1 and 2). For case 3, both VM and GNN were positive. For 2 couples, only RM was positive (cases 4 and 5). In case 6, only VM was positive. Of the 3 positive GNN, no infant was symptomatic. Conclusion Possible vertical transmission of HCoV was evidenced in this pilot study and requires further investigation on a larger scale. Equally indicated is the inclusion of tests to detect recently identified human coronaviruses HCoV NL63 and HKU1, as well as genomic profile analysis of HCoV 229-E detected in the 3 positive mother-child couples.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.042814181,-0.02670712,-0.005437572,-0.071765576,0.060006839,-0.025140925,0.059416695,-0.021377411,0.087837256,-0.074134791,-0.010991898,0.220201298,0.158122951,0.017667448,0.168623342,0.221472018,0.231907948,0.017186421,-0.070044472,0.015788973,9.65E-05,0.045638771,0.045164414,-0.036505347,-0.000949504,0.016110452,0.023532248,-0.013111117,0.016843939,0.028074228
Acute respiratory viral infections in pediatric cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy,"Abstract Objective To estimate the prevalence of infection by respiratory viruses in pediatric patients with cancer and acute respiratory infection (ARI) and/or fever. Methods Cross-sectional study, from January 2011 to December 2012. The secretions of nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed in children younger than 21 years with acute respiratory infections. Patients were treated at the Grupo em Defesa da Criança Com Câncer (Grendacc) and University Hospital (HU), Jundiaí, SP. The rapid test was used for detection of influenza virus (Kit Biotrin, Inc., Ireland), and real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (FTD, Respiratory pathogens, multiplex Fast Trade Kit, Malta) for detection of influenza virus (H1N1, B), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parechovirus, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, and human coronavirus. The prevalence of viral infection was estimated and association tests were used (χ2 or Fisher's exact test). Results 104 samples of nasopharyngeal aspirate and blood were analyzed. The median age was 12±5.2 years, 51% males, 68% whites, 32% had repeated ARIs, 32% prior antibiotic use, 19.8% cough, and 8% contact with ARIs. A total of 94.3% were in good general status. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (42.3%) was the most prevalent neoplasia. Respiratory viruses were detected in 50 samples: rhinoviruses (23.1%), respiratory syncytial virus AB (8.7%), and coronavirus (6.8%). Codetection occurred in 19% of cases with 2 viruses and in 3% of those with 3 viruses, and was more frequent between rhinovirus and coronavirus 43. Fever in neutropenic patients was observed in 13%, of which four (30.7) were positive for viruses. There were no deaths. Conclusions The prevalence of respiratory viruses was relevant in the infectious episode, with no increase in morbidity and mortality. Viral co-detection was frequent in patients with cancer and ARIs.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.327233634,-0.089644896,-0.0882339,0.132724929,0.04123003,-0.044953044,-0.031780465,0.01176784,-0.027788024,0.074111922,0.001013034,-0.050609872,0.088733374,0.039554585,0.073932268,-0.048696853,0.053386076,-0.08119873,0.094792677,0.034039768,0.03050724,-0.038036999,-0.039113141,0.019634942,0.024830854,0.059374062,-0.036496852,0.048377351,-0.066907201,-0.11618699
"Sequence analysis of gene 3, gene 4 and gene 5 of avian infectious bronchitis virus strain CU-T2","Abstract We have previously reported the nucleotide sequences of gene 2 (spike (S) protein gene), gene 6 (nucleocapsid (N) protein gene), and the 3′ end untranslated region of a novel avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain, CU-T2 [Jia et al. (1995) Arch. Virol. 140, 259–271]. In the present report we describe the sequences of the remaining genes of this strain (gene 3, 4 and 5) with the exception of gene 1 (RNA polymerase gene). Gene 3 contained three open reading frames (ORFs), 3a, 3b and 3c of 174, 195 and 282 nucleotides (nt), respectively. Gene 4 (membrane (M) protein gene) consisted of 749 nt with a single ORF of 687 nt. Gene 5 contained two ORFs, 5a and 5b, with 198 and 249 nt, respectively. Thus, in total, there were 7349 nt from the 5′ end of S protein gene to the 3′ end of the CU-T2 genome. The overall nt sequence homologies between gene 3, 4, and 5 of CU-T2 and those of other strains were between 84.1–90.8%, 85.8–88.8% and 90.4–96.4%, respectively. The predicted amino acid (aa) sequence homologies revealed that gene 3b and 5b were more conserved than 3a, 3c and 5a. Each individual gene of CU-T2 strain (with the exception of the RNA polymerase gene) had a different level of homology with the homologous gene of other strains, suggesting that the evolution of IBV strains in general has been a complex, and as yet, poorly understood process. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Reproduction of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in immunostimulated and non-immunostimulated 3-week-old piglets experimentally infected with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2),"Abstract Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in swine is causally associated with the newly recognised pathogen, porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). In this study, 3-week-old SPF PCV2-seronegative piglets were inoculated intranasally with PCV2. The effect of immunostimulation on the induction of PMWS was investigated by immunisation with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) emulsified in incomplete Freunds adjuvant. The study was terminated 5 weeks after inoculation. While disease was not observed in the age-matched controls, two out of five non-immunised PCV2-infected piglets died on postinoculation day (PID) 21, and one was euthanized on PID 25 in moribund condition. These animals had appeared lethargic with persistent fever from PID 12 onwards. The euthanized pig appeared smaller than littermates and suffered from jaundice. At postmortem examination, gastric ulceration, icterus, and liver and thymus atrophy were observed. Furthermore, histological lesions of degenerating hepatocytes and hepatitis in combination with lymphoid depletion and syncytial cells in lymph nodes were consistent with the diagnosis of PMWS. One out of five immunostimulated PCV2-infected piglets was euthanized on PID 22 with convulsions after a period with wasting. This pig was lethargic from PID 14 onwards with persistent fever from PID 8 and transient dyspnoea. No differences in clinical signs, gross pathologic or histological findings were observed for the remaining non-immunostimulated and immunostimulated PCV2-infected piglets. All 10 PCV2-inoculated piglets seroconverted to PCV2 within 14 days after inoculation. By virus isolation, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), and immunostaining of cryostat sections, it was demonstrated that lymphoid tissue contained abundant PCV2 antigen. Viral DNA load in serum samples was assessed by Q-PCR. All four PMWS-affected piglets had high levels of PCV2 DNA in serum, suggesting that there was a correlation between high levels of viral DNA in serum and the development of PMWS. In conclusion, infection with PCV2 caused PMWS in SPF piglets, however, the immunostimulation did not seem to play a critical role.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.005205033,-0.01476767,0.039688143,-0.125050128,-0.033078348,0.025480298,0.012564743,-0.027101091,0.004801606,-0.02142693,0.037377874,-0.006151964,-0.05461285,0.02923955,0.102209867,-0.046646202,-0.026348852,-0.011450676,8.48E-05,0.006214658,-0.025286905,-0.002705148,0.008091589,-0.032857644,-0.003280071,-0.020456055,-0.057497017,-0.007581782,-0.00564118,-0.017972486
Partial sequence of the spike glycoprotein gene of transmissible gastroenteritis viruses isolated in Korea,"Abstract The spike (S) glycoprotein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is the predominant inducer of neutralizing antibodies and has been implicated in virulence and host cell tropism. In this study, the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the amino terminal half of the S glycoprotein gene of one Korean field TGEV strain (133) isolated in 1997 and three Korean field TGEV strains (KT2, KT3 and KT4) isolated in 2000 and HKT2 strain, KT2 passaged 104 times in ST cells, were determined. The amino terminal half of the S glycoprotein gene including antigenic sites A, B, C and D, were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Amplified PCR products were cloned, sequenced, and compared with published sequences for non-Korean TGEV strains. Korea TGEV field strains had 98.5–99.5% nucleotide sequence and 97.2–99.0% amino acid sequence similarity with each other. They had 96.5–99.0% nucleotide sequence similarity and 94.9–97.6% amino acid sequence similarity compared to non-Korean TGEV strains. Korean TGEV strains had several specific nucleotide and amino acid sequences which were not found in foreign TGEV or PRCV strains. HKT2 strain differed by 0.89% in nucleotide and 2.03% amino acid sequences compared to original KT2 strain although the regions forming four antigenic sites were not changed. By phylogenetic tree analysis, Korean field TGEV strains were branched into different groups from non-Korean TGEV or PRCV strains. Korean TGEV field strains KT2 and 133 were branched in separate groups that were differentiated from the other Korean TGEV strains. The Korean TGEV strains seemed to be evolved from a separate lineage of TGEV strain.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.095979952,-0.019224368,0.077907368,-0.114068455,0.137773654,0.038235628,-0.106786267,-0.029095846,0.025414354,0.000701659,-0.02180524,0.089573115,-0.041021542,-0.093581368,0.022528991,-0.100056351,-0.002952058,0.034257455,0.006214979,0.062087795,0.05084062,-0.014725459,0.028444321,0.064228256,0.079095045,0.010882232,0.023252254,-0.038480039,-0.03069296,0.103372121
Genetic diversity of Hungarian canine distemper virus strains,"Abstract To achieve proper diagnosis of dogs based on acute clinical symptoms and poorly preserved field samples taken from animals that died due to canine distemper (CD), a new differential diagnostic test has been developed based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In this study, more than 150 samples collected from dogs showing respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurological signs suggesting canine distemper virus (CDV) infection were examined. The samples consisted of urine, blood and nasal swabs collected from clinically ill patients, sent to our laboratory by clinicians from various veterinary clinics throughout Hungary. Various organs collected during the necropsy of dogs with pathological changes that suggested CDV infection were also included. Three distinct PCRs were designed. For diagnostic purposes, a primer pair specific to a 409 bases-long segment within the conservative part of the large polymerase region (L) of the CDV genome was designed. Using this test, out of the 150 analyzed samples, 46 (30.66%) proved to be positive for CDV, indicating that CDV still represents a high risk to the canine population in Hungary. For the phylogenetical analysis, a primer pair that completely encompasses the hemagglutinin (H) gene of the CDV genome was designed. The amplicons of this region were sequenced in both directions using the appropriate primers. Our results indicate that several different CDV genotypes are currently present in Hungary. Nine of the analyzed Hungarian strains turned out to belong to the so-called Arctic group of CDVs, and were most closely related to non-European strains from North America, China and Greenland, as well as to the phocine distemper virus 2 (PDV-2) isolated from Baikal seals (Phoca sibirica). One of the Hungarian strains showed high similarity to other European isolates from Denmark, Germany, Italy and Turkey, as well as to other isolates from geographically more distant regions, such as the USA. Three Hungarian strains seem to join a new cluster that is formed by only a couple of strains, one isolated from a mink in Denmark, and another from a dog in North America. Using a third set of primers, a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay has also been designed for the fast and reliable differentiation of the wild-type CDVs from the vaccine strains.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.006848241,0.027855735,0.132630434,-0.087082831,0.117106787,0.037102861,-0.033357777,-0.014137165,-0.032877981,0.013259134,0.056771362,0.075366153,-0.033888945,-0.036893467,0.060566336,-0.06738567,-0.040508443,-0.025969675,0.090900354,0.004220717,0.228759535,0.107035284,-0.089067518,0.020936641,0.193164439,-0.140068609,-0.065638874,-0.035123834,-0.072169979,0.121006106
Characterization of an outbreak of astroviral diarrhea in a group of cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus),"Abstract A Mamastrovirus was identified in an outbreak of diarrhea in cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). Five young adult and two adult cheetahs presented with lethargy, anorexia, watery diarrhea and regurgitation over an 11-day period. Fecal samples were submitted for electron microscopy and culture. Electron microscopy results revealed particles morphologically consistent with an astrovirus, and no other viral pathogens or significant bacterial pathogens were identified. The astrovirus was confirmed and sequenced using consensus astroviral PCR, resulting in a 367 base pair partial RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) product and a 628 base pair partial capsid product. Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses were performed on both the RdRp and the capsid protein segments. All animals were monitored and treated with bismuth subsalicylate tablets (524mg PO BID for 5 days), and recovered without additional intervention. This is the first report we are aware of documenting an astrovirus outbreak in cheetah.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.067940648,-0.01072793,-0.002578056,-0.038628231,0.047404822,-0.023397936,0.026095743,0.035194051,-0.077130278,0.017077609,0.031821016,0.055808182,-0.057208963,-0.045842984,0.04075097,-0.082839334,0.032581883,-0.009952946,-0.029303357,-0.045080546,0.037091423,0.042541499,-0.021366831,-0.034387126,0.011776539,-0.000303487,0.009340218,-0.005714994,-0.002822767,0.040910203
Epidemiological study of bovine norovirus infection by RT-PCR and a VLP-based antibody ELISA,"Abstract Noroviruses, belonging to the family Caliciviridae, have been identified in human beings and in several animal species including cattle. The distribution of bovine norovirus infections was investigated by both RT-PCR to detect norovirus genomes and a virus-like particles-based ELISA to detect genotype 2 bovine norovirus antibodies. During a 1-year systematic study, a virus prevalence of 7.5% (CI 95%: [3.7; 13.4%]) (10 out of 133 samples) was found in stool samples from diarrhoeic calves screened by RT-PCR. Nucleotide sequencing performed on the polymerase region classified all the norovirus amplicons in the bovine norovirus genotype 2. Rather surprisingly, some rotavirus sequences were also detected. On the basis of the polymerase region, genotype 1 bovine norovirus was not identified. Other enteropathogens were found in all samples. By ELISA, a genotype 2 seroprevalence of 93.2% (CI 95%: [90.4; 95.3%]) was found from calves and adult cattle. Antibody levels against genotype 2 bovine noroviruses rose in the first 6 months of life and were maintained in adults. Together the results of virus prevalence and seroprevalence studies suggest that bovine norovirus infection occurs early in life and that re-infection with serologically related bovine noroviruses strains could occur in adult cattle as reported for rotaviruses. The antibody rise against genotype 2 bovine noroviruses in the adult cattle also suggests a short lived and/or strain specific immunity as already shown in human noroviruses. Genotype 2 bovine noroviruses are endemic in the region investigated.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.0084721,-0.012869225,0.077487183,-0.076962089,0.072691882,0.00477011,0.019591354,-0.022834171,-0.009375895,-0.056280283,0.016407489,0.10779255,-0.026918569,-0.020585236,0.020359009,-0.01693592,-0.036128137,0.007719123,0.052917497,-0.029265902,0.036995321,0.061929829,-0.04462799,0.091885641,0.038320331,-0.047295358,0.03320752,-0.167222183,0.049067925,-0.01866219
Genetic characterization of a new astrovirus detected in dogs suffering from diarrhoea,"Abstract Astroviruses have been described in several animals species frequently associated with diarrhoea, especially in young animals. In dogs, astrovirus-like particles have been observed sporadically and very little is known about their epidemiology and characteristics. In this paper, we describe the detection of astrovirus-like particles in symptomatic puppies. Furthermore, for the first time in this species, the presumptive identification made by electron microscopy was confirmed by genetic analysis of the viral RNA conducted directly on the clinical specimens. Genetic sequences of ORF2 (2443 nt), encoding for the capsid protein, and partial sequence of ORF1b (346 nt), encoding for the viral polymerase, identified the viruses as member of the family Astroviridae. The phylogenetic analysis clearly clustered canine astroviruses in the genus Mamastrovirus. Relative closest similarities were revealed with a cluster comprising human, porcine and feline astroviruses, based on the ORF2 sequences available. Based on the species definition for astroviruses and on the data obtained in this study, we suggest a new species of astrovirus – canine astrovirus, CaAstV – to be included in the genus Mamastrovirus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.070783403,-0.019237116,0.029905802,-0.056763454,0.149528608,0.028508996,0.072081841,0.027200911,-0.051522948,-0.023844331,-0.012508996,-0.017986461,0.025204283,-0.075139678,0.038943395,-0.057522416,-0.006343535,-0.000876749,0.008112656,-0.008559218,0.088144498,0.061590316,-0.100155202,0.009285114,0.008490032,-0.073091092,-0.005933203,-0.01931359,-0.032123239,0.048998075
"Bid cleavage, cytochrome c release and caspase activation in canine coronavirus-induced apoptosis","Abstract A previous study demonstrated that infection of a canine fibrosarcoma cell line (A-72 cells) by canine coronavirus (CCoV) resulted in apoptosis (Ruggieri et al., 2007). In this study, we investigated the cell death processes during infection and the underlying mechanisms. We found that CCoV-II triggers apoptosis in A-72 cells by activating initiator (caspase-8 and -9) and executioner (caspase-3 and -6) caspases. The proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) confirmed the activation of executioner caspases. Furthermore, CCoV-II infection resulted in truncated bid (tbid) translocation from the cytosolic to the mitochondrial fraction, the cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and alterations in the pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins of bcl-2 family. Our data indicated that, in this experimental model, both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways are involved.

RNA interference inhibits hepatitis E virus mRNA accumulation and protein synthesis in vitro,"Abstract Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a zoonotic pathogen to which several species, including human beings, pigs and rodents, are reported to be susceptible. To date, vaccines developed against HEV still need to be improved and a structural gene (ORF2), which encodes a capsid protein with high sequence conservation found across HEV genotypes, is a potential candidate. To exploit the possibility of using RNA interference (RNAi) as a strategy against HEV infection, four small interference RNA (siRNA) duplex targeting ORF2 gene were constructed. A challenge against HEV infection by RNAi was performed in A549 cells. Real-Time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Real-Time qPCR) and Western blot assay demonstrated that four HEV specific siRNAs (si-ORF2-1, si-ORF2-2, si-ORF2-3 and si-ORF2-4) were capable of protecting cells against HEV infection with very high specificity and efficiency. The results suggest that RNAi is a potent anti-HEV infection prophylaxis strategy.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.077112447,-0.010056467,0.026235077,-0.03459929,-0.025372439,0.015232144,0.017375302,-0.005347991,0.034114885,-0.025547315,-0.026377654,0.000968523,-0.009771148,-0.0013135,0.01533741,-0.037929335,-0.008204974,0.028951828,0.043950069,-0.002921107,0.044842448,0.009446429,-0.006070348,-0.01976459,-0.030068975,0.034141306,0.008050807,-0.006785946,0.029925864,-0.00163743
Molecular characterization and pathogenicity of a genogroup GVI feline norovirus,"Abstract Norovirus (NoV) has been classified into 6 genogroups, GI-GVI. In the present study, we identified novel feline NoV (FNoV) M49-1 strain. The C-terminal of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the FNoV M49-1 strain was highly homologous with GIV FNoV and GIV lion norovirus, whereas VP1 was highly homologous with GVI canine NoV (CNoV). Based on the results of the Simplot analysis, the FNoV M49-1 strain may have been produced by recombination between GIV.2 FNoV and GVI.1 CNoV. In addition, specific pathogen-free cats inoculated with FNoV gene-positive-fecal samples developed diarrhea symptoms, and the viral gene was detected in their feces and blood.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.08605987,-0.013711167,0.05539677,-0.083546155,0.077330991,-0.001409158,-0.007438913,0.006451203,-0.03534367,-0.031589657,0.145230952,0.027681704,0.01293143,-0.059546361,0.015201232,-0.065731508,-0.026085217,0.000991835,0.034682359,0.025280331,0.087619071,0.041684869,-0.050305283,0.0461402,0.059902202,-0.04417178,-0.002545653,0.007439187,-0.008793779,0.06335252
Genetic characteristics of canine bocaviruses in Korean dogs,"Abstract To survey for canine bocavirus (CBoV) infection, 83 Korean dogs showing several clinical signs were collected in different provinces from January 2013 to July 2014. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization, CBoVs were detected in intestine and/or lung samples of 8 dogs (9.6%). To reveal the genetic characteristics of CBoVs, partial or complete regions of CBoVs were sequenced. In phylogenetic trees, 8 CBoVs fell into three clusters. The CBoV strains 13D226-1, 13D250, and 14Q216 were closely related to the CBoV HK831F strain, and the CBoV 14D142 strain was related to the CBoV HK882F strain. Lastly, CBoV 13D003, 13D095, 14D193, and 14Q209 strains were related to CBoV Dis-023, Dis-040, and Dis-046 strains. Interestingly, no canine pathogens were found in dogs in which four CBoVs (13D003, 13D0095, 14D142, and 14D193 strains) were detected and three of them (13D003, 13D095, and 14D193 strains) had a unique deletion (18 nucleotides) in the VP2 gene. Further, the open reading frame 4 (ORF4) region was absent in these 4CBoVs, but found in the other strains, which indicates that the absence of the ORF4 region rather than a unique deletion may have an influence on the pathogenesis of CBoV in dogs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.040604627,-0.011323211,0.070949249,-0.127702536,0.184429084,0.037947675,-0.045613842,-0.008964259,0.001596389,0.009657581,0.029509217,0.072304249,-0.018812797,-0.063872759,0.060230251,-0.079089201,-0.044030631,-0.002663223,0.061124585,0.00341059,0.195759116,0.080579177,-0.063974353,0.049787919,0.150924126,-0.116630343,-0.066608042,-0.0124997,-0.048659013,0.118794251
The nucleoside analog GS-441524 strongly inhibits feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus in tissue culture and experimental cat infection studies,"Abstract Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a common and highly lethal coronavirus disease of domestic cats. Recent studies of diseases caused by several RNA viruses in people and other species indicate that antiviral therapy may be effective against FIP in cats. The small molecule nucleoside analog GS-441524 is a molecular precursor to a pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate molecule. These analogs act as an alternative substrate and RNA-chain terminator of viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase. We determined that GS-441524 was non-toxic in feline cells at concentrations as high as 100 uM and effectively inhibited FIPV replication in cultured CRFK cells and in naturally infected feline peritoneal macrophages at concentrations as low as 1 uM. We determined the pharmacokinetics of GS-441524 in cats in vivo and established a dosage that would sustain effective blood levels for 24 h. In an experimental FIPV infection of cats, GS-441524 treatment caused a rapid reversal of disease signs and return to normality with as little as two weeks of treatment in 10/10 cats and with no apparent toxicity.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.10096032,-0.015747702,0.018064486,-0.102167347,-0.054146762,0.036517133,0.089007238,0.005334574,-0.029233354,-0.103198062,0.405006709,-0.129811214,0.204677072,-0.011609185,-0.088835324,-0.027677498,-0.002716638,0.083907677,0.073047623,0.091814764,-0.032215339,-0.029024937,0.056613988,0.040960724,-0.033648624,0.008777998,-0.000988761,0.044156032,0.021828066,-0.014970417
Longitudinal surveillance of rotavirus A genotypes circulating in a high milk yield dairy cattle herd after the introduction of a rotavirus vaccine,"Abstract Worldwide, neonatal diarrhea is one of the most important health issues affecting dairy calves, and rotavirus A (RVA) is one of its primary causes. Among the measures to mitigate the risk of diarrhea outbreaks, cow vaccination stands out as one of the most important. However, the immune pressure resulting from routine vaccination may be able to select specific G and P genotypes in RVA field strains. This study aimed to determine the frequency and intensity of neonatal diarrhea and the incidence of RVA and attempted to monitor the G and P genotypes present in the RVA strains circulating in a high milk yield cattle herd vaccinated with RVA G6P[5] strain. Fecal samples (n = 1220) from 122 Holstein heifer calves between 0–30 days old that were born from RVA-vaccinated cows were collected at 10 different time points, regardless of the presence or absence of diarrhea. The presence of RVA in fecal samples was determined by the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) technique and confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). G and P amplicons from 10 RVA-positive fecal samples from calves of different ages and collections were subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The proportion of the calves and fecal samples that were positive for RVA were 62.3% (76/122) and 8.1% (99/1220), respectively. Using sequence analysis, all 10 RVA field strains presented genotype G10P[11]. The protection of G6P[5] vaccination is clear, as this genotype was not detected in this study, and it is known that vaccination against RVA reduces the incidence of diarrhea independent of genotype involved. This result demonstrates the importance of epidemiological monitoring of RVA genotypes circulating in vaccinated dairy cattle herds to the early detection of new potential pathogenic RVA strains.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.008594605,9.18E-05,0.075758529,-0.100241922,0.056629303,0.036381654,0.002097943,-0.014233614,-0.006651847,-0.015739659,0.030350016,0.077612485,-0.065777825,-0.0145868,0.067547279,-0.021876428,-0.022334255,0.006061707,0.005656986,-0.025015561,0.001425217,0.012143257,-0.039348892,0.018844722,0.040147237,-0.048531722,-0.012080935,-0.045340416,0.018721981,0.005436581
Limited adaptation of chimeric H9N2 viruses containing internal genes from bat influenza viruses in chickens,"Abstract Influenza virus-like sequences of H17N10 and H18N11 were identified in bats, despite there has been no live virus isolated. The genetic analysis indicated that they have distinct but relatively close evolutionary relationships to known influenza A viruses. However, the infectivity and adaptation of bat influenza viruses in avian species remain unclear. In this study, two modified bat influenza viruses cH9cN2/H17 and cH9cN2/H18 containing HA and NA coding regions replaced with those of H9N2 influenza A virus were generated in the background of the H17N10 or H18N11 viruses. These two modified viruses replicated less efficiently than wild type H9N2 virus in cultured chicken cells. The mini-genome assay showed that viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) of H9N2 has significantly higher polymerase activity than that of bat influenza viruses in avian cells. In chicken study, compared with H9N2 virus, which replicated and transmitted efficiently in chickens, the cH9cN2/H17 and cH9cN2/H18 viruses only replicated in chicken tracheas with lower titers. Pathological examination showed that the H9N2 caused severer lesions in lung and trachea than the modified bat influenza viruses. Notably, the cH9cN2/H18 transmitted among chickens, but not cH9cN2/H17, and chicken IFN-β antagonism results showed that H18N11 NS1 protein inhibited chicken IFN-β response more efficiently than H17N10 NS1 protein in avian cells. Taken together, our data indicated that the internal genes of bat influenza viruses adapted poorly to chickens, while the internal genes of H18N11 seemed to adapt to chickens better than H17N10.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.014677468,-0.079191049,-0.027060914,0.116399242,0.142814283,0.30027774,0.004216108,-0.002685084,-0.054371608,-0.022942601,-0.054735628,-0.097009421,-0.016904094,0.092868836,-0.030402824,0.041626243,0.017623119,-0.044018355,0.022127082,0.029053041,0.019014575,-0.006638166,0.031985968,0.026513372,-0.03716548,0.032281615,-0.016250117,-0.000127219,-0.037026598,-0.032358393
Detection of feline coronaviruses by culture and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of blood samples from healthy cats and cats with clinical feline infectious peritonitis,"Abstract A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for the detection of the feline coronavirus (FCoV) genome and a co-cultivation method for the isolation of field strains of FCoV are described. Using the RT-PCR assay to assess blood samples from cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) (n=47) and healthy cats from households with endemic FCoV (n=69) it was shown that approximately 80% of the cats were viraemic, irrespective of their health status. It was also shown that, over a 12-month period, a similar percentage of healthy cats remained viraemic, and that the presence of viraemia did not appear to predispose the cats to the development of FIP. The co-cultivation system proved to be a suitable method for the culture of field strains of FCoV from blood samples, so long as the cultures were maintained for at least 4 weeks. Using this system, followed by the RT-PCR, viraemia was detected as frequently as by RT-PCR on RNA extracted directly from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.006752705,0.068473866,0.221835497,-0.115880193,0.039186909,-0.022672496,0.006770295,-0.021681231,-0.064042444,-0.180954698,0.484562945,-0.151309995,0.225727311,0.030663636,-0.139582565,-0.058152545,0.088369117,0.013574064,-0.000328262,0.061372702,-0.029738588,0.015966719,0.053074325,0.077951535,-0.016293772,0.051580412,0.044749846,0.025907778,0.048443576,-0.002063428
Detection and genotyping of bovine diarrhea virus by reverse transcription-polymerase chain amplification of the 5′ untranslated region,"Abstract A reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was developed to differentiate the bovine diarrhea virus (BVDV) from other pestiviruses, and to determine the genotype of the BVDV isolates. For this purpose, primer pairs were selected in the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR). The primers BE and B2 were located in highly conserved regions and were pestivirus-specific. Two primer pairs named B3B4 and B5B6 were specific of BVDV genotypes I and II, respectively. With this technique, an amplification product of the expected size was obtained with either the B3B4 or the B5B6 primer pairs for the 107 BVDV isolates tested but not for BDV or CSFV. For some isolates that were grouped in the genotype II, sequence analysis of the PCR fragments confirmed their classification into this genotype.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.046477346,0.020126583,0.124510452,-0.056499876,0.055950565,-0.001935808,-0.052945019,-0.025369056,-0.000735931,-0.018805133,0.005761979,0.07592419,-0.029216034,-0.004701029,0.021591346,-0.015732688,0.010115505,0.029611788,-0.030403297,-0.072280804,0.008700055,0.010763076,0.003589328,0.042177757,0.008860825,-0.030720967,0.011349358,-0.022223073,0.039283662,0.034227887
Immunomodulatory and anti-SARS activities of Houttuynia cordata,"Abstract Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a life-threatening form of pneumonia caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). From late 2002 to mid 2003, it infected more than 8000 people worldwide, of which a majority of cases were found in China. Owing to the absence of definitive therapeutic Western medicines, Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (Saururaceae) (HC) was shortlisted by Chinese scientists to tackle SARS problem as it is conventionally used to treat pneumonia. Aim of the study The present study aimed to explore the SARS-preventing mechanisms of HC in the immunological and anti-viral aspects. Results Results showed that HC water extract could stimulate the proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes significantly and dose-dependently. By flow cytometry, it was revealed that HC increased the proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Moreover, it caused a significant increase in the secretion of IL-2 and IL-10 by mouse splenic lymphocytes. In the anti-viral aspect, HC exhibited significant inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). On the other hand, oral acute toxicity test demonstrated that HC was non-toxic to laboratory animals following oral administration at 16g/kg. Conclusion The results of this study provided scientific data to support the efficient and safe use of HC to combat SARS.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.029116518,0.227494476,-0.156034621,-0.036565635,-0.073383933,0.021158842,-0.018791226,-0.177820226,-0.051529436,-0.014692543,-0.004209212,-0.001907895,-0.008395447,-0.019981673,0.010522653,0.028621988,-0.034344942,0.007263703,0.018697852,0.001762208,0.003939187,0.004134777,0.021451348,0.00700855,-0.000531654,0.005797943,0.005420137,0.026931602,0.011629069,-0.021615284
Water extract of licorice had anti-viral activity against human respiratory syncytial virus in human respiratory tract cell lines,"Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch., Leguminosae) has been used in herbal medicine and food supplement worldwide for centuries. Licorice is a common ingredient of several prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine which have been proved to inhibit infection of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). There are two preparations of licorice, Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata. However, it is unknown whether licorice or which preparation of licorice is effective against HRSV, nor is its active constituent. Aim of the study We tested the hypothesis that Radix Glycyrrhizae can effectively decrease HRSV-induced plaque formation in respiratory mucosal cell lines. We also tried to find out the active constituent. Materials and methods Anti-HRSV activities of hot water extracts of preparations of licorice, glycyrrhizin and 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (18β-GA), the active constituents of licorice, were examined by plaque reduction assay in both human upper (HEp-2) and low (A549) respiratory tract cell lines. Abilities of crude licorice to inhibit viral replication and to stimulate IFN-β were evaluated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Results Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata dose-dependently inhibited HRSV-induced plaque formation in both HEp-2 and A549 cell lines (p<0.0001). The effect of Radix Glycyrrhizae was better than that of Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata on HEp-2 cells. However, there was no difference of their anti-HRSV effects on A549 cells. Besides, glycyrrhizin was ineffective at all. Nevertheless, 18β-GA showed a potent anti-HRSV activity. Radix Glycyrrhizae was more effective when given before viral inoculation (p<0.0001) which may be due to its inhibition of viral attachment on (p<0.0001) and penetration (p<0.0001) into the host cells. The anti-HRSV activity of Radix Glycyrrhizae was further confirmed by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. 300μg/ml Radix Glycyrrhizae markedly decreased the viral amounts within the cells and in the suspension. Radix Glycyrrhizae might further stimulate mucosal cells to secrete IFN-β to counteract viral infection. Conclusions Both Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata are effective against HRSV infection on airway epithelial cells. Radix Glycyrrhizae inhibited HRSV mainly by preventing viral attachment, internalization, and by stimulating IFN secretion. 18β-GA may be one of its active constituents.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.032356149,-0.023151101,0.012930721,-0.052898906,-0.067835934,0.028993638,0.041179965,-0.028171157,0.045835908,-0.019672718,-0.00846426,-0.010185489,-0.014287792,0.057019137,0.010128451,0.010081549,0.006906054,0.002992056,0.003331236,-0.011455169,0.017577755,0.002567207,0.00513318,0.002784466,0.014433946,0.023797475,-0.013423635,0.002568918,0.00327273,-0.016666026
"Aqueous extract of Bai-Hu-Tang, a classical Chinese herb formula, prevents excessive immune response and liver injury induced by LPS in rabbits","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Bai-Hu-Tang (BHT) was traditionally used to reduce fever heat and promote generation of body fluids. Aim of the study To investigate the effect and mechanism of BHT in the prevention of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) fever in manners of immune modulation. Materials and methods The model of fever syndrome of Chinese medicine pattern was imitated by LPS injection i.v. in rabbits, and BHT was gavaged. The serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL-6, 10) and immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, and IgM) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were tested by biochemical methods. Liver tissue damage was detected by hematoxylin–eosin (H&E) stain. Subpopulation of T cells was detected by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS). Genes expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) in liver tissue were assayed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Result The results demonstrated that BHT prevented sudden increase of IL-10, TNF-α, ALT and AST, and liver damage induced by LPS. BHT also prevented significant decrease of the percentage of CD8+ T cells since LPS injection. At the same time, BHT did not affect the gene expression of TLR4 and serum concentration of three immunoglobulins, which were increased by LPS, but made gene expression of LBP higher. Conclusion The results of this study indicated that BHT played an important role in immunity protection and anti-injury through preventing immunoinflammatory damage by LPS. The achievement thereby scientifically provided mechanism of BHT in the prevention of febrile disease, and supported its traditional use.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.034640024,-0.004066145,0.04268593,-0.140022276,-0.091172062,0.038861669,0.006723938,-0.042626311,0.051413006,-0.057878054,-0.058256258,-0.033909543,-0.034036329,0.099968038,-0.038539255,0.008084953,0.004510271,-0.047323288,-0.008305823,-0.075162467,0.053466565,-0.047771633,0.047108543,-0.014530089,-0.058988901,0.014739422,0.036763975,0.024196013,0.034632056,-0.058056358
Reporting effectiveness of an extract of three traditional Cretan herbs on upper respiratory tract infection: Results from a double-blind randomized controlled trial,"Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Observations from the island of Crete, Greece suggest that infusions of traditional Cretan aromatic plants, well known for their ethnopharmacological use in Eastern Mediterranean region and Near East, could be effective in the prevention and treatment of upper respiratory tract infections, including viral-induced infections. The aim of this study was to report the effectiveness of an essential-oil extract of three Cretan aromatic plants in the treatment of cases with an upper respiratory tract infection. Materials and methods A double blind randomized controlled trial was implemented between October 2013 and February 2014. An essential-oil extract of Cretan aromatic plants in olive oil (total volume of 15ml of essential oil per litre of olive oil) was administered as 0.5ml soft gel capsules, twice a day, for 7 days. Placebo treatment was 0.5ml olive oil in soft gel capsules. Eligible patients were those presenting for clinical examination in the selected setting with signs and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection that had begun within the previous 24hours. Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was used for the detection of respiratory viruses. The primary outcome was the severity and duration of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, assessed using the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory System Survey (WURSS-21) questionnaire. A secondary outcome of interest was the change in C-reactive protein (CRP) status. Results One hundred and five patients completed the study: 51 in the placebo group, and 54 in the intervention (treated) group. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. No statistically significant differences were found in symptom duration or severity between the two groups, although small and clinically favorable effects were observed. When the analysis was restricted to subjects with a laboratory-documented viral infection, the percentage of patients with cessation of symptoms after 6 days of treatment was 91% in the intervention group and 70% in the control group (p=0.089). At baseline, one third of the patients in each group had elevated CRP levels. At follow-up, the respective proportions were 0% in the intervention group and 15% in the placebo group (p=0.121). The data were also in a favorable direction when 50% and 80% symptom reduction points were considered for specific virus types. Conclusions Compared with placebo the essential-oil extract of three Cretan aromatic plants provided no detectable statistically significant benefit or harm in the patients with upper respiratory illness, although descriptive differences were identified in favorable direction mainly in the virus-positive population.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.115092977,-0.036739585,-0.062969527,-0.075895145,-0.023563826,-0.019059982,0.001261232,0.034051392,-0.024409238,0.026738162,-0.005564349,-0.001808129,-0.001490667,0.041269385,0.000245547,-0.012147459,0.013145043,0.008966264,0.030308387,0.021465409,0.00685162,-0.114888044,-0.066183531,-0.016524798,-0.014802473,-0.000102289,-0.026957524,-0.036633757,0.004951393,-0.022310623
Clinical characteristics and outcome of ICU admitted MERS corona virus infected patients,"Abstract Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a novel respiratory illness firstly reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. It is caused by a new corona virus, called MERS corona virus (MERS-CoV). Most people who have MERS-CoV infection developed severe acute respiratory illness. Aim of the work This work is done to determine the clinical characteristics and the outcome of intensive care unit (ICU) admitted patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection. Patients and methods This study included 32 laboratory confirmed MERS corona virus infected patients who were admitted into ICU. It included 20 (62.50%) males and 12 (37.50%) females. The mean age was 43.99±13.03years. Diagnosis was done by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test for corona virus on throat swab, sputum, tracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. Clinical characteristics, co-morbidities and outcome were reported for all subjects. Results The main symptoms among the included patients were: fever (96.87%), cough (93.75%), dyspnea (90.62%), sore throat (75%), runny nose (75%), sputum (50%), headache (43.75%), myalgia (40.62%), chest pain (37.50%), hemoptysis (37.50%), nausea and vomiting (34.37%), abdominal pain (21.87%) and diarrhea (15.62%). The presence of abdominal symptoms is significantly (P <0.05) associated with bad prognosis. Out of the included 32 patients, 18 patients (56.25%) survived and 14 patients (43.75%) expired. There was a statistically significant difference in the duration of symptoms before hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and ICU and total hospital stay between the expired group and survivors (P <0.01). Current smoking and smoking severity were statistically significantly (P <0.01) higher in the expired group compared to survivors. Also, there was a statistically (P <0.05) significant positive correlation between mortality and smoking severity (r =0.640). Most of the expired patients presented with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates or unilateral infiltrates, but most of the survivors presented with normal radiology or increased bronchovascular markings, and this difference in the results was statistically highly significant (P <0.01). There were statistically highly significant (P <0.01) differences in the mean values of APACHE II score (21.11±3.70 vs 24.21±3.82), SOFA score (5.83±2.64 vs 8.85±2.17) and CPIS (7.55±1.14 vs 8.64±1.39) between the expired group and survivors respectively. Also, there was a statistically significant decrease in PH, PaO2, O2 saturation and HCO3 (P <0.05) among the expired group in comparison with the survivors, but no statistical difference regarding PaCO2 (P >0.05). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between mortality and old age (r =0.633), obesity (r =0.712), diabetes mellitus (r =0.685), renal failure (r =0.705), chronic heart diseases (0.591), COPD (r =0.523), malignancy (r =0.692), kidney transplantation (r =0.644) and liver cirrhosis (r =0.525) (P <0.05). There was a statistically (P <0.05) positive correlation between the number of associated co-morbidities and mortality (r =0.735). Conclusions Most MERS corona patients present with fever, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, runny nose and sputum. The presence of abdominal symptoms may indicate bad prognosis. Prolonged duration of symptoms before patients’ hospitalization, prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay, bilateral radiological pulmonary infiltrates, and hypoxemic respiratory failure were found to be strong predictors of mortality in such patients. Also, old age, current smoking, smoking severity, presence of associated co-morbidities like obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic heart diseases, COPD, malignancy, renal failure, renal transplantation and liver cirrhosis are associated with a poor outcome of ICU admitted MERS corona virus infected patients.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.181869015,0.075644636,-0.131028067,-0.128192509,-0.043399394,-0.036042821,-0.07744934,0.245225309,0.017628454,0.014066354,0.001646933,0.021145977,-0.060884164,0.05591656,-0.040746111,-2.68E-05,0.024958856,0.009872016,0.024914587,0.028514358,0.011674836,-0.080312714,-0.029367752,0.018364886,-0.034590758,-0.026218195,-0.006784243,-0.031357694,-0.062006689,0.012759019
Severe acute respiratory syndrome—a global concern—influenza virus isolated from suspected cases in Brazil from April to June 2003,"Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a condition associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Coronavirus has been associated with this severe emerging disease, with a pattern suggesting droplet or contact transmission. From April to June 2003, Institute Adolfo Lutz received 16 respiratory secretions from hospitalized patients with recent history of travel to an area with local transmission of SARS. Rapid antigen detection for influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1, 2 and 3, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus; electron microscopy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription PCR (RT–PCR) and serologic assay were performed. Virus isolation attempts were performed in Hep-2, Vero, MDCK, NCI-H292, MRC-5, LLC-MK2 and FRhK-4.

Seroepidemiological analysis of influenza pandemics in Shizuoka Prefecture and all Japan,"Abstract (1) Seroepidemiological analysis of influenza pandemics (1986–2003) in Shizuoka Prefecture and all Japan revealed differences in geographical, annual, seasonal, and age distributions. (2) For 17 years, the pandemics generally began at the 50th week every year showing over 1.0 patient/clinic, reached the peak at 5th week the following year, and ended over 10–15th week. Two big A/H3N2 pandemics were seen in 1989/1990 and 1997/1998 seasons, claiming over 1 million patients in Japan. (3) As herald strains, A/H3N2 strains (A/Sydney-like) were found in October 1999, and B strains (B/Victoria- and B/Yamagata-like) were detected in July and November 1998 and, in August and December 2000 in Shizuoka. B/Shizuoka/1/98 strain was registered internationally as a vaccine-recommended strain. (4) A/H3N2 and B viruses were detected in 55–78% of flu patients (almost under 10 years) with encephalopathy in 1999/2000 and 78–91% in 2000/2001 by MDCK and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. (5) High hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers over 40 in 250 persons were shown against A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2), A/Yokohama/8/98 (H3N2), A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) and A/Moscow/10/99 (H1N1) strains, while low titers showed against A/Beijing/262/95 (H1N1) and A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1), and B/Beijing/243/97, B/Shangdong/7/97 and B/Yamanashi/106/98 strains in 1998–2000. (6) In anti-HA titers against A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B subtypes, clear generation gaps were observed between children (0–19 years), adults (20–59 years) and old men (over 60 years). (7) The pandemics are dependent on host immunity (acquired and vaccinated) and climatic conditions (low temperature, low humidity and limited rainfall), considering highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses (A/H5N1, A/H7N7) like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus in 2002–2003.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.080850062,-0.015937652,-0.018291112,0.019430576,0.048529217,0.137960902,-0.09314554,-0.046469689,-0.031108135,-0.038640162,0.018643455,0.070440436,-0.032762068,-0.010101524,-0.00575943,0.003098646,-0.02591588,0.023314572,-0.001646143,0.013613959,0.025217034,0.026557497,-0.007828951,0.035544464,-0.016932447,-0.000363096,-0.011829752,0.019739008,-0.019164902,0.060832358
Chapter 5 Clinical Applications of Quantitative Real-Time PCR in Virology,"Abstract Since the invention of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and discovery of Taq polymerase, PCR has become a staple in both research and clinical molecular laboratories. As clinical and diagnostic needs have evolved over the last few decades, demanding greater levels of sensitivity and accuracy, so too has PCR performance. Through optimisation, the present-day uses of real-time PCR and quantitative real-time PCR are enumerable. The technique, combined with adoption of automated processes and reduced sample volume requirements, makes it an ideal method in a broad range of clinical applications, especially in virology. Complementing serologic testing by detecting infections within the pre-seroconversion window period and infections with immunovariant viruses, real-time PCR provides a highly valuable tool for screening, diagnosing, or monitoring diseases, as well as evaluating medical and therapeutic decision points that allows for more timely predictions of therapeutic failures than traditional methods and, lastly, assessing cure rates following targeted therapies. All of these serve vital roles in the continuum of care to enhance patient management. Beyond this, quantitative real-time PCR facilitates advancements in the quality of diagnostics by driving consensus management guidelines following standardisation to improve patient outcomes, pushing for disease eradication with assays offering progressively lower limits of detection, and rapidly meeting medical needs in cases of emerging epidemic crises involving new pathogens that may result in significant health threats.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.091819443,0.085554909,0.171689779,0.040321099,-0.082555334,-0.002340703,0.046527772,0.034600115,0.003269155,0.070310175,-0.022646534,-0.030451032,0.083495444,-0.037944596,0.039672126,-0.017796038,-0.016814095,0.017766636,-0.030952762,-0.138268568,0.025883922,0.006012739,0.019824918,-0.119989632,-0.056454974,-0.015044896,0.060410989,-0.0620407,0.04171623,0.008301679
Clinical disease and viral load in children infected with respiratory syncytial virus or human metapneumovirus,"Abstract The relationship between respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) quantity in respiratory secretions and severity of illness in children remains unclear. We assessed the effect of hMPV and RSV viral load as determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on disease characteristics. Data were abstracted from medical records of 418 children with RSV and 81 children with hMPV; associations were evaluated in multivariate analyses, both continuously and comparing lower versus higher viral loads. Increasing viral load in hMPV-infected children was associated with increases in presence of fever, bronchodilator use, obtaining chest radiograph, and length of hospital stay. Increasing viral load in RSV-infected children was associated with decreases in inpatient admissions, use of antibiotics, and respiratory rate. Our study has described a significant relationship between viral load and markers of disease severity for both RSV and hMPV in a large population of children evaluated for respiratory disease.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.225142749,-0.153232425,-0.110142255,0.079454448,0.014882111,-0.189192855,0.112206262,-0.191186519,0.243150441,-0.08568548,0.04044613,-0.136516409,-0.167604129,-0.052033266,-0.135252743,-0.032566488,-0.080252649,0.206464607,-0.153830898,0.048787247,0.053905437,0.037145605,-0.016249217,-0.097370342,-0.068616299,-0.058041824,0.013818411,-0.106519405,-0.042075399,0.068348338
Performance of diagnostic tests to detect respiratory viruses in older adults,"Abstract The performance of 4 laboratory methods for diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections (RTI) in older adults was evaluated. Seventy-four nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens were obtained from 60 patients with RTI at a long-term care facility over 2 respiratory seasons. Sixteen specimens were positive for a respiratory virus by at least 1 method. Multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) by the Luminex xTAG® Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) detected 16 (100%) of the positive specimens, RVP of 24-h culture supernatant detected 8 (50%), direct fluorescent antibody testing detected 4 (25%), rapid culture detected 2 (12.5%), and rapid antigen testing detected none. For a comparison group, RVP was performed on NP swabs from 20 outpatient children with RTI. The mean fluorescence intensity by RVP was significantly lower for positive adult patients than pediatric patients (P = 0.0373). Our data suggest that older adult patients shed lower titers of viruses, necessitating a highly sensitive assay such as RT-PCR to reliably detect respiratory viral pathogens.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.23718198,-0.005132589,0.030281106,0.040014257,-0.007962312,-0.134102527,-0.012475803,0.026238166,-0.053414202,0.041308754,-0.005189379,-0.006914375,0.015719799,0.10252345,-0.003413342,-0.055413607,0.06715992,0.013727742,0.026759226,-0.012718803,0.034862175,-0.038774016,0.007198507,-0.028454982,-0.005640131,0.034718047,-0.026106436,-0.061810563,-0.025834803,-0.038332169
Simple and rapid detection of human enterovirus 71 by reverse-transcription and loop-mediated isothermal amplification: cryopreservation affected the detection ability,"Abstract Human enterovirus 71 (EV71) is the primary pathogen of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). EV71 infection may lead to neurologic damage, with higher incidence of fatality compared with other HFMD pathogens. An effective drug or vaccine against EV71 infection is currently unavailable. It is desirable to determine the pathogen of HFMD accurately and quickly for early treatment. In the current study, reverse-transcription and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) technology were developed to detect EV71. The efficacy of detecting EV71 was compared with regular nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). After detecting 108 clinical specimens, results showed that RT-LAMP can specifically detect EV71, but not Coxsackie virus A16, and exhibited a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 97.1%, which was higher than regular RT-PCR. The findings indicate that RT-LAMP is a practical method for EV71 diagnostic applications, particularly in small county institutes of medical service. The detection ability of RT-LAMP was significantly affected by cryopreservation as the clinical specimens were repeatedly subject to freezing and thawing treatments.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.036164942,0.068927843,0.206672162,0.036850477,-0.066398171,-0.038632929,0.017851046,-0.012572952,-0.000581346,-0.041236668,-0.018205469,0.033352594,-0.034667893,0.059783366,-0.056685813,0.039777405,0.044435395,0.090891787,-0.128044762,-0.008205982,-0.073835788,-0.032332446,-0.090418018,0.163182796,0.135708889,0.032959241,-0.043394828,0.06570443,0.004356851,-0.045289412
Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction/pyrosequencing to characterize neuraminidase H275 residue of influenza A 2009 H1N1 virus for rapid and specific detection of the viral oseltamivir resistance marker in a clinical laboratory,"Abstract Pandemic 2009 H1N1 is normally susceptible to oseltamivir, but variants harboring the H275Y (CAC → TAC) mutation exhibit resistance. We describe the use of a combined reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/pyrosequencing approach to identify the H275 residue. A total of 223 specimens were tested with this method: 216 randomly selected clinical specimens positive for 2009 H1N1 and 7 cell-culture supernatants from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; 4 resistant, 3 susceptible 2009 H1N1 strains). The assay detected H275Y in 1 clinical respiratory sample (0.5%) and all 4 oseltamivir-resistant strains from the CDC; the remaining 215 clinical and 3 susceptible CDC specimens were wild-type. Sanger sequencing confirmed the results for 50 of 50 selected isolates. The RT-PCR/pyrosequencing method was highly specific, producing no amplicons or valid sequences from samples containing non-H1N1 viruses or bacteria. Our findings suggest that this method provides a rapid tool for H275Y detection, with high sensitivity and potential benefit for patient care.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.070082431,0.031407203,0.146265384,0.054751353,-0.007615156,0.089933403,-0.052612972,0.014154611,-0.036993496,-0.008234524,0.022847037,0.060637429,0.001977054,0.006645017,0.022440217,-0.008013851,-0.011953457,0.033729363,-0.044983414,-0.077749421,0.042473672,0.012140878,-0.019646428,0.00492586,-0.039924539,0.046969555,-0.010292332,0.012433077,-0.005092331,0.042313646
Evaluation of the PrimerDesign™ genesig real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction assay and the INFINITI® Respiratory Viral Panel Plus assay for the detection of human metapneumovirus in Kuwait,"Abstract Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a respiratory pathogen that was discovered in 2001 and is considered a major cause of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections. A sensitive, fast, and high-throughput diagnostic test is needed for the detection of hMPV that may assist in the clinical management as well as in the reduction of inappropriate therapy. Therefore, a comparison assessment was performed in this study between the PrimerDesign™ genesig real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Assay and the INFINITI® Respiratory Viral Panel Plus Assay (RVP-Plus) for the detection of hMPV infection in patients with respiratory tract infections. A total of 200 respiratory samples were collected from 185 hospitalized patients, during the winter season in Kuwait. Of 185 patients, 10 (5.4%) were positive for hMPV RNA by the in-house RT-PCR assay, while 7 (4%) were positive for hMPV RNA by the real-time RT-PCR assay and 9 (5%) were positive for hMPV RNA by the INFINITI® RVP-Plus assay. The high incidence rate (60%) of hMPV infection was in January 2011. The sensitivity of the real-time RT-PCR and INFINITI® RVP-Plus assays was 70% and 90%, respectively, with specificity of 100% for both assays. hMPV types A and B could be identified in this study; however, discordant genotyping results were found between the direct sequencing method and the INFINITI® RVP-Plus assay in 33% of hMPV-positive patients.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.200067548,0.02126205,0.111232919,0.139884746,-0.00080336,-0.21129112,0.007094362,-0.046979851,0.0857679,-0.066204786,0.028945731,-0.023549616,-0.111201917,0.137285662,-0.126277231,-0.077552857,0.054720795,0.259796328,-0.128913898,0.061659696,0.211281898,0.032767934,0.011476167,-0.157176696,-0.118244834,0.021363426,-0.207306795,-0.187788576,0.030535668,-0.068176685
Comparison of FilmArray Respiratory Panel and laboratory-developed real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction assays for respiratory virus detection,"Abstract The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (Idaho Technology) is a highly multiplexed respiratory virus real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Eighty-four respiratory viruses identified by laboratory-developed real-time reverse transcription–PCR assays (LDA) or by viral cultures were mixed and tested by FilmArray to assess its performance. FilmArray identified 72 (90%) of 80 viruses also detected by LDA. Six of the 8 viruses not detected by FilmArray had PCR cycle threshold values >35. Compared to LDA, FilmArray showed comparable sensitivity when used to test serial dilutions of virus mixtures and good agreement with negative samples. With the use of 1 FilmArray instrument, 7 clinical samples could be analyzed and reported in an 8-h shift compared to 20 using LDA and 1 real-time detection instrument. While the FilmArray was rapid and easy to use, its low throughput and qualitative results may be a disadvantage in some clinical settings.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.094544164,0.024505518,0.12183339,0.04965083,-0.009556887,-0.03775589,0.018947114,0.00784146,-0.012080388,0.031874981,-0.003976735,-0.027001103,0.029220505,0.004469606,0.033854442,-0.031931731,0.011426556,-0.046401354,0.050034138,-0.072970384,0.031724495,-0.008960549,0.023023374,-0.051118697,-0.022689488,0.010387137,0.001164914,-0.041801237,0.011149815,-0.029467935
Use of an improved quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay to determine differences in human rhinovirus viral loads in different populations,"Abstract Human rhinoviruses (HRV) frequently cause acute respiratory infections and chronic respiratory disease exacerbations. However, testing is not generally offered. We developed a modified HRV quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay to assess viral loads in the community and hospital patients. The assay had a lower limit of detection of 2 log10 viral copies/mL and displayed linearity over 5 log10 viral copies, with a lower limit of quantitation of 4 log10 viral copies/mL. Mean viral loads (95% confidence interval) for hospitalized children, university students, and institutionalized elderly, were 7.08 log10 viral copies/mL (6.7–7.5), 6.87 log10 viral copies/mL (6.5–7.2), and 7.09 log10 viral copies/mL (6.9–7.3), respectively (P = 0.67). Serial specimens of 14 university students showed a decrease of mean viral loads from 6.36 log10 viral copies/mL on day 1 to 2.32 log10 viral copies/mL 7 days past symptom onset (P < 0.001). Using an HRV qPCR, we showed that viral loads did not differ between the community and hospitalized populations and significantly decreased following symptoms onset in healthy individuals.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.068477626,-0.031180708,0.009087947,-0.018674051,-0.053816571,-0.059127822,0.044266674,-0.019370747,-0.004083408,-0.00638356,-0.00963816,-0.018608147,-0.047799423,0.025241888,0.008251862,-0.00821628,-0.01960783,-0.022534489,0.038889008,0.0013295,-0.039640872,-0.009309739,-0.060733772,0.070926998,-0.089222174,0.053607957,-0.020949708,-0.05138447,0.025891469,0.147587827
Viral detection using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction–based assay in outpatients with upper respiratory infection,"Abstract We evaluated a commercial multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in a cross-sectional study among 81 adult and pediatric outpatients—40 cases with upper respiratory infection symptoms and 41 asymptomatic controls—from February to April 2008. Two specimens (throat swab and nasal swab) from each participant were tested using the EraGen MultiCode-PLx Respiratory Virus Panel that detects 17 viral targets. Throat swabs were also tested for Group A Streptococcus (GAS) by PCR. Respiratory viruses were detected in 22/40 (55%) cases and in 3/41 (7%) controls (P < 0.001). GAS was detected in 10 (25%) cases; GAS and respiratory virus co-infection was found in 4 (10%). Agreement between nasal and throat swabs for viral detection was 69% in cases and 95% in controls. Of 22 cases with a detectable virus, 12 (54%) were picked up by only 1 (throat or nasal) specimen, and the detection rate was increased by combining results of nasal and throat swab testing.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.179590945,-0.023907854,-0.001943488,0.0053031,0.009782942,-0.048495259,-0.014622242,0.02070338,-0.021904578,-0.006190737,0.027621015,-0.012644533,-0.029350274,-0.001787945,0.031608335,-0.009399094,-0.00743215,-0.06908083,0.088982791,-0.06532165,-0.049894713,0.019082438,-0.032887941,-0.040682776,0.027501627,0.086419913,0.024962555,0.02256027,-0.026125772,-0.101163293
"A new factor influencing pathogen detection by molecular assay in children with both mild and severe hand, foot, and mouth disease","Abstract This study aimed to find novel information concerning pathogen detection and some probable coinfection factors in hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). In this study, 1104 clinically diagnosed HFMD patients were included. Enterovirus 71 (EV71), coxsackievirus A16 (CA16), and 14 different respiratory pathogens were examined from nasopharyngeal swabs using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). To evaluate the immune activation in HFMD patients, 8 cytokines and IgM antibodies to EV71 and CA16 from mild and severe patients were detected. Our results indicated that the severity of HFMD may affect the pathogen detection. The lower positive rates of enterovirus and respiratory viruses in severe HFMD cases by RT-PCR were probably related to stronger immune response. Therefore, immunological tests such as ELISA are essential supplements to PCR or RT-PCR in order to increase pathogen diagnosis in HFMD, especially in severe cases.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.120494446,0.041448053,0.076885176,-0.027075156,-0.030761843,-0.041986835,-0.005823,0.024080144,-0.059033332,0.029508797,0.002972784,2.00E-05,-0.000626298,0.076299621,-0.003500071,-0.021187912,0.048050992,0.017423521,-0.047300847,-0.073595563,0.024812351,0.018303379,-0.032708571,0.000590367,0.027517078,0.031137275,0.035278475,-2.61E-05,0.029524009,-0.055088356
Molecular detection of gastrointestinal viral infections in hospitalized patients,"Abstract Gastrointestinal viral syndromes are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide. Etiological agents include a large number of viruses encompassing several orders, families, and genera. During the period April 2011 to April 2012, 689 stool samples from as many patients hospitalized at the Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo of Pavia exhibiting gastrointestinal syndromes were examined for the presence of rotavirus, norovirus, astrovirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, sapovirus, cosavirus, and aichi virus using polymerase chain reaction assays. Gastrointestinal viral agents were detected in 246 (36%) patients of the 689 analyzed. Adenovirus and norovirus were the most common viruses in this cohort, while aichi virus was the only gastrointestinal agent not detected.

Performance of a rapid multi-analyte 2-photon excitation assay in children with acute respiratory infection,"Abstract The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the novel 2-photon excitation-based mariPOC© Assay (ArcDia Laboratories, Turku, Finland) for antigen detection of respiratory viruses versus real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The mariPOC Assay and 2 multiplex real-time PCR techniques were performed on nasopharyngeal samples from pediatric patients with suspicion of acute respiratory infection admitted to a children's hospital in Spain during October 2011 to January 2013. A total of 233 samples were studied. Sensitivities and specificities (95% confidence interval) of the mariPOC Assay were for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 78.4% (69.7–85.6) and 99.2% (96.3–100.0); influenza virus (IFV) A, 66.7% (26.2–94.0) and 99.6% (97.9–100.0); IFV-B, 63.6% (33.6–87.2) and 100.0% (98.7–100.0); human metapneumovirus (hMPV), 60.0% (34.5–81.9) and 100.0% (98.6–100.0); adenovirus (ADV), 12.5% (0.6–48.0) and 100.0% (98.7–100.0), respectively.

Development of a pan-serotype reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for the detection of dengue virus,"Abstract During dengue outbreaks, acute diagnosis at the patient's point of need followed by appropriate supportive therapy reduces morbidity and mortality. To facilitate needed diagnosis, we developed and optimized a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay that detects all 4 serotypes of dengue virus (DENV). We used a quencher to reduce nonspecific amplification. The assay does not require expensive thermocyclers, utilizing a simple water bath to maintain the reaction at 63°C. Results can be visualized using UV fluorescence, handheld readers, or lateral flow immunochromatographic tests. We report a sensitivity of 86.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 72.7–94.8%) and specificity of 93.0% (95% CI, 83.0–98.1%) using a panel of clinical specimens characterized by DENV quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction.

The clinical impact of the detection of potential etiologic pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia,"Abstract The etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is determined in less than half of the patients based on cultures of sputum and blood plus testing urine for the antigens of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. This study added nasal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) probes for S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and respiratory viruses. Serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels were measured. Pathogens were identified in 78% of the patients. For detection of viruses, patients were randomized to either a 5-virus laboratory-generated PCR bundle or the 17-virus FilmArray PCR platform. The FilmArray PCR platform detected more viruses than the laboratory-generated bundle and did so in less than 2hours.

Detection of respiratory pathogens in pediatric acute otitis media by PCR and comparison of findings in the middle ear and nasopharynx,"Abstract We conducted a series of polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) in order to detect bacteria (7 species) and viruses (17 species) in middle ear fluid (MEF) and nasopharynx (Nph) of children with acute otitis media (AOM; n=179). Bacterial and viral nucleic acids were detected in MEF of 78.8% and 14.5% patients, respectively. The prevalence was as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 70.4%; Haemophilus influenzae, 17.9%; Staphylococcus aureus, 16.8%; Streptococcus pyogenes, 12.3%; Moraxella catarrhalis, 9.5%; rhinovirus, 9.5%; and adenovirus, 3.4%. The overall rate of PCR-positive specimens for bacterial pathogens was 2.6 times higher, compared to culture results. The rate of PCR-positive results and the distribution of pathogens in the Nph were similar to those in the MEF. Nph PCR results had variable positive predictive values and high negative predictive values in predicting MEF findings. Our results indicate that Nph PCR could be a practical tool for examining respiratory pathogens in children with acute infections.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.136193028,-0.034869716,0.018000119,-0.04243375,0.026446427,-0.079337498,0.05135809,0.008552262,-0.072802595,0.058977854,-0.011605261,-0.042698319,0.003703088,-0.02706151,0.017369653,-0.033489868,0.003749599,-0.055724377,0.013481966,-0.100217044,-0.038261256,0.111172092,0.112613904,-0.011967793,0.008133155,0.055956331,-0.003605256,-0.008586011,0.082610305,-0.026455537
Partial comparison of the NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel Assay with the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Panel Fast Assay V2 and singleplex real-time polymerase chain reaction for detection of respiratory pathogens,"Abstract In this study, 185 nasopharyngeal swabs were tested to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the Luminex NxTAG (NxTAG) Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP) Assay with those of the Luminex Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) Fast Assay v2 and singleplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The NxTAG Assay identified at least one infectious agent in 164 (88.7%) of the swabs. In 91 (6.2%) tests with negative results with the RVP Fast Assay v2, a virus was identified by the NxTAG (P < 0.001). With the NxTAG Assay, the detection rates were significantly higher for respiratory syncytial virus (P = 0.003), human metapneumovirus (P < 0.001), human rhinovirus/human enterovirus (P = 0.009) and human adenovirus (P < 0.001). Finally, the NxTAG Assay identified M. pneumoniae in 32 of 44 (72.7%) PCR-positive samples. However, the concordance with real-time PCR results was low for both assays. In conclusion, the results indicate that the NxTAG Assay overcomes some of the limitations of previous Luminex assays, although further studies are needed for a more complete evaluation of the new assay.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.137394163,0.039788013,0.153493347,0.080259512,-0.00359258,-0.069484345,0.024822027,-0.015274107,0.012104536,-0.007319959,-0.022140687,-0.016801966,-0.01614766,0.046288193,0.014618531,-0.057715799,0.049661657,-0.034970077,0.086689147,-0.041236833,0.076820195,-0.005324537,0.082932243,-0.027092983,-0.043367777,0.066837463,0.006412512,-0.0028776,0.006204262,-0.089814785
Clinical validation of 3 commercial real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays for the detection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus from upper respiratory tract specimens,"Abstract Since discovery of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a novel betacoronavirus first isolated and characterized in 2012, MERS-CoV real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays represent one of the most rapidly expanding commercial tests. However, in the absence of extensive evaluations of these assays on positive clinical material of different sources, evaluating their diagnostic effectiveness remains challenging. We describe the diagnostic performance evaluation of 3 common commercial MERS-CoV rRT-PCR assays on a large panel (n = 234) of upper respiratory tract specimens collected during an outbreak episode in Saudi Arabia. Assays were compared to the RealStar® MERS-CoV RT-PCR (Alton Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany) assay as the gold standard. Results showed i) the TIB MolBiol® LightMix UpE and Orf1a assays (TIB MolBiol, Berlin, Germany) to be the most sensitive, followed by ii) the Anyplex™ Seegene MERS-CoV assay (Seegene, Seoul, Korea), and finally iii) the PrimerDesign™ Genesig® HCoV_2012 assay (PrimerDesign, England, United Kingdom).

Comparison of Cepheid® Xpert Flu and Roche RealTime Ready Influenza A/H1N1 Detection Set for detection of influenza A/H1N1,"Abstract Objective To compare two influenza polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. Methods A total of 749 suspected MERS-CoV patients presenting at Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare, Saudi Arabia, each submitted a clinical sample for influenza A reflex testing using the on-site Cepheid® Xpert Flu assay and at the Ministry of Health laboratory by the Roche PCR assay. Results There was 92.12% overall agreement between the two methods. Specificity of the Cepheid® Xpert Flu was 95.8% for H1N1 and 94.4% for total influenza A. Cepheid® Xpert Flu sensitivity for influenza A was 100% for younger patients (0–19-year age group) but significantly lower both for older patients (68.2% for 60–79-year and 50% for ≥80-year age groups) and overall for males compared to females (72.6% and 94.0%, respectively). Conclusions Specificity of the Cepheid® Xpert Flu test was high; however, sensitivity for total influenza A was lower particularly in males and older patients.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.200146872,0.023758096,-0.008336678,0.066837231,-0.045963227,0.150296346,-0.159814405,0.135501959,-0.060622796,-0.109131373,-0.002078953,0.050102734,-0.040626482,0.020236451,-0.075479643,0.018662924,0.025802727,-0.005787292,0.012891189,-0.041554181,-0.000610166,-0.048797153,0.048859646,-0.016099161,-0.02872315,-0.008071487,-0.027134715,-0.043459668,-0.03289428,0.059243817
Comparison of FTD® respiratory pathogens 33 and a singleplex CDC assay for the detection of respiratory viruses: A study from Cameroon,"Abstract Introduction: This study compares the detection of 14 common respiratory viruses by two different real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) methods: in house singleplex tests developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the commercially available Fast Track Diagnostic (FTD®) Respiratory Pathogens 33 multiplex test. Methods: A total of 217 nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed using CDC singleplex rRT-PCR and FTD® Respiratory Pathogens 33 multiplex assays, for the detection of 14 respiratory viruses. Results: The results showed that 179/217 (82.5%) samples were positive with the singleplex method and 183/217 (84.3%) with the FTD® Respiratory Pathogens 33 multiplex test. Excellent or satisfactory agreement was obtained for all viruses (k > 0.6) except Parainfluenzavirus 4 (k = 0.24) and influenza B (k = 0.51). Conclusion: Although the multiplex FTD kits were more expensive than the singleplex assay, the FTD kits yielded rapid results in a shorter timeframe, increasing efficiency of diagnosis.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.172894218,0.009730695,0.10383416,0.09705006,0.003229485,-0.024456922,-0.007093016,0.02421397,0.000331922,0.051334739,-0.009234631,-0.030475349,0.042643771,-0.011297919,0.057825593,-0.048607811,0.033160146,-0.074619305,0.043915291,-0.079942697,0.018091835,-0.04202918,0.049341566,-0.076170742,0.007300859,0.000212235,-0.039941925,-0.022862764,0.014198264,-0.091920684
Equine Coronavirus-Associated Colitis in Horses: A Retrospective Study,"Abstract Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is a known cause of fever, anorexia, and lethargy in adult horses. Although there are multiple reports of ECoV outbreaks, less is known about the clinical presentation of individual horses during a nonoutbreak situation. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical presentation of horses diagnosed with ECoV infection that were not associated with an outbreak. Medical records of all horses admitted to Washington State University, Veterinary Teaching Hospital, during an 8-year period were reviewed (2010–2018). The five horses included in this study were older than 1 year of age, were diagnosed with colitis, tested positive for ECoV using real-time polymerase chain reaction, and were negative to other enteric pathogens. Interestingly, 4 of 5 horses had moderate to severe diarrhea, 3 had abnormal large colon ultrasonography, 2 had transient ventricular tachycardia and 2 had clinicopathologic evidence of liver dysfunction. ECoV should be included as a differential diagnosis for individual horses presenting with anorexia, fever, lethargy, and colitis. Early identification of ECoV cases is key to implement appropriate biosecurity measures to prevent the potential spread of this disease.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.028674154,0.000725859,0.009957019,-0.08210234,-0.018443919,0.015544852,0.013973536,0.026720752,-0.008175302,-0.02377381,0.013793149,0.031146461,-0.010585945,-0.034368024,0.028916912,0.003979226,-0.002570511,0.026513022,-0.031196255,-0.020765054,0.009422685,0.010344758,-0.069034909,-0.03303097,0.023609307,0.001731046,-0.029292086,0.016657611,0.013891963,-0.029166654
Sequence and analysis of bovine enteritic coronavirus (F15) genome I.—Sequence of the gene coding for the nucleocapsid protein; analysis of the predicted protein,"Summary Sequences encoding the N protein of the bovine enteritic coronavirus-F15 strain (BECV-F15) have been cloned in PBR322 plasmid using cDNA produced by priming with oligo-dT on purified viral genomic RNA. Some 265 insert-containing clones were studied. Hybridization of these inserts with poly(A)+ RNA extracted from infected cells led to the conclusion that they were located at the 3′-end of the genome. After subcloning in M13 phage DNA, clones were sequenced by the Sanger technique. A 1,710-nucleotide sequence corresponding to the gene coding for the viral N-protein was established. It shows 2 overlapping open reading frames (ORF). The 3′-non-coding end of the gene has an 8-nucleotide sequence in common with the homologous genome areas of MHV, TGE and IBV viruses. This sequence may represent the polymerase RNA binding site. An upstream sequence surrounding the first AUG of the smaller ORF corresponds to a potentially functional initiation codon. The sequence of the primary translation product deduced from the DNA sequence predicts a polypeptide of 207 amino acids (22.9 Kd) with a high leucine (19.8%) content, possessing a hydrophobic N-terminal end. The larger ORF has a coding capacity of 448 amino acids (49.4 Kd), corresponding to the N-protein molecular weight. The deduced protein possesses 43 serine residues (9.6% of the total amino acid content) which may be phosporylated and involved in N-protein/RNA binding. N-protein also has 5 regions with a high basic amino acid content. One of them is also serine-rich and has a strong homology site with MHV, TGE and IBV viruses. In the first part of the N-terminal, a 12-amino-acid sequence (PRWYFYYLGTGP) is highly conserved for BECV-F15, JHM, TGE and IBV viruses. BCV Mebus strain and BECV-F15 have only minor differences in their N-protein sequence.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.239109054,-0.078423944,-0.001537399,-0.019215496,0.157610734,-0.087004333,-0.238282329,-0.016727498,0.045032594,0.050057877,-0.11369052,-0.017156887,0.068000667,-0.144041071,-0.101620325,-0.100831449,0.071005864,0.010594284,0.033208451,0.029072416,-0.032829255,-0.018888973,-0.011520876,0.01862495,-0.005653314,0.084018596,0.049813851,-0.062340348,-0.039425667,0.029196271
Immunohistochemical and molecular detection of natural cases of bovine rotavirus and coronavirus infection causing enteritis in dairy calves,"Abstract Bovine rotavirus (BRoV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are major enteric viral pathogens responsible for calve diarrhoea. They are widespread both in dairy and beef cattle throughout the world and causing huge economic losses. The diagnosis of these agents is very difficult due to non-specific nature of lesions and the involvement of some intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors. We performed postmortem of 45 calves, which was below three months of age. Out of 45 necropscid calves, three (6.66%) cases were positive for BRoV and four (8.88%) cases were found positive for BCoV, screened by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Further RT-PCR positive cases were confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in paraffin-embedded intestinal tissue sections. Three cases of enteritis caused by BRoV showed the hallmark lesions of the shortening and fusion of villi, denudation and infiltration of mononuclear cells in the lamina propria. The BRoV antigen distribution was prominent within the lining epithelium of the villi, peyer's patches in the ileum and strong immunoreactions in the lymphocytes and some macrophages of the mesenteric lymph nodes. Four cases in which BCoV was detected, grossly lesions characterized by colonic mucosa covered with thick, fibrinous and diphtheritic membrane. Histopathologically, jejunum showed skipping lesion of micro-abscesses in crypts. The BCoV antigen distribution was prominent within the necrotic crypts in the jejunum and cryptic micro-abscesses in the colon and ileum. It is the first report of BRoV and BCoV antigen demonstration in the jejunum, colon, ileum, Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes of naturally infected calves from India by using IHC.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.013471708,0.014705659,0.0704975,-0.089413797,0.006163501,0.000889386,-0.015925407,-0.001994031,-0.003552383,-0.038715847,0.061819164,0.022554842,-0.032844492,0.014075189,0.065189254,-0.015063803,0.007844409,0.017754156,-0.011757961,-0.038388927,-0.001568935,0.061184312,-0.076309662,-0.027101576,0.061443168,0.024270677,-0.001846871,-0.06547525,0.04208338,-0.04421391
Characteristic features and outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome found in severe acute respiratory syndrome intensive care unit patients,"Abstract Purpose The aim of the study was to identify characteristic clinical features and outcomes of critically ill patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Materials and Methods This retrospective study enrolled all patients admitted to a 12-bed SARS intensive care unit (ICU) in a tertiary care medical center in Taipei between May 15 and July 17, 2003. Patients with positive results of either reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction or antibody to SARS coronavirus were defined as SARS cases and others with negative results as control cases. Results Of the 50 patients, 14 had confirmed SARS. Demographics were similar between the 2 groups. The highest leukocyte and neutrophil counts, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase; positive end-expiratory pressure; and use of corticosteroids, ribavirin, and intravenous immunoglobulin were higher in the SARS group. In contrast, the lowest lymphocyte count and the ratio of Pao 2 to the fraction of inspired oxygen were lower in the SARS group. Of the 15 deaths in the control group, 12 (80%) occurred during the first 2 weeks after ICU admission. However, in the confirmed SARS group, 5 (55.6%) of the 9 deaths occurred within the third or fourth week. This difference in timing between these 2 groups was significant (P = .004). Conclusions In a SARS ICU, patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS had significantly different clinical features and timing of mortality from those of the control group.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.135152687,0.329517673,-0.237429259,-0.110548968,-0.063365462,-0.026393675,-0.12805431,-0.211703761,-0.225398687,-0.007779454,-0.026199625,0.017957211,-0.0201027,0.001058854,-0.011236384,0.033623594,-0.007555703,0.04678574,0.01733341,0.055939041,0.003286509,-0.079523529,-0.058991043,-0.010107397,-0.061588041,-0.050385625,-0.008097397,-0.009758016,-0.058840938,-0.010500669
Genomic analysis of HAdV-B14 isolate from the outbreak of febrile respiratory infection in China,"Abstract Human adenovirus type 14 (HAdV-B14) was first reported in 1955 from the Netherlands and since then had been associated with outbreaks of febrile respiratory illness (FRI). In China, sporadic HAdV-B14 infections were first identified in 2010, in Guangzhou and Beijing. In 2012, an outbreak of FRI occurred in Beijing and the etiological agent was determined to be HAdV-B14. We present a complete HAdV-B14 genome sequence isolated from this recent FRI outbreak. Virus in 30 throat swab samples was detected using polymerase chain reaction assays, and confirmed by sequencing of the fiber, hexon and penton genes. Comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis showed that the newly isolated HAdV-B14 (HAdV-B14 CHN) shared highest sequence homology with a 2006 isolate from the United States and clustered closely with other HAdV-B14 strains. It is expected that data from the present study will help in devising better protocols for virus surveillance, and in developing preventative measures.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.023104769,-0.024687099,-0.00113315,-0.081451689,0.093412322,0.010115784,0.002956355,-0.016710747,0.022301022,-0.006390106,-0.032752019,0.049657994,-0.029530265,-0.085455985,0.052699688,-0.058928082,-0.09694991,0.029904211,-0.030714646,-0.065760977,0.065450387,0.233879816,-0.051176606,0.074155517,-0.127905728,0.126366358,-0.024294393,0.370743397,-0.167914552,0.01329402
VIRUS-INDUCED WHEEZING IN CHILDREN Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Rhinovirus,"The strong association between infantile wheezing and respiratory tract infections caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been well established. In studies of older children, rhinovirus becomes the major virus associated with asthma. These relationships are outlined in the box on page 36. In the past, this relationship was more difficult to appreciate, because rhinovirus does not always grow well in culture. In addition, the linkage between asthma and atopy during childhood has raised the question whether viral infections alone can precipitate exacerbations of asthma. Use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to measure viral nucleic acid material has provided the opportunity to study virus-induced wheezing among children in greater detail, and investigations of experimental rhinovirus infections in adults have demonstrated how this virus can augment both the early and late phase manifestations of airway hyperreactivity. This article reviews recent advances that have enhanced our understanding of virus-induced wheezing, along with new information indicating that interactions between viral infections and allergic inflammation may be critical to the pathogenesis of acute symptoms.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.118283998,-0.110423747,-0.057453732,0.022701963,-0.03206799,-0.066865651,0.102191624,-0.093722021,0.088622667,0.068055088,-0.016265044,-0.100657883,0.001212212,-0.045261225,0.052561166,-0.007228637,0.014811019,-0.045380697,0.013591574,0.007566083,-0.03548302,-0.12932181,-0.043924326,0.058247982,0.006140033,0.071548412,0.000899525,-0.007889128,0.069408851,0.113435544
Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome,Abstract Here we designed and tested two highly specific quantitative TaqMan®-MGB-based reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).

Development of a realtime RT-PCR assay for the rapid detection of influenza A(H2) viruses,"Abstract Influenza and other acute respiratory infections are of great concern for public health, causing excessive morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Influenza virus A(H2N2), which caused a pandemic of so called “Asian flu” in 1957 was expelled from the human population by the new pandemic virus subtype H3N2 in 1968, however, influenza A(H2) viruses continue to circulate in wild birds and poultry. The lack of immunity in human population and the continued circulation of influenza A(H2) among animals makes emergence of a new pandemic virus possible. One of the basic techniques of molecular diagnostics of infectious diseases is the realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The aim of this work was to design oligonucleotide primers and probes for the rapid detection of influenza A virus subtype H2 by realtime reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Analysis of 539 sequences of influenza A(H2N2) virus hemagglutinin gene from GISAID EpiFlu database revealed conservative regions suitable for use as binding sites for primers and probes. 191 probes were designed and 2 sets of primers and probes (H2-1 and H2-2) were selected for further experimental evaluation. Detection limit of RT-PCR system was 50 copies of DNA per 25 μl reaction when 10-fold dilutions of pCI-neo-H2 plasmid used as template. Analytical specificity of selected sets of primers and probes were tested on wide range of influenza strains and non-influenza respiratory viruses. H2-2 set found to have insufficient specificity detecting seasonal influenza A(H1N1) viruses and was excluded from further analysis. Analytical sensitivity was further tested on vaccine strain A/17/California/66/395 (H2N2) and A/Japan/305/1957 (H2N2), limit of detection for primers-probe set H2-1 was 3.2 (CI95%: 3.07–3.48) lg EID50/ml. Designed primers and probes for the realtime RT-PCR universal detection of influenza A(H2) viruses could be used in clinical trials of vaccines against influenza A(H2) and screening for H2 in cases of unsubtypeable influenza A in humans.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.071043518,-0.032337286,0.098999877,0.159035034,0.014328159,0.21759877,-0.102363601,-0.005776444,-0.021520695,-0.047653185,-0.000916785,0.011909938,0.024283865,-0.009068168,0.003854626,-0.003504917,0.009805572,-0.012689365,-0.019288711,-0.047403976,0.018346136,0.002652692,0.020998582,0.024243875,-0.007971387,-0.017048537,-0.038334269,-0.004509493,0.009147272,0.040537217
Development of a recombinase polymerase amplification combined with lateral-flow dipstick assay for detection of bovine ephemeral fever virus,"Abstract Bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV), identified as the causative pathogen of bovine ephemeral fever (BEF), is responsible for increasing numbers of epidemics/outbreaks and has a significant harmful effect on the livestock industry. Therefore, a rapid detection assay is imperative for BEFV diagnosis. In this study, we described the development of lateral-flow dipstick isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (LFD-RPA) assays for detection of BEFV. RPA primers and LF probes were designed by targeting the specific G gene, and the amplification product can be visualized on a simple lateral flow dipstick with the naked eyes. The amplification reaction was performed at 38 °C for 20 min and LFD incubation time within 5 min. The detection limit of this assay was 8 copies per reaction, and there was no cross-reactivity with other bovine infectious viruses such as bovine viral diarrhea virus, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine coronavirus, bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, bovine vesicular stomatitis virus. In addition, the assay was performed with total 128 clinical specimens and the diagnostic results were compared with conventional RT-PCR, real-time quantative(q) PCR. The result showed that the coincidence rate of BEFV LFD-RPA and real-time qPCR was 96.09% (123/128), which was higher than conventional RT-PCR. The RPA combined with LFD assay probably provides a rapid and sensitive alternative for diagnosis of BEFV infections outbreak.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.054127464,0.086307594,0.307855297,0.087982891,-0.050501228,-0.069541582,0.020592748,0.012953238,0.003273225,-0.048140499,-0.077900784,0.028073814,-0.020436357,-0.046136829,-0.035763298,0.056351142,-0.032496783,-0.06162378,0.171627753,0.223528326,0.109501372,-0.012086794,-0.00444586,-0.029758987,-0.066880811,0.082057174,0.081862742,-0.031558149,0.078316916,-0.064220281
Equipment-free recombinase polymerase amplification assay using body heat for visual and rapid point-of-need detection of canine parvovirus 2,"Abstract A visible and equipment-free recombinase polymerase amplification assay combined with a lateral flow strip (LFS RPA) was developed to detect canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), which is the etiological agent of canine parvovirus disease. The CPV-2 LFS RPA assay was developed based on the VP2 gene and is performed in a closed fist using body heat for 15 min; the products are visible to the naked eye on the LFS within 5 min. The assay could detect CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c, and there was no cross-reaction with the other viruses tested. Using the standard CPV-2 DNA as a template, the analytical sensitivity was 1.0 × 102 copies per reaction, which was the same result as that of a real-time PCR. The assay performance was further evaluated by testing 60 canine fecal samples, and CPV-2 DNA was detected in 46 samples (76.7%, 46/60) by LFS RPA, which was the same result as that of the real-time PCR assay and higher than that of the SNAP method (48.3%, 29/60). The novel CPV-2 LFS RPA assay is an attractive and promising tool for rapid and convenient diagnosis of CPV disease, especially cage side and in underequipped laboratories.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.012075727,0.065012659,0.239779938,-0.000446097,-0.043364691,-0.038339053,0.047222284,0.019046574,-0.018902835,-0.093583037,-0.019806505,0.052285383,-0.062642174,-0.064220849,-0.030390905,0.057132932,-0.061819025,-0.119832393,0.219432024,0.1533032,0.220696151,0.08565904,-0.051538561,-0.082805511,0.019547123,-0.063287452,-0.044364203,0.023456884,0.00517566,0.053262785
A lateral flow dipstick combined with reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification for rapid and visual detection of the bovine respirovirus 3,"Abstract Bovine respirovirus 3 also known as Bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV3) is one of the most important viral respiratory agents of both young and adult cattle. Rapid diagnosis could contribute greatly in containing epidemics and thus avoid economic losses. However, the lack of robust isothermal visual method poses difficulty. In this study, a novel isothermal assay for detecting BPIV3 was established. The method includes a lateral flow dipstick (LFD) assay combined with reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA). First, the analytical sensitivity and specificity of BPIV3 LFD RT-RPA were tested. The LFD RT-RPA assay has a detection limit of up to 100 copies per reaction in 30 min at 38 °C. Then the performance of LFD RT-RPA was evaluated using 95 clinical samples. Compared to qPCR, the LFD RT-RPA assay showed a clinical sensitivity of 94.74%, a clinical specificity of 96.05% and 0.8734 kappa coefficient. These results have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of the method to be developed into a point of care protocol for the diagnosis of BPIV3.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.055939009,0.113548557,0.342674455,0.101396626,-0.083266134,-0.082836563,0.030756776,0.023212166,-0.017622987,-0.126002937,-0.071240315,0.079269338,-0.084673511,-0.035163813,-0.112269729,0.11596064,-0.039050752,-0.071401114,0.185706464,0.305320824,0.086778238,-0.012645756,-0.037698583,0.007434534,-0.045486792,0.082306588,0.076290432,-0.007411089,0.098769768,-0.08343202
Reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification with lateral flow dipsticks for detection of influenza A virus and subtyping of H1 and H3,"Abstract Three reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assays with lateral flow dipsticks (RT-RPA-LFD) were developed for identification of the matrix and hemagglutinin (HA) genes to detect influenza A virus and distinguish subtypes H1 and H3. Assessment of the assays’ specificity showed that there was no cross-reactivity with other targets. Their limits of detection were 123.6 copies per reaction for the matrix gene, 677.1 copies per reaction for the H1 HA gene, and 112.2 copies/reaction for the H3 HA gene. Of 111 samples tested by RT-RPA-LFD assays, 27 were positive for influenza A virus, 14 were positive for H1, and 10 were positive for H3. Compared to the results obtained from real-time RT-PCR assays, the sensitivity of RT-RPA-LFD assays was 75%, 93.33% and 71.43% for the matrix, H1, and H3, with 100% specificity. The sensitivity of RT-RPA-LFD assays is lower than that of real-time RT-PCR, comparable or better than that of conventional RT-PCR, and much better than that of RIDTs. In conclusion, these assays offer an efficient and reliable tool for identification and subtyping of influenza A virus (subtype H1 and H3) in the resource-limited setting.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.056750385,0.078806131,0.275328381,0.129150393,-0.036213535,0.035251457,-0.05622359,0.012551279,-0.02058849,-0.128831093,-0.05715998,0.044360851,-0.056880954,0.036134381,-0.075435602,0.065121319,0.024615768,-0.061059735,0.107572084,0.122208176,0.083675428,0.019911052,-0.005734577,-0.001937315,-0.072907569,0.062662181,0.073454433,-0.032511396,0.092002689,-0.048873836
Establishment of a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay for the detection of Brucella spp. Infection,"Abstract Brucellosis is a worldwide re-emerging zoonosis. It has an economic impact due to abortion and loss of fertility in livestock. In this study, Real-time recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA-BP26) targeting Brucella spp. bp26 gene and Lateral flow dipstick (LFD-RPA-IS711) combined with SYBR- Green recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) targeting insertion sequence IS711 region of Brucella spp. bp26 gene, was developed to detect Brucella spp. from different sample types in domestic animals. The sensitivity and specificity of the two developed RPAs were compared with real-time PCR, PCR, and Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT). The analytical sensitivity and detection limit of Real-time RPA and LFD RPA were four and six copies per reaction respectively. The detection of six colony forming units (CFU) of the bacteria-bearing construct with the target sequence was within 20 min at 40 °C for Real-time RPA and 37 °C for LFD RPA. The LFD RPA could work at temperatures between 30 and 35 °C and could be completed within 10–30 min. No significant differences were observed when comparing the results from Real-time RPA and LFD RPA to Real-time PCR and PCR. Both methods showed no cross reactivity with Chlamydia abortus, Toxoplasma gondii, Salmonella typhimurium, and Escherichia coli.

A multiplex PCR for Massachusetts and Arkansas serotypes of infectious bronchitis virus,"Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the prototype of the coronavirus family, is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus with a genome size of approximately 27·6 kilobase. Infectious bronchitis virus causes an acute, highly contagious respiratory and urogenital disease of chickens which results in significant economic losses in commercial broilers, layers and breeders. A rapid, highly sensitive and specific method is needed in the differential diagnosis of infections of different serotypes. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was developed and optimized to simultaneously detect Massachusetts (Mass) and Arkansas (Ark) serotypes of IBV. One common primer and two serotype specific primers were chosen from the S1 gene sequences of IBV and used in one PCR reaction. Under optimized PCR conditions, two serotype specific PCR products, 1026 bp for Mass and 896 bp for Ark, respectively, were amplified and detected by agarose gel electrophoreses. The specificity of the technique was verified by using 20 different strains and isolates of IBV, and other avian bacterial and viral pathogens. Using a serial 10-fold dilution of the artificial mixture of both Mass and Ark samples, the detection limit was found to be 5 pg RNA after 35 cycles of PCR. The multiplex PCR was able to detect and differentiate both serotypes in embryonated eggs that were co-infected with different EID50virus titers of Mass 41 and Ark 99. The multiplex PCR developed in this study will be valuable for rapid identification, differential diagnosis, and epidemiological studies of these two serotypes of IBV infections.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.002648798,0.026969595,0.193709633,0.004578498,0.133903255,0.004035319,-0.131305949,-0.076895882,0.067888326,0.307543107,0.065155329,-0.036621373,-0.012134643,0.052264139,-0.066358054,0.082276958,0.035599072,-0.003931027,0.025182051,-0.036456861,-0.046669482,0.0071122,0.045207544,-0.056621716,0.00128066,-0.00082208,-0.007341838,-0.005529296,0.031728103,0.027656845
Three-dimensional Culture of Human Airway Epithelium in Matrigel for Evaluation of Human Rhinovirus C and Bocavirus Infections,"Abstract Objective Newly identified human rhinovirus C (HRV-C) and human bocavirus (HBoV) cannot propagate in vitro in traditional cell culture models; thus obtaining knowledge about these viruses and developing related vaccines are difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a novel platform for the propagation of these types of viruses. Methods A platform for culturing human airway epithelia in a three-dimensional (3D) pattern using Matrigel as scaffold was developed. The features of 3D culture were identified by immunochemical staining and transmission electron microscopy. Nucleic acid levels of HRV-C and HBoV in 3D cells at designated time points were quantitated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Levels of cytokines, whose secretion was induced by the viruses, were measured by ELISA. Results Properties of bronchial-like tissues, such as the expression of biomarkers CK5, ZO-1, and PCK, and the development of cilium-like protuberances indicative of the human respiration tract, were observed in 3D-cultured human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, but not in monolayer-cultured cells. Nucleic acid levels of HRV-C and HBoV and levels of virus-induced cytokines were also measured using the 3D culture system. Conclusion Our data provide a preliminary indication that the 3D culture model of primary epithelia using a Matrigel scaffold in vitro can be used to propagate HRV-C and HBoV.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.006653656,-0.046204735,0.020057016,-0.044958434,-0.032708074,0.00608607,0.080318923,-0.049441864,0.046045794,0.016830983,-0.058705932,-0.030589394,0.019447592,0.03379016,0.018589615,-0.030893223,-0.017187283,-0.047141825,0.003557368,-0.084465529,0.063562279,-0.050614951,-0.000553123,0.07179783,-0.14209083,0.108819692,-0.089367409,0.029650851,0.037110363,0.103005999
Coxsackievirus B3 Infection Triggers Autophagy through 3 Pathways of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress,"Abstract Objective Autophagy is a highly conserved intracellular degradation pathway. Many picornaviruses induce autophagy to benefit viral replication, but an understanding of how autophagy occurs remains incomplete. In this study, we explored whether coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection induced autophagy through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Methods In CVB3-infected HeLa cells, the specific molecules of ER stress and autophagy were detected using Western blotting, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and confocal microscopy. Then PKR-like ER protein kinase (PERK) inhibitor, inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE1) inhibitor, or activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6) inhibitor worked on CVB3-infected cells, their effect on autophagy was assessed by Western blotting for detecting microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3). Results CVB3 infection induced ER stress, and ER stress sensors PERK/eIF2α, IRE1/XBP1, and ATF6 were activated. CVB3 infection increased the accumulation of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 punctuation and induced the conversion from LC3-I to phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated LC3-1 (LC3-II). CVB3 infection still decreased the expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p-mTOR. Inhibition of PERK, IRE1, or ATF6 significantly decreased the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I in CVB3-infected HeLa cells. Conclusion CVB3 infection induced autophagy through ER stress in HeLa cells, and PERK, IRE1, and ATF6a pathways participated in the regulation of autophagy. Our data suggested that ER stress may inhibit mTOR signaling pathway to induce autophagy during CVB3 infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.066179078,-0.030980866,0.000159742,-0.086561878,-0.077077267,0.03058556,0.023822838,-0.029937482,0.051297234,-0.036999253,-0.024922621,-0.016856995,-0.026863429,0.076786881,-0.004546903,0.016956195,0.024955354,-0.034811275,-0.000782849,-0.002294018,0.002259738,0.013717558,-0.005269892,-0.027299628,0.042963222,0.012205561,-0.026149172,0.014134299,-0.013547179,-0.004644264
"A prospective, community-based study on virologic assessment among elderly people with and without symptoms of acute respiratory infection","Abstract Background and objective Community-based elderly studies concerning microbiology of acute respiratory infections are scarce. Data on subclinical infections are even totally absent, although asymptomatic persons might act as a source of respiratory infections. Methods In a 1-year community-based study, we prospectively investigated the possible virologic cause of acute respiratory infections in 107 symptomatic case episodes and 91 symptom-free control periods. Participants, persons ⩾60 years, reported daily the presence of respiratory symptoms in a diary. Virologic assessment was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology. Results In 58% of the case episodes a pathogen was demonstrated, the most common being rhinoviruses (32%), coronaviruses (17%), and influenzaviruses (7%). The odds ratio for demonstrating a virus in cases with symptoms vs. controls without symptoms was 30.0 (95% confidence interval 10.2–87.6). In 4% of the symptom-free control periods a virus was detected. Conclusion This study supports the importance of rhinovirus infections in community-dwelling elderly persons, whereas asymptomatic elderly persons can also harbor pathogens as detected by PCR, and thus might be a source of infection for their environment.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.165247061,-0.051470257,-0.04689726,-0.020598365,0.020779454,-0.038825314,0.030316433,-0.012789261,0.0261766,0.020080657,0.018471472,-0.027233182,0.011610748,-0.054178336,0.045086216,0.01130913,-0.014281743,-0.057969299,0.061331378,-0.039884661,-0.054816564,-0.065555512,-0.037676118,0.000731979,0.069348439,0.038719892,-0.040715553,-0.018560877,0.056736926,-0.051003585
Sequence similarity and structural homologies are involved in the autoimmune response elicited by mouse hepatitis virus A59,"Abstract The features of autoantibodies (autoAb) to liver fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) elicited in mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) were studied by ELISA and western-blot competition assays. All sera tested contained Ab to cryptic FAH epitopes according with results from western-blot tests, whereas ELISA data indicated that some of these same sera did recognize native epitopes of the autoantigen (autoAg). Such differences were detected in individual sera from various mouse strains, and were ascribed to the fact that proteins insolubilized on solid supports expose a variety of conformational and cryptic antigenic determinants. On the other hand, whereas results from both experimental protocols showed that anti-MHV Ab did not cross-react with the soluble autoAg, the opposite situation did not show analogous results. Thus, binding of autoAb to insolubilized FAH could be inhibited by MHV depending on the mouse serum or the experimental protocol used. Additionally, a set of synthetic homologous peptides from mouse FAH and various viral proteins was employed to analyze the Ab repertoire of MHV-infected mice. Results indicated that two homologous peptides were recognized by most Ab: the N-terminal sequences (1–10) from FAH and the nucleocapside, both sharing 50% of identity, and sequence 2317–2326 of the RNA polymerase, a peptide showing 30% of identity with FAH 11–20. Results indicated that MHV-infection triggers at least three distinct Ab populations: anti-MHV, anti-FAH and cross-reacting Ab. This cross-reaction implies either sequential or conformational epitopes from both the viral proteins and the autoAg and may differ between individuals.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.087371058,-0.033242453,0.00242688,-0.052919036,-0.008116272,-0.00713811,-0.048609317,-0.010272373,0.02350837,-0.055098978,-0.041959574,-0.023588603,0.013796733,0.00386401,0.040617307,0.029372849,-0.040445803,0.023140338,0.018581223,-0.01020862,0.030227545,-0.014546447,0.054707697,0.028490505,0.116421161,0.118707413,0.019413831,-0.035877878,-0.055051535,0.016099865
Betacoronavirus 1 in alpacas (Vicugna pacos) in the High Peruvian Andes,"Abstract Genetic sequences highly related to Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) were detected in fecal samples from Peruvian 1–3 week old alpaca crias located on six farms in Puno department, some of which shared pastures with cattle. A total of 60 samples were screened for coronavirus using a nested PCR amplification of a fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. Sequences from 11 positive samples were highly similar to the Kakegawa, Quebec and Mebus BCoV strains (99.5–100.0%) and 99.2% identical to an alpaca Coronavirus (CoV) previously detected in the USA.

Progress towards a higher taxonomy of viruses,"Summary The current consensus view is that a higher hierarchical taxonomy of viruses cannot be established for two reasons. Firstly, viruses appear to be polyphyletic in origin, with several sets of viruses arising by different, independent routes at different times. Secondly, subsequent virus adaptation for survival in different host/vector combinations has involved the selective acquisition of additional genes by a process of cassette or modular evolution, with these additional gene modules coming from other viruses or host genetic material. Thus, depending on the gene product used for comparison, different phylogenetic relationships can be deduced. Further virus adaptation can arise by reassortment of segmented genomes, gene duplication, deletions, frameshift mutations, point mutations or de novo development of new gene products from existing, unused reading frames. The solution to the first objection is to place all viruses in a separate kingdom and assign the current viruses to several phyla that reflect these diverse origins. The solution to the second objection is to consider the core module of replication machinery as the major criterion on which to make the initial assignments to classes and orders. For RNA viruses, the major criterion is the sequence identity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Using this criterion, the positive strand RNA viruses can be assigned to five classes that correspond to the recently recognized supergroups of RNA viruses. These five classes contain four, three, three, three and one order(s) respectively. These fourteen orders contain 31 virus families (including 17 families of plant viruses) and 48 genera (including 30 genera of plant viruses). This approach confirms the separation of the alphaviruses and flaviviruses into two families, the Togaviridae and Flaviridae, but suggests that several other current taxonomic assignments, such as the pestiviruses, hepatitis C virus, rubiviruses, hepatitis E virus and arteriviruses, may be wrong. The coronaviruses and toroviruses appear to be distinct families in distinct orders, not distinct genera of the same family as currently classified. In addition, the luteoviruses are split into two families and apple chlorotic leaf spot virus appears not to be a closterovirus but a new genus of the Potexviridae. From an analysis of the polymerase dendrograms of the dsRNA viruses, it appears that they are not closely related to each other, but belong to four additional classes (Partitiviridae, Reoviridae, Birnaviridae and Cystoviridae) and one additional order (Totiviridae) of one of the classes of positive ssRNA viruses in the same subphylum as the positive strand RNA viruses. The negative strand virus polymerase relationships confirm the assignment of the negative strand viruses to two orders in a single class in a separate subphylum of the RNA viruses. This review includes preliminary data suggesting that the DNA viruses can also be assigned to higher taxa on the basis of the sequence identities of their highly conserved DNA polymerases. The suggested use of viral polymerases to establish higher order relationships is similar in principle to the use of highly conserved ribosomal RNA gene sequences in prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxonomy. This review also discusses the assignment of 33 of the 35 groups of plant viruses into genera of 25 families based on the nature of the genome and its arrangement, the level of sequence identity and, to a lesser extent, particle morphology.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.143860498,-0.070103855,-0.028041858,0.146639318,0.113167627,-0.010611442,0.046131904,0.052429632,-0.077338604,0.079017882,-0.00489884,-0.048724428,0.046311961,-0.019706778,0.021208222,-0.049814638,-0.009367361,-0.047302126,-0.003047322,0.030807463,-0.005515154,0.017695534,-0.082753295,0.086844294,-0.136634853,-0.070096256,0.033694004,-0.0218994,-0.023746545,-0.076824647
Evaluation of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) for the detection of rota viruses: applications of the assay,"Summary Our aim was to evaluate the reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) technique for the detection of rotavirus shedding by infected children as a routine diagnostic procedure, in comparison to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), electron microscopy (EM) and polyacrylamide gel etectrophoresis (PAGE) of rotavirus double stranded RNA. Two-hundred and twenty stool specimens were collected from infants and young children with diarrhoea, and 10–20% faecal suspensions were made. Several methods of rotavirus dsRNA extraction were assayed. Electrophoretic analysis of viral RNA was carried out on 10% polyacrylamide gols followed by silver staining. RT/PCR was performed using oligonucleotide primers specific for both 3′ and 5′ ends of the rotavirus gene encoding VP7 which ere highly conserved among group A rotaviruses. Following RNA extraction with phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitation, RT/PCR could detect rotaviral RNA in only 11 of 25 samples known to contain rotaviruses by conventional methods. The purification of RNA extracts by CF11 cellulose and the application of the RNAID method were equally effective in extracting RNA and/or removing inhibitory substances from the faecal samples. RT/PCR led to the detection of 66 positive samples from 220 specimens tested (30%). whilst 64 specimens were positive by EUSA (29%), 59 (26.3%) by PAGE and 56 (25.4%) by EM. In our study, RT/PCR was 100 times more sensitive than the ELISA test in detecting rotaviruses serially diluted in a faecal suspension. Although RT/PCR is theoretically much more sensitive than ELISA, PAGE and EM for detection of rotaviruses, great care must be taken to remove inhibitory substances from the enzymatic reactions. We do not consider that RT/PCR should replace immunoassays with high sensitivity and specificity for rotavirus testing in faecal samples, although this technique has other applications, like the search for rotavirus in different clinical specimens (sera, cerebrospinal fluid, respiratory secretions, etc.) and in environmental samples, as well as the typing of viral strains using serotype-specific primers.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.035375405,0.07344183,0.220306222,0.085705226,0.037004263,-0.124252424,-0.013276253,-0.019378215,-0.044393014,-0.025892654,0.093502885,-0.001620289,-0.049511081,0.10901776,0.025918248,-0.026135732,0.062894854,-0.010693352,0.006438758,-0.114504622,-0.046041302,0.082763026,-0.02728456,0.001155615,0.036928916,-0.022110018,0.028940808,-0.073044014,-0.000694517,0.027243682
Interplay between mutational and horizontally acquired resistance mechanisms and its association with carbapenem resistance amongst extensively drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (XDR-PA),"Abstract Between 2003 and 2009, the prevalence of extensively drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (XDR-PA) increased significantly in northern Taiwan from 1.0% to 2.1%. Molecular methods were used to investigate the genetic relatedness and carbapenem resistance mechanisms of a collection of 203 non-repetitive XDR-PA isolates available for study. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), 52 genotypes were observed; one predominant genotype (pulsotype 1) was found in 57.6% of the isolates. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequencing and quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR analyses demonstrated that one horizontally acquired mechanism [metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) genes] and two mutational mechanisms (efflux and porins) accounted for the carbapenem resistance. The most predominant horizontally acquired mechanism was carriage of bla VIM-3, which was found in 61.1% of isolates. Decreased expression of oprD was the most prevalent mutational mechanism and was found in 70.0% of the XDR-PA isolates, whereas overexpression of mexA was found in 27.6% of the isolates. The highlight of this study was the discovery of statistically significant relationships between certain horizontally acquired and mutational resistance mechanisms and their contribution to carbapenem susceptibility. MBL-producers expressed significantly lower MexAB and higher OprD than non-MBL-producers. Amongst isolates without an acquired β-lactamase gene, oprD expression was significantly reduced, whilst expression of efflux pumps was increased. Reduced OprD expression alone or the production of VIM-type MBLs showed similar contributions to a low to intermediate MIC50 (minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of the organisms) for carbapenems. Isolates with reduced OprD expression that simultaneously harboured bla VIM exhibited high levels of resistance to carbapenems, which implied that these two mechanisms had a synergistic effect on the MICs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.042236786,-0.025870667,0.032502403,-0.111997299,-0.030817746,0.087201349,0.003225722,-0.047363002,0.024247911,0.020449021,-0.032698015,0.021612277,-0.03449041,0.044198296,-0.015399026,-0.009678221,-0.036893749,-0.00822365,-0.039344211,-0.06073128,0.058329947,0.014592228,0.063485452,0.058519173,-0.076372193,-0.01072017,0.043954673,0.000188457,0.043647045,-0.010216403
Peptide microarrays with site-specifically immobilized synthetic peptides for antibody diagnostics,"Abstract Peptide microarrays bear the potential to discover molecular recognition events on protein level, particularly in the field of molecular immunology, in a manner and with an efficiency comparable to the performance of DNA microarrays. We developed a novel peptide microarray platform for the detection of antibodies in liquid samples. The system comprises site-specific solution phase coupling of biotinylated peptides to NeutrAvidin, localized microdispensing of peptide–NeutrAvidin conjugates onto activated glass slides and a fluorescence immuno sandwich assay format for antibody capture and detection. Our work includes synthetic peptides deduced from amino acid sequences of immunodominant linear epitopes, such as the T7 phage capsid protein, Herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D, c-myc protein and three domains of the Human coronavirus 229E polymerase polyprotein.

A real-time convective PCR machine in a capillary tube instrumented with a CCD-based fluorometer,"Abstract This research reports the design, analysis, integration, and test of a prototype of a real-time convective polymerase chain reaction (RT-cPCR) machine that uses a color charged coupled device (CCD) for detecting the emission of fluorescence intensity from an RT-cPCR mix in a microliter volume glass capillary. Because of its simple mechanism, DNA amplification involves employing the cPCR technique with no need for thermocycling control. The flow pattern and temperature distribution can greatly affect the cPCR process in the capillary tube, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation was conducted in this study for the first time to estimate the required period of an RT-cPCR cycle. This study also tested the PCR mix containing hepatitis B virus (HBV) plasmid samples by using SYBR Green I fluorescence labeling dye to assess the prototype performance. The measured results from the image-processing scheme indicate that the RT-cPCR prototype with a CCD-based fluorometer can achieve similar DNA quantification reproducibility compared to commercial machines, even when the initial DNA concentration in the test PCR mix is reduced to 10copies/μL",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.000671516,0.056286171,0.192439159,0.007509454,-0.0518368,-0.017648961,0.004186627,-0.004821648,-0.00854755,-0.033825973,-0.009093373,0.01326574,-0.013797871,0.026658748,-0.025177032,0.046616932,0.013301035,-0.001045559,-0.019850684,-0.051243671,-0.024842586,0.01528082,-0.016625414,-0.008042013,-0.008689947,0.016879528,-1.16E-05,0.006962717,0.023137425,-0.004142476
A Lego®-like swappable fluidic module for bio-chem applications,"Abstract A Lego®-like swappable fluidic module (SFM) is proposed in this research. We designed and fabricated selected modular fluidic components, including functional and auxiliary types that can be effortlessly swapped and integrated into a variety of modular devices to rapidly assemble a fully-portable, disposable fluidic system. In practice, an integrated SFM uses finger-operated, electricity-free pumps to deliver fluids. Using a swirling mechanism, the vortex mixer can rapidly mix two liquids in a one-shot mixing event. We demonstrate the successful application of this SFM in several microfluidic applications, such as the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) from chloroauric acid (HAuCl4), and nucleic acid amplification from the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) with a capillary convective polymerase chain reaction (ccPCR).",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.064923134,-0.007147268,0.067914024,-0.024548153,-0.055639296,0.018697859,0.030602605,0.007983077,0.000663086,0.009662825,-0.036677993,0.017368542,0.033071632,-0.096689232,-0.005137555,0.040828263,-0.034532273,0.018940133,-0.037102658,-0.019141079,-0.042595543,-0.046746391,0.007091407,-0.059709791,0.006803642,0.002043308,-0.042318679,0.03350146,-0.024635058,0.013344052
IoT PCR for pandemic disease detection and its spread monitoring,"Abstract During infectious disease outbreaks, the centers for disease control need to monitor particular areas. Considerable effort has been invested in the development of portable, user-friendly, and cost-effective systems for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, which could also create an Internet of Things (IoT) for healthcare via a global network. However, at present IoT based on a functional POC instrument is not available. Here we show a fast, user-friendly, and affordable IoT system based on a miniaturized polymerase chain reaction device. We demonstrated the system’s capability by amplification of complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) of the dengue fever virus. The resulting data were then automatically uploaded via a Bluetooth interface to an Android-based smartphone and then wirelessly sent to a global network, instantly making the test results available anywhere in the world. The IoT system presented here could become an essential tool for healthcare centers to tackle infectious disease outbreaks identified either by DNA or ribonucleic acid.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.020366096,0.013710576,0.084807027,-0.037540714,-0.064814411,0.047244034,0.034595645,0.021796249,0.015469086,0.051797461,-0.021019466,0.012454929,0.047632743,-0.138266486,-0.009861436,0.040464416,-0.061368877,0.025858983,-0.057014072,0.00266236,-0.032127997,-0.057312943,-0.020867291,-0.078458841,-0.005321657,0.002596336,-0.032280449,0.018368308,-0.0433438,0.04198055
Infectious exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease associated with respiratory viruses and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae,"Abstract Infectious exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been reported to occur with both viral and bacterial pathogens. In this study, 35 exacerbations associated with the isolation of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae from sputum were identified as part of a prospective longitudinal study. Samples from these patients were subjected to immunoassays to identify a new immune response to the homologous isolate of non-typeable H. influenzae to more accurately assess a bacterial etiology. These patients also were studied carefully for evidence of viral infection using viral culture, serology and polymerase chain reaction-based assays. Sixteen of 35 exacerbations (45.7%) were associated with evidence of acute viral infection and 11 of the 35 exacerbations (31.4%) were associated with the development of new serum IgG to homologous non-typeable H. influenzae. Overall, evidence of infection with a respiratory virus or non-typeable H. influenzae was seen in 24 of 35 exacerbations (68.6%). No association between viral infection and immune response to non-typeable H. influenzae was observed, although a trend toward an immune response to non-typeable H. influenzae and absence of viral infection was seen. The results show that exacerbations in adults with COPD were associated with infection caused by virus alone, non-typeable H. influenzae alone, or virus and non-typeable H. influenzae simultaneously.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.061555925,-0.045276669,-0.045884948,-0.10851642,-0.064030187,-0.013811001,0.039390301,0.002963558,-0.053696792,0.079186839,-0.017437971,-0.05493137,0.019244326,0.017032931,0.003698584,-0.017200893,0.007264408,-0.051384964,-0.009504885,0.004431707,-0.011184445,-0.055923619,-0.005053308,0.059438622,0.006023874,0.025892699,0.003102831,-0.028238501,0.059050219,0.110488402
Detection of Human Metapneumovirus in Hospitalized Children with Acute Respiratory Tract Infection Using Real-time RT-PCR in a Hospital in Northern Taiwan,"Background/purpose Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a newly discovered respiratory pathogen. This prospective hospital-based study investigated the clinical role and features of hMPV in Taiwan. Methods Respiratory specimens collected from hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection between September 1, 2003 and April 10, 2005 were screened for metapneumovirus using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results During the study period, 930 specimens were obtained from 926 hospitalized children. After exclusion of 200 cases due to lack of clinical evidence of airway infection or diseases with known etiology, 726 were included in the analysis. Among these, 33 children had a positive result for hMPV infection. The majority of these patients were admitted during spring and early summer. Twenty-one (63.6%) were younger than 2 years of age. hMPV accounted for 13.3% of respiratory infections occurring between the ages of 18 and 24 months and was as common a respiratory pathogen as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in that age group. The 11 patients (33.3%) with underlying diseases had a similar disease course to those without underlying diseases. A co-pathogen was found in 11 patients (33.3%). Infected children between 2 and 5 years of age had significantly higher titers of hMPV in their respiratory specimens (103.88 copies/mL) than children younger than 2 years (102.26 copies/mL) (p = 0.013) and children older than 5 years (102.25 copies/mL) (p = 0.005). hMPV positive cases were significantly older than those with RSV infection (p = 0.002) and had a shorter duration of hospitalization (p = 0.001), fewer days of oxygen use (p = 0.001) and higher levels of C-reactive protein (p = 0.004). Conclusion Metapneumovirus circulates in children in northern Taiwan during spring and early summer. hMPV was the most common respiratory pathogen in children aged between 18 and 24 months hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection. Real-time RT-PCR is a sensitive method for investigating the epidemiology and diseases associated with hMPV.

Viral infections associated with Kawasaki disease,"Background/Purpose Kawasaki disease (KD) is a disease of unknown cause. To investigate the infectious etiology of Kawasaki disease, we initiated a prospective case-control study to investigate possible links between common viral infections and Kawasaki disease. Methods We enrolled 226 children with KD and 226 age- and sex-matched healthy children from February 2004 to March 2010. Throat and nasopharyngeal swabs were taken for both viral isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for various viruses. Results The mean age of the 226 KD cases was 2.07 years, and the male to female ratio was 1.43 (133 boys to 93 girls). Their mean fever duration was 7.5 days with a mean peak temperature of 39.7°C. In addition to the typical symptoms of fever, neck lymphadenopathy, lip fissure and/or strawberry tongue, skin rash, nonpurulent bulbar conjunctivitis, palm/sole erythema, and induration followed by periungual desquamation, these KD cases also exhibited cough (69%), rhinorrhea (58%), and diarrhea (45%). Cases of KD had a significantly higher positive rate of viral isolation in comparison with the control group (7.5% vs. 2.2%, p = 0.02). Compared with the control group, cases of KD were more likely to have overall positive rates of viral PCR (50.4% vs. 16.4%, p < 0.001) and for various viruses including enterovirus (16.8% vs. 4.4%, p < 0.001), adenovirus (8.0% vs. 1.8%, p = 0.007), human rhinovirus (26.5% vs. 9.7%, p < 0.001), and coronavirus (7.1% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.003).

"Infections nosocomiales à coronavirus humains chez le nouveau-né 1 Travail financé en partie par la Société française de pédiatrie (bourse de DEA), le ministère de la santé (PHRC 97) et le CCLIN–Ouest. A. Gagneur est boursier de la Société française de pédiatrie.","Résumé Les coronavirus humains sont des virus enveloppés à ARN de la famille des Coronaviridae avec deux sérogroupes identifiés : 229-E et OC-43. Ces virus possèdent le plus grand ARN viral connu. Ce génome est un ARN simple brin positif associé à une protéine phosphorylée de la nucléocapside, la protéine N. L’enveloppe des coronavirus humains contient deux ou trois glycoprotéines membranaires : S ou spike protein, M ou protéine de membrane et HE ou hémagglutine-estérase. Le rôle pathogène de ces virus est mal connu en raison des difficultés diagnostiques. Cependant la mise au point de l’immunofluorescence avec anticorps monoclonaux et des techniques d’amplification génique permet de nouvelles recherches épidémiologiques. Les coronavirus peuvent survivre jusqu’à six jours en suspension et trois heures après séchage, ce qui suggère un rôle nosocomial potentiel. Deux études prospectives réalisées dans une unité de réanimation néonatale et pédiatrique ont révélé une relation significative entre l’existence de prélèvement nasopharyngés positifs et la survenue de symptômes respiratoires. Des prélèvements positifs chez le personnel suggèrent une contamination patient-personnel ou personnel–patient. En raison de leur survie possible sur les surfaces et de l’efficacité démontrée des agents désinfectants, des mesures universelles de prévention associant lavage des mains et désinfection des surfaces peuvent être proposées. Abstract Human coronaviruses, with two known serogroups named 229-E and OC-43, are enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses. The large RNA is surrounded by a nucleoprotein (protein N). The envelop contains 2 or 3 glycoproteins: spike protein (or protein S), matrix protein (or protein M) and a hemagglutinin (or protein HE). Their pathogen role remains unclear because their isolation is difficult. Reliable and rapid methods as immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction allow new researches on epidemiology. Human coronaviruses can survive for as long as 6 days in suspension and 3 hours after drying on surfaces, suggesting that they could be a source of hospital-acquired infections. Two prospective studies conducted in a neonatal and paediatric intensive care unit demonstrated a significant association of coronavirus-positive naso-pharyngal samples with respiratory illness in hospitalised preterm neonates. Positive samples from staff suggested either a patient-to-staff or a staff-to-patient transmission. No cross-infection were observed from community-acquired respiratory-syncitial virus or influenza-infected children to neonates. Universal precautions with hand washing and surface desinfection could be proposed to prevent coronavirus transmission.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.003758713,-0.028526697,-0.014973389,-0.032613222,-0.004202707,0.010233265,0.014756879,0.000618802,0.044965506,-0.0210218,-0.022358472,0.018300106,0.047513745,-0.102395568,0.19603092,0.187003924,0.344468872,0.037963477,-0.033586875,0.066149326,0.00051587,0.058631339,0.045968788,-0.008516385,-0.007832497,0.040627461,-0.017828302,-0.035071434,-0.041508904,0.015505503
Infections respiratoires aiguës à métapneumovirus humain chez l’enfant : études descriptive et comparative avec le virus respiratoire syncytial,"Résumé Objectif. – Un nouveau paramyxovirus, le métapneumovirus humain, a été récemment isolé. Nous rapportons les premiers cas pédiatriques français d’infection respiratoire à ce virus, détectés entre 2000 et 2002. Matériel et méthodes. – Les prélèvements ont été obtenus par aspirations nasales chez des enfants hospitalisés pour infections respiratoires dans les services de pédiatrie du centre hospitalier universitaire de Caen et de l’hôpital de Flers. La recherche du métapneumovirus humain a été effectuée par polymerase chain reaction sur les prélèvements négatifs pour les virus respiratoire syncytial, virus influenza A et B, virus para-influenza (1, 2 et 3), adénovirus, entérovirus, coronavirus et rhinovirus. La comparaison de la morbidité des infections à métapneumovirus et virus respiratoire syncytial a été effectuée après appariement des sexe, âge et mois d’infection. Résultats. – Vingt-six cas d’infection à métapneumovirus humain ont été identifiés. L’étude comparative avec une cohorte appariée de nourrissons infectés par le virus respiratoire syncytial n’a retrouvé aucune différence significative en ce qui concerne les motifs d’hospitalisation, les signes cliniques et la prise en charge thérapeutique. Conclusion. – Le métapneumovirus humain est responsable d’un tableau typique de bronchiolite aiguë du nourrisson. Abstract Background. – A new paramyxovirus, the human metapneumovirus was recently isolated. We report the first French cases collected between 2000 and 2002. Material and methods. – Samples were obtained from nasopharyngeal aspirates from children hospitalised for acute respiratory tract infection in hospitals of Caen and Flers in Basse-Normandie. Human metapneumovirus was studied by polymerase chain reaction on negative samples for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B virus, parainfluenza (1, 2 and 3) virus, adenovirus, coronavirus and rhinovirus. Comparison between metapneumovirus virus and respiratory syncytial virus infections was done after matching sex, age and infection month. Results. – Twenty-six human metapneumovirus infections were identified. A comparative study of a matched group of children infected by respiratory syncytial virus found no significative difference for hospitalisation motive, clinical criteria and treatment. Conclusion. – The human metapneumovirus is responsible for typical acute bronchiolitis in children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.106714681,-0.08965602,-0.038456572,0.015482492,0.021656657,0.019621936,0.03224488,-0.054160291,0.083290993,-0.016697947,0.000442548,-0.014620239,0.042691186,-0.091936608,0.218828179,0.198912355,0.333640718,0.046163356,-0.025846037,0.056145296,0.043688152,0.049857833,0.070430126,0.036502935,-0.011511811,0.048049263,-0.044029019,-0.016575839,-0.012863825,-0.011235356
Virologie : l’apport de la biologie moléculaire dans le diagnostic microbiologique en pneumopédiatrie,"Résumé Les outils traditionnels du diagnostic virologique comprennent la recherche antigénique directe par immunofluorescence (IF) ou test immunoenzymatique (EIA), et l’isolement en culture. Les techniques d’IF ou EIA ont une sensibilité en général légèrement inférieure à celle de la culture, mais elles permettent de détecter également une fraction d’échantillons faussement négatifs en culture. Les résultats de plusieurs équipes, utilisant des techniques de reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), montrent que les méthodes moléculaires détectent plus d’échantillons positifs que les méthodes traditionnelles. Le travail est en cours pour élargir le nombre de virus identifiés par des RT-PCR multiplex et découvrir de nouveaux virus, tels le métapneumovirus humain, en cause dans les atteintes respiratoires de l’enfant. En conclusion, afin de concilier rapidité, contrôle des coûts et un fort taux de détection des virus respiratoires, l’utilisation combinée de l’IF et de la RT-PCR multiplex semble ce jour la meilleure façon de progresser dans le diagnostic des maladies respiratoires de l’enfant. Summary The conventionnal tools used for virological diagnosis include direct antigen detection by immunofluorescence (IFA) or an immunoenzymatic test (EIA), and viral isolation technique (VIT). In most cases, IFA and EIA have a slightly lower sensitivity than VIT but are also able to detect some VIT-negative samples. Results of several teams using RT-PCR technologies show that the molecular methods detect more positive cases than the conventional tools. Work is under way to expand the number of viruses detected by multiplex RT-PCR and to determine wether newly discovered viruses, such as human metapneumovirus, contribute to burden of paediatric lower respiratory infections. In conclusion, according to requirements of speed, low cost of the methods, and to achieve the highest rate of detection of respiratory viruses, the combined use of IFA and multiplex RT-PCR is today likely to be the best way to improve diagnosis of respiratory illnesses in children.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.092356887,0.000582246,0.121810377,0.02695589,-0.018463664,-0.038247966,0.038862176,-0.021886591,0.028506556,0.009907157,0.00245834,0.011268021,0.047400235,-0.082095366,0.251379619,0.247235131,0.444551005,0.073339807,-0.084196253,-0.015064556,0.037293143,0.092909862,0.088078003,0.022597186,-0.044049338,0.023847017,0.015854352,-0.069187986,-0.009208346,-0.009216599
Intérêt de l’identification en routine des agents pathogènes respiratoires chez les enfants hospitalisés pour une exacerbation d’asthme,"Résumé Introduction Chez l’enfant les exacerbations d’asthme sont le plus souvent déclenchées par une infection respiratoire. L’objectif de cette étude était d’évaluer l’intérêt de l’identification des pathogènes respiratoires chez les enfants hospitalisés pour une exacerbation d’asthme. Patients et méthodes Il s’agit d’une étude rétrospective incluant tout enfant hospitalisé pour une exacerbation d’asthme dans notre unité entre janvier 2010 et décembre 2011 et analysant la prescription des examens microbiologiques, leurs indications, leur rendement, leur impact sur la prise en charge médicale et leur coût. Résultats Cent quatre-vingt-dix-sept enfants ont été inclus. Une recherche d’agent pathogène respiratoire avait été réalisée chez 157 enfants (79,7 %), surtout en cas d’infection oto-rhino-laryngologique (ORL), d’hypoxémie ou de pneumonie. Un virus avait été identifié chez 30 (23,8 %) des 126 enfants prélevés. Les analyses bactériologiques avaient eu un rendement faible puisque seulement 3,2 % des analyses par amplification génique (PCR) pour Mycoplasma pneumoniae avaient été positives (n =4/125). Aucune autre bactérie n’avait été identifiée. Aucun lien n’a pu être établi entre les résultats microbiologiques et la gravité de l’exacerbation. La prise en charge thérapeutique avait été peu modifiée par ces résultats. Le coût global avait été de plus de 40 400euros pour les 2ans d’étude. Conclusion D’après nos résultats la recherche de pathogènes respiratoires au cours des exacerbations d’asthme a un intérêt modéré en dehors de l’aspect épidémiologique. L’impact du rhinovirus, du coronavirus, du bocavirus et de l’entérovirus, non recherchés en routine hospitalière, reste cependant à préciser. Summary Background Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood. With its high economic burden, it is considered a disease of major public health importance by the World Health Organization. The link between respiratory tract infections and acute exacerbation has been recognized for a long time. The aim of this retrospective study in routine care was to evaluate our practices concerning microbiological prescriptions in children hospitalized for asthma exacerbation. Study design All children aged from 2 to 15years hospitalized for asthma exacerbation between January 2010 and December 2011 in our unit were included in the study. Microbiological prescriptions, their indications, their results, and their cost were studied. Results One hundred ninety-seven children were included in the study. A potential causative agent was sought in 79.7% of the children (n =157) by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The main indications were upper airway infections, hypoxemia, and pneumonia. Viruses were detected in 23.8% of them (30/126). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected by PCR in only 3.2% of these patients (4/125). No other bacterial agent was identified. There was no correlation between the severity of asthma exacerbation and the microbiological diagnosis of infection. The results did not influence the therapy given. These prescriptions represented a substantial cost for each child. Conclusion These analyses do not seem to have a real advantage for the patient except for epidemiology. It would be important to conduct a new study analyzing the role of rhinovirus, and of other viruses such as coronavirus, bocavirus, and enterovirus, not routinely investigated in our hospital, and to question the value of these costly microbiological tests.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.094411232,-0.0595871,-0.014587068,-0.081355148,-0.019974537,-0.040968525,0.056103148,-0.012800335,0.013456965,0.010928391,-0.024930964,0.005669901,0.01634713,-0.11583249,0.200019038,0.23620046,0.352787579,0.025049174,-0.036052563,0.015601032,0.025254579,0.028605061,0.077462279,0.049311844,-0.04886912,0.063004198,-0.031047203,-0.02192294,0.052326353,0.080095536
Étude prospective de l’écologie virale hivernale dans un service de réanimation pédiatrique,"Résumé Le but de cette étude prospective était d’évaluer l’épidémiologie des virus respiratoires chez les enfants hospitalisés dans une unité de réanimation et de soins continus pédiatriques pendant 3 mois d’hiver, en 2012–2013. Ont été inclus tous les enfants admis en réanimation pédiatrique du centre hospitalier universitaire (CHU) de Caen et ayant bénéficié d’une recherche d’infection par un virus respiratoire à partir d’un prélèvement nasal analysé par amplification génique (PCR) multiplex. Sur 105 enfants admis, 84 répondaient aux critères d’inclusion. Trente-sept enfants présentaient un ou plusieurs symptômes respiratoires à l’admission. Cinquante-quatre échantillons étaient positifs (64,3 %) avec 70 virus détectés. Le virus dont la prévalence était la plus élevée était le virus respiratoire syncytial (VRS) (n =28 ; 40,0 %), suivi par le rhinovirus (n =24 ; 34,3 %). Parmi les enfants sans symptômes respiratoires, 42,6 % étaient infectés par un ou plusieurs virus. Aucune différence de durée d’hospitalisation, de durée de ventilation mécanique n’a été mise en évidence en fonction du virus détecté. La principale limite de cette étude est l’analyse par PCR, beaucoup plus sensible que d’autres méthodes de détection, notamment chez des sujets asymptomatiques sur le plan respiratoire. Cette étude révèle cependant un taux élevé d’infections respiratoires causées par des virus chez les enfants qui ne présentent pas de symptômes respiratoires à leur admission en unité de réanimation et soins continus. Elle suggère un intérêt du dépistage de ces infections virales à l’admission des enfants et un bénéfice à l’extension des mesures d’isolement pour tous les enfants en réanimation pédiatrique. Summary Introduction Viral respiratory infections are common in children, most of which are due to a virus. They can lead to serious infections, and these children may require treatment in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). This prospective study evaluated the epidemiology of respiratory viruses and associated illnesses among children hospitalized in a PICU during the three winter months of 2012–2013. Methods All the children admitted to the PICU, University Hospital of Caen, France, were included. Nasal swabs were collected and specimens were tested using a single real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction). Results Of the 105 patients admitted to the PICU during the study period, 84 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The “respiratory group” included 37 patients with respiratory symptoms at admission while the “nonrespiratory group” included 47 patients with no respiratory symptoms. The 84 nasal swabs collected included 54 that were considered positive (64.3%) and 70 viruses were detected. The most commonly detected virus was RSV (n =28; 40.0% positive samples), followed by HRV (n =24; 34.3%). Viruses were more frequently detected in the respiratory (86.5%) than in the nonrespiratory (42.6%) group (P <0.001). Statistical analysis by subgroups revealed that RSV infections were significantly more frequent in the respiratory group (54.1%) than in the nonrespiratory group (6.4%) (P <0.001). There was no difference for HRV (32.4% and 27.7%) or for the other viruses. No difference in duration of hospitalization or duration of mechanical ventilation was demonstrated depending on the virus detected. Discussion The use of the very sensitive multiplex PCR technique increased virus detection rates in both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. Conclusion We have confirmed the frequency of RSV infections in a PICU and found that many patients without respiratory symptoms have respiratory infections caused by viruses. The impact of these infections on patient outcome should now be analyzed in order to demonstrate the role played by respiratory viruses.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.181767076,-0.093186456,-0.049435201,-0.008570822,0.024664741,-0.074330908,0.043676946,-0.020987635,0.039026577,0.015569285,0.007378291,-0.021002516,0.000148381,-0.068845226,0.196957479,0.191518433,0.332737628,0.026265528,0.012206191,0.033199682,0.026511652,-0.020668894,0.024958116,0.036440644,-0.034545712,0.013047334,0.012226763,-0.039336504,-0.02309869,0.019214181
Association between multiple respiratory viral infections and pediatric intensive care unit admission among infants with bronchiolitis,"Abstract Background It is unclear whether multiple respiratory viral infections are associated with more severe bronchiolitis requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. We aimed to identify the association between multiple respiratory viral infections and PICU admission among infants with bronchiolitis. Methods We performed a 1:1 case-control study enrolling previously healthy full-term infants (≤12 months) with bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU as cases and those to the general pediatric ward as controls from 2015 to 2017. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for detection of the respiratory viruses. We summarized the characteristics of infants admitted to the PICU and the general pediatric unit. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to fit the association between multiple respiratory viral infections (≥2 strains) and PICU admission. Results A total of 135 infants admitted to the PICU were compared with 135 randomly selected control infants admitted to the general pediatric unit. The PICU patients were younger (median: 2.2 months, interquartile range: 1.3–4.2) than the general ward patients (median: 3.2 months, interquartile range: 1.6–6.4). Respiratory syncytial virus (74.1%), rhinovirus (28.9%), and coronavirus (5.9%) were the most common viruses for bronchiolitis requiring PICU admission. Patients with bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU tended to have multiple viral infections compared with patients on the general ward (23.0% vs. 10.4%, P <0.001). In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, bronchiolitis with multiple viral infections was associated with higher odds of PICU admission (adjusted odds ratio: 2.56, 95% confidence interval: 1.17–5.57, P =0.02). Conclusion Infants with multiviral bronchiolitis have higher odds of PICU admission compared with those with a single or nondetectable viral infection.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.123646662,-0.066456684,-0.06764704,-0.050706193,-0.018000935,-0.064272977,0.016810016,0.005959105,-0.006889868,0.012288022,-0.001666724,-0.006770675,-0.027231796,-0.029216708,0.012575643,0.056610843,0.029529083,-0.017395936,0.029823457,0.011173494,-0.036897687,-0.046801416,-0.05653598,0.025568572,0.022382879,-0.045753108,0.032851946,-0.048214996,-0.025235365,-0.010777848
A one-year prospective study of infectious etiology in patients hospitalized with acute exacerbations of COPD and concomitant pneumonia,"Summary Aim This study assessed the infectious etiology of patients hospitalized for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) with concomitant pneumonia. Methods Patients admitted to medical wards in an acute hospital were recruited prospectively from May 1, 2004 to April 30, 2005. Sputum culture, blood culture, paired serology, and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) viral culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies were performed. Spirometry was assessed in stable phase at 2–3 months post-hospital discharge. Results Seventy eight subjects were admitted for AECOPD with concomitant pneumonia. The mean (SD) age was 77.1 (7.5) years, with FEV1 of 41.5 (20.8)% predicted normal. Overall, an infectious etiology could be established in 48.7% of the subjects. Among the 71 subjects with sputum collected, 40.8% had positive bacterial culture. The commonest bacteria identified were Streptococcus pneumoniae (8[11.3%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7[9.9%]) and Haemophilus influenzae (7[9.9%]). Among the 66 subjects with NPA collected, 9.0 and 12.2% had positive viral culture and PCR results, respectively. The commonest viruses identified by NPA PCR were influenza A (4[6.1%] subjects) and rhinovirus (2[3.0%]). Paired serology was positive in 4.4%. Patients on high dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (>1000mcg beclomethasone-equivalent/day) had a higher rate of positive sputum bacterial culture than those on low-medium dose of ICS (50.0% vs 18.2%, p =0.02). Conclusion An infectious etiology could be established in about half of patients hospitalized with AECOPD and concomitant pneumonia. The majority of identifiable causes were bacterial. Patients on high dose ICS might have impaired airway defense as reflected by the higher rate of positive sputum culture.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.172109099,-0.053295921,-0.050154992,-0.106344889,-0.054626842,-0.04391031,-0.048964516,0.067304374,-0.165906117,0.071395914,-0.023652627,-0.009688566,-0.011162744,0.031684288,-0.04142872,-0.021364684,0.030703564,0.00821829,-0.01261322,-0.037029746,-0.008513126,0.018701882,0.085882244,0.013971986,-0.011099142,0.043112215,0.014999341,0.008136716,0.011831265,0.069176295
Angiotensin-converting enzyme polymorphism affects outcome of local Chinese with acute lung injury,"Summary Introduction Acute Lung Injury (ALI) with genetic predisposition is fatal. Relationship between angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D) polymorphism and the prognosis of local Chinese patients with ALI was investigated; meanwhile, the mechanisms involved were explored. Methods 101 ALI patients, 408 non-ALI patients and 236 healthy blood donors were enrolled. ACE I/D polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction, then ACE genotype (II, ID, DD) and allele (I, D) frequencies were compared. Clinical data of ALI patients was calculated. Also, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from healthy volunteers with different ACE genotypes. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ACE gene mRNA expression and ACE activity was measured. Results There was no significant difference in the frequencies of the genotypes and alleles. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score was higher in DD subgroup than in II subgroup (19.7 ± 8.7 and 15.6 ± 6.2; P < 0.05). The 28-day mortality was significantly different (17.4%, 26.8%, and 64.3% for II, ID, and DD; P = 0.013). DD genotype was the independent prognostic factor for 28-day outcome. Furthermore, LPS-induced ACE mRNA expression and ACE activity from PBMC in DD genotype subgroup were both significantly higher than those in the other two subgroups. Conclusions ACE I/D polymorphism is a prognostic factor for ALI. Patients with the DD genotype have higher mortality of ALI. Polymorphism influences the expression of ACE gene in LPS-stimulated PBMC, DD genotype leads to higher level of mRNA and enzyme activity. It may be one of the mechanisms involved.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.011179799,-0.024764607,-0.025445655,-0.146329183,-0.046133217,0.015433055,-0.008648444,-0.007561775,-0.03993603,-0.038491962,-0.038046078,0.031431532,-0.020085227,0.054048777,-0.039706536,0.03055927,-0.011232344,-0.024387767,-0.018021018,-0.037853968,0.038375278,-0.041992535,0.009299969,0.028161606,-0.031295475,-0.054330476,-0.009430745,-0.016585986,0.019151688,-0.026642617
The association between seasonal asthma exacerbations and viral respiratory infections in a pediatric population receiving inhaled corticosteroid therapy with or without long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist: A randomized study,"Abstract Background A seasonal peak in asthma exacerbations in the fall has previously been reported. The association between fall exacerbations and viral respiratory tract infections (RTI) remains uncertain. Objective To investigate the number of fall exacerbations and the incidence of RTIs in a pediatric asthmatic population using an at-home mucus collection methodology. Methods This was a 16-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group exploratory study. Children, 4–11 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of asthma requiring use of an inhaled corticosteroid, a morning peak expiratory flow ≥70% predicted and a history of ≥1 asthma exacerbation during the previous respiratory viral season were eligible for enrollment. Subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/SAL) 100/50 mcg or FP 100 mcg prior to starting school. Subjects collected mucus samples using an at-home kit when they experienced respiratory symptoms. Mucus samples obtained during symptomatic periods were analyzed for common respiratory viruses by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The number of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids was recorded. Results In total, 339 (FP/SAL, n = 171; FP, n = 168) subjects were randomized and included in the intent-to-treat population; 292 (86%) completed the study. Of the 537 mucus samples collected, 64% tested positive for viruses, but only 6% of positive samples were associated with an asthma exacerbation.

The clinical impact of pneumocystis and viral PCR testing on bronchoalveolar lavage in immunosuppressed patients,"Abstract Introduction Pulmonary infiltrates in immunosuppressed patients are common. Yields from bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has been reported to be between 31 and 65%. The clinical impact of pneumocystis and viral Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on BAL has not been extensively evaluated in a mixed immunosuppressed patient population. Methods We performed a retrospective chart review of immunosuppressed adults with pulmonary infiltrates who underwent BAL at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Only one BAL per patient was included. We compared the rate of positive PCR testing to conventional testing. We then investigated factors associated with positive PCR testing. Finally, we assessed for changes in antimicrobial therapy after bronchoscopy. Results Three hundred and fifty-nine patients underwent BAL with 249 patients having pneumocystis PCR testing and 142 having viral PCR testing. Pneumocystis identification occurred in 43 patients and viral species identification occurred in 56 patients. PCR testing increased pneumocystis identification compared to microscopy, 14% vs. 5%, p = 0.01, and viral identification compared to culture, 25% vs. 6%, p = 0.0001. Of the patients with positive pneumocystis PCR testing 49% had antibiotics stopped, 66% were started on anti-pneumocystis therapy, and only 6% did not receive treatment. There was no difference in the number of patients with antibiotics stopped based on viral PCR testing results. Discussion PCR testing increases BAL yield in immunosuppressed patients compared to conventional testing. Pneumocystis identified by PCR only may cause a self-limited infection and may not require antimicrobial therapy. PCR testing should be included in the evaluation of pulmonary infiltrates in immunosuppressed patients.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.117626,0.014112233,0.012668523,-0.085016296,-0.078882995,-0.034169871,-0.034153788,0.104758753,-0.132349283,0.063975547,-0.027738133,0.014074315,0.027971158,0.067427649,-0.021720921,-0.023369467,0.045369225,0.055754753,-0.034831276,-0.062727623,0.056541262,-0.025635118,0.006519734,-0.076011219,-0.016614942,-0.013316243,0.03404423,-0.077796235,0.000231039,0.042781096
Integrated microdevice of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with colorimetric immunochromatographic detection for rapid gene expression analysis of influenza A H1N1 virus,"Abstract An integrated microdevice of a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) reactor and an immunochromatographic strip was constructed for colorimetric detection of gene expression of influenza A virus subtype H1N1. An RT-PCR cocktail, which included Texas Red-labeled primers, dNTP including biotin-labeled dUTP, and RNA templates of influenza A H1N1 virus, was filled in the PCR chamber through the micropump, and the RT-PCR was performed to amplify the target H1 gene (102bp). The resultant amplicons bearing biotin moieties and Texas Red haptens were subsequently eluted to the immunochromatographic strip, in which they were first conjugated with the gold nanoparticle labeled anti-hapten antibody in the conjugation pad, and then captured on the streptavidin coated test line through the biotin–streptavidin interaction. By observing a violet color in the test line which was derived from the gold nanoparticle, we confirmed the H1N1 target virus. The entire process on the integrated microdevice consisting of a micropump, a 2μL PCR chamber, and an immunochromatographic strip was carried out on the portable genetic analyzer within 2.5h, enabling on-site colorimetric pathogen identification with detection sensitivity of 14.1pg RNA templates.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.000440876,0.02119137,0.151981736,0.105429498,-0.025242675,0.072264546,-0.096725927,0.006096045,-0.037375231,-0.063634328,0.001963276,-0.005383959,-0.006325786,0.052009761,-0.008680235,0.018507045,0.048954645,0.012981306,-0.046961754,-0.094564677,0.007072525,0.023716492,0.014844619,-0.025244955,-0.016192493,0.025607176,0.021130261,-0.013030518,0.032073854,0.046940006
Thermally stable and uniform DNA amplification with picosecond laser ablated graphene rapid thermal cycling device,"Abstract Rapid thermal cycling (RTC) in an on-chip device can perform DNA amplification in vitro through precise thermal control at each step of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This study reports a straightforward fabrication technique for patterning an on-chip graphene-based device with hole arrays, in which the mechanism of surface structures can achieve stable and uniform thermal control for the amplification of DNA fragments. A thin-film based PCR device was fabricated using picosecond laser (PS-laser) ablation of the multilayer graphene (MLG). Under the optimal fluence of 4.72 J/cm2 with a pulse overlap of 66%, the MLG can be patterned with arrays of 250 μm2 hole surface structures. A 354-bp DNA fragment of VP1, an effective marker for diagnosing the BK virus, was amplified on an on-chip device in less than 60 min. A thin-film electrode with the aforementioned MLG as the heater was demonstrated to significantly enhance temperature stability for each stage of the thermal cycle. The temperature control of the heater was performed by means of a developed programmable PCR apparatus. Our results demonstrated that the proposed integration of a graphene-based device and a laser-pulse ablation process to form a thin-film PCR device has cost benefits in a small-volume reagent and holds great promise for practical medical use of DNA amplification.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.032551736,0.02306439,0.142365103,-0.02213631,-0.068228766,0.001662052,0.029389213,0.004034307,-0.011242241,-0.007931913,-0.047613634,0.011179238,0.016092428,-0.080662069,-0.020466544,0.069760547,-0.043458254,-0.01606999,-0.029954468,-0.030330462,-0.03222195,-0.034125671,0.017348616,-0.044891398,-0.026018569,-0.03035096,-0.063393276,0.036189727,-0.025259899,0.05143336
Polyproteins in structural biology,"Polyproteins are chains of covalently conjoined smaller proteins that occur in nature as versatile means to organize the proteome of viruses including HIV. During maturation, viral polyproteins are typically cleaved into the constituent proteins with different biological functions by highly specific proteases, and structural analyses at defined stages of this maturation process can provide clues for antiviral intervention strategies. Recombinant polyproteins that use similar mechanisms are emerging as powerful tools for producing hitherto inaccessible protein targets such as the influenza polymerase, for high-resolution structure determination by X-ray crystallography. Conversely, covalent linking of individual protein subunits into single polypeptide chains are exploited to overcome sample preparation bottlenecks. Moreover, synthetic polyproteins provide a promising tool to dissect dynamic folding of polypeptide chains into three-dimensional architectures in single-molecule structure analysis by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The recent use of natural and synthetic polyproteins in structural biology and major achievements are highlighted in this contribution.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.093494955,-0.040952706,-0.012544725,0.008424168,-0.044463455,0.062068369,0.02338673,-0.01537915,0.014735413,0.004293169,-0.057231256,0.015935568,0.03233548,-0.077966266,-0.034637259,-0.041602223,0.034497434,-0.011535712,-0.035043681,0.017754519,-0.029904555,0.012881473,-0.038621647,-0.009110684,0.021044027,0.022767302,0.016535172,-0.035940635,0.0002832,0.002145433

Bat-derived influenza-like viruses H17N10 and H18N11,"Shorebirds and waterfowls are believed to be the reservoir hosts for influenza viruses, whereas swine putatively act as mixing vessels. The recent identification of two influenza-like virus genomes (designated H17N10 and H18N11) from bats has challenged this notion. A crucial question concerns the role bats might play in influenza virus ecology. Structural and functional studies of the two major surface envelope proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), demonstrate that neither has canonical HA or NA functions found in influenza viruses. However, putative functional modules and domains in other encoded proteins are conserved, and the N-terminal domain of the H17N10 polymerase subunit PA has a classical structure and function. Therefore, potential genomic reassortments of such influenza-like viruses with canonical influenza viruses cannot be excluded at this point and should be assessed.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.027446211,-0.106260722,-0.047954728,0.204646694,0.069154893,0.324605354,-0.033117028,0.016008981,-0.078889932,-0.094321393,-0.068729622,-0.02547038,0.011133769,-0.028139364,-0.038133506,-0.00972076,0.074124398,-0.052671275,-0.021538707,0.019589279,-0.014257696,-0.002547338,0.012758465,-0.035100923,-0.000786013,0.030004158,-0.048002779,-0.004275794,0.011556632,-0.026453313
Antiviral and cytotoxic activities of aminoarylazo compounds and aryltriazene derivatives,"Abstract Twelve aminoarylazocompounds (A–C) and 46 aryltriazene 7 derivatives (D–G) have been synthesized and evaluated in cell-based assays for cytotoxicity and antiviral activity against a panel of 10 RNA and DNA viruses. Eight aminoazocompounds and 27 aryltriazene derivatives exhibited antiviral activity, sometimes of high level, against one or more viruses. A marked activity against BVDV and YFV was prevailing among the former compounds, while the latter type of compounds affected mainly CVB-2 and RSV. None of the active compounds inhibited the multiplication of HIV-1, VSV and VV. Arranged in order of decreasing potency and selectivity versus the host cell lines, the best compounds are the following; BVDV: 1 > 7 > 8 > 4; YFV: 7 > 5; CVB-2: 25 > 56 > 18; RSV: 14 > 20 > 55 > 38 > 18 > 19; HSV-1: 2. For these compounds the EC50 ranged from 1.6μM (1) to 12μM (18), and the S. I. from 19.4 (1) to 4.2 (2). Thus the aminoarylazo and aryltriazene substructures appear as interesting molecular component for developing antiviral agents against ss RNA viruses, particularly against RSV and BVDV, which are important human and veterinary pathogens. Finally, molecular modeling investigations indicated that compounds of structure A–C, active against BVDV, could work targeting the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), having been observed a good agreement between the trends of the estimated IC50 and the experimental EC50 values.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.069404609,-0.058545793,-0.037758044,0.062631817,-0.084899747,0.017291535,0.104598151,-0.018381931,0.033922518,0.020557551,0.047469769,0.032790175,-0.069824146,-0.007077986,-0.018942272,-0.020248227,-0.022801265,0.102068274,0.080028169,-0.044922547,7.31E-07,-0.011606243,0.014380166,0.011563211,0.061189583,-0.044522611,0.130484869,0.012219672,0.012239591,0.035328411
CRISPR-Cas13a mediated nanosystem for attomolar detection of canine parvovirus type 2,"Abstract Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) infection is the most lethal disease of dogs with higher mortality in puppies worldwide. In today’s world, dogs are an integral part of our communities as well as dogs breeding and rearing has become a lucrative business. Therefore, a fast, accurate, portable, and cost-effective CPV-2 detection method with the ability for on-site detection is highly desired. In this study, we for the first time proposed a nanosystem for CPV-2 DNA detection with RNA-guided RNA endonuclease Cas13a, which upon activation results in collateral RNA degradation. We expressed LwCas13a in prokaryotic expression system and purified it through nickel column. Activity of Cas13a was verified by RNA-bound fluorescent group while using a quenched fluorescent probe as signals. Further Cas13a was combined with Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and T7 transcription to establish molecular detection system termed specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter un-locking (SHERLOCK) for sensitive detection of CPV-2 DNA. This nanosystem can detect 100 amol/L CPV-2 DNA within 30 min. The proposed nanosystem exhibited high specificity when tested for CPV-2 and other dog viruses. This CRISPR-Cas13a mediated sensitive detection approach can be of formidable advantage during CPV-2 outbreaks because it is time-efficient, less laborious and does not involve the use of sophisticated instruments.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.055553487,0.028024526,0.183007506,0.033763478,-0.061665122,-0.051606879,0.055931729,0.017663165,-0.032995534,-0.030714905,-0.000562575,0.026219125,-0.018041274,-0.071688972,-0.000969569,0.043576066,-0.081404044,-0.119753513,0.136906017,0.062152597,0.155469794,0.066278532,-0.051048757,-0.078622088,0.084613759,-0.150815067,-0.128555032,0.046335719,-0.079094066,0.097925762
Altered regulatory cytokine profiles in cases of pediatric respiratory syncytial virus infection,"Abstract Objectives Regulatory cytokines are associated with viral infection. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relation between serum regulatory cytokines concentrations and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease. Methods We enrolled 325 children aged < 24 months who were diagnosed with acute respiratory tract infection. Twenty age-matched healthy children were enrolled as controls. Nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed to identify virus by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and blood samples were taken to quantify the regulatory cytokine concentrations, including interleukin (IL)-35, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 using the Bio-Plex immunoassay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results RSV disease was associated with a great regulatory cytokine response than healthy children, among 89 RSV-infected patients, serum IL-35 (P = .0001) and IL-10 (P = .006) was significantly elevated in comparison with healthy controls. Young children (0< age ≤6 months) with RSV infection had significantly lower IL-35 and IL-10 expression but needed more oxygen therapy and more severe disease comparing with older children (12< age <24 months). Comparing with mild group, the expression levels of IL-10 were significantly lower in children with moderate and severe disease (P = .012 and P = .005, respectively). And levels of IL-10 was inversely associated with total duration of RSV infection symptoms (r = − 0.311, P = .019). Conclusion Children with RSV infected had increased serum regulatory cytokine IL-10 and IL-35 concentrations. Elevated expression of IL-10 and IL-35 were contributed to protect hypoxia and reduce the severity of disease.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.136614761,-0.095575989,-0.056920043,-0.117238196,-0.048542126,-0.082691713,0.065230943,-0.124508653,0.126137302,-0.127795427,0.0145337,-0.10012292,-0.129283838,0.04688742,-0.099332392,0.037711604,-0.040676108,-0.032296038,-0.007743027,-0.068738938,-0.013080588,-0.08227975,0.08021228,-0.015500729,-0.057743309,-0.105457001,0.173886887,0.063392895,0.014390864,0.041276259
"The Genome Organization of the Nidovirales: Similarities and Differences between Arteri-, Toro-, and Coronaviruses","Abstract Viruses in the families Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae have enveloped virions which contain nonsegmented, positive-stranded RNA, but the constituent genera differ markedly in genetic complexity and virion structure. Nevertheless, there are striking resemblances among the viruses in the organization and expression of their genomes, and sequence conservation among the polymerase polyproteins strongly suggests that they have a common ancestry.

Recombination and Coronavirus Defective Interfering RNAs,"Abstract Naturally occurring defective interfering RNAs have been found in 4 of 14 coronavirus species. They range in size from 2.2 kb to approximately 25 kb, or 80% of the 30-kb parent virus genome. The large DI RNAs do not in all cases appear to require helper virus for intracellular replication and it has been postulated that they may on their own function as agents of disease. Coronavirus DI RNAs appear to arise by internal deletions (through nonhomologous recombination events) on the virus genome or on DI RNAs of larger size by a polymerase strand-switching (copy-choice) mechanism. In addition to their use in the study of virus RNA replication and virus assembly, coronavirus DI RNAs are being used in a major way to study the mechanism of a high-frequency, site-specific RNA recombination event that leads to leader acquisition during virus replication (i.e., the leader fusion event that occurs during synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs, and the leader-switching event that can occur during DI RNA replication), a distinguishing feature of coronaviruses (and arteriviruses).

Nucleic acid detection using G-quadruplex amplification methodologies,"Abstract In the last decade, there has been an explosion in the use of G-quadruplex labels to detect various analytes, including DNA/RNA, proteins, metals and other metabolites. In this review, we focus on strategies for the detection of nucleic acids, using G-quadruplexes as detection labels or as enzyme labels that amplify detection signals. Methods to detect other analytes are briefly mentioned.

Visual detection of Flavivirus RNA in living cells,"Abstract Flaviviruses include a wide range of important human pathogens delivered by insects or ticks. These viruses have a positive-stranded RNA genome that is replicated in the cytoplasm of the infected cell. The viral RNA genome is the template for transcription by the virally encoded RNA polymerase and for translation of the viral proteins. Furthermore, the double-stranded RNA intermediates of viral replication are believed to trigger the innate immune response through interaction with cytoplasmic cellular sensors. Therefore, understanding the subcellular distribution and dynamics of Flavivirus RNAs is of paramount importance to understand the interaction of the virus with its cellular host, which could be of insect, tick or mammalian, including human, origin. Recent advances on the visualization of Flavivirus RNA in living cells together with the development of methods to measure the dynamic properties of viral RNA are reviewed and discussed in this essay. In particular the application of bleaching techniques such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) are analysed in the context of tick-borne encephalitis virus replication. Conclusions driven by this approached are discussed in the wider context Flavivirus infection.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.181116483,-0.070247001,-0.066222485,0.116385602,-0.064552412,-0.043042343,0.059969264,0.02293038,-0.008161833,0.073331975,0.0260644,-0.062793872,0.041801614,0.080240412,0.038776514,0.012205463,-0.021673614,-0.030670602,-0.029852436,0.054570374,-0.05159651,0.061998559,-0.063195975,-0.037647019,-0.040587106,-0.053136965,0.013176193,-0.005098335,-0.044144699,0.035292881
Hesperetin protects crayfish Procambarus clarkii against white spot syndrome virus infection,"Abstract Hesperetin is a natural flavanone compound, which mainly exists in lemons and oranges, and has potential antiviral and anticancer activities. In this study, hesperetin was used in a crayfish pathogen challenge to discover its effects on the innate immune system of invertebrates. The crayfish Procambarus clarkii was used as an experimental model and challenged with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). Pathogen challenge experiments showed that hesperetin treatment significantly reduced the mortality caused by WSSV infection, while the VP28 copies of WSSV were also reduced. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction revealed that hesperetin increased the expression of several innate immune-related genes, including NF-kappaB and C-type lectin. Further analysis showed that hesperetin treatment plays a positive effects on three immune parameters like total hemocyte count, phenoloxidase and superoxide dismutase activity. Nevertheless, whether or not infected with WSSV, hesperetin treatment would significantly increase the hemocyte apoptosis rates in crayfish. These results indicated that hesperetin could regulate the innate immunity of crayfish, and delaying and reducing the mortality after WSSV challenge. Therefore, the present study provided novel insights into the potential therapeutic or preventive functions associated with hesperetin to regulate crayfish immunity and protect crayfish against WSSV infection, provide certain theoretical basis for production practice.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.03946168,-0.012362073,-0.004997649,-0.097240641,-0.074868239,0.074195964,0.050161309,-0.01644294,0.046196608,-0.00519777,-0.026329608,-0.015996747,-0.005005382,0.046118588,-0.001319765,-0.00712973,-0.022818779,-0.004441889,-0.02547805,-0.022523674,0.033386701,-0.012605372,-0.004646403,0.010295376,-0.019782159,-0.018817206,0.017254172,0.004544472,0.046575253,-0.045834281
Assessment of Adenovirus Infection in Adult Lung Transplant Recipients Using Molecular Surveillance,"Background Little is known about adenovirus infections in adult lung transplant recipients. Because the virus can establish latency, re-activation may be relatively common after transplantation. Methods We assessed adenovirus infection in 80 adult lung transplant recipients. Adenovirus polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR assay; limit of detection ∼25 copies/ml plasma) was done on plasma samples collected at regular intervals until 1 year post-transplant. Results Adenovirus DNA was detected in 18 of 80 patients (22.5%) and in 19 of 595 (3.4%) plasma samples up to 12 months post-transplant. Median time to detection of viremia was 134 days post-transplant (range 1 to 370 days). Median viral load was 180 copies/ml plasma (range 50 to 360 copies/ml). Symptoms were evaluated at the time of adenovirus detection: 14 of 18 (78%) patients were asymptomatic; 4 of 18 (22%) patients had otherwise unexplained febrile/flu-like illness that resolved spontaneously. Adenovirus was not found to be a trigger for acute rejection. No detrimental effect on pulmonary function was seen immediately after adenovirus infection. Conclusions Adenovirus viremia is common in adult lung transplant recipients. In contrast to findings on adenoviral pneumonitis in lung transplant recipients, isolated episodes of low-level viremia are self-limited and do not trigger acute rejection or a decline in pulmonary function.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.10309724,-0.019502032,0.019446868,-0.081063811,-0.036247176,-0.04697898,0.021162531,0.011179874,-0.054977264,0.0012088,-0.023353509,-0.01179874,-0.031412167,0.038589623,0.001977476,-0.019254701,-0.020641789,-0.019329189,0.052737988,-0.030253286,0.030779882,0.002691517,-0.022690521,-0.002733296,-0.04862836,-0.007111741,-0.017886962,0.042242157,-0.059971097,-0.002368152

Molecular Screening by Polymerase Chain Reaction Detects Panleukopenia Virus DNA in Formalin-Fixed Hearts from Cats with Idiopathic Cardiomyopathy and Myocarditis,"Abstract Viral myocarditis has been suggested as an etiology for cardiomyopathy in several mammalian species. Myocarditis and idiopathic cardiomyopathy have been reported in the domestic cat, although a viral etiology has not been demonstrated. Because of the continuing interest in the potential relationship between viral myocarditis and cardiomyopathy, we evaluated hearts from cats with spontaneous, idiopathic cardiomyopathy for viral genomic material within myocytes by polymerase chain reaction, and for the presence of myocarditis by light microscopy. Thirty-one (31) formalin-fixed hearts from domestic cats who died of idiopathic cardiomyopathy were randomly selected from pathology archives. Seventeen (17) formalin-fixed hearts from healthy cats were similarly selected as normal controls. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to evaluate myocardial tissue for the presence of viral genome from feline panleukopenia virus, herpes virus, calici virus, and corona virus. Hearts were examined using light microscopy for histologic evidence of myocarditis according to the Dallas criteria. Panleukopenia virus was identified by PCR in 10 of 31 cats with cardiomyopathy but in none of the controls. Neither cardiomyopathic or control cats tested positive by PCR for herpes virus, calici virus, and corona virus. Myocarditis was detected by histologic examination in 18 of 31 cardiomyopathic cats and in none of 17 control cats. Myocarditis and or feline panleukopenia virus genome was detected in felines with idiopathic hypertrophic, dilated, and restrictive cardiomyopathy, suggesting a possible role of viral infection and inflammation in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy in this species.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.01236592,-0.030948843,0.039807888,-0.111029751,0.005746223,0.023643468,0.038572136,-0.00157474,-0.04462871,-0.069054685,0.221360656,-0.114548957,0.126707921,-0.013595165,-0.037088765,-0.02885346,0.02848808,-0.015986548,0.003915092,0.051927672,-0.019826605,0.000830463,0.024648681,0.025427743,-0.027225362,0.02856319,0.005017344,0.005715743,-0.009465011,0.017743285
Chlamydia pneumoniae and Exacerbations of Asthma in Adults,"Background Chlamydia pneumoniae is a frequent causative agent of acute respiratory disease and has been recently reported as a possible case of asthma. Objective We assessed the prevalence of C. pneumoniae infections in adult patients with acute exacerbations of asthma. Methods One hundred sixty-eight adult patients with acute exacerbations of asthma and 108 control subjects matched for age, sex, and smoking status were studied. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained from all subjects and analyzed by isolation in cell culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for C. pneumoniae. Serum samples were also obtained and tested for C. pneumoniae-specific antibodies by the microimmunofluorescence test. Results C. pneumoniae was isolated from two (1.2%) asthma patients and none from controls and detected by PCR from nine (5.4%) cases and one (0.9%) control. Both culture positive specimens were also positive in PCR. Further, serologic evidence of acute C. pneumoniae infection was present in 15 (8.9%) of asthma patients and in three (2.8%) of controls (P = .048). The prevalence of C. pneumoniae-specific IgG and IgA was significantly higher in asthma cases than in controls (IgG >/= 1:16; 85.1% versus 67.6%, P = .001; IgA ≥ 1:16: 47.6% versus 16.7%, P < .001). Mean titer of IgG and IgA was also significantly greater in asthma cases than in controls (IgG: 38.8 versus 18.1, P = .0001; IgA: 17.2 versus 6.1, P = .0001). Conclusion Our data suggest that C. pneumoniae infection may trigger acute exacerbations of adult asthma.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.162810351,-0.037988032,-0.041464714,-0.126546331,-0.040979396,-0.077496313,-0.011824378,0.027289108,-0.111654011,0.044790718,-0.028294495,-0.020666031,-0.027759565,0.001935999,-0.001247545,0.006269577,0.035706358,-0.06695602,0.030462469,-0.081685407,-0.021272545,-0.072219107,0.060847752,0.046813369,0.01855471,0.135220134,-0.047486065,0.018067114,0.116785231,0.109620886
Detection of respiratory viruses in adult patients with perennial allergic rhinitis,"Abstract Background The symptoms of allergic rhinitis may be worsened by a viral respiratory infection. However, there are few data on the presence of respiratory virus in patients with allergic rhinitis. Objective To evaluate whether patients with allergic rhinitis have an increased frequency of respiratory virus detection in a prospective case–control study. Methods Fifty-eight adult patients diagnosed with perennial allergic rhinitis were evaluated from September 2011 through June 2012. A control group of 61 adult patients without allergy was included. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to detect respiratory viruses in nasal lavage samples. Results Respiratory viruses were detected in 25 of 58 patients (43.1%) with perennial allergic rhinitis, but in only 15 of 61 control patients (24.6%). In virus-positive samples, multiple viruses were detected in 9 of 25 patients (36.0%) with perennial allergic rhinitis but in only 2 of 15 control patients (12.5%). Rhinovirus was the most common virus in patients without allergy and those with allergic rhinitis. There were significant differences in the detection rates of overall and multiple respiratory viruses and rhinovirus between the 2 groups (P < .05). However, in patients with allergic rhinitis, there was no statistically significant association between the detection of respiratory viruses and symptom scores. Conclusion This study shows that there is a high prevalence of respiratory viruses, especially rhinovirus, in patients with allergic rhinitis. Subsequent studies are needed to determine the clinical significance of highly prevalent respiratory viruses in patients with allergic rhinitis.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.157845753,-0.047906209,-0.060684681,-0.041398351,-0.005795139,-0.055523478,-0.017574084,0.059491441,-0.092750342,0.06256515,-0.031433043,0.004699932,0.013698001,0.061939632,0.007363464,-0.025233197,0.041515685,-0.036475522,0.038287381,0.033599138,0.047765565,-0.112545935,-0.026775789,0.044861958,-0.010123207,-0.005535121,-0.027402702,-0.017687544,-0.038592132,-0.048972124
Viral Respiratory Tract Infections in Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Recipients in the Era of Molecular Testing,"Abstract Viral respiratory tract infection (vRTI) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). This study aimed to assess the epidemiologic characteristics, risk factors, and outcomes of vRTI occurring in the period from conditioning to 100 days after allo-HSCT in the era of molecular testing. This study was a retrospective record review of patients who underwent allo-HSCT at Royal Melbourne Hospital between January 2010 and December 2015. Symptomatic patients were tested using respiratory multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to identify risk factors for vRTI and the risk of death or intensive care unit (ICU) admission, respectively. A total of 382 patients were reviewed, and 65 episodes of vRTI were identified in 56 patients (14.7%). Rhinovirus accounted for the majority of infections (69.2%). The majority of episodes presented initially with upper respiratory tract infection (58.5%), with 28.9% of them progressing to lower respiratory tract infection. Eleven episodes (16.9%) were associated with ICU admission. There were no deaths directly due to vRTI. Previous autologous HSCT was associated with an increased risk of vRTI (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 4.1). The risks of death (P = .47) or ICU admission (P = .65) were not significantly different by vRTI status. vRTI is common in the first 100 days after allo-HSCT and is associated with ICU admission.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.127125379,-0.03932263,-0.073941233,-0.09194551,-0.034281119,-0.040508021,-0.01422101,0.050690044,-0.03516256,0.009548863,-0.019926079,0.026566225,-0.012525204,0.022695607,-0.01484174,0.034054562,0.011381338,-0.010690631,0.019834189,0.023408532,0.000559453,-0.092299845,-0.05463128,0.011167427,0.026152386,-0.047720824,-0.01798285,-0.061300713,-0.030911165,-0.022616496
Identification of porcine circovirus type 2 in retrospective cases of pigs naturally infected with porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus,"Abstract The identification of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) was studied in fresh intestinal tissues by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in formalin-fixed, paraffin-wax-embedded intestinal tissues by in situ hybridisation. The tissues came from pigs naturally infected with porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV). A total of 35 (32.7%) of 107 small intestinal samples from pigs naturally infected with PEDV were found to be positive using PCR. Positive signals for PCV2 were detected in 32 (29.9%) of 107 small intestinal samples from pigs naturally infected with PEDV by in situ hybridisation. The distribution of positive cells in the jejunum and ileum was multifocal or patchy. Distinct positive labelling was found throughout the lamina propria in the small intestines. The results of this study indicate that PCV2 is highly prevalent in pigs naturally infected with PEDV.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.016319655,0.000153453,0.097757138,-0.131248193,0.043156027,0.031662775,-0.016914711,-0.031731278,-0.005889933,-0.054390526,0.083894008,0.048778371,-0.141660904,0.091284978,0.296956288,-0.181569549,-0.032711282,0.012087317,-0.041562366,0.115229998,-0.142221452,-0.047792849,0.086068834,-0.072222575,-0.025256721,-0.028099374,-0.071471727,0.025823915,0.036556127,-0.024741661
Genetic differentiation of the nucleocapsid protein of Korean isolates of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus by RT-PCR based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis,"Abstract A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis based on the nucleocapsid (N) gene was developed to differentiate between field isolates of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) and a vaccine strain, J-vac. Thirteen field isolates of PEDV from Korea were distinguishable from the vaccine strain and the prototype PEDV strain CV777 by RFLP using Tru9I. RFLP patterns in 11 of 13 field PEDV isolates were different from the vaccine strain using AspLEI, HgaI and MspR9I. Sequence analysis of the PEDV N gene revealed that Korean field PEDV isolates had 93.6% and 89.6% identity with the vaccine virus at nucleotide and amino acid sequence levels, respectively, suggesting progressive point mutations of the PEDV genome in the field. RFLP analysis of the PEDV N gene is a promising tool for distinguishing field strains from the vaccine-derived virus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.064951305,0.007637615,0.134226291,-0.128161148,0.129016892,0.074477523,-0.093960523,-0.050211173,0.027406881,0.008694321,0.03917603,0.133426953,-0.180718274,-0.026014501,0.243691552,-0.232751785,-0.078104258,0.0648314,-0.075643567,0.217602513,-0.142069604,-0.095565938,0.142925991,0.014281344,-0.053308614,-0.050016475,0.014158469,0.01391247,0.046125004,0.03982578
Current perspectives on the diagnosis and epidemiology of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infection,"Abstract Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is the principal aetiological agent of enzootic pneumonia (EP), a chronic respiratory disease that affects mainly finishing pigs. Although major efforts to control M. hyopneumoniae infection and its detrimental effects have been made, significant economic losses in pig production worldwide due to EP continue. M. hyopneumoniae is typically introduced into pig herds by the purchase of subclinically infected animals or, less frequently, through airborne transmission over short distances. Once in the herd, M. hyopneumoniae may be transmitted by direct contact from infected sows to their offspring or between pen mates. The ‘gold standard’ technique used to diagnose M. hyopneumoniae infection, bacteriological culture, is laborious and is seldom used routinely. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction detection methods, in addition to post-mortem inspection in the form of abattoir surveillance or field necropsy, are the techniques most frequently used to investigate the potential involvement of M. hyopneumoniae in porcine respiratory disease. Such techniques have been used to monitor the incidence of M. hyopneumoniae infection in herds both clinically and subclinically affected by EP, in vaccinated and non-vaccinated herds and under different production and management conditions. Differences in the clinical course of EP at farm level and in the efficacy of M. hyopneumoniae vaccination suggest that the transmission and virulence characteristics of different field isolates of M. hyopneumoniae may vary. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of the epidemiology of M. hyopneumoniae infection including its transmission, infection and seroconversion dynamics and also compares the various epidemiological tools used to monitor EP.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.010539822,-0.009290088,0.034602826,-0.076345974,-0.021643496,0.049256286,0.03422892,0.004164751,0.017617774,0.02381316,0.004193602,0.008665883,-0.007049492,-0.039283264,0.060766485,-0.004734875,-0.032143676,0.011098847,-0.035986682,0.022743826,-0.009597631,-0.02824016,0.007218056,-0.03241009,0.018187404,-0.007488536,-0.031367016,0.007905106,-0.002669582,-0.012041131
"Evaluation of rapid assays for the detection of bovine coronavirus, rotavirus A and Cryptosporidium parvum in faecal samples of calves","Abstract Rapid immunochromatographic assays for detecting infections with bovine coronavirus (BCV), rotavirus A and Cryptosporidium parvum in calf faeces were evaluated using as gold standards a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (BCV and rotavirus) and a sedimentation-flotation technique (C. parvum). Rapid tests for the detection of BCV and rotavirus showed a high specificity (96.4% and 95.3%, respectively), but a relatively low sensitivity (60.0% and 71.9%, respectively). Sensitivity and specificity for detection of C. parvum were high (100% and 94.6%, respectively).",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.01484529,0.02718849,0.132796044,-0.033705254,-0.01928357,-0.008154381,0.013798608,-0.003033686,-0.009198321,-0.043487317,-0.00380711,0.039386789,-0.01761931,-0.055186673,0.004832245,0.012186381,-0.013583134,-0.017073144,0.019211434,-0.059098853,-0.031990924,-0.015156935,0.008280703,0.013865152,0.064470327,-0.030924388,-0.029993047,-0.093643505,-0.046940836,-0.012674299
Tracing the transmission of bovine coronavirus infections in cattle herds based on S gene diversity,"Abstract Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is found worldwide and causes respiratory infections and diarrhoea in calves and adult cattle. In order to investigate the molecular epidemiology of BCoV, 27 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive samples from 25 cattle herds in different parts of Sweden were analysed. A 1038-nucleotide fragment was PCR amplified and directly sequenced. The analysed BCoV strains showed a high sequence identity, regardless of whether they were obtained from outbreaks of respiratory disease or diarrhoea or from calves or adult cattle. Circulation of an identical BCoV strain during a 4-month period was demonstrated in calves in one dairy herd. In a regional epizootic of winter dysentery in Northern Sweden, highly similar BCoV strains were detected. In the Southern and Central regions, several genotypes of BCoV circulated contemporaneously, indicating that in these regions, which had a higher density of cattle than the Northern regions, more extensive transmission of the virus was occurring. Identical BCoV sequences supported the epidemiological data that inter-herd contact through purchased calves was important. Swedish BCoV strains unexpectedly showed a high homology with recently detected Italian strains. This study shows that molecular analysis of the spike (S) glycoprotein gene of BCoV can be a useful tool to support or rule out suspected transmission routes.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.009687707,0.007520723,0.079412602,-0.074227579,0.104503291,0.009851092,-0.026775197,-0.009333224,0.010760072,-0.004381493,0.022881186,0.059004634,-0.029273504,-0.024995423,0.053123564,-0.032792809,-0.007332683,0.01835152,0.013170796,-0.033214204,0.058962334,0.007687578,-0.053144121,0.022034397,0.061166028,-0.01086471,0.001346164,-0.084966607,0.061153237,0.002202119
Detection of animal pathogens by using the polymerasechain reaction (PCR),"Summary The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a nucleic acid-based technique that enables the rapid and sensitive detection of specific micro-organisms. Although this technique is widely used in veterinary research, it has not yet found applications in routine microbiological analysis of veterinary clinical samples. However, advances in sample preparation together with the increasing availability of specific gene sequences will probably lead to the more widespread diagnostic use of PCR in the future. PCR is likely to have a strong impact in the epidemiology, treatment and prevention of animal infectious diseases.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.016596266,0.04918527,0.181402902,-0.003254564,-0.027951667,0.015898707,0.028588913,0.003739584,-0.004537702,0.077951554,-0.033946888,-0.021183893,0.097607321,-0.099645532,0.015644867,-0.009667697,-0.022490222,0.039694208,-0.069029391,-0.094780182,-0.023983791,-0.027544237,0.038799209,-0.097590141,0.000647468,-0.038800253,-0.013097033,-0.049404281,0.003141267,0.063183202
Prevalence and Genetic Pattern of Feline Coronaviruses in Urban Cat Populations,"Abstract The prevalence and phylogeny of feline coronaviruses were studied in urban cat populations by sampling of 113 clinically healthy cats. Rectal swab samples were subjected to a nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, specific for the conservative nucleocapsid region of the virus genome. More than 30% of the sampled animals proved positive for the presence of feline coronaviruses. The nucleotide sequences of amplified 440 bp products were determined, aligned and the phylogenetic analysis revealed noticeable genetic clusters among the prevalent feline coronaviruses in the surveyed geographic area.

In-silico screening for anti-Zika virus phytochemicals,"Abstract Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus that has infected hundreds of thousands of people and is a rapidly expanding epidemic across Central and South America. ZIKV infection has caused serious, albeit rare, complications including Guillain–Barré syndrome and congenital microcephaly. There are currently no vaccines or antiviral agents to treat or prevent ZIKV infection, but there are several ZIKV non-structural proteins that may serve as promising antiviral drug targets. In this work, we have carried out an in-silico search for potential anti-Zika viral agents from natural sources. We have generated ZIKV protease, methyltransferase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase using homology modeling techniques and we have carried out molecular docking analyses of our in-house virtual library of phytochemicals with these protein targets as well as with ZIKV helicase. Overall, 2263 plant-derived secondary metabolites have been docked. Of these, 43 compounds that have drug-like properties have exhibited remarkable docking profiles to one or more of the ZIKV protein targets, and several of these are found in relatively common herbal medicines, suggesting promise for natural and inexpensive antiviral therapy for this emerging tropical disease.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.090377659,-0.014482767,-0.016179029,-0.013741318,-0.083673671,0.06623084,0.069395968,-0.003003894,0.035713582,0.035951916,-0.017914606,0.023121809,0.027670096,-0.050377895,0.005031857,-0.024490215,-0.008007577,0.097380823,0.017362731,0.036321457,-0.024939196,0.008966472,-0.044126571,0.016101456,0.056726421,0.035277881,0.039193019,-0.025697787,0.025263187,0.041613523
"Visualization of protein sequence space with force-directed graphs, and their application to the choice of target-template pairs for homology modelling","Abstract The protein sequence-structure gap results from the contrast between rapid, low-cost deep sequencing, and slow, expensive experimental structure determination techniques. Comparative homology modelling may have the potential to close this gap by predicting protein structure in target sequences using existing experimentally solved structures as templates. This paper presents the first use of force-directed graphs for the visualization of sequence space in two dimensions, and applies them to the choice of suitable RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) target-template pairs within human-infective RNA virus genera. Measures of centrality in protein sequence space for each genus were also derived and used to identify centroid nearest-neighbour sequences (CNNs) potentially useful for production of homology models most representative of their genera. Homology modelling was then carried out for target-template pairs in different species, different genera and different families, and model quality assessed using several metrics. Reconstructed ancestral RdRP sequences for individual genera were also used as templates for the production of ancestral RdRP homology models. High quality ancestral RdRP models were consistently produced, as were good quality models for target-template pairs in the same genus. Homology modelling between genera in the same family produced mixed results and inter-family modelling was unreliable. We present a protocol for the production of optimal RdRP homology models for use in further experiments, e.g. docking to discover novel anti-viral compounds.

Whole blood cytokine profiles in cats infected by feline coronavirus and healthy non-FCoV infected specific pathogen-free cats,"In this study, the cytokine profiles of clinically healthy cats naturally infected with feline coronavirus (FCoV), of cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and of specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats were investigated in whole blood using a traditional reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and a semi-quantitative method of analysis based on computerised quantification of positive bands. The low inter-assay coefficient of variation recorded demonstrated that this method is highly repeatable. Compared with SPF cats, cytokine production was upregulated in most of the samples from FCoV-positive non-symptomatic cats. The appearance of a case of FIP in the cattery was associated with an increased expression of cytokines, in particular there was an increased production of IL-1β and IFN-γ, suggesting that these cytokines might protect infected cats from the disease. This hypothesis was also supported by the low levels of IFN-γ recorded in blood from cats with FIP.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.01353442,0.020156202,0.134224925,-0.217994362,-0.024079037,0.026368819,0.044901878,-0.026573543,-0.027022821,-0.205816714,0.485762825,-0.185304006,0.244982602,0.010405936,-0.168690414,-0.03519026,0.05181665,-0.02588386,-0.007354806,0.066592445,-0.029210963,-0.047159591,0.089309398,0.035030473,-0.05868063,0.034976349,0.01825176,0.05358794,0.039814511,-0.033071749
The detection of feline coronaviruses in blood samples from cats by mRNA RT-PCR,"In this study, 26 blood samples were collected from 25 healthy cats and one cat with clinical signs suggestive of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), namely, fever, weight loss, enlarged abdomen, and ascites. Blood samples were tested for feline coronavirus (FCoV) messenger RNA (mRNA) by an reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay which has previously been described to have a high specificity in the diagnosis of clinical FIP [Simons AF, Vennema H, Rofina JE, Pol JM, Horzinek MC, Rottier PJM, Egberink HF (2005) A mRNA PCR for the diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis. Journal of Virological Methods 124, 111–116]. Overall we found 14 (54%) of the cats were positive for FCoV including the cat with clinical disease, but the high rate of positivity among healthy cats suggested a poor specificity for the clinical diagnosis of FIP among these cats. It was observed that the positivity rate was highest in cats aged between 6 months–1 year old.

Pathogenesis of feline enteric coronavirus infection,"Fifty-one specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats 10 weeks to 13 years of age were infected with a cat-to-cat fecal–oral passed strain of feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). Clinical signs ranged from unapparent to a mild and self-limiting diarrhea. Twenty-nine of these cats were FECV naïve before infection and followed sequentially for fecal virus shedding and antibody responses over a period of 8–48 months. Fecal shedding, as determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from rectal swabs, appeared within a week and was significantly higher in kittens than older cats. FECV shedding remained at high levels for 2–10 months before eventually evolving into one of three excretion patterns. Eleven cats shed the virus persistently at varying levels over an observation period of 9–24 months. Eleven cats appeared to have periods of virus shedding interlaced with periods of non-shedding (intermittent or recurrent shedders), and seven cats ceased shedding after 5–19 months (average 12 months). There was no change in the patterns of virus shedding among cats that were excreting FECV at the time of a secondary challenge exposure. Four cats, which had ceased shedding, re-manifested a primary type infection when secondarily infected. Cats with higher feline coronavirus (FCoV) antibody titers were significantly more likely to shed virus, while cats with lower titers were significantly less likely to be shedding. Twenty-two kittens born to experimentally infected project queens began shedding virus spontaneously, but never before 9–10 weeks of age. Natural kittenhood infections appeared to be low grade and abortive. However, a characteristic primary type infection occurred following experimental infection with FECV at 12–15 weeks of age. Pregnancy, parturition and lactation had no influence on fecal shedding by queens. Methylprednisolone acetate treatment did not induce non-shedders to shed and shedders to increase shedding.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.018812336,-0.018974104,0.043407432,-0.177579302,0.011892621,0.022980106,0.039566696,-0.024101825,-0.018171066,-0.163290156,0.363763204,-0.123463233,0.157930842,-0.017218568,-0.066437755,-0.027474439,0.027902338,-0.000166248,0.018337915,0.07900011,-0.034136648,-0.034433529,0.026163817,0.024442173,-0.009955173,0.030859733,0.042939851,0.010219197,-0.001805303,0.006132191
Association between faecal shedding of feline coronavirus and serum α1-acid glycoprotein sialylation,"The sialylation pattern of serum α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) in non-symptomatic cats infected by feline coronavirus (FCoV) and its possible relationship with the amount of FCoVs shed in faeces were investigated. Blood from three specific pathogen-free cats (group A) and from 10 non-symptomatic FCoV-positive cats from catteries with low (group B, three cats) or high (group C, seven cats) levels of faecal shedding were collected monthly. AGP was purified from serum and Western blotting followed by lectin-staining of α(2,3)-linked and α(2,6)-linked sialic acid. Faecal shedding was quantified in group C by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Variations of AGP sialylation were recorded only in cats from group C, on which viral shedding peaked before the occurrence of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in the cattery, and decreased 1 month later, when serum AGP had an increase of α(2,3)-linked sialic acid.

Prevalence of feline coronavirus in two cat populations in Malaysia,The prevalence of feline coronavirus (FCoV) was studied in two catteries in Malaysia. Rectal swabs or faecal samples were collected from a total of 44 clinically healthy Persian purebred and mix-breed cats. RNA extracted from the faecal material was subjected to a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers flanking for a conserved region of the virus genome. The overall prevalence of FCoV infection was 84% and the infection rate was higher in Persian purebred cats (96%) than mix-breed cats (70%). There was no significant association between the age or gender of tested cats and shedding the virus. This study is the first PCR-based survey for FCoV in Malaysia and showed the ubiquitous presence of FCoV in Malaysian cat colonies.,0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.000135107,0.006621913,0.097085059,-0.130600484,0.068588708,-0.01100915,0.00757586,-0.001481342,-0.053089359,-0.177674867,0.444848978,-0.136060152,0.205912617,-0.00021912,-0.114306506,-0.044226534,0.07493418,-0.008295809,0.014384034,0.051273995,-0.048859113,-0.003089295,0.038714969,0.033426628,-0.019849497,0.03533676,0.021559807,0.026507227,0.037818741,-0.000545567
The role of polymerase chain reaction and its newer developments in feline medicine,"Abstract We give a brief overview on the principles of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), quantitative competitive PCR and real-time PCR (TagMan technology). The literature dealing with PCR and its role in the diagnosis, pathogenesis and research of infectious diseases of the domestic cat is reviewed. Cross-contaminations which occasionally occur during handling of amplified DNA may be an important problem in the PCR laboratory. In many infectious diseases, PCR results are difficult to interpret as their predictive positive and negative values are not always known. Newer assays, such as TagMan procedures, are becoming increasingly reliable and cost-effective.

Human metapneumovirus-associated respiratory tract infections in the Republic of Ireland during the influenza season of 2003–2004,"ABSTRACT Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a newly identified paramyxovirus that has been associated with respiratory tract illness in children aged < 5 years, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients. This study determined the frequency of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) associated with hMPV in the Republic of Ireland. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from 168 adult patients and respiratory specimens from 122 children aged < 5 years were collected between September 2003 and May 2004. The virus was detected by reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR using hMPV polymerase (L) and matrix (M)-specific primers in four (2.4%) of 171 BAL specimens obtained from 168 adults. No other respiratory virus was detected in these specimens, and no hMPV RNA was detected in respiratory specimens from children during the same time period. In all four adult cases, two of whom had underlying disease, hMPV was associated with mild, self-limiting upper RTIs. The most common clinical findings included fever (3/4 patients), cough (4/4) and rhinorrhoea (3/4). No patient died as a result of these RTI episodes. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the amplified regions of the Mand fusion (F) genes of hMPV. The Irish isolates belonged to cluster 1B, and did not show a separate Irish sub-lineage.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.241533684,-0.072209185,-0.072943596,0.040691531,0.081184365,-0.179105385,0.01080907,-0.081172182,0.122877215,-0.040350221,0.005679381,-0.02558803,-0.079937969,0.060527855,-0.100033324,-0.073630648,-0.009914728,0.213083834,-0.140847894,0.051744411,0.1858829,0.051435191,-0.010516511,-0.092373945,-0.084430306,0.050420901,-0.218201208,-0.114059121,0.019289589,-0.050198272
Infectious disease emergencies: role of the infectious disease specialist,"ABSTRACT The importance of infections for public health has become obvious during the last decades. Examples are emerging infections such as HIV/AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome, deliberate release of microorganisms, such as the anthrax episode in the USA, the increasing problems with organisms resistant to antimicrobial treatment, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and the threat of a new influenza pandemic with a case fatality rate similar to that in the 1918 outbreak. An effective response to infectious disease emergencies requires careful planning and establishment of resources in advance. The medical specialties involved are clinical microbiology, clinical infectious diseases and epidemiology. Clinical microbiology should include bacteriology, virology and parasitology; the technical developments during the last 15 years have clearly erased most of the methodological differences between these branches of microbiology. New techniques such as new generations of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), rapid methods for nucleic acid sequence analyses and microarrays have enabled more rapid identification of organisms and provide powerful tools in the epidemiological analysis of an outbreak. The infectious disease specialists are necessary for rapid and adequate clinical diagnoses, optimal use of antimicrobial agents and provision of facilities for containment of patients who may spread the infections. The need for isolation units became acute when many countries prepared themselves for a possible severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Europe. With few exceptions, Europe still lacks epidemiological field forces, and it has been embarrassing to be obliged to call upon the Centers for Disease Control for European outbreaks. Hopefully, this will be corrected with the creation of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.090274104,0.026549854,0.024489017,-0.003896664,-0.047260575,0.080148372,0.028937278,0.01838862,-0.000279242,0.105296587,-0.027196,-0.008925918,0.100069831,-0.123526492,0.036411642,-0.015567336,-0.055982581,0.077910016,-0.056935619,0.009497753,0.011235667,-0.053593708,-0.039352482,-0.072583812,-0.008162425,-0.011777453,-0.016283698,0.003772682,0.005004376,0.017213838
"Prevalence, codetection and seasonal distribution of upper airway viruses and bacteria in children with acute respiratory illnesses with cough as a symptom","Abstract Most studies exploring the role of upper airway viruses and bacteria in paediatric acute respiratory infections (ARI) focus on specific clinical diagnoses and/or do not account for virus–bacteria interactions. We aimed to describe the frequency and predictors of virus and bacteria codetection in children with ARI and cough, irrespective of clinical diagnosis. Bilateral nasal swabs, demographic, clinical and risk factor data were collected at enrollment in children aged <15 years presenting to an emergency department with an ARI and where cough was a symptom. Swabs were tested by polymerase chain reaction for 17 respiratory viruses and seven respiratory bacteria. Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between child characteristics and codetection of the organisms of interest. Between December 2011 and August 2014, swabs were collected from 817 (93.3%) of 876 enrolled children, median age 27.7 months (interquartile range 13.9–60.3 months). Overall, 740 (90.6%) of 817 specimens were positive for any organism. Both viruses and bacteria were detected in 423 specimens (51.8%). Factors associated with codetection were age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for age <12 months = 4.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.0, 7.9; age 12 to <24 months = 6.0, 95% CI 3.7, 9.8; age 24 to <60 months = 2.4, 95% CI 1.5, 3.9), male gender (aOR 1.46; 95% CI 1.1, 2.0), child care attendance (aOR 2.0; 95% CI 1.4, 2.8) and winter enrollment (aOR 2.0; 95% CI 1.3, 3.0). Haemophilus influenzae dominated the virus–bacteria pairs. Virus–H. influenzae interactions in ARI should be investigated further, especially as the contribution of nontypeable H. influenzae to acute and chronic respiratory diseases is being increasingly recognized.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.192713991,-0.115479547,-0.078937908,-0.028533574,0.028474857,-0.059083389,0.027478301,-0.045032741,-0.010991882,-0.06845163,0.021685258,0.043525238,-0.064746751,-0.102348832,-0.049348495,0.098782237,-0.087696365,-0.127139073,0.064536269,-0.030816604,-0.213851697,0.10884533,0.066577506,0.085733376,0.031421579,-0.007291264,-0.013631405,-0.204490013,-0.031933766,-0.085738886
Ordinary and opportunistic enteropathogens associated with diarrhea in senegalese adults in relation to human immunodeficiency virus serostatus,"Abstract Objectives: A survey was conducted in Dakar, Senegal, to identify major types and prevalences of bacteria, parasites, fungi, and Rotaviruses associated with diarrhea in relation to human immunodeficieny virus (HIV) serostatus with the goal to provide guidance to physicians for case management. Methods: Etiologic agents were identified in a case-control study: cases were HIV-infected patients with diarrhea (HIV+ D+) and HIV seronegative patients with diarrhea (HIV− D+); controls were HIV-infected patients without diarrhea (HIV+ D−) and seronegative controls without diarrhea (HID− D−). Ordinary enteric pathogens were identified by conventional methods. Different Escherichia coli pathotypes were characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), identification of HEp-2 cell adherence pattern, Sereny test, GIvl1-ELISA, and the suckling mouse assay. Opportunistic parasites, such as Cryptosporidium and Microsporidium, were identified by the Kinyoun method and trichromic stain of Weber, respectively. Rotaviruses were identified with a commercial latex agglutination kit. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by the disk diffusion method. Results: Among the 594 patients examined, 158 were HIV+ D+, 121 were HIV− D+, 160 were HIV+ D−, and 155 were HIV− D−. The main etiologies of diarrhea were different according to HIV serostatus of patients. In immunocompetent adults the main causes of diarrhea were Shigella sp (12.4%), Entamoeba histolytica (10.7%), Salmonella enterica (6.6%), and Giardia (4.9%). In the immunocompromised host the more frequent pathogens were enteroaggregative E. coli (19.6%), Microsporidium (9.4%), Cryptosporidium sp (8.2%), Rotavirus (8.2%), Shigella sp (7.6%), Candida albicans (7.6%), E. histolytica (5.1%), S. enterica (4.4%), and Isospora belli (4.4%). Also, Blastocystis hominis has to be considered as an opportunistic parasite, because it was identified only in HIV-infected patients, with higher prevalence in adults with diarrhea (2.5% in HIV+ D+ patients; 0.6% in HIV+ D− patients). High level of asymptomatic carriage of Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura and some cases of multiple infections were observed. Fungi, Cryptosporidium sp and Microsporidium sp, were often identified in patients with low CD4 counts (range, 79–250 cells/mL). Independently from HIV-serostatus, CD4 count was lower in diarrheic persons, suggesting that diarrhea is a debilitating illness and that effective management of diarrhea can prevent immunosuppression. Isolated enteropathogenic strains displayed high resistance to most antibiotics used in Senegal for treating diarrhea (ampicillin, tetracycline, cotrimoxazole); they were susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. Conclusion: These epidemiologic data suggest that guidelines for the management of diarrhea during HIV infection in Dakar should be updated.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.056624399,-0.011305531,-0.004928328,-0.114755783,-0.050471256,0.010989744,0.002883329,0.027531195,-0.072725231,0.025337648,-0.016028581,0.056507572,-0.036750444,0.009487726,0.041879022,-0.036891438,-0.018200287,0.053978542,-0.012864044,0.016581947,0.001577677,0.003714398,-0.020687062,0.034709276,0.020906916,-0.008738848,0.003697514,-0.066558489,-0.003219023,0.024717051
Viral load quantitation of SARS-coronavirus RNA using a one-step real-time RT-PCR,"Summary Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease that first occurred in humans in the People's Republic of China in November 2002 and has subsequently spread worldwide. A novel virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family has been identified as the cause of this pulmonary disease. The severity of the disease combined with its rapid spread requires the development of fast and sensitive diagnostic assays. Results A real-time quantitative RT-PCR was designed in the nsp11 region of the replicase 1B domain of the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome. To evaluate this quantitative RT-PCR, cRNA standards were constructed by in vitro transcription of SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 RNA using T7 RNA polymerase, followed by real-time RT-PCR. The assay allowed quantitation over a range of 102 to 108 RNA copies per reaction. Conclusions Extrapolated to clinical samples, this novel assay has a detection range of 104 to 1010 copies of viral genome equivalents per millilitre. In comparison to the current de facto cRNA Artus Biotech standard, the in-house cRNA standard gives a 100-fold higher absolute quantity, suggesting a possible underestimation of the viral load when using the Artus Biotech standard.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.012799919,0.32033848,0.03896083,0.12801875,-0.026747531,-0.08143965,-0.030885244,-0.121786445,-0.036009067,0.004953549,0.015902653,-0.031618761,0.011435046,0.025641397,0.011643486,-0.016555789,0.002586795,0.009449535,0.000204061,-0.025773424,0.005500625,0.049637758,-0.036598894,0.001039014,-0.05074109,-0.017684224,0.069743997,-0.029262146,0.021813969,0.023109245
E-mail-based symptomatic surveillance combined with self-collection of nasal swabs: a new tool for acute respiratory infection epidemiology,"Summary Objective We examined the feasibility of combining communication by e-mail and self-collection of nasal swabs for the prospective detection of acute respiratory infections in a non-medical setting. Methods The study was conducted among a convenience sample of employees (n =53) at a research institution (December 2009–April 2010). Real-time data on the occurrence of acute respiratory symptoms and a nasal self-swab were collected prospectively, with automated weekly e-mails as a reminder mechanism. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect respiratory viral pathogens in the swabs. Results Fifty-one out of 53 participants completed the study. The study design was well accepted. Thirty (∼57%) participants reported at least one episode of acute respiratory infection and returned the nasal swab during the study period (eight participants reported two episodes). The majority had no difficulties taking the self-swab and preferred this to swabbing by study personnel. Most participants obtained and returned the swabs within the recommended time. Viral respiratory pathogens were detected in 19 of 38 swabs (50%), with coronaviruses 229E/NL63 and OC43 and rhinoviruses A and B constituting 17 positive swabs (89%). Conclusions Combining e-mail-based symptomatic surveillance with nasal self-swabbing promises to be a powerful tool for the real-time identification of incident cases of acute respiratory infections and the associated pathogens in population-based studies.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.185133279,-0.009489571,-0.007602434,0.02814259,0.031278771,-0.046884038,0.021974753,-0.010397848,0.022834504,0.006312244,0.008757495,0.014788497,0.040284469,-0.002839405,0.071516179,-0.007511709,-0.00612151,-0.097055725,0.08983613,-0.085337408,-0.046388783,-0.064855708,-0.076467395,-0.06760536,0.083098851,0.046029306,-0.015634056,0.033230102,0.056870719,-0.117061451
A family cluster of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus infections related to a likely unrecognized asymptomatic or mild case,"Abstract Background Ninety confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported to the World Health Organization. We report the details of a second family cluster of MERS-CoV infections from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Methods We present the clinical, laboratory and epidemiological details of 3 patients from a family cluster of MERS-CoV infections. Results The first patient developed respiratory symptoms and fever 14 days after admission to hospital for an unrelated reason. He died 11 days later with multi-organ failure. Two of his brothers presented later to another hospital with respiratory symptoms and fever. MERS-CoV infection in the latter 2 patients was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. All 3 patients had fever, cough, shortness of breath, bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and rises in serum creatinine kinase and alanine transaminase. No hospital or other social contacts are known to have acquired the infection. It appears that the index patient in this cluster acquired MERS-CoV infection whilst in hospital from an unrecognized mild or asymptomatic case.

Early identification of pneumonia patients at increased risk of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in Saudi Arabia,"Abstract Background The rapid and accurate identification of individuals who are at high risk of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection remains a major challenge for the medical and scientific communities. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a risk prediction model for the screening of suspected cases of MERS-CoV infection in patients who have developed pneumonia. Methods A two-center, retrospective case–control study was performed. A total of 360 patients with confirmed pneumonia who were evaluated for MERS-CoV infection by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) between September 1, 2012 and June 1, 2016 at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh and King Fahad General Hospital in Jeddah, were included. According to the rRT-PCR results, 135 patients were positive for MERS-CoV and 225 were negative. Demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, and radiological and laboratory findings were collected for each subject. Results A risk prediction model to identify pneumonia patients at increased risk of MERS-CoV was developed. The model included male sex, contact with a sick patient or camel, diabetes, severe illness, low white blood cell (WBC) count, low alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and high aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The model performed well in predicting MERS-CoV infection (area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC) 0.8162), on internal validation (AUC 0.8037), and on a goodness-of-fit test (p =0.592). The risk prediction model, which produced an optimal probability cut-off of 0.33, had a sensitivity of 0.716 and specificity of 0.783. Conclusions This study provides a simple, practical, and valid algorithm to identify pneumonia patients at increased risk of MERS-CoV infection. This risk prediction model could be useful for the early identification of patients at the highest risk of MERS-CoV infection. Further validation of the prediction model on a large prospective cohort of representative patients with pneumonia is necessary.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.148955317,0.261348606,-0.144005607,-0.07249811,-0.063817445,-0.001408762,-0.063542132,0.36764197,0.156511238,0.0142312,0.010851911,-0.008905524,-0.049561915,0.009807518,-0.04992491,0.008964796,0.000405266,-0.017649621,-0.04288423,0.012765968,0.011957156,0.018069773,0.067246851,0.035774273,-0.000586186,-0.04348491,0.009793965,-0.022738129,-0.052937125,0.029137425
A new multiplex RT-qPCR method for the simultaneous detection and discrimination of Zika and chikungunya viruses,"Abstract Objective The re-emergence and spread of tropical viruses to new areas has raised a wave of concern worldwide. In order to treat patients at an early stage and prevent the diffusion of an outbreak, early diagnosis, and therefore fast and adequate detection, is needed. To this end, a multiplex reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction TaqMan method was designed to detect Zika (ZIKV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses simultaneously. Methods Two methods targeting different genome segments were selected from the literature for each virus. These were adapted for high genome coverage and combined in a four-plex assay that was thoroughly validated in-house. The SCREENED tool was used to evaluate the sequence coverage of the method. Results The full validation approach showed that the new four-plex method allows the specific and sensitive identification and discrimination of ZIKV and CHIKV in routine samples. The combination of two targets per virus allowing almost 100% coverage of about 500 genomes is shown for the first time. Conclusions PCR is a reliable user-friendly technique that can be applied in remote areas. Such multiplex methods enable early and efficient diagnosis, leading to rapid treatment and effective confinement in outbreak cases. They may also serve as an aid for surveillance, and the full validation permits easy method-transfer allowing worldwide harmonization.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.026949227,0.050794108,0.140026484,0.046828856,-0.045156985,0.008245687,0.011849266,0.016313842,-0.021168032,0.046351604,-0.040757572,-0.012016793,0.05275437,-0.038572883,0.03560183,-0.0105104,-0.025961181,0.016035264,-0.001708822,-0.013243884,0.009643191,-0.004340579,-0.014775909,-0.002463095,-0.023590309,-0.006435989,0.023515315,0.020784106,-0.039801436,0.003385284
Rapid optimization of antimicrobial chemotherapy given to pediatric patients with community-acquired pneumonia using PCR techniques with serology and standard culture,"Abstract Children (n =117; mean age 2.4 ± 2.9 years) were diagnosed as having community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) using clinical symptoms, chest X-rays, and hematological data. The causative pathogen was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (6 bacteria), multiple reverse transcription-PCR (MPCR; 11 viruses), bacterial culture, and serology. The initial chemotherapy was evaluated based on the pathogens identified using PCR. We found 27 viral cases (23.1%), 25 bacterial cases (21.4%), 45 mixed infections with virus and bacteria (38.5%), 10 Mycoplasma pneumoniae (8.5%), 7 mixed infections with M. pneumoniae and another pathogen (6.0%), 1 Chlamydophila pneumoniae (0.9%), and 2 unknown pathogens (1.7%). Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae accounted for 58 (49.5%) and 27 (23.0%) of the cases, respectively. The median values (50%) of the white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) using the box-and-whisker and plot method, respectively, were 11.7 × 103 mm−3 and 1.4mg/dl in viral infections, 15.6 × 103 mm−3 and 4.8mg/dl in mixed infections with virus and bacteria, 17.8 × 103 mm−3 and 6.3mg/dl in bacterial infections, 6.7 × 103 mm−3 and 1.4mg/dl in M. pneumoniae infections, and 21.5 × 103 mm−3 and 6.4mg/dl in mixed infections with M. pneumoniae and other bacterial infections. Sulbactam/ampicillin (n =61), carbapenems (n =12), and ceftriaxone (n =7) were selected for the patients suspected of having bacterial infections alone or mixed infections with bacterial and viruses in accordance with our criteria defined tentatively.

Investigation of pneumonia-causing pathogenic organisms in children and the usefulness of tebipenem pivoxil for their treatment,"Abstract We investigated the usefulness of the novel oral carbapenem antibiotic tebipenem pivoxil (TBPM-PI) for treating bacterial pneumonia in children. Sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected simultaneously, and causative organisms were identified by conventional bacterial culture together with exhaustive bacterial and viral identification by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The subjects were eight patients diagnosed with mild or moderate pneumonia at Sotobo Children’s Clinic Outpatient Department between October 2006 and June 2007. TBPM-PI was administered at the recommended clinical dose of 4mg/kg b.i.d. to five patients and at a high dose of 6mg/kg b.i.d. to three patients. Sputum was collected from all patients, and 11 strains were detected from washed sputum culture. Causative organisms were mainly Streptococcus pneumoniae (3 strains) and Haemophilus influenzae (6 strains), and nasopharyngeal swabs showed the same organisms as coughed-up sputum. Real-time PCR for individual viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae identified four cases of only bacterial infection, one case of M. pneumoniae coinfection, two cases of viral coinfection, and one case of both viral and M. pneumoniae coinfection. The clinical results indicated efficacy in all patients, and causative organisms were 100% eliminated. In the four patients with only bacterial infection, the average fever of 38.9°C at the start of treatment normalized the following day, showing excellent efficacy. No clinically problematic adverse events occurred, and compliance was good. We consider that these cases provide valuable insights into the identity of pathogenic organisms of pneumonia in children and the possible role of TBPM-PI in outpatient treatment.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.17927304,-0.042716227,-0.049914981,-0.116687883,-0.049102614,-0.053747154,-0.01625986,0.082369339,-0.147842821,0.103663028,-0.038928659,-0.00404965,-0.008041774,-0.011591318,-0.027502022,-0.042332102,-0.012919349,0.037542377,-0.028050341,0.001641586,-0.007178423,0.169157592,0.11571625,0.014753521,0.028442324,0.051448015,0.062314052,0.031657674,0.05767563,0.035276654
"Incorporating polymerase chain reaction-based identification, population characterization, and quantification of microorganisms into aerosol science: A review","Abstract The quantity, identity, and distribution of biomass in indoor and outdoor aerosols are poorly described. This is not consistent with the current understanding of atmospheric chemistry or the microbiological characterization of aquatic and terrestrial environments. This knowledge gap is due to both difficulties in applying contemporary microbiological techniques to the low biomass concentrations present in aerosols, and the traditional reliance of aerosol researchers on culture-based techniques—the quantitative limitations and ecological biases of which have been well-documented and are now avoided in other environmental matrices. This article reviews the emergence of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a nonculture-based method to determine the identity, distribution, and abundance of airborne microorganisms. To encourage the use of PCR-based techniques by a broad spectrum of aerosol researchers, emphasis is given to the critical, aerosol specific method issues of sample processing, DNA extraction, and PCR inhibition removal. These methods are synthesized into a generalized procedure for the PCR-based study of microbial aerosols—equally applicable to both indoor and outdoor aerosol environments.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.01004613,0.020581104,0.107383012,-0.030865211,-0.043493666,0.02947914,0.050075651,0.003019485,-0.007611927,0.04019336,-0.011456972,-0.007187176,0.048847831,-0.068230811,0.03068604,0.016527717,-0.012765021,0.010366564,-0.053197207,-0.108052093,-0.020089571,0.004753579,0.045061077,-0.06236456,-0.004906811,-0.018391552,-0.010594353,-0.028659625,-0.004323227,0.036656558
Molecular diagnostic techniques,"Abstract Molecular diagnostic techniques will continue to transform clinical microbiology. They provide more rapid and sensitive testing that impacts directly on clinical management of infected patients. Molecular diagnostic tests arose from the need to detect micro-organisms that are slow or difficult to grow, or that are present in only small numbers. Nucleic acid amplification techniques (e.g. polymerase chain reaction, PCR) can detect DNA or RNA specific to certain micro-organisms and do not rely on either the recovery of the pathogen or an immune response in the infected patient. Alternative nucleic acid amplification methods have emerged recently because of increasing commercial interest in infectious disease diagnostics and the comprehensive patient protection of PCR technology. Such techniques are gaining widespread acceptance, and have displaced more conventional gold-standard testing in some areas of infectious disease (e.g. viral load testing in HIV-1 infected patients, diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infection). Genetic characterization techniques are increasingly used to determine the relatedness of micro-organisms in the clinical setting. These methods are useful in establishing routes or sources of infection in outbreaks of disease, and are powerful epidemiological tools in large-scale clinical investigations. Recently, there has been a move towards pathogen characterization techniques based on direct nucleotide sequencing (e.g. single nucleotide polymorphism analysis, multi-locus sequence typing). These techniques offer unambiguous, portable data that can be exchanged via the Internet, strengthening collaborative efforts in the field of infectious disease research.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.034686824,0.039762287,0.131819271,-0.018890869,-0.082849504,0.001843435,0.034299205,0.041582614,-0.031512126,0.151347804,-0.042615238,-0.023023812,0.140455061,-0.136952693,0.010198692,0.016217054,-0.060764355,0.077349247,-0.106722322,-0.039399591,-0.016261865,-0.062453751,0.03036381,-0.139799395,-0.036677311,-0.044642293,-0.020619463,-0.037958834,-0.09721845,0.09582505
Molecular diagnostic techniques,"Abstract Clinical microbiology laboratories increasingly rely on molecular diagnostic techniques. The various formats of nucleic acid amplification are the most frequently used molecular tests in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. In many clinical settings, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is clearly the method of choice due to its exquisite sensitivity and specificity. Today, many conventional PCR methods are being replaced by real-time PCR, which allows more rapid detection and quantification of the PCR product, as well as detection of different strains of the pathogen by melting curve analysis. The ability to measure the quantity of microbe by quantitative PCR has become increasingly important, providing information on the progression and prognosis of disease, and effectiveness of treatment. Other widely used molecular diagnostic techniques are isothermal amplification methods and nucleic acid hybridization techniques. Microarray is a technique which holds promise and has an exceptional sensitivity and the capacity to detect several pathogens simultaneously. However, microarrays are currently too expensive to be adapted for routine diagnostics, and their diagnostic use requires broad-based nucleic acid amplification prior to analysis which is not well established. Several molecular methods can be used for genotyping, which allows the identification of different subtypes of the pathogen; genotyping plays a role in the risk assessment and management of infections. Clinicians need to recognize the enhanced accuracy and speed of the molecular diagnostic techniques for the diagnosis of infections, but also to understand their limitations. Laboratory results should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical presentation of the patient, and appropriate site, quality, and timing of specimen collection are required for reliable test results.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.071519724,0.076921908,0.25831864,0.050702379,-0.101105637,-0.009431246,0.064346078,0.028260011,-0.015907701,0.136936593,-0.080492896,-0.031029256,0.165451906,-0.176527778,0.013624607,0.003621587,-0.047530101,0.050229135,-0.097699393,-0.107725589,-0.037742528,-0.080858055,0.076869303,-0.172550329,-0.000726191,-0.041521645,-0.022900199,-0.050724542,-0.074409831,0.080682916

"The macro domain protein family: Structure, functions, and their potential therapeutic implications","Abstract Macro domains are ancient, highly evolutionarily conserved domains that are widely distributed throughout all kingdoms of life. The ‘macro fold’ is roughly 25kDa in size and is composed of a mixed α–β fold with similarity to the P loop-containing nucleotide triphosphate hydrolases. They function as binding modules for metabolites of NAD+, including poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), which is synthesized by PAR polymerases (PARPs). Although there is a high degree of sequence similarity within this family, particularly for residues that might be involved in catalysis or substrates binding, it is likely that the sequence variation that does exist among macro domains is responsible for the specificity of function of individual proteins. Recent findings have indicated that macro domain proteins are functionally promiscuous and are implicated in the regulation of diverse biological functions, such as DNA repair, chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Significant advances in the field of macro domain have occurred in the past few years, including biological insights and the discovery of novel signaling pathways. To provide a framework for understanding these recent findings, this review will provide a comprehensive overview of the known and proposed biochemical, cellular and physiological roles of the macro domain family. Recent data that indicate a critical role of macro domain regulation for the proper progression of cellular differentiation programs will be discussed. In addition, the effect of dysregulated expression of macro domain proteins will be considered in the processes of tumorigenesis and bacterial pathogenesis. Finally, a series of observations will be highlighted that should be addressed in future efforts to develop macro domains as effective therapeutic targets.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.110985385,-0.028737417,-0.01820271,-0.046929448,-0.044636669,0.032523766,0.047849179,-0.018950226,0.024300789,-0.008745135,-0.058169175,0.041111347,0.004026929,-0.071772803,-0.041734748,-0.02830098,0.061113972,-0.021841593,-0.060294523,0.017632748,-0.021125234,0.016262031,-0.022900441,-0.043703375,0.06032034,0.031395262,-0.03076662,0.027886516,0.053725831,-0.066693361
"Interaction of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) with four nucleic acid binding proteins DNase I, RNase A, reverse transcriptase and Taq polymerase","Abstract In the investigation of interaction of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) with four biologically important proteins we observed inhibition of enzymatic activity of DNase I, RNase A, M-MLV reverse transcriptase and Taq polymerase by ATA in vitro assay. As the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is the main catalytic subunit of telomerase holoenzyme, we also monitored effect of ATA on telomerase activity in vivo and observed dose-dependent inhibition of telomerase activity in Chinese hamster V79 cells treated with ATA. Direct association of ATA with DNase I (K d =9.019μM)), RNase A (K d =2.33μM) reverse transcriptase (K d =0.255μM) and Taq polymerase (K d =81.97μM) was further shown by tryptophan fluorescence quenching studies. Such association altered the three-dimensional conformation of DNase I, RNase A and Taq polymerase as detected by circular dichroism. We propose ATA inhibits enzymatic activity of the four proteins through interfering with DNA or RNA binding to the respective proteins either competitively or allosterically, i.e. by perturbing three-dimensional structure of enzymes.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.095695509,-0.017800674,-0.006898207,-0.02000267,-0.070873011,0.016287662,0.030208895,-0.021110125,0.020294929,-0.031620521,0.005834768,0.047424766,-0.029254022,2.84E-05,-0.024671329,0.006553139,0.029016979,-0.000579765,0.010954154,-0.021145667,-0.012649443,-0.001407437,0.012973211,-0.033470184,0.040170618,0.029129008,-0.051887821,0.028536842,0.014095636,0.008514304
Molecular analysis of cerebrospinal fluid in viral diseases of the central nervous system,"Abstract The use of nucleic acid (NA) amplification techniques has transformed the diagnosis of viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS). Because of their enhanced sensitivity, these methods enable detection of even low amounts of viral genomes in cerebrospinal fluid. Following more than 10 years of experience, the polymerase chain reaction or other NA-based amplification techniques are nowadays performed in most diagnostic laboratories and have become the test of choice for the diagnosis of several viral CNS infections, such as herpes encephalitis, enterovirus meningitis and other viral infections occurring in human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons. Furthermore, they have been useful to establish a viral etiology in neurological syndromes of dubious origin and to recognise unusual or poorly characterised CNS diseases. Quantitative methods have provided a valuable additional tool for clinical management of these diseases, whereas post-amplification techniques have enabled precise genome characterisation. Current efforts are aiming at further improvement of the diagnostic efficiency of molecular techniques, their speed and standardisation, and to reduce the costs.

Clinical virology in real time,"Abstract The ability to detect nucleic acids has had and still has a major impact on diagnostics in clinical virology. Both quantitative and qualitative techniques, whether signal or target amplification based systems, are currently used routinely in most if not all virology laboratories. Technological improvements, from automated sample isolation to real time amplification technology, have given the ability to develop and introduce systems for most viruses of clinical interest, and to obtain clinical relevant information needed for optimal antiviral treatment options. Both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) can currently be used together with real time detection to generate results in a short turn-around time and to determine whether variants relevant for antiviral resistance are present. These new technologies enable the introduction of an individual patient disease management concept. Within our clinical setting, we have introduced this e.g. for quantitative detection of Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV) in T-dell depleted allogeneic stem cell transplant patients. This enabled us to develop models for pre-emptive anti B-cell immunotherapy for EBV reactivation, thereby effectively reducing not the incidence of EBV-lymphoproliferative disease but the virus related mortality. Furthermore, additional clinically relevant viruses can now easily be detected simultaneously. It also becomes more feasible to introduce molecular testing for those viruses that can easily be detected using classical virological methods, like culture techniques or antigen detection. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the clinical importance of the additional positive samples detected. It should however be made clear that a complete exchange of technologies is unlikely to occur, and that some complementary technologies should stay operational enabling the discovery of new viruses. The implementation of these molecular diagnostic technologies furthermore warrants the use and introduction of standardized materials as well as participation in international quality control programs. Finally, the use of an internal control throughout the whole procedure not only ensures the accuracy of the results generated, but also is necessary to enable precise quantification of these results and to determine detection thresholds more accurately. Since so many targets do have clinical implications, laboratories might prefer to use universal internal controls before the in-house developed assays should be introduced in clinical virology.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.050554815,0.027949792,0.140965863,0.051824563,-0.086705988,0.021445397,0.07254668,0.034562632,-0.019862544,0.113400106,-0.072680993,-0.021155282,0.125030977,-0.116568957,0.02436776,-0.010714953,-0.067356167,0.035679232,-0.024208482,-0.041616251,-0.002647304,-0.054852643,0.022906477,-0.070652521,-0.048815293,-0.035290801,0.003278771,-0.041245254,-0.044964181,0.021943304
SARS-coronavirus replicates in mononuclear cells of peripheral blood (PBMCs) from SARS patients,"Abstract Background: The etiologic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently identified, positive single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Little is known about the dynamic changes of the viral replicative form in SARS cases. Objectives: Evaluate whether SARS-CoV can infect and replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of infected persons and reveal any dynamic changes to the virus during the course of the disease. Study design: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from SARS cases infected by the same infectious source were tested for both negative-stranded RNA (minus-RNA, “replicative intermediates”) and positive-stranded RNA (genomic RNA) of SARS-CoV during the course of hospitalization by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: SARS-CoV minus-RNA was detected in PBMCs from SARS patients. The viral replicative forms in PBMCs were detectable during a period of 6 days post-onset of the disease, while the plus-RNA were detectable for a longer period (8–12 days post-onset). Conclusions: SARS-coronavirus can infect and replicate within PBMCs of SARS patients, but viral replication in PBMCs seems subject to self-limitation.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.034762038,0.378229987,-0.236850709,0.049573563,-0.054326567,-0.06085386,-0.088996001,-0.201398065,-0.116976235,0.0018391,0.074314492,-0.05102059,0.007573524,0.050107662,0.043446163,0.047690691,-0.023985894,-0.016442024,0.003569711,0.023725373,-0.022474985,0.026290254,-0.044012592,-0.00132222,-0.054872445,-0.054298746,-0.024866031,0.032693843,-0.021976636,0.013715732
A role for arrays in clinical virology: fact or fiction?,"Abstract Microarrays of DNA probes have at least three roles in clinical virology. These are: firstly, in diagnosis, to recognise the causative agent of an illness; secondly, for molecular typing for (i) patient management, (ii) epidemiological reasons (e.g. investigating routes of transmission), (iii) purposes related to vaccine use; and thirdly, in research, to investigate the interactions between the virus and the host cell. Microarrays intended for syndromic diagnostic purposes require genome specific probes to capture the unknown target viral sequences and thereby reveal the presence of that virus in a test sample. Microarrays intended for typing and patient management, e.g. monitoring antiviral drug resistant mutations require a set of probes representing the important sequence variants of one or more viral genes. Microarrays intended for research into virus–host interactions require probes representative of each individual gene or mRNA of either the virus or the host genome. Diagnostic microarrays are dependent for their utility and versatility on generic, multiplex or random polymerase chain reactions that will amplify any of several (unknown) viral target sequences from a patient sample. In this review, the existing and potential applications of microarrays in virology, and the problems that need to be overcome for future success, are discussed.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.052997424,-0.007196445,0.045706181,0.002697892,-0.045903164,0.057447248,0.047025074,0.007398486,0.021354768,0.066871455,-0.050229692,-0.039204215,0.078133381,-0.061780707,0.021958019,-0.001997187,-0.040752654,0.017743327,-0.061226872,-0.018758018,-0.006406619,-0.011229071,-0.021610261,-0.004791381,-0.032013224,-0.060843195,0.027759251,-0.020814539,-0.010724683,0.03913078
Virological surveillance of influenza-like illness in the community using PCR and serology,"Abstract Background: Surveillance of winter respiratory viral illness has been carried out for nearly 30 years using a clinical diagnosis by general practitioners as part of the Scottish Sentinel General Practice (SSGP) network. Contemparaneous laboratory diagnosis has not been available previously. Objectives: To assess the proportion of influenza-like illness (ILI) attributable to influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and picornavirus infection during the winter season. To compare the influenza PCR data with serology of paired blood samples. Study design: Combined nose and throat swabs, from patients with ILI attending 15 general practices across Scotland, were submitted to the laboratory in virus PCR sample solution (VPSS). The extracted nucleic acid was tested using a multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Serological analysis was performed on paired serum samples using complement fixation assays. The rate of influenza virus positivity was compared with reports of ILI obtained from the SSGP network. Results: Of 240 samples received at the laboratory, 132 (55%) were PCR positive for influenza A virus. There were nine (3.8%) picornavirus and three (1.2%) RSV PCR positives, two (0.8%) were dual influenza A/picornavirus infections. Ninety four (39.2%) were negative for all viruses tested. Results on paired sera from 89 patients showed a rising titre to influenza A in 48 of the 57 PCR positive samples (84.2%). One PCR negative patient displayed a significant rising titre to influenza A. Virological data paralleled the SSGP data but was available at least a week earlier. Conclusions: Influenza A infection was detected in the majority of patients with ILI; picornavirus infection was also shown to be an important cause of illness. PCR is a rapid and sensitive method for respiratory virus surveillance. Serology is slow, insensitive and difficult to interpret at low titres.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.248832446,-0.048768461,0.048351187,0.209769488,0.011256632,0.173879262,-0.163287407,-0.001225191,-0.045163544,-0.077903491,0.052499449,-0.04266575,0.005688607,0.045445728,-0.006837117,-0.043404266,0.057666422,-0.026139871,0.006702921,-0.089054481,0.027989553,-0.064341562,0.028487042,-0.095743474,0.033605144,-0.044113551,0.050670746,0.035510493,-0.008053801,0.028197754
Evaluation of quantitative and type-specific real-time RT-PCR assays for detection of respiratory syncytial virus in respiratory specimens from children,"Abstract Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract morbidity in young children and immunosuppressed patients. Objectives: To rapidly and accurately quantify and subtype RSV in respiratory samples, we developed and evaluated two real-time RT-PCR assays. Study design: A quantitative assay was designed using primers for a consensus region of the matrix protein gene and a subtype-specific assay for RSV-A and RSV-B detection was designed using primers for the polymerase gene. Quantitative RSV RT-PCR results of pediatric nasal wash samples submitted to the University of Washington Virology Laboratory from December 2002, through May 2003, were compared to those of an indirect fluorescent antibody RSV antigen detection assay (FA). Results: Specificity of the RT-PCR assay was high, with no amplification of eleven common respiratory viruses and eight herpes viruses. Among 751 samples, RSV was detected in 267 (35.6%) by FA and in 286 (38.1%) by RT-PCR. Median RSV copy number in nasal wash samples that were positive by both FA and RT-PCR was 2.5×107 copies/mL versus a median of 3.0×104 copies/mL for samples positive by RT-PCR only (P<0.001). The detection and quantity of RSV in respiratory specimens was associated with younger age, but not with gender or hospitalization. Among positive samples from this Seattle cohort, 52% were subtype A and 48% were subtype B. Both subtypes were detected with similar viral loads among all patient groups (stratified by age, gender, and hospitalization), and throughout the specimen collection period. Conclusions: These real-time RT-PCR assays provide a rapid, specific, and highly sensitive alternative for detecting, quantifying, and subtyping RSV in clinical specimens.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.243454593,0.026355574,0.196358237,0.173467601,0.045387947,-0.173544173,-0.006256774,-0.111465352,0.102052881,-0.108727181,0.039682238,-0.082352702,-0.158192868,0.073160284,-0.078103727,-0.078539338,0.057736673,0.053524469,0.010583917,-0.076734272,0.046522531,-0.077371009,0.014297424,-0.040255993,0.081126799,-0.119695948,0.291605752,0.05005332,-0.027496946,0.044244616
Development of a PCR-and hybridization-based assay (PCR Adenovirus Consensus®) for the detection and the species identification of adenoviruses in respiratory specimens,"Abstract Background: Antigen detection assays and viral isolation techniques are routinely used to detect adenoviruses (Ad) associated with respiratory infections, and the value of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has recently been assessed. Objectives: This paper describes a PCR-hybridization-immunoenzymatic assay (PCR Adenovirus consensus®) used to detect Ad and identify Ad species in respiratory specimens. Results: On seven representative serotypes Ad 12, Ad 3, Ad 7, Ad 11, Ad 1, Ad 8, Ad 4, the mean genome equivalents per ml and the mean 50% infectious doses per ml were 106.3and 104, respectively. Using 362 nasal aspirates from children, Ad were detected by immunofluorescence (IF) and culture in 97 cases (27%), by the PCR-Ad hexon method in 107 cases (29.5%) and by the PCR Adenovirus Consensus® method in 113 cases (31.2%); 13 samples were found positive by both PCR and negative by the IF and culture methods; five samples were only positive according to the PCR Adenovirus Consensus® method. The sensitivity, specificity, predictive positive value and predictive negative value of the PCR Adenovirus Consensus® method were 97.9%, 93.2%, 84%, 99.1%, respectively. The method identified the species (sp) from 91 positive amplicons: 1 Ad sp A, 44 Ad sp B, 42 Ad sp C, 3 Ad sp E, and 1 Ad sp F; 85 isolates were identified by IF or the neutralisation in culture, and 86 by a PCR-RE digestion method. The PCR Adenovirus Consensus® detected six positive samples that were negative according to the IF and culture methods, and it identified the precise species of nine IF-positive and culture-negative nasal aspirates. Conclusion: The PCR Adenovirus Consensus® technique is more efficient than the classical IF or culture techniques for the detection of Ad in respiratory samples. An internal control is included to validate the screening results, and specific probes are used to identify the Ad species.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.056258649,0.010042379,0.092327622,-0.03609026,0.022293758,-0.025057487,0.011697485,-1.33E-05,-0.019069462,0.004516694,0.004253768,-0.019091472,-0.007051932,-0.009304084,0.042732616,-0.016161915,0.0072918,-0.012628159,0.006750758,-0.120236073,-0.007303971,0.044392431,0.034818403,-0.036752421,-0.018505255,0.022880795,-0.01208195,-0.006436591,-0.024492112,-0.007366184
Detection and quantification of human metapneumovirus in pediatric specimens by real-time RT-PCR,"Abstract Background: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), a recently identified virus, causes respiratory illness in children. Objectives: A real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed and used to detect and quantify hMPV in respiratory specimens. Study design: The quantitative RT-PCR assay amplified an approximately 70 base pair fragment from the hMPV fusion protein gene. The assay was validated and used to test respiratory specimens obtained from children seen at a hospital in Seattle, Washington, from December 2002 through May 2003. Results: The assay detected 1000hMPV copies/mL of specimen, did not detect 19 other respiratory viruses, and was able to detect and accurately quantify isolates from the four known hMPV genetic lineages in a proficiency panel of 20 previously tested samples. hMPV was detected in 52 (7.2%) of 719 pediatric respiratory specimens. The mean log10copies/mL of hMPV in the 52 positive specimens was 7.67 (range=4.59–10.60). Children aged 7–12 months had a significantly higher hMPV prevalence (12.4%) than did children younger than 7 months (4.7%) (P <0.005). Children in this age group also had significantly higher levels of hMPV in their respiratory specimens (mean log8.43 copies/mL) than did the younger children (mean log6.93copies/mL) (P =0.0025). Conclusions: The rapid real-time RT-PCR assay described here is a sensitive test for clarifying the epidemiology of and diseases associated with hMPV.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.233135155,-0.030806407,0.072358765,0.109129388,0.070335172,-0.210225886,0.040548095,-0.159267829,0.179537361,-0.124175787,0.019317385,-0.059174979,-0.153984731,0.061940359,-0.124548233,-0.075476064,-0.002738527,0.210382578,-0.122522709,0.021808986,0.156323129,0.12130757,0.047167457,-0.109927338,-0.150577109,0.094776001,-0.183742562,-0.172905315,0.029712926,-0.051491201
The interaction of the SARS coronavirus non-structural protein 10 with the cellular oxido-reductase system causes an extensive cytopathic effect,"Abstract The pathological mechanism of SARS-CoV infection was investigated. The gene for the SARS-CoV non-structural protein 10, which is located in the open reading frame of pp1a/pp1ab gene, was synthesized and used to screen for the specific cellular gene coding for the protein interacting with this nsp10 protein in a human embryo lung cDNA library using a yeast trap method. The results indicated that apart from the two subunits of cellular RNA polymerase complex, BTF3 and ATF5, this nsp10 protein was also able to interact specifically with the NADH 4L subunit and cytochrome oxidase II. Further study revealed that the activity of the NADH-cytochrome was altered and the inner mitochondrial membrane was depolarized in the transfected human embryo lung fibroblast by the nsp10 protein gene. The cytopathic effect of the Coronavirus 229E strain appeared more extensive in these cells than in the control cells.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.153107382,0.142526349,-0.105183591,-0.038454396,-0.009490543,0.001043111,-0.088306302,-0.109522178,0.07841772,-0.054387196,-0.103331208,-0.03193797,0.036057236,0.027195931,-0.039706429,-0.06339767,0.052916963,-0.057067563,0.027138207,0.033420939,0.008441324,0.025786977,0.056249254,0.012230698,0.019483366,0.040801873,-0.012508347,-0.005735775,-0.045883018,0.034898328
Expanding the frontiers of existing antiviral drugs: Possible effects of HIV-1 protease inhibitors against SARS and avian influenza,"Abstract When unexpected diseases such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza become a serious threat to public health, an immediate response is imperative. This should take into consideration existing licensed antiviral drugs against other viral diseases already known to be safe for use in humans. In this report, evidence is presented that HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs) currently used in anti-HIV-1 therapies might exert some effects on SARS and perhaps, on avian influenza. Evidence for the potential benefits of PIs against the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is provided by empirical clinical studies, in vivo viral inhibition assays and computational simulations of the docking of these compounds to the active site of the main SARS-CoV protease. As suggested by in silico docking of these molecules to a theoretical model of a subunit of type A influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, there also exists a remote possibility that these PIs may have an effect on avian influenza viruses. Although this evidence is still far from being definitive, the results so far obtained suggest that PIs should be seriously taken into consideration for further testing as potential therapeutic agents for SARS and avian influenza.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.006742452,0.255021242,-0.206896033,0.169390698,-0.086490011,0.251100181,-0.065047113,-0.203157302,-0.047409494,0.010852114,0.009085459,0.004546028,0.058830254,-0.053999211,0.00916506,0.011195005,-0.035239384,0.052972869,0.042785568,0.027063399,0.003605868,0.020537797,-0.035151819,0.059149985,-0.00161479,-0.028939943,-0.013853199,-0.042034607,0.08488584,0.000864481
Development and evaluation of real-time PCR assays for the detection of the newly identified KI and WU polyomaviruses,"Abstract Background Recently, novel human polyomaviruses, KI (KIV) and WU (WUV) were described. Their role in human disease has not yet been determined. Objectives The aim of this study was to develop sensitive and specific assays for the detection of KIV and WUV. Study Two KIV (KI-A and KI-B) and three WUV (WU-A, WU-B and WU-C) real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) assays were developed and evaluated. Clinical sensitivities and specificities were determined by testing 200 respiratory specimens and the results compared to those for previously described conventional PCR assays. Limits of detection were determined, and the analytical specificities of the assays were investigated. Results No cross-reactivity was observed between the rtPCR methods and unrelated organisms. All five rtPCR assays could reliably detect 10 copies of genomic DNA equivalents per reaction, which was more sensitive than conventional methods. Compared to the conventional PCR assays, the sensitivity of the KI-A, KI-B, WU-A, WU-B and WU-C assays was 100%, 86.7% 95.5%, 100% and 100%, respectively. Specificity was 94.6%, 97.3%, 96.6%, 97.7% and 97.2%, respectively.

Presence of the newly discovered human polyomaviruses KI and WU in Australian patients with acute respiratory tract infection,"Abstract Background Currently, the role of the novel human polyomaviruses, KI (KIV) and WU (WUV) as agents of human disease remains uncertain. Objectives We sought to determine the prevalence of these viruses and their rate of co-detection with other viral respiratory pathogens, in an Australian population. Study design Polymerase chain reaction assays previously described were used to examine the presence of KIV and WUV in 2866 respiratory specimens collected from January to December 2003 from Australian patients with acute respiratory infections. Results KIV and WUV were present in our population with an annual prevalence of 2.6% and 4.5%, respectively. There was no apparent seasonal variation for KIV, but a predominance of infection was detected during late winter to early summer for WUV. The level of co-infection of KIV or WUV with other respiratory viruses was 74.7% and 79.7%, respectively. Both viruses were absent from urine and blood specimens collected from a variety of patient sources. Conclusions KIV and WUV circulate annually in the Australian population. Although there is a strong association with the respiratory tract, more comprehensive studies are required to prove these viruses are agents causing respiratory disease.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.090750411,-0.037084268,-0.027861785,-0.005494611,0.019236641,-0.016600763,0.05081688,-0.00645249,0.018317236,0.03425099,-0.006845044,0.023462308,0.053100827,0.010466763,0.032067298,-0.015159188,-0.007331264,-0.020019647,0.011161543,-0.003605345,0.045144944,-0.032798261,-0.030758512,0.009586582,0.01428848,0.000278342,-0.055865876,-0.010419981,0.001929208,-0.074162597
Multiple simultaneous viral infections in infants with acute respiratory tract infections in Spain,"Abstract Background The clinical significance of the presence of more than one type of virus in the respiratory specimens of children with respiratory infections is not clear. Objectives To describe the clinical characteristics of multiple viral infections versus single infection by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in hospitalized infants. Study design This is a prospective study conducted in all infants under 2 years of age admitted for acute respiratory infection (September 2000–June 2003) in a secondary teaching hospital. Virological diagnosis was made by two different multiplex reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays in nasopharyngeal aspirates. We describe the clinical characteristics of the patients with multiple viral infections and compare them to a group of 86 randomly selected patients infected only with RSV. Results 749 specimens taken were analyzed. Respiratory viruses were detected in 65.9% of the samples. 86 children had multiple viral infections (17.4% of all positive specimens). The most frequent clinical diagnosis in this group was recurrent wheezing in 44% and bronchiolitis in 52%. Fever was significantly more frequent (p <0.001), hospital stays were longer (p =0.05), and antibiotic treatment was used more (p =0.03) in infants with multiple viral infections than in the RSV-infected group. Conclusions Multiple viral infections are frequent in hospitalized children with respiratory tract disease (17.4%). Multiple viral infections are linked to higher fever, longer hospital stays and more frequent use of antibiotics than in the case of infants with single RSV infections.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.304405505,-0.118957412,-0.101307955,0.070826125,0.010894743,-0.176644906,0.069355309,-0.080570912,0.096396087,0.040809453,0.03901526,-0.11191738,-0.039723643,0.003929976,0.023650962,-0.025234008,0.039435655,0.041674154,0.023382816,0.023748291,-0.021984342,-0.089015678,-0.096508116,-0.003650343,0.069095747,-0.081842851,0.127049168,0.006746484,-0.016487705,0.026607239
In situ reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (in situ RT-LAMP) for detection of Japanese encephalitis viral RNA in host cells,"Abstract Background Clinical diagnosis of Japanese encephalitis is usually difficult due to non-specific signs at the early and acute stages of the infection. Virus isolation from peripheral blood is also not possible because of the short period and low level of transient viremia even in the acute stage of the disease. It is thus urgent to develop a feasible and convenient method for laboratory diagnosis of the infection. Objectives To establish a newly designed molecular approach that can be used to detect intracellular Japanese encephalitis viral RNA in host cells. Study design The method was firstly established and then was carried out to test its efficacy in cultured BHK-21 cells, subsequently in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from mice that have been inoculated with JE virus suspension. Results In this study, in situ reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (in situ RT-LAMP) was established; which combines merits of recently developed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and in situ reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (in situ RT-PCR).

Importance of viral and bacterial infections in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations,"Abstract Background Few studies have evaluated the contribution of both viruses and bacteria in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Objectives This study estimated the burden of both types of pathogens among adults seeking care for an AECOPD during two consecutive winter seasons. Study design Patients 50 years or older who consulted within 10 days of AECOPD onset were eligible. Clinical data were collected on a standardized questionnaire, and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA), paired sera, and non-induced sputum were collected. Polymerase chain reaction (PRC) assays were used to identify viral, atypical and bacterial pathogens in NPA specimen. Results Overall, 108 patients with AECOPD were included, 88% of patients were admitted and 2 patients (2%) received intensive care. A third of patients (31%) had evidence of a viral infection, 9% with influenza A, 7% RSV and 7% with PIV-3. One patient was positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 49% of patients with available sputum, most frequently Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae. Among virus-infected patients, 14 (58%) also had bacteria in their sputum, but co-infected patients did not present with different symptoms than patients with single infections. Conclusions These results suggest that influenza and RSV are frequent contributors of AECOPD, and that coinfection with bacteria does not appear to be more severe among virus-infected patients. Clinicians should be aware that AECOPD may be frequently triggered by viruses, and may consider antivirals and proper infection control measures in appropriate epidemiological setting.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.218737235,-0.071596732,-0.112077135,-0.06734412,-0.078570485,-0.031375133,-0.065671645,0.088557038,-0.182588983,0.080589025,-0.053784193,-0.026738742,-0.012277912,0.069236852,-0.050416119,-0.034364222,0.02915886,0.025661508,0.013571124,0.046827396,0.039597913,-0.076115777,0.040517248,0.02013537,0.024173596,-0.02120426,0.059702987,0.046320256,-0.013012433,0.091559026
Human bocavirus and rhino-enteroviruses in childhood otitis media with effusion,"Abstract Background Viral respiratory infections play an important role in the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion (OME) in children. The most common human rhinoviruses (HRVs) have been detected in middle ear effusions (MEE), but there is only limited data available about the closely related human enteroviruses (HEVs). The newly discovered human bocavirus (HBoV) has not, however, been identified in MEE of OME children. Objectives The aim of our study was to determine the presence of HBoV and HRV/HEV and the rate of coinfection in a set of MEE samples collected from OME children. Study design Seventy-five MEE samples from 54 children with no acute respiratory symptoms were studied with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of HRV/HEV and quantitative PCR for detection of HBoV. Results Twenty-six (35%) of 75 MEE samples were positive for viral nucleic acid, 22 (29%) for HEV, 10 (13%) for HRV and 2 (3%) for HBoV. There was no statistically significant difference between mucoid and serous effusions in the rate of virus detection.

Evaluation of a rapid molecular algorithm for detection of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus and screening for a key oseltamivir resistance (H275Y) substitution in neuraminidase,"Abstract Background Rapid and specific molecular tests for identification of the recently identified pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus as well as rapid molecular tests to identify antiviral resistant strains are urgently needed. Objectives We have evaluated the performance of two novel reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) targeting specifically hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus in combination with a conserved matrix PCR. In addition, we investigated the performance of a novel discrimination RT-PCR for detection of the H275Y resistance mutation in the neuraminidase gene. Study design Clinical performance of both subtype specific RT-PCR assays was evaluated through analysis of 684 throat swaps collected from individuals meeting the WHO case definition for the novel pandemic influenza virus. Analytical performance was analyzed through testing of 10-fold serial dilutions of RNA derived from the first Dutch sequenced and cultured confirmed case of novel pandemic influenza infection. Specificity and discriminative capacities of the H275Y discrimination assay were performed by testing wild type and recombinant H275Y pandemic influenza. Results 121 throat swaps collected from April 2009 to July 2009 were positive by at least two out of three RT-PCRs, and negative for the seasonal H3/H1 subtype specific RT-PCR assays. 117 of these were tested positive for all three (Ct-values from 15.1 to 36.8). No oseltamivir resistance was detected. Conclusions We present a sensitive and specific approach for detection of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 and a rapid RT-PCR assay detecting a primary oseltamivir resistance mutation which can be incorporated easily into clinical virology algorithms.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.106636161,0.028992744,0.183052744,0.210869896,-0.034131639,0.222773502,-0.134755364,0.027797313,-0.052745228,-0.096425735,0.021637169,0.048060871,-0.003071774,0.056365313,-0.004427104,-0.011690758,0.034118922,0.049766337,-0.046886426,-0.097055902,0.035338729,0.039893471,-0.021790729,0.002201926,-0.04248657,0.070567539,0.061661477,-0.033827587,0.043285748,0.053878565
Viral agents responsible for febrile respiratory illnesses among military recruits training in tropical Singapore,"Abstract Background Military personnel are highly susceptible to febrile respiratory illnesses (FRI), likely due to crowding, stress and other risk factors present in the military environment. Objective Our objective was to investigate the viral etiological agents responsible for FRI among military recruits training in a tropical climate in Singapore. Study design From March 2006 through April 2007, a total of 1354 oropharyngeal (throat) swabs were collected from military recruits who reported sick with an oral temperature of ≥38°C and a cough and/or sore throat. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to assay for the presence of influenza A and B viruses and adenoviruses (H-AdV), and conventional PCR used for the remaining respiratory viruses in all specimens. Results Influenza A virus was the dominant infection with a laboratory-confirmed incidence of 24% (326/1354) and a predominance of the H3N2 subtype. The temporal pattern for influenza A virus infections coincided with the nation-wide pattern in the civilian community. Detection rates of 12% (159/1354) and 2.7% (5/1354) were obtained for influenza B virus and other respiratory viruses, respectively. Conclusions The laboratory findings identified influenza A virus as the primary causative viral agent for FRI in the Singapore military, in strong contrast to findings from temperate countries and countries where recruits are often vaccinated for influenza. Our results suggest that influenza vaccination should be considered as a requirement to reduce the incidence of influenza infections. This is the first report describing respiratory infections in a tropical military setting, in a developed country in Asia.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.149259795,-0.083927231,-0.010992865,0.139789667,0.003271658,0.180673952,-0.078727366,-0.008570092,-0.01556906,-0.043311064,0.010568738,-0.012776055,0.009494765,-0.006155932,0.029860189,-0.004289587,0.003261676,-0.045251996,0.020475821,-0.01830574,0.009214924,0.004403289,-0.013498092,-0.004516219,0.005099475,0.014987642,-0.012397306,0.041888994,0.002532124,-0.022425739
Etiology of bronchiolitis in a hospitalized pediatric population: Prospective multicenter study,"Abstract Background In 2006, bronchiolitis due to adenovirus nosocomial infections resulted in the closure of a pediatric department in northern Portugal. Objectives To determine the etiology of bronchiolitis in northern Portugal. Study design It was a prospective multicenter study on the etiology of bronchiolitis during the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season (November–April). Children ≤24 months of age admitted for a first wheezing episode were included. Nasopharyngeal specimens were analyzed by an indirect immunofluorescent-antibody assay (IFA) for RSV, adenovirus (HAdV), parainfluenza (PIV) 1–3 and influenza (IV) A and B and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription-PCR for the same viruses and for human metapneumovirus (hMPV), bocavirus (HBoV), rhinovirus (HRV), coronaviruses (229/E; NL63; OC43; HKU1) and enterovirus. Results During this period, 253 children were included, 249 IFA analyses and 207 PCRs were performed. IFA detected RSV in 58.1%; PCR increased it to 66.7%. IFA detected HAdV in 3.2%, PCR 10.0%. PCR detected IV A in 5; IV B in 2; PIV 1 in 6, PIV 2 in 4 and PIV 3 in 11 cases. HBoV, as single agent in 2 cases, and HRV were positive in 8 samples and hMPV in 11. With this virus panel, 19.7% remained without etiology. Conclusions The most frequent agent was RSV, followed by HAdV. PCR can be cost-effective and more accurate than IFA, which is crucial for HAdV that may be associated with significant mortality (IFA alone did not detect 2/3 of the cases).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.195412948,-0.091615728,-0.011385225,0.035903748,0.069402805,-0.110999869,0.043985124,-0.106358702,0.103882026,-0.070710062,0.021269352,-0.030859685,-0.097634256,-0.021286426,-0.014113893,-0.021259528,-0.02134735,0.081526757,-0.024965084,-0.091518074,0.055925367,0.120913355,0.021900189,0.004705322,-0.094439936,0.055835635,0.03452189,0.173096895,-0.07570726,0.09967551
Correlation of viral load of respiratory pathogens and co-infections with disease severity in children hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infection,"Abstract Background The clinical significance of viral load and co-infections in children with respiratory infections is not clear. Objective To evaluate the correlation of viral load as well as viral and bacterial co-infections with disease severity in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Study design This is a prospective study conducted in children admitted for LRTIs for two seasons. To determine viral and bacterial load of respiratory pathogens we performed multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction and semiquantitative bacterial cultures on nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA). Results During the study period 244 (60%) children were hospitalized for LRTI with acute virus-induced wheezing and 160 (40%) for radiologic confirmed pneumonia. In the first NPA, viruses were identified in 315 (78%) of the 404 samples and bacteria in 198 (63.3%) of 311 samples. The viral load significantly decreased between the first and second NPA sample in most single and viral co-infections, except rhinovirus and human bocavirus infections. Viral load was inversely related to CRP in RSV infections, whereas a positive correlation was observed in adenovirus infections. Duration of hospitalization was significantly longer in RSV single infections compared to rhinovirus single infections whereas in the latter, leucocytosis and use of systemic steroids was more common. In RSV viral co-infections the presence of fever, leucocytosis, and the use of antibiotics was significantly more frequent. Positive cultures of Haemophilus influenzae dominated in RSV and rhinovirus single infections and Moraxella catarrhalis in RSV viral co-infections. Conclusions Specific viral single and co-infections as well as viral load contribute to disease severity in children with LRTIs.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.237520492,-0.155732279,-0.092164411,0.058252056,-0.013023445,-0.169535839,0.132480786,-0.108366285,0.099544884,0.06298567,0.020438208,-0.138147278,-0.032958662,-0.041557895,0.007177655,-0.050446152,-0.027248477,-0.000768301,0.003863793,0.002924464,-0.063465006,0.02608346,-0.045619575,0.049174108,0.010842174,-0.046988935,0.139304291,-0.000237445,0.023778106,0.106652278
Epidemiology of viral respiratory tract infections in a prospective cohort of infants and toddlers attending daycare,"Abstract Background The epidemiology of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in a daycare cohort has not been explored using molecular techniques. Objectives (1) Determine the overall incidence of RTIs in a daycare cohort using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). (2) Determine the relative incidence and impact of specific respiratory viruses, and characterize and compare clinical features associated with these pathogens. Study design In this prospective cohort study conducted from February 2006 to April 2008, nasal swabs were obtained from symptomatic children ages 0–30 months enrolled in fulltime daycare. RT-PCR was performed to detect respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (MPV), influenza (Flu) viruses A and B, parainfluenza (PIV), adenovirus (AdV), human coronaviruses (CoV) and rhinovirus (RhV). Symptom diaries were completed for each illness. Results We followed 119 children (mean age 10 months; range 2–24 months) for 115 child years. The mean annual incidence of RTI per child was 4.2 the first year and 1.2 the second year of the study. At least 1 virus was identified in 67% RTIs. Co-infections were common (27% RTIs), with RhV, CoV, and AdV the most common co-pathogens. PIV was identified in 12% of RTIs with a high incidence of PIV4. The viruses with the greatest impact on our population were RSV, RhV and AdV. Conclusions Using molecular techniques, viruses were identified in approximately twice as many RTIs as previously reported in a daycare cohort. Infections with newly identified viruses, such as HMPV and CoV subtypes were less frequent and severe than infections with RSV, AdV and RhV.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.216180873,-0.028470089,-0.061577659,0.102462498,0.074455525,-0.071030656,0.059840055,-0.058803567,0.122875334,-0.028682483,0.013110605,-0.059151308,-0.048713705,-0.045580392,-0.013748156,-0.021427907,0.001966198,0.012382765,-0.010568677,-0.028472622,0.0195306,-0.010915524,0.022497084,0.02552282,0.022684013,-0.025692059,0.056613458,0.038307079,0.001697492,-0.014056312
Prevalence and clinical characteristics of human CoV-HKU1 in children with acute respiratory tract infections in China,"Abstract Background Human CoV-HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) has been isolated from a 71-year-old man with pneumonia; however, the impact and role of emerging HCoV-HKU1 have not been defined in children with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI). Objective To investigate the Prevalence and clinical characteristics of HCoV-HKU1 in children with ARTI in Lanzhou, China. Study design The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or PCR was employed to screen HCoV-HKU1 and other common respiratory viruses in 645 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) specimens collected from children with ARTI from November 2006 to October 2008. All PCR positive products were sequenced. And the demographic and clinical data were collected for all patients. Results Nineteen of 645 (2.95%) specimens tested positive for HCoV-HKU1, and all HCoV-HKU1 positive specimens were distributed in the winter and spring season. The HCoV-HKU1 co-infection rate with other respiratory viruses was 47.37% (9/19). There was no statistically significant difference in the detection rate between groups by age or gender, except between patients with and without underlying diseases. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that HCoV-HKU1 genotype B was circulating in the years 2007 and 2008 in children with ARTI in Lanzhou, China. Conclusions HCoV-HKU1 is an uncommon virus existing among Chinese children with ARTI. Children with underlying diseases are more vulnerable to viral infection. Only HCoV-HKU1 genotype B circulated locally.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.152987282,-0.043788145,-0.064915662,-0.027816826,0.14176735,-0.097171555,0.070334552,-0.059490247,0.125827269,-0.086054924,-0.0203776,0.350471346,0.237026199,0.157016659,0.00098945,0.072130823,-0.067272056,-0.035703823,-0.086981469,-0.000768097,-0.041692306,0.075060045,0.03139575,-0.062397679,-0.025279331,0.021347203,0.059565841,0.002745839,0.02866748,0.055321373
"Human bocavirus in children: Mono-detection, high viral load and viraemia are associated with respiratory tract infection","Abstract Background and objectives Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) has recently been detected in children with respiratory tract infections (RTI). In order to study whether HBoV1 can cause RTI, we investigated its presence in children with upper RTI (URTI), lower RTI (LRTI) and a control group of children without RTI. Study design Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) and blood samples were collected from children admitted to hospital with RTI from 6 June 2007 to 28 February 2009 (n =1154), and from children admitted for elective surgery who had no RTI (n =162). Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the NPAs were examined for 17 infectious agents including HBoV1. Blood samples were tested with HBoV1-PCR only. Results HBoV1 was detected in NPAs from 10% of patients and 17% of controls. Adjusted for age, gender and the presence of other viruses, HBoV1 was not associated with RTI. In the HBoV1-positive NPAs, at least one other virus was detected in 75% and the virus appeared alone in 25%. Adjusted for age and gender, the detection of HBoV1 as the sole virus was associated with RTI, but not with LRTI. Viraemia was found only in children with RTI. The study showed that it was associated with RTI and LRTI. A high HBoV1-load was associated with LRTI, but not with RTI. No interactions between HBoV1 and other infectious agents were found. Conclusions Our data support the hypothesis that HBoV1 causes RTI in children, because detection of HBoV1 alone, viraemia and high viral load are associated with RTI and/or LRTI in this age group. However, HBoV1 is common in healthy children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.084878788,-0.067319877,-0.01781523,-0.052273241,0.022977344,-0.06745486,0.060146836,-0.045687861,0.032000179,-0.015186955,0.015663242,-0.001355964,-0.029639052,-0.032080416,0.006090993,0.016631117,-0.029836881,-0.023985165,0.003157605,-0.032576498,-0.031321463,0.079250368,0.003291839,0.028958369,-0.056451482,0.033371742,-0.047577111,-0.029960804,-1.74E-06,0.013208718
Severe community-acquired pneumonia caused by adenovirus type 11 in immunocompetent adults in Beijing,"Abstract Background Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to human adenoviruses (HAdVs) in immunocompetent adults has raised concerns. Objective To describe the clinical, laboratorial, and radiological characteristics of adenovirus pneumonia and detect the type and diversity of human adenoviruses that caused acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in Beijing. Study design An etiological study of adult community-acquired pneumonia was carried out prospectively at Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital. A total of 18 cases with laboratory-confirmed adenovirus infections in 487 cases with CAP were observed clinically. The viral type and phylogenetic analysis were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results Patients with adenovirus pneumonia typically reported flu-like symptoms. Some of them developed shortness of breath or severe dyspnea on 6 days after disease onset. The patients with ARDS usually present dyspnea, higher level of serum muscle enzymes and bilateral, mutilobal consolidation and patchy/ground-glass opacities. HAdVs type was detected in 17 samples and all of them belonged to species B (HAdV-11, 7, 3 and 14). Among them, HAdV-11 was most frequently (10/17), followed by HAdV-7 (5/17). Phylogenetic analysis of the partial penton nucleotide confirmed a close relationship with stains circulating in the Beijing region. Conclusions Our identification of severe respiratory illness due to adenovirus, especially type 11 may highlight the need for rapid diagnosis and improved surveillance, which may assist with targeted development of antiviral agents or type-specific vaccines.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.153532315,-0.018284642,-0.056617802,-0.078129215,0.0230148,-0.00625254,-0.003615705,0.058335905,-0.102742738,0.055100908,-0.045946303,0.034322658,-0.01131038,-0.028421051,-0.027310641,-0.066535585,-0.071579553,0.062552934,-0.04664237,0.014311365,0.065081894,0.213306968,0.037306029,0.057854602,0.002936161,0.04957389,-0.010140037,0.228935431,-0.058792008,-0.005388035
Epidemiologic report and serologic findings for household contacts of three cases of influenza A (H7N9) virus infection,"Abstract Background and objective We conducted epidemiologic investigations and serologic assays on household contacts that were extensively exposed to three influenza A (H7N9) virus infected case-patients before infection-control practices were implemented. Study design Data on the early clinical course of each patient and the exposure history for each patient's household contacts were obtained by interviewing household members and by reviewing medical records. Viral RNA in patient samples was tested using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. Antibodies against H7N9 virus in serum samples were tested using hemagglutination inhibition and pseudovirus based neutralization assays. Results All household contacts were extensively exposed to the case-patients without the use of measures to protect against infection. Viral RNA was detected in the specimens from case-patients for approximately 7–11 days after confirmation of infection. However, the results of the analyses of serum specimens taken from the household contacts 15–26 days post exposure revealed no evidence of transmission of H7N9 virus from the case-patients to the contacts. Conclusion Despite ample unprotected exposures to case-patients during the virus shedding period, household members in this report were not infected by the H7N9 virus.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.084028947,0.016602671,-0.030353736,-0.039956113,-0.047901321,0.034616071,-0.064495462,0.101173807,-0.045816913,-0.009285864,0.030337323,0.00058144,-0.012718501,0.062739752,0.008774573,0.018460592,-0.001004367,0.008193394,0.007998833,0.004602903,0.012662786,-0.020549556,-0.067394383,-0.046320562,-0.045489722,0.013695282,0.017184913,-0.00405101,-0.064523208,0.042854098
Kinetics and pattern of viral excretion in biological specimens of two MERS-CoV cases,"Abstract Background Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging coronavirus involved in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and rapid renal failure. Hospital outbreak and nosocomial transmission were reported, however, several issues remain on the viral excretion course. Objectives Describe the kinetics and pattern of viral excretion in two infected patients. Study design After the initial diagnosis, blood, urine, rectal and respiratory samples were collected regularly, aliquoted and stored at −80°C. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay targeted the UpE and Orf1a regions of the MERS-CoV genome. Results In patient 1, who died of refractory ARDS and renal failure, MERS-CoV RNA was detected in pharyngeal and tracheal swabs, as well blood samples and urine samples until the 30th day. Rectal swabs were negative. Patient 2 also developed multiple-organ failure, but survived, with persisting renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance at 30mL/min) and persistent interstitial syndrome albeit weaned off mechanical ventilation and no longer requiring oxygen. Tracheal aspirations were positive until the 33rd day, while nasopharyngeal swabs were negative. All other biological samples were negative. Discussion Lower respiratory tract excretion of MERS-CoV could be observed for more than one month. The most severely ill patient presented an expression of the virus in blood and urine, consistent with a type-1 interferon mediated immunological response impaired in patient 1, but developed by patient 2. These results suggest that infection control precautions must be adequately evaluated in clinical wards and laboratories exposed to MERS-CoV.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.110791707,0.265824108,-0.102957544,-0.025568225,-0.013231806,-0.029925464,-0.044076935,0.281422142,0.208131151,0.005901166,0.062550171,-0.036734129,-0.020289072,0.03591874,0.026200621,-0.028559971,0.007943077,-0.069647568,0.017418667,0.007049876,0.014054371,-0.007742605,-0.006382538,0.006462068,-0.006537079,-0.034999102,-0.050048452,0.006683922,-0.036008201,-0.021677048
Clinical characteristics and outcomes of severe rhinovirus-associated pneumonia identified by bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage in adults: Comparison with severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia,"Abstract Background Rhinoviruses (RVs) may cause pneumonia, but the characteristics of RV-associated pneumonia have not been adequately evaluated.

Study design We used prospective cohort data of adult patients with severe pneumonia who had been admitted to the medical intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital over a 4-year period. The clinical features and outcomes of 27 patients with RV-positive bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were compared to those of 51 pneumonia patients with IFV-positive BAL fluid or IFV-positive nasopharyngeal specimens. Results Of 356 patients who underwent bronchoscopic BAL and respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR), RV was the most commonly identified virus (8.1%) from BAL fluid. Patients with RV-associated pneumonia were more likely to be immunocompromised than patients with IFV-associated pneumonia (81.5% vs. 33.3%, p <0.001). Bacterial coinfection tended to be less common in the RV group (18.5% vs. 37.3%, p =0.09). Although septic shock was less common in the RV group (29.6% vs. 54.9%, p =0.03), other clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and radiologic patterns were similar between the groups. The 28-day mortality of patients with severe RV- and IFV-associated pneumonia was similarly high (29.6% vs. 35.3% respectively, p =0.61). Conclusions Severe RV-associated pneumonia patients were more likely to be immunocompromised and less likely to present septic shock. Overall clinical features were similar and mortalities of both groups were comparably high. Studies of larger cohorts encompassing mild to moderate pneumonia patients are needed.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.186308907,-0.04230779,-0.109076987,-0.121336774,-0.054252986,-0.050158181,-0.068533453,0.097826752,-0.181819945,0.039455599,-0.060616676,0.030893719,-0.032597847,0.038441153,-0.089993808,-0.004249136,0.017088551,0.075177291,-0.052733712,0.070307903,0.027727913,-0.007605858,0.032413128,0.0276726,0.02301556,-0.027028025,0.037118844,-0.008471938,-0.080141721,0.026765101
Detection of respiratory viruses in gargle specimens of healthy children,"Abstract Background Respiratory tract viral infection is one of the most common and important diseases in children. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are often used to detect viruses in samples, it is difficult to interpret the clinical significance of PCR positivity, which may reflect a past, imminent or active asymptomatic infection due to their high sensitivity. Although single respiratory viruses have been detected in samples from children with symptoms, other respiratory viruses can also be detected simultaneously. However, the clinical importance of these findings for the symptoms is not known. Objectives To investigate the prevalence of respiratory viruses among children without any symptoms such as acute respiratory illness and/or fever. Study design From week twenty-five 2013 to week twenty-six 2014, gargle samples were collected from children once a week and these samples were subjected to real-time PCR to detect respiratory viruses. On each sampling day, we asked the parents about their children’s health condition. Results Among the 286 samples collected, 200 were from asymptomatic children. In the asymptomatic condition, human parechovirus, adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus 229E and HKU1 were observed in 45 episodes. In samples from symptomatic children, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus and coronavirus OC43 were detected in addition to those mentioned above. Conclusions Various viruses of different species were detected in the specimens from the children regardless of their health status. It might be speculated that host factors such as the function of the immune system influence the clinical outcome of the infection. However, this needs to be studied further.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.289043974,-0.084501122,-0.048927521,0.105623379,0.138423656,-0.144995515,0.121504808,-0.092991603,0.11120153,0.049471268,0.045122171,-0.04713986,0.055452028,0.002742101,0.094126981,-0.043721539,-0.01494785,-0.106557321,0.074709256,-0.062770807,-0.022816545,0.101004065,-0.043329246,0.043288458,-0.030804192,0.067401415,-0.043494003,-0.012027698,0.034500256,-0.089142975
The clinical impact of coronavirus infection in patients with hematologic malignancies and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients,"Abstract Background Compared to other respiratory viruses, relatively little is known about the clinical impact of coronavirus (CoV) infection after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or in patients with hematologic malignancies. Objectives To characterize the role of CoV in respiratory tract infections among HSCT and hematologic malignancy patients. Study design We conducted a retrospective review of all cases of CoV infection documented by polymerase chain reaction, (PCR)-based testing on nasopharyngeal and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples between June 2010 and 2013. Cases of CoV infection occurring in HSCT and hematologic malignancy patients were identified and the clinical characteristics of these cases were compared to other respiratory viruses. Results CoV was identified in 2.6% (n =43) of all samples analyzed (n =1661) and in 6.8% of all samples testing positive for a respiratory virus (n =631). 33 of 38 (86.8%) of patients in whom CoV was identified were HSCT and hematologic malignancy patients. Among these patients, CoV was detected in 9.7% of unique infection episodes, with only rhinovirus/enterovirus (RhV/EnV) infection being more common. Group I CoV subtypes accounted for 76.3% of cases, and 57% of infections were diagnosed between December and March. CoV infection was associated with upper respiratory tract symptoms in most patients, similar to other respiratory viruses. Possible and proven lower respiratory tract disease was less common compared to other respiratory viruses except RhV/EnV. Conclusions CoV is frequently detected in HSCT and hematologic malignancy patients in whom suspicion for a respiratory viral infection exists, but is less likely to progress to lower respiratory tract disease than most other respiratory viruses.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.230489548,0.159862302,-0.203024789,-0.003078234,0.02327658,-0.072450567,-0.011742755,0.115811615,0.053906874,0.073266544,-0.006252246,-0.021502312,0.037355078,0.055823091,0.021090166,-0.048377598,0.048945965,-0.032888352,0.040234963,0.047376581,0.068987984,-0.085480998,-0.02878408,0.046817812,0.031468246,-0.006999002,-0.058657779,0.001314087,-0.013783591,-0.040775238
Diagnostics-in-a-Suitcase: Development of a portable and rapid assay for the detection of the emerging avian influenza A (H7N9) virus,"Abstract Background In developing countries, equipment necessary for diagnosis is only available in few central laboratories, which are less accessible and of limited capacity to test large numbers of incoming samples. Moreover, the transport conditions of samples are inadequate, therefore leading to unreliable results. Objectives The development of a rapid, inexpensive, and simple test would allow mobile detection of viruses. Study design A suitcase laboratory “Diagnostics-in-a-Suitcase” (56cm×45.5cm×26.5cm) containing all reagents and devices necessary for performing a reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay was developed. As an example, two RT-RPA assays were established for the detection of hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) genes of the novel avian influenza (H7N9) virus. Results The sensitivities of the H7 and the N9 RT-RPA assays were 10 and 100 RNA molecules, respectively. The assays were performed at a single temperature (42°C). The results were obtained within 2–7min. The H7N9 RT-RPA assays did not show a cross-detection either of any other respiratory viruses affecting humans and/or birds or of the human or chicken genomes. All reagents were used, stored, and transported at ambient temperature, that is, cold chain independent. In addition, the Diagnostics-in-a-Suitcase was operated by a solar-powered battery. Conclusions The developed assay protocol and mobile setup performed well. Moreover, it can be easily implemented to perform diagnoses at airports, quarantine stations, or farms for rapid on-site viral nucleic acid detection.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.053765466,0.087021984,0.282132638,0.165319373,-0.050880882,-0.011839422,0.024055954,0.036501939,-0.015493204,-0.039491052,-0.06704274,0.042299681,-0.027011124,-0.031814275,-0.069982792,0.07842464,-0.051737194,-0.067570706,0.118786045,0.210647843,0.062818115,-0.015468131,-0.034877397,-0.017518056,-0.091837875,0.053369447,0.062713575,0.016963905,0.050581777,-0.067925192
Seasonal variations of respiratory viruses and etiology of human rhinovirus infection in children,"Abstract Background Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method it is possible to detect uncultivable viruses and discover multiple viral infections. However, the clinical importance of these findings in relation to symptoms is not known. Objectives The seasonal fluctuations of respiratory viruses and the clinical outcomes of single infections and dual infections were investigated. Study design Nasal aspirate samples were obtained from outpatients and inpatients of a children’s hospital and these samples were subjected to real-time PCR to detect 16 respiratory viruses. Seasonal variations of the 16 viruses and the clinical outcomes such as wheezing, the need for oxygenation and prolonged hospitalization of patients with single viral infections and multiple infections were determined for the 5 most often detected viruses. Results Among 512 specimens analyzed, one or more viruses were detected in 424 (83%) specimens. Two or more viruses were detected in 160 samples (31% of all samples). The epidemic peaks of the viruses did not coincide with each other. Rhinoviruses were the most frequently detected viruses and their coinfection rates were also higher. However, the disease severity in the lower respiratory tract did not differ in most respiratory viral infections regardless of whether there was single infection or dual infection with a rhinovirus and other respiratory virus. Conclusions Seasonal distribution was seen for each virus. There were no significant differences in clinical symptoms in the children studied. Because the infection of rhinoviruses is the common occurrence in children, it is hypothesized that the factors related to disease severity are mainly the underlying conditions of the children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.280306979,-0.108705458,-0.052506409,0.118602229,0.077553424,-0.126687816,0.096912899,-0.054265265,0.046866733,0.105669212,0.040519471,-0.079693446,0.05435075,0.027307045,0.078793616,-0.071962115,0.004668858,-0.078593717,0.050113738,0.004467166,0.009318498,0.033951906,-0.078715697,0.092319259,-0.042680819,0.027598454,-0.012986822,-0.041890963,0.029041302,-0.049372039
External quality assessment for the molecular detection of MERS-CoV in China,"Abstract Background In May 2015, an imported case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection occurred in China, so rapid and reliable diagnosis of suspected cases was necessary. Objectives An external quality assessment (EQA) program for the molecular detection of MERS-CoV was organized by the National Center for Clinical Laboratories (NCCL). Study design MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs) encapsulating specific RNA sequences of MERS-CoV were prepared as positive specimens. The assessment panel, which comprised of three negative and seven positive samples with different concentrations of VLPs, was distributed to 56 laboratories from 16 provinces, municipalities, or autonomous regions for molecular detection. Results Among the received data sets, three employed an in-house-developed real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay and the others applied various commercial rRT-PCR kits. Overall, the majority of laboratories (46/56, 82.1%) could achieve 100% accuracy for MERS-CoV detection, but three laboratories (5.4%) still had room for improvement. Consequently, all negative samples were identified correctly, reaching 100% specificity. The false-negative rate was 3.1%, and most of the false-negative results were obtained from samples with relatively low concentration, indicating an urgent need to improve detection in weak-positive specimens. Conclusions The majority of participants possessed reliable diagnostic capacity for the detection of MERS-CoV. Moreover, EQA is indispensable because it can help enhance the diagnostic capability for the surveillance of MERS-CoV infections and allow comparison of the results among different laboratories.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.089362207,0.298913177,0.015065038,0.045121096,0.00725774,-0.019779205,-0.027389626,0.306492328,0.231439431,0.006675241,0.044843398,-0.029355517,-0.02537147,-0.03225645,0.030296187,-0.025665896,-0.007445613,-0.07635786,0.015955061,-0.077934514,-0.023673564,0.026243192,0.068016884,-0.024583296,-0.002951811,-0.025066414,-0.025470784,0.003348215,-0.029630924,0.022461141
Pitfalls in interpretation of CT-values of RT-PCR in children with acute respiratory tract infections,"Abstract Background The relation between viral load and disease severity in childhood acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) is not fully understood. Objectives To assess the clinical relevance of the relation between viral load, determined by cycle threshold (CT) value of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays and disease severity in children with single- and multiple viral ARI. Study design 582 children with ARI were prospectively followed and tested for 15 viruses. Correlations were calculated between CT values and clinical parameters. Results In single viral ARI, statistically significant correlations were found between viral loads of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and hospitalization and between viral loads of Human Coronavirus (HCoV) and a disease severity score. In multiple-viral ARI, statistically significant correlations between viral load and clinical parameters were found. In RSV-Rhinovirus (RV) multiple infections, a low viral load of RV was correlated with a high length of hospital stay and a high duration of extra oxygen use. The mean CT value for RV, HCoV and Parainfluenza virus was significantly lower in single- versus multiple infections. Conclusion Although correlations between CT values and clinical parameters in patients with single and multiple viral infection were found, the clinical importance of these findings is limited because individual differences in host-, viral and laboratory factors complicate the interpretation of statistically significant findings. In multiple infections, viral load cannot be used to differentiate between disease causing virus and innocent bystanders.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.15455071,-0.089894839,-0.074512588,0.039104024,-0.028479567,-0.103091056,0.095138011,-0.066366241,0.070173081,0.047329775,0.014576464,-0.018191609,0.064552658,0.034036291,-0.003887533,-0.003684986,-0.046803075,-0.015978875,-0.033234553,0.016670242,-0.077357662,0.011110724,-0.099650416,0.027609061,-0.027290722,-0.045913254,0.166066572,-0.06611597,-0.027122121,0.077964424
Diagnostic yield and clinical impact of routine cell culture for respiratory viruses among children with a negative multiplex RT-PCR result,"Abstract Background Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the reference standard for respiratory virus testing. However, cell culture may still have added value in identifying viruses not detected by PCR. Objectives We aimed to estimate the yield and clinical impact of routine respiratory virus culture among children with a negative PCR result. Study design A retrospective cohort study was performed from Jan. 2013 to Sept. 2015. Respiratory samples from hospitalized or immunocompromised patients <18years old were routinely inoculated on traditional tube cell culture monolayers if they tested negative by a PCR assay for 12 respiratory viruses. We studied patients with a respiratory specimen negative by PCR and positive by culture. Duplicates and samples of sold services were excluded. Data on demographics, clinical history, laboratory findings, and patient management were collected from patients’ charts. Descriptive and multivariate statistics were performed. Results Overall, 4638 PCR-negative samples were inoculated in cell culture. Of those, 196 (4.2%) were cell culture positive, and 144 met study inclusion criteria. Most subjects (81.9%) were hospitalized. Mean age was 2.4±3.4years. The viruses most frequently isolated were cytomegalovirus (33.3%) and enteroviruses (19.4%). Cell culture results prompted a change in management in 5 patients (3.5%), all of whom had acyclovir initiated for localized HSV-1 infection. Four of these had skin or mucosal lesions that could be sampled to establish a diagnosis. Conclusion In children, routine viral culture on respiratory specimens that were negative by PCR has low yield and minimal clinical impact.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.230236239,-0.00579339,0.018185229,-0.003459415,-0.016762049,-0.082468698,-0.026291189,0.030230301,-0.051706321,0.073270493,0.017901985,-0.04764235,0.037750275,0.108846286,0.050980758,-0.054782361,0.057697848,-0.004533382,0.014237633,-0.091775467,0.04441999,0.022359387,0.038460491,-0.078597869,-0.050537587,0.048260268,-0.014130291,-0.054913083,-0.039400413,-0.039968338
Systematic review of respiratory viral pathogens identified in adults with community-acquired pneumonia in Europe,"Abstract Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an important respiratory disease and the fifth leading cause of mortality in Europe. The development of molecular diagnostic tests has highlighted the contributions of respiratory viruses to the aetiology of CAP, suggesting the incidence of viral pneumonia may have been previously underestimated. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to describe the overall identification of respiratory viruses in adult patients with CAP in Europe, following PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO; CRD42016037233). We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, WHOLIS, COCHRANE library and grey literature sources for relevant studies, and screened these against protocol eligibility criteria. Two researchers performed data extraction and risk of bias assessments, independently, using a piloted form. Results were synthesised narratively, and random effects meta-analyses performed to calculate pooled estimates of effect; heterogeneity was quantified using I2. Twenty-eight studies met inclusion criteria of which 21 were included in the primary meta-analysis. The pooled proportion of patients with identified respiratory viruses was 22.0% (95% CI: 18.0%–27.0%), rising to 29.0% (25.0%–34.0%) in studies where polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostics were performed. Influenza virus was the most frequently detected virus in 9% (7%–12%) of adults with CAP. Respiratory viruses make a substantial contribution to the aetiology of CAP in adult patients in Europe; one or more respiratory viruses are detected in about one quarter of all cases.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.167976483,-0.071312638,-0.071395725,0.01614457,-0.016558396,-0.011295707,-0.012512417,0.071179182,-0.132339563,0.090917457,-0.065619685,-0.006442428,0.045877219,-0.006893929,-0.059322677,-0.048691561,-0.008879835,-0.027300616,-0.036337494,0.0904504,-0.007627513,0.062533205,0.15203016,0.084856777,0.083285178,-0.084234686,-0.010881999,-0.006999461,0.082197951,-0.038460118
Kinetics of viral load and cytokines in severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome,"Abstract Background Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease in China, Japan, and Korea, which is characterized by high fever, thrombocytopenia, and high mortality. It is hypothesized that a cytokine storm plays an important role in the pathophysiology of SFTS. However, limited data have been published on the detailed kinetics of the viral load and cytokine profiles throughout the course of this disease. Objectives We investigated the patterns of changes in cytokines and viral load in SFTS patients. Study design During the admission period of patients, RNA was extracted from plasma and quantified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In addition, cytokine bead arrays were performed for the 18 cytokines and chemokines selected for testing. Results The median time from admission to the negative conversion of SFTS viremia was 17.0 days. When censored patients were found to be negative for viral load at discharge, the median duration of viral shedding was 13.0 days (95% CI, 5.4–20.6). Interferon (IFN)-α, interleukin (IL)-10, and IFN-γ-induced protein (IP)-10 concentrations significantly increased in the early course of disease and then decreased during the hospital stay. However, the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, IL-12p40, IL-13, IL-17A, Regulated on Activation and Normally T-cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) increased during the late course of disease. Initial IP-10 levels during hospital days 1–4 were the most significantly correlated with initial viral load (r = 0.88, P < .01). Conclusion SFTS viremia persisted until weeks 2–3 and was highly correlated with initial plasma IP-10 levels. In addition, IFN-α, IL-10, and IP-10 were associated with the initial cytokine storm in SFTS.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.039632255,-0.023782727,-0.043568628,-0.162291803,-0.123874986,-0.010801634,0.012333301,0.00976021,-0.018019242,-0.038394406,0.000116184,-0.041562009,-0.055436953,0.108409574,-0.078277641,0.03744928,-0.040412744,-0.041831821,-0.008677821,-0.020870658,-0.029649516,-0.051189638,-0.008933808,0.002595079,-0.109259218,-0.065395762,0.09624485,-0.036684001,-0.042486196,0.029571339
Human coronavirus circulation in the United States 2014–2017,"Abstract Background Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) -OC43, -229E, -NL63 and -HKU1 cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections. HCoVs are globally distributed and the predominant species may vary by region or year. Prior studies have shown seasonal patterns of HCoV species and annual variation in species prevalence but national circulation patterns in the US have not yet been described. Objectives To describe circulation patterns of HCoVs -OC43, -229E, -NL63 and -HKU1 in the US. Study design We reviewed real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test results for HCoV-OC43, -229E, -NL63 and -HKU1 reported to The National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) by U.S. laboratories from July 2014–June 2017. We calculated the total number of tests and percent positive by week. For a subset of HCoV positive submissions with age and sex of the patient available, we tested for differences in age and sex across the four HCoV species using Chi Square and Kruskal Wallace tests. Results 117 laboratories reported 854,575 HCoV tests; 2.2% were positive for HCoV-OC43, 1.0% for HCoV-NL63, 0.8% for HCoV-229E, and 0.6% for HCoV-HKU1. The percentage of positive tests peaked during December – March each year. No significant differences in sex were seen across species, although a significant difference in age distribution was noted. Conclusions Common HCoVs may have annual peaks of circulation in winter months in the US, and individual HCoVs may show variable circulation from year to year. Different HCoV species may be detected more frequently in different age groups.

Clinical decision making in the emergency department setting using rapid PCR: Results of the CLADE study group,"Abstract Background Emergency Departments (ED) are challenged during influenza season by patients who present acutely during sporadic ED visits. ED management is largely empiric, often occurring without reliable diagnostics needed for targeted therapies, safe outpatient discharge, or hospital admissions. Objective To evaluate the impact of the influenza diagnosis on physician decision making during ED visits using the Cobas Liat® influenza A + B assay. Study design Prospective study assessing the impact of rapid (<30 min), reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) influenza testing on physician decision making in the ED. Physician responses established pre-and post-diagnosis management courses which required confirmation via secondary documentation in the medical record. Changes in physician decision making were analyzed across four clinical touchpoints: (i) admission/discharge status, (ii) medical procedures, (iii) antiviral and antibiotic prescribing, and (iv) laboratory studies. Results An influenza diagnosis changed patient management courses, relative to empiric, pre-diagnosis plans, in in 61% of the cases resulting in cost savings of $49,420-to-$42,270 over 143 patients and 104 days during influenza season resulting in a cost savings of $200.40/ED visit. Evaluation over 2000 ED patient visits projects cost savings > $578,000 due to deferred admissions, and reduction in antiviral prescribing. Sensitivity of ED-based influenza testing using the Cobas Liat® assay was equivalent to centralized lab testing at 98.8% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity respectively. Conclusion Providing rapid, RT-PCR influenza testing to ED settings is actionable and used to guide patient care decisions. Understanding the cascade of events linked to the influenza diagnosis in the ED provides overall cost savings which offset the cost of providing ED-based testing.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.091491151,-0.014253053,0.056529011,0.069256429,-0.07811358,0.152991465,-0.084302068,0.041788166,-0.049905379,-0.059266719,-0.011578722,0.026728893,0.006420789,-0.028129193,-0.022848066,0.031297035,0.014760335,0.032755553,-0.02948888,-0.04693109,0.013797973,-0.048427549,0.005683104,-0.057299305,3.73E-05,-0.013986343,-0.00217584,-0.02134777,0.022955723,0.030157337
WU polyomavirus detected in children with severe respiratory failure,"Abstract Background WU polyomavirus (WUPyV) is a relatively new virus associated with respiratory infections. However, its role is unclear in children with severe respiratory failure. Objectives We aimed to evaluate the characteristics of severe respiratory failure associated with WUPyV infection in children. Study design We retrospectively reviewed cases of respiratory tract infection at a tertiary children's hospital in Japan and performed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for WUPyV using residual extracted nucleic acid samples taken from respiratory tract samples of pediatric patients primarily with respiratory failure. We investigated the clinical characteristics of patients positive for WUPyV and assessed samples positive for WUPyV for other respiratory pathogens using multiplex PCR. Results WUPyV was detected in 14 of 318 specimens of respiratory tract infections. The median age was 34 months and males were predominant (n = 11, 64%). An underlying disease was found in 11 (79%) patients including five preterm and three immunocompromised patients. The most common clinical diagnosis was pneumonia (n = 13, 93%). The majority of the samples were endotracheal tube aspirates (n = 11, 79%). Other viruses were co-detected in nine (64%) patients, while WUPyV was the only pathogen detected in five patients with a history of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. These five patients presented with fever and cough, and perihilar infiltrates were detected on chest radiograph in several days. Conclusions WUPyV was detected in children with severe respiratory failure independently or concurrently with other pathogens. WUPyV can be a pathogen for children with a history of preterm birth or an underlying disease.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.232509545,-0.040619368,-0.076416602,-0.045214621,0.007537364,-0.112718849,0.001414027,0.02306454,-0.022060111,0.051534484,-0.003546065,0.007368823,0.010580504,0.023504772,0.007904861,-0.014692787,0.017755868,0.008651079,0.018235168,0.014398924,0.029988166,-0.001868485,-0.025590658,-0.026665322,0.003944806,0.021000835,-0.061571333,-0.000591072,-0.002892678,-0.036493334
Human adenovirus in nasopharyngeal and blood samples from children with and without respiratory tract infections,"Abstract Background Human adenovirus (HAdV) is a double-stranded DNA virus associated with respiratory tract infections (RTI) in children. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, HAdV often is detected together with other virus species, even in healthy controls. Objectives The aim of this study was to compare molecular detection of HAdV with culture, and to examine the associations of various methods to RTI. Study design Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected from 4319 children admitted with RTI and from 361 controls. The NPAs were examined for 23 viral and bacterial pathogens, using inhouse real-time PCR-assays based on TaqMan probes, in addition to bacterial and viral culture. HAdV concentration was evaluated semi-quantitatively from the Ct-value and quantitatively by use of ADENOVIRUS R-gene®. Results HAdV-DNA was detected in 6.1% patient samples and in 10.5% controls (p< 0.001). Compared to controls, patients had an OR of 3.8 (95% CI 1.4–10.3) for mono-detection of HAdV DNA, and an OR of 5.1 (95% CI 2.0–13.4) for HAdV-positive samples grew adenovirus by culture. HAdV DNA loads from children with RTI consisted of two clusters: one cluster with high viral loads (Ct < 30 and >106 copies/ml) and one cluster with low viral loads, whereas among the controls, nearly all had low viral loads (OR 7.8, 95% CI 2.2–27.1). In 61 available plasma samples, 16.4% were positive for HAdV DNA, all were from patients. Conclusion The detection of HAdV DNA per se by qualitative PCR is not useful as a diagnostic test. Detection of HAdV by use of viral culture and a high viral HAdV DNA load are the two methods most strongly associated with RTI in children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.123780053,-0.049390247,0.039446142,-0.052011095,-0.003390446,-0.092657554,0.066124527,-0.036641796,-0.020475785,0.004263838,-0.031191857,0.003287236,-0.04183107,-0.067475502,-0.012185016,0.010358586,-0.118133345,-0.029302339,0.00154853,-0.106978664,-0.065946461,0.310383849,0.034318796,0.07184948,-0.191559869,0.093665268,-0.064767039,0.18307652,-0.194950764,0.074046832
Molecular and clinical characterization of human adenovirus associated with acute respiratory tract infection in hospitalized children,"Abstract Background Human adenovirus (HAdV) is a common pathogen in children that can cause acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI), but the molecular epidemiological and clinical information relating to HAdV among hospitalized children with ARTI are few reported in China. Objectives To evaluate the epidemiological, clinical, and molecular characteristics of HAdV infections among hospitalized children with ARTI in Hebei, Northern China from June 2017 to May 2018. Study design A 12-month longitudinal, retrospective study on HAdV, typed by nested polymerase chain reaction targeting the hexon gene’s hypervariable region (typing was merely performed by sequencing of the hexon neutralization epitope and thus genotypes could not be identified unequivocally), associated with ARTI was performed. The epidemiological and clinical data of different types of HAdV were analyzed using statistical product and service solutions (SPSS) 21.0 software. Results HAdV was detected in 330 (3.71%) of the 8906 specimens, with most (88.48%, 292/330) HAdV-positives cases detected among children < 3 years old. HAdV were detected throughout the year with a higher prevalence in spring. 11 types were identified, with HAdV-2 (33.33%, 110/330) as the predominant type, followed by HAdV-3 (21.21%, 70/330) and HAdV-7 (13.94%, 46/330). Of the 330 HAdV-positive specimens, 247 (74.85%) were co-detected with other respiratory pathogens, most commonly rhinovirus (HRV) (58.7%, 145/247). Additionally, patients with HAdV-7 positive had longer duration of fever than HAdV-2 or -3 positive patients. Conclusions During the study period, HAdV-2, HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 were the predominant types identified from children with ARTI in Hebei Province. Pediatric patients with HAdV-7 positive may not present more severe clinical outcome except a longer duration of fever.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.103229459,-0.058013001,-0.036270776,-0.096515969,0.046325526,-0.061327399,0.032457979,-0.025926072,0.015299358,-0.013329987,-0.021837765,0.049656113,-0.053149444,-0.064289432,0.024054798,-0.022196002,-0.087035464,0.039012185,-0.025821562,-0.075221893,0.037049165,0.253608343,-0.031732339,0.052895497,-0.153295915,0.162261818,-0.061037254,0.346448163,-0.143111378,0.048553815
"Detection of viral, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in exacerbations of asthma in children","Abstract Background: A high frequency of virus infections has been recently pointed out in the exacerbations of asthma in children. Objectives: To confirm this, using conventional and molecular detection methods, and expanding the study to younger children. Study design: One hundred and thirty-two nasal aspirates from 75 children hospitalized for a severe attack of asthma were studied (32 infants, mean age 9.1 months; and 43 children, mean age 5.6 years). According to the virus, a viral isolation technique, immunofluorescence assays (IFA) or both were used for the detection of rhinovirus, enterovirus, respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, adenovirus, coronavirus 229E, influenza and parainfluenza virus. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were used for the detection of rhinovirus, enterovirus, RS virus, adenovirus, coronavirus 229E and OC43, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Results: Using IFA and viral isolation techniques, viruses were detected in 33.3% of cases, and by PCR techniques, nucleic acid sequences of virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were obtained in 71.9% of cases. The combination of conventional and molecular techniques detects 81.8% of positive samples. Two organisms were identified in the same nasal sample in 20.4% of the cases. The percentage of detections was higher (85.9%) in the younger group than in the other (77%). The most frequently detected agents were rhinovirus (46.9%) and RS virus (21.2%). Using PCR rather than conventional techniques, the detection rates were increased 5.8- and 1.6-fold in rhinovirus and RS virus infections, respectively. The detection levels of the other organisms are as follows: 9.8, 5.1, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.7, and 2.2% for enterovirus, influenza virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, respectively. Conclusion: These results confirm the previously reported high frequency of rhinovirus detection in asthmatic exacerbations in children. They also point out the frequency of RS virus detection, and emphasize the fact that PCR assays may be necessary to diagnose respiratory infections in asthma.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.225029149,-0.093841318,0.034805814,0.088079755,0.028993524,-0.089205193,0.044603071,-0.053783902,0.000512581,0.078009708,-0.03054731,-0.075558867,0.059125109,-0.094406228,0.077207548,0.000518534,0.028541393,-0.095405253,0.052239151,-0.092287377,-0.071424103,0.03057552,0.132487847,0.052526136,0.028315911,0.110861255,0.007982094,0.048637924,0.032633737,0.0483245
Methods to detect infectious human enteric viruses in environmental water samples,"Abstract Currently, a wide range of analytical methods is available for virus detection in environmental water samples. Molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) have the highest sensitivity and specificity to investigate virus contamination in water, so they are the most commonly used in environmental virology. Despite great sensitivity of PCR, the main limitation is the lack of the correlation between the detected viral genome and viral infectivity, which limits conclusions regarding the significance for public health. To provide information about the infectivity of the detected viruses, cultivation on animal cell culture is the gold standard. However, cell culture infectivity assays are laborious, time consuming and costly. Also, not all viruses are able to produce cytopathic effect and viruses such as human noroviruses have no available cell line for propagation. In this brief review, we present a summary and critical evaluation of different approaches that have been recently proposed to overcome limitations of the traditional cell culture assay and PCR assay such as integrated cell culture-PCR, detection of genome integrity, detection of capsid integrity, and measurement of oxidative damages on viral capsid protein. Techniques for rapid detection of infectious viruses such as fluorescence microscopy and automated flow cytometry have also been suggested to assess virus infectivity in water samples.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.026718968,0.029538044,0.182367346,0.073752922,-0.046083548,0.005981323,0.067734255,-0.019277343,-0.008598473,0.084555061,-0.045833617,-0.07449632,0.07333838,0.016519685,0.069389198,-0.068907943,0.002343974,-0.038696199,0.00168208,-0.081589096,0.021967816,0.049898469,0.056796811,-0.022361354,-0.065661097,0.021028494,0.050057627,-0.044756772,-0.075595554,-0.010664903
The emergence of influenza A H7N9 in human beings 16 years after influenza A H5N1: a tale of two cities,"Summary Infection with either influenza A H5N1 virus in 1997 or avian influenza A H7N9 virus in 2013 caused severe pneumonia that did not respond to typical or atypical antimicrobial treatment, and resulted in high mortality. Both viruses are reassortants with internal genes derived from avian influenza A H9N2 viruses that circulate in Asian poultry. Both viruses have genetic markers of mammalian adaptation in their haemagglutinin and polymerase PB2 subunits, which enhanced binding to human-type receptors and improved replication in mammals, respectively. Hong Kong (affected by H5N1 in 1997) and Shanghai (affected by H7N9 in 2013) are two rapidly flourishing cosmopolitan megacities that were increasing in human population and poultry consumption before the outbreaks. Both cities are located along the avian migratory route at the Pearl River delta and Yangtze River delta. Whether the widespread use of the H5N1 vaccine in east Asia—with suboptimum biosecurity measures in live poultry markets and farms—predisposed to the emergence of H7N9 or other virus subtypes needs further investigation. Why H7N9 seems to be more readily transmitted from poultry to people than H5N1 is still unclear.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.009285788,-0.062955069,-0.014423132,0.044723671,0.01725221,0.216427518,-0.041234035,0.010155978,0.002613592,0.039564261,0.00315891,0.008761289,-0.004765111,0.005432201,0.003399408,0.02645983,-0.029888556,-0.004907748,-0.027850501,0.045264055,0.044550791,0.007350308,-0.020138019,0.059292485,-0.042597337,-0.006948085,-0.026784022,0.00684369,0.012308192,-0.055276505
Structural analysis of inhibition mechanisms of Aurintricarboxylic Acid on SARS-CoV polymerase and other proteins,"Abstract We recently published experimental results that indicated Aurintricarboxylic Acid (ATA) could selectively inhibit SARS-CoV replication inside host cells by greater than 1000 times. This inhibition suggested that ATA could be developed as potent anti-viral drug. Here, to extend our experimental observation, we have incorporated protein structural studies (with positive/negative controls) to investigate the potential binding modes/sites of ATA onto RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from SARS-CoV and other pathogenic positive-strand RNA-viruses, as well as other proteins in SARS-CoV based on the fact that ATA binds to Ca2+-activated neutral protease (m-calpain), the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) and HIV integrase which have existing crystal structures. Eight regions with homologous 3D-conformation were derived for 10 proteins of interest. One of the region, R binding (754–766 in SARS-CoV's RdRp), located in the palm sub-domain mainly constituted of anti-parallel β-strand-turn-β-strand hairpin structures that covers two of the three RdRp catalytic sites (Asp 760, Asp761), was also predicted by molecular docking method (based on free energy of binding ΔG) to be important binding motif recognized by ATA. The existence of this strictly conserved region that incorporated catalytic residues, coupled with the homologous ATA binding pockets and their consistent ΔG values, suggested strongly ATA may be involved in an analogous inhibition mechanism of SARS-COV's RdRp in concomitant to the case in m-calpain, PTP and HIV integrase.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.153129344,0.204734753,-0.16549687,0.056222044,-0.061708498,-0.003654918,0.012631163,-0.083399005,-0.014971718,-0.00409095,0.03495683,0.078927117,-0.055524682,-0.06723993,-0.036893965,-0.022520425,0.042032259,-0.03463502,-0.00669265,-0.039195953,-0.007390304,0.01281944,0.042958185,-0.009993419,0.029458566,0.022437825,-0.014663253,0.015879352,0.061171283,0.047391057
A systematic review of emerging respiratory viruses at the Hajj and possible coinfection with Streptococcus pneumoniae,"Abstract Background The annual Hajj to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia attracts millions of pilgrims from around the world. International health community's attention goes towards this mass gathering and the possibility of the development of any respiratory tract infections due to the high risk of acquisition of respiratory viruses. Method We searched MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus databases for relevant papers describing the prevalence of respiratory viruses among Hajj pilgrims. Results The retrieved articles were summarized based on the methodology of testing for these viruses. A total of 31 studies were included in the quantitative/qualitative analyses. The main methods used for the diagnosis of most common respiratory viruses were polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Influenza, rhinovirus and parainfluenza were the most common viruses detected among pilgrims. Coronaviruses other than MERS-CoV were also detected among pilgrims. The acquisition of MERS-CoV remains very limited and systematic screening of pilgrims showed no infections. Conclusions Well conducted multinational follow-up studies using the same methodology of testing are necessary for accurate surveillance of respiratory viral infections among Hajj pilgrims. Post-Hajj cohort studies would further evaluate the impact of the Hajj on the acquisition of respiratory viruses.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.110908734,0.032300151,-0.042895778,0.064702415,0.017404455,0.029867148,0.037194781,0.10126216,0.104580514,0.035497209,0.001002342,-0.026995224,0.042064194,-0.032914935,0.042804449,-0.030229312,0.012040973,-0.07889881,0.020799321,-0.018729754,0.006874778,-0.060215753,0.002260829,0.036429516,0.026742039,-0.002899844,-0.057167679,-0.00296081,0.039168503,-0.081725576
Molecular Diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome The State of the Art,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first appeared in Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002. Although virus isolation and serology were useful early in the SARS outbreak for diagnosing new cases, these tests are not generally useful because virus culture requires a BSL-3 laboratory and seroconversion is often delayed until 2 to 3 weeks after infection. The first qualitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-coronavirus (CoV) were sensitive and capable of detecting 1 to 10 genome equivalents. These assays were quickly supplemented with quantitative real-time assays that helped elucidate the natural history of SARS, particularly the initial presence of low viral loads in the upper respiratory tract and high viral loads in the lower respiratory tract. The unique natural history of SARS-CoV infection dictates the testing of both respiratory and nonrespiratory specimens, the testing of multiple specimens from the same patient, and sending out positives to be confirmed by a reference laboratory. Commercially available reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS have recently appeared; however, meaningful evaluations of these assays have not yet been performed and their true performance has not been determined. These and other issues related to diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection are discussed in this review.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.108566626,0.433370182,-0.172521182,0.05183419,-0.056560432,-0.016359136,-0.035346584,-0.240664346,-0.015262866,0.030366865,-0.014425589,-0.04859441,0.090938506,-0.060364838,0.069707754,-0.006577663,-0.038823719,-0.007751202,-0.003535921,-0.006477725,0.01588824,-0.027617117,-0.014894191,-0.038423433,-0.044437212,-0.020341877,-0.009511058,-0.002048129,-0.019847023,-0.020666817
Role of Atypical Pathogens in Nursing Home–Acquired Pneumonia,"Abstract Objectives No international consensus has been reached on the empirical use of antibiotics with atypical coverage in nursing home–acquired pneumonia (NHAP). Aspiration is an important cause of NHAP, but it may not require antimicrobial treatment. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of AP infections and review the need for empirical antibiotics with atypical coverage in NHAP. Design A prospective cohort study. Setting Four nursing homes with a total number of 772 residents. Participants Patients were aged ≥ 65 years, hospitalized for NHAP, which was defined as the presence of respiratory symptoms and abnormal chest radiographs, from April 2006 to March 2007. Measurements Demographics, clinical parameters, and investigation results were recorded. Microbial investigations comprised sputum routine and mycobacterial cultures, blood and urine cultures, serology, and nasopharyngeal aspirate viral culture and polymerase chain reaction tests. Suspected aspiration pneumonitis was arbitrarily defined as NHAP without pathogens identified. Results After excluding lone bacteriuria, 108 episodes of NHAP in 94 patients were included. Twelve APs were detected in 11 patients. There was no clinical feature to distinguish between infections caused by APs and other pathogens. The commonest APs were Mycoplasma pneumoniae (6) and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (3). No Legionella pneumophila was detected by urinary antigen test. None of the patients with AP infection received antibiotics indicated for AP infections. However, AP infections did not result in mortality. No pathogen was isolated in 31.5% of cases. Patients without pathogens isolated were less likely to have purulent sputum and crepitations on chest auscultation, compared with those with pneumonia caused by identified pathogens. Conclusions Atypical pathogens (APs) were not associated with mortality even in cases where the prescribed antibiotics did not cover APs. NHAP may not necessarily be treated with empirical antibiotics covering APs.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.181723217,-0.053318154,-0.073510143,-0.103402171,-0.06361961,-0.055333625,-0.005946313,0.083288301,-0.117895713,0.095403937,-0.035740883,-0.008066721,0.029559675,-0.02033428,-0.01176669,-0.031132104,-0.000753691,0.041261685,-0.015467541,0.024534508,0.019810514,0.022453505,0.040175213,-0.015383108,0.0595872,0.025735616,0.002559629,0.028422353,0.043169463,-0.019850086
"Evaluation of Viruses Associated With Acute Respiratory Infections in Long-Term Care Facilities Using a Novel Method: Wisconsin, 2016‒2019","Abstract Residents of long-term care facilities (LCTFs) have high morbidity and mortality associated with acute respiratory infections (ARIs). Limited information exists on the virology of ARI in LTCFs, where virological testing is reactive. We report on findings of a surveillance feasibility substudy from a larger prospective trial of introducing rapid influenza diagnostic testing (RIDT) at 10 Wisconsin LTCFs. Any resident with symptoms consistent with ARI had a nasal swab specimen collected for RIDT by staff. Following RIDT, the residual swab was placed into viral transport medium and tested for influenza using Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and for 20 pathogens using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction respiratory pathogen panel. Numbers of viruses in each of 7 categories (influenza A, influenza B, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus) across the 3 years were compared using χ2. Totals of 160, 215, and 122 specimens were collected during 2016‒2017, 2017‒2018, and 2018‒2019, respectively. Respiratory pathogen panel identified viruses in 54.8% of tested specimens. Influenza A (19.2%), influenza B (12.6%), respiratory syncytial virus (15.9%), and human metapneumovirus (20.9%) accounted for 69% of all detections, whereas coronaviruses (17.2%), rhinovirus/enterovirus (10.5%) and parainfluenza (3.8%) were less common. The distribution of viruses varied significantly across the 3 years (χ2 = 71.663; df = 12; P < .001). Surveillance in LTCFs using nasal swabs collected for RIDT is highly feasible and yields high virus identification rates. Significant differences in virus composition occurred across the 3 study years. Simple approaches to surveillance may provide a more comprehensive assessment of respiratory viruses in LTCF settings.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.254055896,-0.112799841,-0.050573032,0.213003464,0.062966695,0.121556133,-0.049735656,-0.008733383,9.39E-05,-0.011055935,-0.000504115,-0.030412629,0.064860073,-0.024592158,0.041957939,-0.039518042,0.007235604,-0.08846733,0.063971395,-0.01934574,-0.014911683,-0.064853363,-0.009967272,-0.012472318,0.051477388,0.035338437,-0.02842286,0.056624987,0.008096382,-0.137644022
"Clinical picture, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in children","Summary Children are susceptible to infection by SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) but the clinical picture of SARS is milder than in adults. Teenagers resemble adults in presentation and disease progression and may develop severe illness requiring intensive care and assisted ventilation. Fever, malaise, cough, coryza, chills or rigor, sputum production, headache, myalgia, leucopaenia, lymphopaenia, thrombocytopaenia, mildly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin times and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels are common presenting features. Radiographic findings are non-specific but high-resolution computed tomography of the thorax in clinically suspected cases may be an early diagnostic aid when initial chest radiographs appear normal. The improved reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are critical in the early diagnosis of SARS, with sensitivity approaching 80% in the first 3 days of illness when performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates, the preferred specimens. Absence of seroconversion to SARS-CoV beyond 28 days from disease onset generally excludes the diagnosis. The best treatment strategy for SARS among children remains to be determined. No case fatality has been reported in children and the short- to medium-term outcome appears to be good. The importance of continued monitoring for any long-term complications due to the disease or its empiric treatment, cannot be overemphasised.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.106112958,0.313475586,-0.151054277,-0.031434208,-0.079787071,-0.027226115,-0.039249829,-0.19577687,-0.033177777,-0.016287283,0.009921846,-0.026113233,0.011521834,-0.070423657,0.011695917,0.046832372,-0.045899463,0.049220062,-0.047570061,-0.013057317,-0.027307951,0.048378214,-0.055511297,-0.016672585,-0.025214673,0.012221785,0.003156354,-0.006085465,0.033461329,0.002272256

Two Cases of Systemic Coronavirus-Associated Disease Resembling Feline Infectious Peritonitis in Domestic Ferrets in Japan,"Abstract A systemic disease of domestic ferrets characterized by pyogranulomatous inflammation was first recognized in Europe and the United States in 2002. The disease closely resembled feline infectious peritonitis and subsequently has been shown to be associated with ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV). A definitive laboratory diagnosis of this disease is typically based on a combination of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests to detect FRSCV in granulomatous lesions. In 2010, this feline infectious peritonitis–like disease was first identified in a laboratory ferret in Japan, and laboratory confirmation of the clinical diagnosis was limited to IHC. This report describes 2 cases of systemic coronavirus-associated disease in ferrets presented to Japanese veterinary hospitals. Both presented with pyogranulomatous inflammation in the abdominal cavity, and both cases tested positive for coronavirus antigen by IHC. In 1 case, for which unfixed tissues were available, FRSCV RNA was detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in the affected tissues.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.01355531,0.027437582,0.032733248,-0.095058928,0.001984196,0.031839703,-0.006135475,0.007667261,-0.000242015,-0.021046132,0.11372491,-0.01565996,0.086565071,-0.067399092,0.000444706,-0.001818288,-0.012829398,0.041801677,-0.050670789,-0.002221612,-0.002480225,-0.006724716,-0.050261131,-0.06150904,0.029064975,0.017969908,-0.021725074,0.021923939,-0.013052332,-0.020179973
A Retrospective Study of 17 Cases of Mycobacteriosis in Domestic Ferrets (Mustela Putorius furo) between 2005 and 2013,"Abstract From 2005 to 2013, 17 ferrets were diagnosed with mycobacteriosis at the authors’ practices. Clinical findings included ocular, respiratory, and digestive abnormalities. Diagnosis was based on histopathology, specific histochemical stains, and/or on polymerase chain reaction. All bacteria identified belonged to the nontuberculous Mycobacterium complex. Several treatment protocols were attempted, frequently based on the use of enrofloxacin. In all, 3 ferrets were considered cured. Mycobacteriosis in ferrets is a polymorphous disease with diverse clinical presentations. It is also likely an underdiagnosed disease in pet ferrets, which appear to be particularly susceptible to environmental sources. Mycobacteriosis should be included in the differential diagnosis for ocular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal diseases; in particular, it should be differentiated from systemic coronavirus infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.041784969,-0.004771582,0.011188146,-0.065321049,-0.021819872,0.013609852,0.033461727,0.013112489,0.01101894,0.02481132,0.017811523,0.00307444,0.057743746,-0.054741804,0.0191343,0.002441898,-0.00340685,0.032735047,-0.024254423,0.002513554,0.021413012,-0.034379049,-0.034917796,-0.044275473,0.05202955,-0.008851033,-0.032118731,-0.005225368,0.011501757,-0.019930623
SARS associated coronavirus has a recombinant polymerase and coronaviruses have a history of host-shifting,"Abstract The sudden appearance and potential lethality of severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in humans has focused attention on understanding its origins. Here, we assess phylogenetic relationships for the SARS-CoV lineage as well as the history of host-species shifts for SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses. We used a Bayesian phylogenetic inference approach with sliding window analyses of three SARS-CoV proteins: RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S). Conservation of RDRP allowed us to use a set of Arteriviridae taxa to root the Coronaviridae phylogeny. We found strong evidence for a recombination breakpoint within SARS-CoV RDRP, based on different, well supported trees for a 5′ fragment (supporting SARS-CoV as sister to a clade including all other coronaviruses) and a 3′ fragment (supporting SARS-CoV as sister to group three avian coronaviruses). These different topologies are statistically significant: the optimal 5′ tree could be rejected for the 3′ region, and the optimal 3′ tree could be rejected for the 5′ region. We did not find statistical evidence for recombination in analyses of N and S, as there is little signal to differentiate among alternative trees. Comparison of phylogenetic trees for 11 known host-species and 36 coronaviruses, representing coronavirus groups 1–3 and SARS-CoV, based on N showed statistical incongruence indicating multiple host-species shifts for coronaviruses. Inference of host-species associations is highly sensitive to sampling and must be considered cautiously. However, current sampling suggests host-species shifts between mouse and rat, chicken and turkey, mammals and manx shearwater, and humans and other mammals. The sister relationship between avian coronaviruses and the 3′ RDRP fragment of SARS-CoV suggests an additional host-species shift. Demonstration of recombination in the SARS-CoV lineage indicates its potential for rapid unpredictable change, a potentially important challenge for public health management and for drug and vaccine development.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.091318858,0.456167575,-0.258217471,0.058927878,0.113792024,0.066048785,0.070023705,-0.14063315,-0.044139309,0.02480218,0.007826243,-0.007746572,-0.00644889,-0.065424357,-0.020448659,0.031972924,-0.024205144,-0.0251148,-0.013147477,0.020719119,0.02295542,-0.021362029,0.029780548,0.060456262,-0.006692074,-0.026117158,0.00817622,-0.004897469,0.023446619,0.034437699
Evidence from the evolutionary analysis of nucleotide sequences for a recombinant history of SARS-CoV,"Abstract The origins and evolutionary history of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) remain an issue of uncertainty and debate. Based on evolutionary analyses of coronavirus DNA sequences, encompassing an approximately 13kb stretch of the SARS-TOR2 genome, we provide evidence that SARS-CoV has a recombinant history with lineages of types I and III coronavirus. We identified a minimum of five recombinant regions ranging from 83 to 863bp in length and including the polymerase, nsp9, nsp10, and nsp14. Our results are consistent with a hypothesis of viral host jumping events, concomitant with the reassortment of bird and mammalian coronaviruses, a scenario analogous to earlier outbreaks of influenzae.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.043359115,0.345225665,-0.198853794,0.003324086,0.028926029,0.011479609,-0.0204892,-0.188525051,-0.036410856,-0.000427923,-0.025016178,-0.026766183,0.05545957,-0.067210677,0.022386085,0.016771393,-0.02635021,-0.030044,-0.013409888,0.027007124,0.004308273,-3.51E-05,0.003184399,0.043634099,-0.009111105,-0.02308446,-0.025018511,0.005155573,-0.004682888,0.010536036

Biased mutational pattern and quasispecies hypothesis in H5N1 virus,"Abstract Like other RNA viruses, influenza viruses are subject to high mutation rates. Carrying segmented RNA genomes, their genetic variability is even higher. We aimed at analyzing the mutational events occurring during the infection of chickens by the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus. We therefore studied the different sequences of two surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), as well as two internal proteins, PB2 and NS. Three organs (lung, spleen, brain) were obtained from a chicken, experimentally infected with a lethal dose of HPAI H5N1 virus. Cloning these PCR fragments enabled us to investigate the mutations undergone by the virus after several replicative cycles. The first outcome is the presence of a strong mutational bias, resembling host-driven ADAR1 adenosine deamination, which is responsible for 81% of all mutations. Whereas the frequency of RNA dependent RNA polymerase-related mutations is compatible with the survival of the virus, the ADAR1-like activity usually strongly increases the mutation frequency into a level of “error catastrophe” in theory incompatible with virus survival. Nevertheless, the virus was successfully infective. HPAI H5N1 virus displayed traits in agreement with the quasispecies theory. The role of this quasispecies structure in successful infection and the superposition with the ADAR1-like response is discussed.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.095782493,-0.076540579,-0.031823876,0.116400673,0.018952196,0.130676418,-0.018726087,0.003398065,-0.02794772,0.032875174,0.049059961,-0.027431721,0.001236168,0.02540043,0.018051354,0.021528804,-0.00712026,-0.036271012,-0.027347826,0.031005835,0.036355151,-0.021572196,-0.008017331,0.056638945,-0.06779264,-0.005615147,0.014868331,-0.027138901,-0.061679876,-0.038948417
Molecular methods for pathogen and microbial community detection and characterization: Current and potential application in diagnostic microbiology,"Abstract Clinical microbiology laboratories worldwide have historically relied on phenotypic methods (i.e., culture and biochemical tests) for detection, identification and characterization of virulence traits (e.g., antibiotic resistance genes, toxins) of human pathogens. However, limitations to implementation of molecular methods for human infectious diseases testing are being rapidly overcome allowing for the clinical evaluation and implementation of diverse technologies with expanding diagnostic capabilities. The advantages and limitation of molecular techniques including real-time polymerase chain reaction, partial or whole genome sequencing, molecular typing, microarrays, broad-range PCR and multiplexing will be discussed. Finally, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and deep sequencing are introduced as technologies at the clinical interface with the potential to dramatically enhance our ability to diagnose infectious diseases and better define the epidemiology and microbial ecology of a wide range of complex infections.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.01039512,0.018159485,0.094463715,-0.006239739,-0.025559933,0.033359572,0.077374123,0.014880523,-0.00218826,0.1114721,-0.049875609,0.001790131,0.109632584,-0.106786338,0.021625359,-0.012616381,-0.048399688,0.03775564,-0.071393938,-0.06067148,0.020518635,-0.025514446,0.041442767,-0.087335828,-0.038461361,-0.0285869,-0.001006083,-0.042524399,-0.010911992,0.009166916
Molecular evolution and emergence of avian gammacoronaviruses,"Abstract Coronaviruses, which are single stranded, positive sense RNA viruses, are responsible for a wide variety of existing and emerging diseases in humans and other animals. The gammacoronaviruses primarily infect avian hosts. Within this genus of coronaviruses, the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes a highly infectious upper-respiratory tract disease in commercial poultry. IBV shows rapid evolution in chickens, frequently producing new antigenic types, which adds to the multiple serotypes of the virus that do not cross protect. Rapid evolution in IBV is facilitated by strong selection, large population sizes and high genetic diversity within hosts, and transmission bottlenecks between hosts. Genetic diversity within a host arises primarily by mutation, which includes substitutions, insertions and deletions. Mutations are caused both by the high error rate, and limited proof reading capability, of the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, and by recombination. Recombination also generates new haplotype diversity by recombining existing variants. Rapid evolution of avian coronavirus IBV makes this virus extremely difficult to diagnose and control, but also makes it an excellent model system to study viral genetic diversity and the mechanisms behind the emergence of coronaviruses in their natural host.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.099953852,-0.013863685,0.014687104,0.046560126,0.185563838,0.087946124,0.002736352,-0.021046884,0.030453581,0.300142765,0.095839782,-0.021561793,0.004212663,0.017326795,-0.063695048,0.119139887,-0.038459173,0.002076918,-0.027533374,0.085219984,-0.007546544,-0.047588206,-0.055502232,0.016396818,-0.089272445,-0.02612223,0.037471514,-0.025772872,-0.033021616,-0.071386154
Time scale evolution of avipoxviruses,"Abstract Avipoxviruses are divided into three clades: canarypox-like viruses, fowlpox-like viruses, and psittacinepox-like viruses. Several molecular clock and demographic models available in the BEAST package were compared on three avipoxvirus genes (P4b, cnpv186 and DNA polymerase genes), which enabled to determine that avipoxviruses evolved at a rate of 2–8×10−5 substitution/site/year, in the range of poxviruses previously reported evolution rates. In addition, the date of mean time of divergence of avipoxviruses from a common ancestor was extrapolated to be about 10,000–30,000years ago, at the same period as modern poxvirus species. Our findings will facilitate epidemiological investigations on avipoxviruses’ spread, origin and circulation.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.013780607,-0.035312162,0.012366943,0.001759741,0.058883141,0.046516812,0.067390383,0.011907496,-0.011123553,0.002653521,-0.036415195,-0.000455654,0.005820355,-0.041230201,0.009914181,-0.019856312,-0.025946671,-0.034472915,-0.003551524,-0.012272667,0.037195899,-0.017388035,-0.041466732,0.032741169,-0.115263553,-0.020809633,0.015662386,0.052531841,-0.02105273,-0.070542903
Insectivorous bats carry host specific astroviruses and coronaviruses across different regions in Germany,"Abstract Recently several infectious agents with a zoonotic potential have been detected in different bat species. However, there is still a lack of knowledge on the transmission dynamics within and between bat species, as well as from bats to other mammals. To better understand these processes, it is important to compare the phylogenetic relationships between different agents to that of their respective hosts. In this study, we analysed more than 950 urine, faeces and oral swab samples collected from 653 bats from mainly four species (Myotis nattereri, Myotis bechsteinii, Myotis daubentonii, and Plecotus auritus) for the presence of coronavirus, paramyxovirus and astrovirus related nucleic acids located in three different regions of Germany. Using hemi-nested reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR amplification of fragments within the highly conserved regions of the respective RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes, we detected astrovirus sequences at an overall detection rate of 25.8% of the analysed animals, with a maximum of 65% in local populations. The detection rates for coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses were distinctly lower, ranging between 1.4% and 3.1%. Interestingly, the sequence similarities in samples collected from the same bat species in different geographical areas were distinctly larger than the sequence similarities between samples from different species sampled at the same location. This indicates that host specificity may be more important than host ecology for the presence of certain viruses in bats.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.072498242,0.051789043,0.041000389,0.026135866,0.304416716,0.072150479,0.244758338,0.067012848,-0.148300929,-0.028376992,-0.07504377,-0.090737312,-0.035810384,0.03308142,-0.017452021,0.035893554,0.016658079,0.027335041,0.012174288,-0.046527054,-0.021474078,-0.007573096,-0.025648962,-0.038930549,0.026449812,0.002184317,0.006385209,-0.00296172,0.000390644,0.030890307
Detection and molecular characterization of sapoviruses in dogs,"Abstract Caliciviruses are important human and animal pathogens. Novel caliciviruses have been identified recently in dogs, raising questions about their pathogenic role and concerns regarding their zoonotic potential. By screening stool samples of young or juvenile dogs using RT-PCR assays, sapoviruses (SaVs) were found in 7/320 (2.2%) samples of animals with acute gastroenteritis while they were not detected in healthy animals (0/119). The sequence of a nearly 3kb portion at the 3′ end of the genome, encompassing the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the capsid region (ORF1) and the ORF2 were determined for three strains. A distinctive genetic feature in canine SaVs was a 4-nucleotide (nt) interval between the ORF1 and ORF2. Two strains (Bari/4076/07/ITA and Bari/253/07/ITA) were very closely related in the RdRp and capsid regions to the strain AN210D/09/USA (90.4–93.9% nt), while strain Bari/5020/07/ITA displayed only 71.0–72.0% nt identity to this group of canine SaVs and 76.0% to strain AN196/09/USA. Overall, these findings indicate that the canine SaVs detected in Italy may represent distinct capsid types, although all currently known SaVs segregate into the novel proposed genogroup, tentatively named as GXIII.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.086149988,-0.004827556,0.050043496,-0.034969899,0.136334592,-0.007981527,0.00657057,0.003619681,-0.05411819,-0.004079474,0.062235056,0.094408708,-0.050243581,-0.074770128,0.027456525,-0.085249194,-0.016642799,-0.007714633,0.057704466,-0.043810933,0.175165961,0.087048395,-0.086127571,0.035802093,0.105529093,-0.107756157,-0.024802294,-0.026596243,0.001062333,0.072894274
A novel feline norovirus in diarrheic cats,"Abstract By screening a collection of fecal samples from young cats housed in three different shelters in South Italy, noroviruses (NoVs) were found in 3/48 (6.2%) specimens of animals with enteritis signs while they were not detected in samples collected from healthy cats (0/57). Upon sequence analysis of the short RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region, the three strains displayed the highest nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) identities to the prototype GIV.2 strain lion/Pistoia/387/06/ITA (91.0–93.0% nt and 97.0–98.0% aa). The sequence of ~3.4-kb portion at the 3′ end of the genome of a NoV strain, TE/77-13/ITA, was determined. In the full-length ORF2, encoding the VP1 capsid protein, the virus was genetically closest to the canine GVI.2 NoV strains C33/Viseu/2007/PRT and FD53/2007/ITA (81.0–84.0% nt and 93.0–94.0% aa identities), suggesting a recombination nature, with the cross-over site being mapped to the ORF1-ORF2 junction. Based on the full-length VP1 amino acid sequence, we classified the novel feline NoV, together with the canine strains Viseu and FD53, as a genotype 2, within the genogroup GVI. These findings indicate that, as observed for GIV NoV, GVI strains may infect both the canine and feline host. Unrestricted circulation of NoV strains in small carnivores may provide the basis for quick genetic diversification of these viruses by recombination. Interspecies circulation of NoVs in pets must also be considered when facing outbreaks of enteric diseases in these animals.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.111162808,-0.033113314,0.051233544,-0.094343697,0.162650439,0.014769181,-0.032639108,-0.002750018,-0.048144678,-0.049836542,0.152409717,0.070025826,0.03327575,-0.130044583,0.002455058,-0.097361736,-0.031541846,0.003747102,0.034421311,0.026808934,0.137372164,0.038108692,-0.055873701,0.071262691,0.073630723,-0.071252717,0.006837585,-0.005782662,-0.04629083,0.081247026
Molecular detection of bovine Noroviruses in Argentinean dairy calves: Circulation of a tentative new genotype,"Abstract Bovine noroviruses are enteric pathogens detected in fecal samples of both diarrheic and non-diarrheic calves from several countries worldwide. However, epidemiological information regarding bovine noroviruses is still lacking for many important cattle producing countries from South America. In this study, three bovine norovirus genogroup III sequences were determined by conventional RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing in feces from diarrheic dairy calves from Argentina (B4836, B4848, and B4881, all collected in 2012). Phylogenetic studies based on a partial coding region for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, 503 nucleotides) of these three samples suggested that two of them (B4836 and B4881) belong to genotype 2 (GIII.2) while the third one (B4848) was more closely related to genotype 1 (GIII.1) strains. By deep sequencing, the capsid region from two of these strains could be determined. This confirmed the circulation of genotype 1 (B4848) together with the presence of another sequence (B4881) sharing its highest genetic relatedness with genotype 1, but sufficiently distant to constitute a new genotype. This latter strain was shown in silico to be a recombinant: phylogenetic divergence was detected between its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase coding sequence (genotype GIII.2) and its capsid protein coding sequence (genotype GIII.1 or a potential norovirus genotype). According to this data, this strain could be the second genotype GIII.2_GIII.1 bovine norovirus recombinant described in literature worldwide. Further analysis suggested that this strain could even be a potential norovirus GIII genotype, tentatively named GIII.4. The data provides important epidemiological and evolutionary information on bovine noroviruses circulating in South America.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.090347539,-0.014824068,0.043811484,-0.057185252,0.117172418,-5.42E-05,0.002721822,-0.004830147,-0.018750769,-0.011302406,0.02146516,0.130966721,-0.018536906,-0.043925561,0.033301257,-0.053821302,-0.02625583,0.022346173,0.027734811,-0.046855345,0.069603043,0.043724793,-0.041603538,0.058509846,0.020384733,-0.05084538,0.043030292,-0.063149809,0.043578992,0.032118132
"Circulation of Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus and Paramyxovirus in Hipposideros bat species in Zimbabwe","Abstract Bats carry a great diversity of zoonotic viruses with a high-impact on human health and livestock. Since the emergence of new coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses in humans (e.g. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Nipah virus), numerous studies clearly established that bats can maintain some of these viruses. Improving our understanding on the role of bats in the epidemiology of the pathogens they harbour is necessary to prevent cross-species spill over along the wild/domestic/human gradient. In this study, we screened bat faecal samples for the presence of Coronavirus and Paramyxovirus in two caves frequently visited by local people to collect manure and/or to hunt bats in Zimbabwe. We amplified partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes of Alpha and Betacoronavirus together with the partial polymerase gene of Paramyxovirus. Identified coronaviruses were related to pathogenic human strains and the paramyxovirus belonged to the recently described Jeilongvirus genus. Our results highlighted the importance of monitoring virus circulation in wildlife, especially bats, in the context of intense human-wildlife interfaces in order to strengthen prevention measures among local populations and to implement sentinel surveillance in sites with high zoonotic diseases transmission potential.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.043194047,0.109318603,-0.065581143,0.045554431,0.298726429,0.12725338,0.237984535,0.044239721,-0.089406881,-0.019845123,-0.087677467,-0.103597763,0.009989343,0.044511567,-0.009382769,0.031921327,0.005335927,0.038130285,0.013464726,0.00979071,0.008470929,-0.000312061,-0.001818812,-0.02542444,0.037448535,0.018292623,-0.022156565,0.02319594,0.003682772,-0.030965879
Interplay between co-divergence and cross-species transmission in the evolutionary history of bat coronaviruses,"Abstract Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been documented in almost every species of bat sampled. Bat CoVs exhibit both extensive genetic diversity and a broad geographic range, indicative of a long-standing host association. Despite this, the respective roles of long-term virus-host co-divergence and cross-species transmission (host-jumping) in the evolution of bat coronaviruses are unclear. Using a phylogenetic approach we provide evidence that CoV diversity in bats is shaped by both species richness and their geographical distribution, and that CoVs exhibit clustering at the level of bat genera, with these genus-specific clusters largely associated with distinct CoV species. Co-phylogenetic analyses revealed that cross-species transmission has been more common than co-divergence across coronavirus evolution as a whole, and that cross-species transmission events were more likely between sympatric bat hosts. Notably, however, an analysis of the CoV RNA polymerase phylogeny suggested that many such host-jumps likely resulted in short-term spill-over infections, with little evidence for sustained onward transmission in new co-roosting host species.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.088493506,0.13509951,-0.092938847,-0.004688062,0.307071422,0.156098237,0.308771338,0.111115909,-0.087495148,-0.055140296,-0.102548855,-0.129260284,-0.030199662,0.056516091,-0.039570703,0.090455546,-0.001912268,0.042243262,-0.000155635,0.029938988,-0.040287402,-0.024645379,0.001777053,-0.018326115,0.009938791,0.00342144,0.00664582,-0.01170867,-0.000479962,0.029191604
Astrovirus evolution and emergence,"Abstract Astroviruses are small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the Astroviridae family. Astroviruses infect diverse hosts and are typically associated with gastrointestinal illness; although disease can range from asymptomatic to encephalitis depending on the host and viral genotype. Astroviruses have high genetic variability due to an error prone polymerase and frequent recombination events between strains. Once thought to be species specific, recent evidence suggests astroviruses can spread between different host species, although the frequency with which this occurs and the restrictions that regulate the process are unknown. Recombination events can lead to drastic evolutionary changes and contribute to cross-species transmission events. This work reviews the current state of research on astrovirus evolution and emergence, especially as it relates to cross-species transmission and recombination of astroviruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.078014275,-0.019059739,-0.011361022,-0.020849119,0.105540047,0.053510174,0.126790812,0.042007471,-0.048719024,0.027438023,0.013895962,-0.000559826,-0.002654758,-0.030430384,0.037626696,0.04876466,-0.060268144,0.001665262,-0.053197061,0.010327436,0.044148321,-0.008472097,-0.081007266,0.06061207,-0.05805308,-0.042079307,0.051531236,-0.020152792,-0.036719402,-0.002808243
Virome diversity analysis reveals novel enteroviruses and a human picobirnavirus in stool samples from African green monkeys with diarrhea,"Abstract It is important to identify viruses in animals because most infectious diseases in humans are caused by viruses of zoonotic origin. African green monkey is a widely used non-human primate model in biomedical investigations. In this study, total RNAs were extracted from stool samples of 10 African green monkeys with diarrhea. High-throughput sequencing was used to characterize viromes. PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to determine the full genome sequences. Great viral diversity was observed. The dominant viruses were enteroviruses and picobirnaviruses. Six enterovirus genomes and a picobirnavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence were characterized. Five enteroviruses belonged to two putative new genotypes of species Enterovirus J. One enterovirus belonged to EV-A92. The picobirnavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence had the highest nucleotide similarity (93.48%) with human picobirnavirus isolate GPBV6C2.

Review of Non-bacterial Infections in Respiratory Medicine: Viral Pneumonia,"Abstract Although bacteria are the main pathogens involved in community-acquired pneumonia, a significant number of community-acquired pneumonia are caused by viruses, either directly or as part of a co-infection. The clinical picture of these different pneumonias can be very similar, but viral infection is more common in the pediatric and geriatric populations, leukocytes are not generally elevated, fever is variable, and upper respiratory tract symptoms often occur; procalcitonin levels are not generally affected. For years, the diagnosis of viral pneumonia was based on cell culture and antigen detection, but since the introduction of polymerase chain reaction techniques in the clinical setting, identification of these pathogens has increased and new microorganisms such as human bocavirus have been discovered. In general, influenza virus type A and syncytial respiratory virus are still the main pathogens involved in this entity. However, in recent years, outbreaks of deadly coronavirus and zoonotic influenza virus have demonstrated the need for constant alert in the face of new emerging pathogens. Neuraminidase inhibitors for viral pneumonia have been shown to reduce transmission in cases of exposure and to improve the clinical progress of patients in intensive care; their use in common infections is not recommended. Ribavirin has been used in children with syncytial respiratory virus, and in immunosuppressed subjects. Apart from these drugs, no antiviral has been shown to be effective. Prevention with anti-influenza virus vaccination and with monoclonal antibodies, in the case of syncytial respiratory virus, may reduce the incidence of pneumonia.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.216812013,-0.107293184,-0.099294015,0.097915404,-0.073916358,0.093858408,0.005314584,0.039195338,-0.025688619,0.113537015,-0.043460519,-0.0475929,0.109092908,-0.053747818,0.02743601,-0.039945475,-0.006809827,0.063713882,-0.022363187,0.111432423,-0.002078179,0.067162189,0.06141349,0.04198212,0.0799923,0.016973549,0.015028096,0.011884705,0.030728726,-0.03496822
"Use of a Multiplex RT-PCR Assay for Simultaneous Detection of the North American Genotype Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus, Swine Influenza Virus and Japanese Encephalitis Virus","Abstract A multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (multiplex RT-PCR) assay was developed and subsequently evaluated for its efficacy in the detection of multiple viral infections simultaneously, in swine. Specific primers for each of the 3 RNA viruses, North American genotype porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and swine influenza virus, were used in the testing procedure. The assay was shown to be highly sensitive because it could detect as little as 10−5 ng of each of the respective amplicons in a single sample containing a composite of all 3 viruses. The assay was also effective in detecting one or more of the same viruses in various combinations in specimens, including lymph nodes, lungs, spleens, and tonsils, collected from clinically ill pigs and in spleen specimens collected from aborted pig fetuses. The results from the multiplex RT-PCR were confirmed by virus isolation.

Viral etiology of acute lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized young children in Northern Taiwan,"Background Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) comprise a great proportion of diagnoses among hospitalized children. This study identifies the viral pathogens causing LRTIs in young children and compares their clinical features and disease severity. Methods Children younger than 36 months old, hospitalized at a medical center in Northern Taiwan with acute bronchiolitis or pneumonia from April to December 2007, were prospectively enrolled. Nasopharyngeal aspiration fluid samples were sent for virus culture, for direct immunofluorescence test of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), for rapid influenza viral identification, and for polymerase chain reaction of human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human boca virus (hBoV), and human corona virus. The clinical features and laboratory findings were recorded and analyzed. Results A total of 48 children were enrolled. RSV was the most common pathogen (41.7%), followed by hMPV (27.1%), hBoV, and enterovirus (both 6.3%). There were no significant differences in clinical presentation and disease severity between the RSV and hMPV groups. However, the hMPV group had a higher mixed infection rate (p = 0.038). Fourteen children had no identifiable viruses. Children with single, dual, and triple pathogens numbered 26, 7, and 1, respectively. The mixed infection rate reached 23.5% among 34 children with identifiable viruses. Children with a higher severity score had greater chance to develop asthma in the next 2 years (p = 0.042). Conclusion RSV is the most common pathogen causing LRTIs in young children, followed by hMPV. The hMPV group had higher mixed infection rate than RSV group. hBoV does circulate in northern Taiwan.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.277001974,-0.179587243,-0.110385132,0.076271253,0.06324924,-0.173046637,0.099964207,-0.179011242,0.195674969,-0.068539728,0.028550743,-0.112008675,-0.148586788,-0.064065665,-0.115270328,-0.032423592,-0.061455142,0.182174682,-0.136424816,0.052542097,0.068382106,0.083704524,0.030453147,-0.061734736,-0.096840122,-0.00015847,-0.058536042,-0.054657869,-0.009931299,0.05343823

Materials and methods From January 2009 to March 2011, a total of 113 children with bronchiolitis, aged <2 years, hospitalized in Chang Gung Children’s Hospital were randomly selected for viral etiology investigation. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from each case and sent for viral detection by tissue culture, antigen test, and polymerase chain reaction. Results A total of 120 viruses were detected from 113 children. Positive viral etiology was identified in 86 (76%) children. Mixed viral pathogens were found in 28 cases (25%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common pathogen and was identified in 43.4% of the cases. Human bocavirus (hBoV) was the second most common identified virus (in 19.5%), followed by human metapneumovirus (hMPV), rhinovirus, influenza viruses, and coronavirus OC43. In terms of clinical characteristics, no significant difference was found among the children with bronchiolitis either caused by different single or mixed viral infection. Conclusion RSV was the most common etiologic agent for children with bronchiolitis in Taiwan. Newly identified viruses, including hMPV and hBoV, were also among the common causative agents. Clinical characteristics were not significantly different among the children with bronchiolitis caused by different viruses.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.227363122,-0.155855627,-0.100469423,0.075174902,0.055038514,-0.128415819,0.092196909,-0.118583298,0.120545942,-0.007258354,0.014716461,-0.077670677,-0.058775214,-0.072846113,-0.023375216,-0.016694383,-0.024993997,0.069946162,-0.063879537,0.026404734,-0.011258243,0.164575493,-0.006399238,0.022477483,-0.079828043,0.036175107,0.010641309,0.004114205,-0.014843892,0.046855117
Epidemiology of human coronavirus NL63 infection among hospitalized patients with pneumonia in Taiwan,"Abstract Background/Purpose Human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 is recognized in association with upper or lower respiratory tract illnesses in children. This study surveyed the prevalence of HCoV-NL63 and influenza viruses in patients with influenza-like illness in Taiwan during 2010–2011. Methods Throat samples from 107 hospitalized patients with pneumonia and 175 outpatients with influenza-like illness were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction assays with virus-specific primers, and then virus-positive specimens were confirmed by sequencing the polymerase chain reaction products. Results HCoV-NL63 infection was identified in 8.4% (9/107) of hospitalized patients with pneumonia, but not found in outpatients with influenza-like illness. Age distribution of HCoV-NL63 infection in hospitalized patients with pneumonia indicated that the group aged 16–25 years (20%) had the highest positive rate compared with the other groups, and exhibited a similar age-specific pattern to influenza A/H1N1 infection, but not influenza A/H3N2 and B infections in hospitalized patients. Seasonal prevalence of HCoV-NL63 infection was late winter, overlapping the highest peak of the influenza A/H1N1 epidemic during December 2010 to March 2011 in Taiwan. Co-infection of HCoV-NL63 and influenza A/H1N1 was detected in three hospitalized patients. Clinical manifestation analysis indicated that the main symptoms for HCoV-NL63 infection included fever (88.9%), cough (77.8%), and pneumonia (100%). Co-infection caused significantly higher rates of breathing difficulties, cough, and sore throat than those of single infection with HCoV-NL63 and influenza A/H1N1. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a low level of heterogeneity between Taiwan and global HCoV-NL63 strains. Conclusion Understanding epidemiology of HCoV-NL63 in Taiwan provides an insight for worldwide surveillance of HCoV-NL63 infection.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.209624858,-0.098313774,-0.105033244,0.043826429,0.113346975,0.095270448,-0.071138332,-0.005664811,0.032916263,-0.13309783,-0.037966326,0.368961017,0.264591596,0.19540006,-0.033190167,0.073321891,-0.042160834,-0.007943844,-0.096118588,0.052892432,0.009124636,0.007418369,0.033259344,-0.093470708,-0.022642735,-0.004049528,0.025604481,0.036788378,-0.001278305,0.102575287
Characteristics of community-acquired respiratory viruses infections except seasonal influenza in transplant recipients and non-transplant critically ill patients,"Abstract Background/Purpose Transplant recipients are vulnerable to life-threatening community-acquired respiratory viruses (CA-RVs) infection (CA-RVI). Even if non-transplant critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU) have serious CA-RVI, comparison between these groups remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate clinical characteristics and mortality of CA-RVI except seasonal influenza A/B in transplant recipients and non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU. Methods We collected 37,777 CA-RVs multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test results of individuals aged ≥18 years from November 2012 to November 2017. The CA-RVs tests included adenovirus, coronavirus 229E/NL63/OC43, human bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus A/B. Results We found 286 CA-RVI cases, including 85 solid organ transplantation recipients (G1), 61 hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients (G2), and 140 non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU (G3), excluding those with repeated isolation within 30 days. Adenovirus positive rate and infection cases were most prominent in G2 (p < 0.001). The median time interval between transplantation and CA-RVI was 30 and 20 months in G1 and G2, respectively. All-cause in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in G3 than in G1 or G2 (51.4% vs. 28.2% or 39.3%, p = 0.002, respectively). The mechanical ventilation (MV) was the independent risk factor associated with all-cause in-hospital mortality in all three groups (hazard ratio, 3.37, 95% confidence interval, 2.04–5.56, p < 0.001). Conclusions This study highlights the importance of CA-RVs diagnosis in transplant recipients even in long-term posttransplant period, and in non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU with MV.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.09973513,-0.041748049,-0.046024449,-0.075440629,-0.024493325,-0.006237256,-0.018570056,0.041613395,-0.046721539,-0.013437574,-0.021622544,0.042905598,0.010177188,0.024355344,-0.01994056,0.021270529,0.00694533,0.001144199,0.005410356,0.013410773,0.011530221,-0.041408125,-0.02054292,-0.002166967,-0.006159558,-0.02336879,-0.017882586,-0.015397162,-0.042948825,-0.03066677
Ribovirus emergentes implicados en las gastroenteritis,"Los virus se sitúan en un lugar preferente entre los agentes causales de diarrea aguda, en particular en la infancia. En este contexto el papel de los astrovirus, coronavirus, torovirus y picobirnavirus es emergente. Los astrovirus se han detectado en las heces entre el 1,2 y el 20 % de niños con diarrea que requieren atención médica en una gran variedad de localizaciones geográficas. Se han descrito brotes epidémicos en escuelas, guarderías y salas pediátricas, y son más frecuentes entre niños de menos de 3 años. En climas templados se ha demostrado una mayor incidencia invernal, y en climas tropicales ésta es similar en todo el año, siendo su transmisión preferente por vía orofecal. Se han reconocido siete serotipos de astrovirus humanos, de los cuales el más común es el uno. Los viriones pueden eliminarse durante amplios períodos y detectarse mediante microscopia electrónica. En estudios epidemiológicos se emplean técnicas de enzimoinmunoanálisis para detectar el antígeno común de grupo y se han desarrollado también técnicas basadas en la detección de ácidos nucleicos mediante hibridación y amplificación (reacción en cadena de la polimerasa). Los coronavirus entéricos se han asociado con frecuencia con enfermedad gastrointestinal en recién nacidos y niños menores de 12 años. El papel de los torovirus y picobirnavirus como causa de gastroenteritis es también emergente. Se necesitan estudios epidemiológicos para determinar su verdadera frecuencia en la comunidad, identificar sus mecanismos de transmisión y explicar la fisiopatología de los cuadros provocados por estos agentes. Viral agents are one of the main causes of acute diarrhea, particularly in infants and young children. Astrovirus, coronavirus, torovirus, and picobirnavirus are increasingly being identified as causative agents of gastroenteritis. Astroviruses have been detected in the stools of between 1.2 % and 20 % of children with diarrhea requiring medical care in a variety of geographical areas. Outbreaks have been described in schools, day care settings and pediatric wards. Children younger than 3 years old are the most frequently affected. In temperate climates incidence is greater in winter whereas in tropical areas infection occurs throughout the year. Transmission is mainly through the fecal-oral route. At least seven serotypes of human astroviruses have been recognized and serotype 1 is more common than the other serotypes. Astroviruses are often shed in stools during long periods and can be detected by electron microscopy. An enzyme-immunoassay technique that detects the astrovirus group antigen has been widely used in epidemiological studies. Nucleic acid hybridization and polymerase chain reaction-based techniques have also been used. Enteric coronaviruses have most frequently been associated with gastrointestinal disease in neonates and children younger than 12 years old. The role of toroviruses and picobirnaviruses as causative agents of gastroenteritis is still emerging. Further epidemiological studies to determine the frequency of these viruses in the community and to identify their mechanisms of transmission are needed, as are further studies to elucidate the pathophysiology of diseases due to these agents.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.026339552,-0.055561428,-0.009648459,-0.095565827,0.005159322,0.009673936,0.06300797,-0.021578591,0.040299951,-0.03659222,-0.007623796,0.034517034,-0.018481291,-0.183131442,0.264738103,0.323770034,0.453354779,0.099004288,-0.049419734,0.089783282,0.049501187,0.104062065,0.040355385,0.048185187,-0.10539792,-0.117728503,0.058900926,-0.002709208,-0.018731046,0.029653313
Infecciones respiratorias por metapneumovirus en lactantes hospitalizados,"Antecedentes El metapneumovirus humano es un virus de reciente descripción al que se atribuyen infecciones respiratorias que afectan fundamentalmente a la población infantil. Objetivos Conocer la incidencia de infecciones por metapneumovirus en lactantes hospitalizados, así como sus características clínicas y la posible presencia de coinfecciones con otros agentes virales. Pacientes y métodos Estudio prospectivo realizado de septiembre a junio de 2003 en todos los niños menores de 2 años ingresados en la Unidad de Lactantes del Hospital Severo Ochoa de Leganés (Madrid), por infección respiratoria. La detección de agentes virales se realizó mediante recogida de aspirado nasofaríngeo y realización de inmunofluorescencia directa y/o reacción en cadena de la polimerasa-transcripción inversa (RT-PCR). Descripción de las características clínicas y epidemiológicas de los procesos respiratorios de los pacientes con detección positiva para metapneumovirus humano. Resultados Ingresaron 200 lactantes con patología respiratoria durante el período mencionado, de los cuales en 18 se detectó infección por metapneumovirus humano (9% de los pacientes). El metapneumovirus humano supuso un 13,8% de los aislamientos virales positivos. El 100 % de estos niños ingresaron en marzo-abril. La edad media fue de 6,7 ± 6,1 meses. El 38,8 % desarrolló una bronquiolitis y en el 55,5 % se objetivó un episodio recurrente de sibilancias. El 55,5 % de los niños precisó oxigenoterapia durante el ingreso. Se encontraron coinfecciones con otros agentes virales en el 33,3 % de estos pacientes. Conclusiones El metapneumovirus humano es un agente viral muy frecuente en los lactantes afectados de enfermedad respiratoria, causando fundamentalmente bronquiolitis y episodios recurrentes de sibilancias. Es más frecuente en primavera y tiene una alta tendencia a la coinfección con otros virus. Background Human metapneumovirus (hPMV) is a recently identified virus that is recognized as a cause of respiratory tract illness in the pediatric population. Objectives To determine the incidence of respiratory tract infections caused by hPMV in hospitalized infants and to describe the clinical characteristics and possible presence of coinfection with other viral agents. Patients and methods We performed a prospective study from September to June 2003 in all children aged less than 24 months who were admitted to the Severo Ochoa Hospital (Leganés, Madrid) with a respiratory tract infection. Virological diagnosis was made with a direct immunofluorescent assay and/or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on specimens obtained from nasopharyngeal washing. Demographic and clinical data from patients with an hPMV respiratory tract infection were analyzed. Results During the study period, 200 infants were admitted with a respiratory tract infection, of which 18 (9 %) had an hPMV infection. HPMV was the viral agent isolated in 13.8% of positive nasopharyngeal washings. All patients were admitted between March and April. The mean age was 6.7 ± 6.1 months. The most common diagnoses were recurrent wheezing (55.5 %) and bronchiolitis (38.8%). Oxygen therapy was required by 55.5 % of infants during hospitalization. Coinfection with other respiratory viruses was confirmed in 33.3% of the patients. Conclusions Human metapneumovirus is a major cause of respiratory tract illness in hospitalized infants. This virus causes mainly bronchiolitis and recurrent wheezing and is more frequent in spring.

Papel del rinovirus en las infecciones respiratorias en niños hospitalizados,"Antecedentes El rinovirus se considera un agente causal de cuadros catarrales banales, sin embargo se ha descrito como un agente inductor de exacerbaciones asmáticas en adultos y niños mayores. En nuestro medio no se ha descrito el papel del rinovirus en infecciones respiratorias de niños hospitalizados. Objetivos Describir las infecciones confirmadas por rinovirus en niños hospitalizados por infección respiratoria en un hospital de segundo nivel. Pacientes y métodos Estudio descriptivo prospectivo de las infecciones confirmadas por rinovirus en niños hospitalizados por fiebre o infección respiratoria en la temporada 2004-2005. Para el diagnóstico virológico se realizó inmunofluorescencia y reacción en cadena de la polimerasa (PCR) en aspirado nasofaríngeo. Se describen las características clínicas de los pacientes. Resultados Se describen un total de 76 niños hospitalizados con infección por rinovirus, lo que supuso el 25 % de los pacientes hospitalizados por procesos respiratorios o fiebre. El rinovirus fue el segundo agente viral identificado tras el virus respiratorio sincitial (29,9% de los hospitalizados). El 71,1 % de los pacientes fueron menores de 2 años. Los diagnósticos más frecuentes fueron sibilancias recurrentes en el 60,5 %, bronquiolitis en 23,7 %, neumonía en el 7,9 % e infección respiratoria de vías altas en el 5,3%. Presentaron fiebre de más de 38 °C el 57,9 % de los niños e infiltrado radiológico el 23,7%. Presentaron hipoxia el 43,4% de los niños. En niños mayores de 2 años el diagnóstico fue crisis asmática en 21 de los 22 casos. Conclusiones Los rinovirus se detectaron en un importante porcentaje de los niños hospitalizados a consecuencia de infección respiratoria, siendo precedidos en frecuencia sólo por el virus respiratorio sincitial. En nuestra serie es el agente viral más frecuentemente asociado con episodios de sibilancias recurrentes en niños mayores de 2 años, y el segundo en los más pequeños. Background Rhinovirus is a recognized cause of common cold and has been shown to cause asthma exacerbations in adults and children. The burden of rhinovirus infections in hospitalized children has not been described in Spain. Objective To describe confirmed rhinovirus infections in children hospitalized for respiratory tract infection in a secondary public hospital. Patients and methods We performed a prospective descriptive study in children admitted to hospital with fever or respiratory tract infection and with a positive isolation of rhinovirus in nasopharyngeal washings between September 2004 and July 2005. Virological diagnosis was made with direct immunofluorescent assay and/or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in specimens obtained from nasopharyngeal washings. The clinical characteristics of the patients were analyzed. Results There were 76 children with rhinovirus infection, representing 25 % of admissions in 304 children with fever or respiratory tract infection. Rhinovirus was the second most frequent viral agent identified after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (29.9 % of admissions). Fifty-four children (71.1%) were under 2 years of age. The most frequent clinical diagnoses were recurrent wheezing in 60.5 %, bronchiolitis in 23.7%, pneumonia in 7.9%, and upper respiratory tract infection in 5.3 %. Fever > 38 °C was present in 57.9% of the patients and radiologic infiltrate was found in 23.7%. Oxygen saturation less than 95% was found in 43.4% of the patients. Of 22 children aged more than 2 years, a diagnosis of asthmatic crisis was made in 21.

Infecciones virales de las vías respiratorias en la Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos Neonatales,"Resumen Introducción Las infecciones virales respiratorias son causa de importante morbimortalidad en recién nacidos prematuros. Hemos realizado un estudio prospectivo en nuestra unidad de cuidados intensivos neonatales (UCIN) para determinar la incidencia de infecciones respiratorias, su impacto, epidemiología y pronóstico en neonatos de alto riesgo. Pacientes y métodos Estudio prospectivo realizado entre septiembre del 2011 y mayo del 2013 entre todos los recién nacidos < 32 semanas de edad gestacional y aquellos niños cuya patología pudiera dar lugar a pensar en un ingreso superior a las 2 semanas. Se recogieron aspirados nasofaríngeos (ANF) el primer día de vida y semanalmente hasta el alta para estudio virológico mediante reacción en cadena de polimerasa. En los casos en los que los niños presentaban síntomas respiratorios, se procedió a recoger un nuevo ANF. El pediatra cumplimentó un cuestionario con los datos clínicos. Resultados Se estudió a 60 niños; 30 (50%) de ellos con una edad gestacional < 32 semanas y 36 (60%) con un peso < 1.500 g. Se recogió un total de 256 ANF, 24 de los cuales resultaron positivos (9,3%). Estas 24 muestras positivas correspondieron solo a 13 niños (21,6% de los pacientes). De ellos, 9 resultaron sintomáticos y presentaron 11 episodios de infección (2 pacientes experimentaron 2 episodios diferentes con control negativo entre ellos). El virus más frecuentemente identificado —el 79% de las muestras (19)— fue el rinovirus (RV). El dato clínico más frecuente fue la presencia o incremento de apneas (75%) y la necesidad de oxigenoterapia. Conclusiones Las infecciones por RV son frecuentes en la UCIN y los recién nacidos pretérmino tienen un alto riesgo de presentar infecciones de relevancia clínica. Abstract Introduction Viral respiratory infections cause major morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. We have performed a prospective study in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to determine the incidence of respiratory infections, their impact and the epidemiology and outcome in high risk neonates. Patients and methods From September 2011 to May 2013 a prospective study was conducted in all preterm infants < 32 weeks gestational age and in all term newborns admitted to NICU for any pathology that are anticipated to have an income exceeding two weeks. A nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was collected the first day of life and weekly until discharge for virologic study with polymerase chain reaction. When these babies presented respiratory symptoms a new NPA was collected in this moment. A clinical form was filled by the physician. Results A total of 60 infants were analyzed: 30 (50%) had a gestational age < 32 weeks and 36 (60%) weighing less than 1500 grams. We collected a total of 256 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, 24 of them being positive (9.3%). These 24 positive samples corresponded to 13 infants in our cohort (21.6% of the patients). Of them, 9 were symptomatic and had 11 episodes of infection (2 patients had two different episodes with negative control between them). The most frequently identified virus was rhinovirus in (19) 79% of cases. The most frequent clinical data was the presence or increased of apneas (75%) and the needed of oxygenotherapy.

Estudio prospectivo para estimar la carga de hospitalización y visitas a urgencias de la gripe en población pediátrica en Bilbao (2010-2011),"Resumen Introducción El estudio se llevó a cabo para estimar la carga de enfermedad de la gripe confirmada por laboratorio en niños menores de 15 años. Pacientes y métodos Los niños que acudieron al Hospital Universitario de Basurto con síntomas de infección respiratoria aguda y/o fiebre aislada entre noviembre de 2010 y mayo de 2011 fueron incluidos en el estudio (NCT01592799). Se tomaron 2muestras de secreción nasofaríngea: una para un test de diagnóstico rápido en el Servicio de Urgencias y otra para análisis en laboratorio con reacción en cadena de la polimerasa en tiempo real y cultivo viral. Resultados Se seleccionó a un total de 501 niños, de los que 91 fueron hospitalizados. El diagnóstico de gripe se confirmó en 131 (26,1%); 120/410 (29,3%) fueron tratados ambulatoriamente y 11/91 (12,1%), hospitalizados. En 370/501 niños (73,9%) el resultado no fue positivo. La proporción de otros virus respiratorios fue 145/501 (28,9%) casos y de coinfección con otro virus respiratorio además de gripe de 7/501 (1,4%). Los tipos de virus de gripe fueron: A (H1N1 y H3N2) 53,2% (67/126); B (Victoria y Yamagata) 46,0% (58/126); A+B 0,8% (1/126). El coste médico directo medio asociado con cada caso de gripe confirmada fue de 177,00€ (N=131). No se observaron diferencias estadísticamente significativas entre el coste asociado con gripe A o B. Conclusión Casi la mitad de los casos fueron virus de gripe B. La administración de una vacuna que incluya tipos A y B de gripe debería reducir la carga de la enfermedad. Abstract Introduction This study was undertaken to estimate the burden of morbidity associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza in children below 15 years of age. Patients and methods Children presenting with acute respiratory infection and/or isolated fever at the Basurto University Hospital, Bilbao, Spain between November 2010 and May 2011 were included in this study (NCT01592799). Two nasopharyngeal secretion samples were taken from each; one for a rapid influenza diagnostic test in the emergency department, and the second for laboratory analysis using real-time polymerase chain reaction and viral culture. Results A total of 501 children were recruited, of whom 91 were hospitalized. Influenza diagnosis was confirmed in 131 children (26.1%); 120 of 410 (29.3%) treated as outpatients and 11 of 91 (12.1%) hospitalized children. A total of 370 of 501 children (73.9%) had no laboratory test positive for influenza. The proportion of subjects with other respiratory viruses was 145/501 (28.9%) cases and co-infection with the influenza virus plus another respiratory virus was detected in 7/501 (1.4%) cases. Influenza virus types were: A (H1N1 and H3N2) 53.2% (67/126); B (Victoria and Yamagata) 46.0% (58/126); A+B 0.8% (1/126). The median direct medical costs associated with each case of laboratory-confirmed influenza was €177.00 (N=131). No significant differences were observed between the medical costs associated with influenza A and B. Conclusion Almost half of the cases were influenza virus B type. The administration of a vaccine containing influenza A and B types to children below 15 years of age might reduce the overall burden of the illness.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.125924187,-0.100111656,-0.043375286,0.015737415,-0.01239613,0.103316423,-0.053274509,-0.019985686,0.023671009,-0.082474704,0.009588502,0.030075339,-0.03360184,-0.132570079,0.184875754,0.280040104,0.35458914,0.058739411,-0.031448774,0.066238751,0.028677405,0.111562656,0.069469081,0.01271603,-0.116844055,-0.044212271,0.01650023,0.014722113,-0.017519945,0.05181158
Estudio clínico-epidemiológico de la infección por Bordetella pertussis en la isla de Gran Canaria en el período 2008-2016,"Resumen Objetivo Describir el patrón epidemiológico y clínico de la infección por Bordetella pertussis (tosferina) en niños menores de un año hospitalizados en un hospital pediátrico de Gran Canaria. Pacientes y métodos Se revisaron retrospectivamente las historias clínicas de los pacientes con diagnóstico microbiológico de infección por B. pertussis mediante reacción en cadena de la polimerasa, de enero de 2008 a diciembre de 2016. Resultados Se identificaron 110 pacientes, de los cuales 105 (95,4%) fueron menores de 6 meses y el 59,1% eran varones. La incidencia anual de hospitalización se estimó entre 13,7 y 425,0 casos por cada 100.000 lactantes menores de 12 meses, con 2picos en 2011 y 2015. Los familiares cercanos fueron las principales fuentes de contagio potenciales. Las principales manifestaciones fueron la tos pertusoide asociada con signos catarrales, cianosis y linfocitosis. El 15,4% de los pacientes presentaron complicaciones (principalmente neumonía), pero la evolución fue favorable en todos los casos. La menor edad y la no vacunación se asociaron con un mayor riesgo de desarrollar complicaciones (p < 0,05). La coinfección viral ocurrió en el 31,6% de los pacientes diagnosticados de infección por B. pertussis. Conclusiones La incidencia de infección por B. pertussis ha aumentado en los últimos años en nuestra área, con un menor desarrollo de complicaciones y con tasas de mortalidad inferiores al período anterior. La menor edad y la no vacunación previa se consideran factores de riesgo para el desarrollo de complicaciones. La vacunación en mujeres embarazadas probablemente disminuirá la incidencia en el futuro, sobre todo en niños menores de 6 meses. Abstract Objective Describe the epidemiological and clinical pattern of Bordetella pertussis infection (whooping cough) among hospitalised infants less than one year-old in a paediatric hospital in Gran Canaria. Patients and methods A retrospective review of the patient hospital records was performed, and recording only those with a microbiological diagnosis of pertussis infection detected using polymerase chain reaction, from January 2008 to December 2016. Results A total of 110 patients were identified, of which 105 (95.4%) were less than 6 months-old, and 59.1% were males. The annual incidence of hospital admissions was estimated between 13.7 to 425.0 cases per 100,000 infants <12 months old, with 2peaks in 2011 and 2015. Household members were the main potential sources of infection. Main clinical features were pertussis cough associated with signs of catarrh, cyanosis, and lymphocytosis. Complications occurred in 15.4% of the patients (mainly pneumonia), but the outcome was favourable in all the cases. A lower age and non-vaccination were associated with an increased risk of developing complications (P<.05). Viral co-infection occurred in 31.6% of infants diagnosed with pertussis. Conclusions The incidence of pertussis has increased in the last years in Gran Canaria, with a lower development of complications and mortality rates compared with the previous period. Lower age and non-vaccination status are considered risk factors for developing complications. Vaccination in pregnant women will probably lead to a decline in the incidence in the future, especially in infants younger than 6 months.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.075570026,-0.064250653,-0.043515165,-0.120659139,-0.037958432,0.003107254,0.021690736,0.013653233,0.018291453,-0.054304318,0.001300266,0.053048627,-0.05107503,-0.172074666,0.232485328,0.373859791,0.461818206,0.099767034,-0.02673665,0.100520353,0.034148508,0.069499818,0.047181098,0.030227346,-0.075526623,-0.13985321,0.083972399,0.021809508,-0.028990994,0.007144394
Epidemiology of community acquired pneumonia,"Abstract Despite efforts in prevention worldwide including recent advances in vaccine therapy, childhood community acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality both in the developed and the developing world. Traditionally, qualifying the aetiology of CAP proved to be fraught with challenges particularly due to low yields from blood and sputum specimens. In recent years however, new advances in techniques such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction have dramatically improved detection rates of both bacteria and viruses. In addition to qualifying the true burden of disease by known organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae it has led to the identification of organisms such as human bocavirus which have not previously been associated with CAP. This article aims to provide a brief update to the clinician on the current epidemiology of CAP in this post-vaccination era. It is based on a combination of recommendations from existing clinical practice guidelines, recent systematic reviews and the current literature.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.062054843,-0.033090566,0.009676712,-0.03012095,-0.065158572,0.012028542,0.061426726,0.051287339,-0.09804035,0.115873625,-0.063479048,-0.002403399,0.057083914,-0.091471733,-0.051929577,-0.049134527,-0.046254652,0.017163005,-0.090925057,0.08688781,-0.011412098,0.120261995,0.206174294,0.071297155,0.102618431,-0.078355364,-0.002639735,0.060279926,0.166859138,-0.013084604
Postmortem diagnosis of cytomegalovirus and accompanying other infection agents by real-time PCR in cases of sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI),"Abstract As an opportunistic pathogen with high mortality rates, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) may lead to fatal disseminated CMV infection of the premature and newborn; thus necessitating the demonstration of CMV-DNA with clinical history and/or histopathological findings of CMV infection and defining other bacterial and viral infection agents with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in udden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) cases as we aimed in this study. 314 (144 female, 170 male) SUDI cases were prospectively investigated from January 2013 to January 2015 in Istanbul Forensic Medicine Institution. The study includes 87 tissue samples of 39 cases for post-mortem histopathological examination of interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, meningitis, encephalitis, hepatitis, colitis or tubulointerstitial nephritis and/or accompanying chronic sialadenitis. CMV-DNA was found positive in 35 (40.2%) salivary gland, 19 (21.8%) lung, 1 (1.1%) tonsil, and 1 (1.1%) brain tissues. CMV sialadenitis and/or CMV pneumonia associated with other viral and/or bacterial agents were detected in 23 (60%) of 39 infant cases. The demonstration of CMV-DNA would significantly clarify the cause of death and collection of epidemiological data in SUDI cases with clinical history and histopathological findings of CMV infection accompanying chronic CMV sialadenitis. Furthermore, CMV suppresses the immune system, and may predispose to other bacterial and/or viral infections in these cases.

Bartonella-associated inflammatory cardiomyopathy in a dog,"Abstract A 6-year-old, male, mongrel dog was presented for acute onset of dyspnea and cough. At admission, the dog was cachectic and severely depressed. The electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm conducted with left bundle truncular branch block and interrupted by frequent multiform ventricular ectopic beats organized in allorhythmias. Thoracic radiographs revealed a marked cardiomegaly with perihilar edema, whereas transthoracic echocardiography revealed a dilated cardiomyopathy with segmental dyskinesis. Furosemide, enalapril, pimobendan, and mexiletine were prescribed, and a Holter was scheduled after resolution of congestive heart failure. Three days later, the dog died suddenly during sleep. Histopathology revealed diffuse myocyte hypertrophy with multifocal hemorrhages, alternating to areas of severe replacement fibrosis and lymphoplasmocytic infiltrates. Immunohystochemistry stains were strongly positive for T-lymphocyte infiltration (CD3) and weakly positive for B-lymphocytes (CD79). Polymerase chain reaction was positive for Bartonella spp. Based on these results, a post-mortem diagnosis of bacterial inflammatory cardiomyopathy was made.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.016057946,0.000176415,-0.003091199,-0.12185871,-0.016364447,0.023489082,-0.002910187,0.02700523,-0.028007977,-0.022920237,0.034094335,0.02102197,-0.024350383,-0.015053119,0.018866497,0.015128969,-0.000855828,0.003804398,-0.016697166,-0.023200356,0.009967227,-0.002171073,-0.051454836,-0.052615197,0.030417339,-0.003511414,-0.052270935,0.009738565,0.005712746,-0.014140603
MERS-CoV diagnosis: An update,"Summary Diagnosis of MERS-Cov still a major concern in most of daignostic laboratories. To date the Real-time Polymerase Chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the mainstay for diagnosis of MERS-CoV. RT-PCR has limitations, including a long turnaround time and lack of common measurements and correlations with Viral Load (VL). It is recommended to screen for MERS-CoV using RT-PCR of the upstream of envelope gene (upE) followed by confirmation of the presence of one of the following genes; open reading frame 1A, 1B genes or nucleocapsid (N) gene. Scientists are looking to implement viral sequencing on all negative samples by RT-PCR and they beleive that can be exposed to another level of testing using sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene or N gene and in this case a positive result is diagnostic. It is also very important to maintain a contineous and random sequencing for MERS-Cov samples to be able to pick early viral mutations. Serological assays still not widely or routinely performed, and a lot of studies looking to implement such method in routine patient's testings.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.009268299,0.304115918,0.057385104,0.084531822,0.035062999,-0.059549537,-0.057161892,0.275656254,0.21297971,0.004336903,0.025837985,-0.051619114,-0.031975564,0.046575072,-0.026481261,-0.075356087,0.062487217,-0.048666689,-0.043031351,-0.107042975,-0.000922618,0.077533521,0.031033129,0.047270448,-0.066912763,-0.049884312,0.082977854,-0.080685813,0.045927316,0.043328909
L’analyse virologique des aspirations nasopharyngées reflète-t-elle l’infection respiratoire basse chez l’enfant ? Étude en PCR multiplex,"Résumé Les infections respiratoires sont un problème de santé publique. Leur cause en est majoritairement virale chez le jeune enfant. La mise au point de techniques de détection par biologie moléculaire a permis d’en élargir le spectre virologique. L’objectif de notre travail est d’évaluer la corrélation entre les résultats des prélèvements effectués par aspiration rhinopharyngée et par lavage bronchoalvéolaire. Trente enfants présentant une symptomatologie d’infection respiratoire basse ont ainsi été prélevés aux deux sites au cours d’une même séance. Les échantillons ont été analysés par Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) virale multiplex (xTAG™RVP). Une corrélation forte est retrouvée entre la positivité de la PCR virale dans les voies respiratoires hautes et basses (p =0,0002). Le virus le plus fréquemment isolé est l’entéro-rhinovirus. Ces résultats confirment que l’infection virale touche l’appareil respiratoire de façon diffuse, et suggèrent que le prélèvement par aspiration rhinopharyngée suffit au diagnostic virologique d’une infection respiratoire virale basse chez l’enfant immunocompétent. Abstract Respiratory tract infections are frequent in young children and are related to viruses in most cases. Multiplex Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based techniques are valuable tools for describing the spectrum of such viruses. The goal of this study was to assess the correlation of virus detection in samples obtained by nasopharyngeal aspiration and by bronchoalveolar lavage. Both samples were taken at the same time in 30 children with lower respiratory tract infection, and were analyzed by multiplex virus PCR (xTAG™RVP). A strong correlation has been found (P =0.0002) and the most frequently isolated virus was the entero-rhinovirus spp. These results strengthen the opinion that viruses colonize both the upper and lower respiratory tract. Nasopharyngeal samples should be sufficient to the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract viral infection in immuno-competent children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.096839956,-0.054481019,0.016747478,-0.020959486,0.00324647,-0.040978868,0.059448757,-0.031962579,0.060015732,0.020428657,0.003024278,-0.006403725,0.04225943,-0.08937536,0.224118309,0.192693989,0.334353204,0.022903144,-0.031397015,0.000332905,0.042607528,0.054770251,0.06741862,0.003738621,-0.023331797,0.028201754,-0.039902745,-0.05774991,0.001797575,-0.007111239
The European race of Gremmeniella abietina hosts a single species of Gammapartitivirus showing a global distribution and possible recombinant events in its history,"Abstract The population genetics of the family Partitiviridae was studied within the European race of the conifer pathogen Gremmeniella abietina. One hundred sixty-two isolates were collected from different countries, including Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, Montenegro, Serbia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States. A unique species of G. abietina RNA virus–MS1 (GaRV-MS1) appears to occur indistinctly in G. abietina biotypes A and B, without a particular geographical distribution pattern. Forty-six isolates were shown to host GaRV-MS1 according to direct specific RT-PCR screening, and the virus was more common in biotype A than B. Phylogenetic analysis based on 46 partial coat protein (CP) cDNA sequences divided the GaRV-MS1 population into two closely related clades, while RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequences revealed only one clade. The evolution of the virus appears to mainly occur through purifying selection but also through recombination. Recombination events were detected within alignments of the three complete CP and RdRp sequences of GaRV-MS1. This is the first time that recombination events have been directly identified in fungal partitiviruses and in G. abietina in particular. The results suggest that the population dynamics of GaRV-MS1 do not have a direct impact on the genetic structure of its host, G. abietina, though they might have had an innocuous ancestral relationship.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.128205724,-0.021972709,-0.002566308,0.041642914,0.121686151,0.002903019,0.043487684,0.028913105,-0.050765141,0.053914357,0.058868065,0.041051819,-0.03153526,-0.02556952,-0.005217339,0.004381316,-0.016307324,-0.001848424,-0.062792464,-0.034708984,0.078688753,-0.017601182,-0.002849871,0.03477984,-0.055823409,0.003822117,0.086476572,0.009227924,-0.012135221,0.031854066
Influenza,"Zusammenfassung Virus Influenzavirus ist ein Mitglied der Orthomyxoviren, welche in der Evolution die Fähigkeit erworben haben, schnelle Wirtswechsel vorzunehmen. Typische Wirte sind Mensch, Haustiere wie Pferd, Schwein, Katze und Geflügel, unter den Vögeln besonders Gans und Ente, und Säugetiere des Wassers. Das Genom von Influenzavirus A und B ist segmentiert und wenn zwei Viren eine Zelle infizieren können ganze Genomsegmente ausgetauscht werden (reassortment), was zu einer hohen Variabilität führt. Diese betrifft sowohl die Oberflächenproteine der Hülle des Influenzavirus wie H (Hämagglutinin) und N (Neuraminidase) als auch die im Partikel liegende Polymerase. Ein Influenzavirus, welches auf der Oberfläche Epitope trägt, die dem tierischen oder menschlichen Immunsystem nicht bekannt sind, hat das Potential eine neue Epidemie auszulösen. Übertragung typisch für Influenzavirus ist die aerogene Übertragung, besonders über Tröpfchen beim Husten und Niesen und Schmierinfektion, meist durch direkten Kontakt. Die Inkubationszeit beträgt normalerweise 24 bis 48 Stunden. Frühe klinische Symptome sind Fieber, Infektionszeichen (Halsschmerzen, Nasensekretion, Niesen) im oberen Respirationstrakt, Augenrötung gepaart mit Myalgie, Schüttelfrost und schwerem Krankheitsgefühl. Prävention wesentlich sind Abstand vom Infizierten, Vermeiden von Aerosolen und - innerhalb der Behandlungseinheiten - Händedesinfektion und Desinfektion von Gebrauchsgegenständen vom Stethoskop bis zur Türklinke. Ein wesentlicher Beitrag zur Prävention wird durch die jährliche Impfung gegen saisonale Stämme Influenzavirus A-H1N1 und A-H3N2 und Influenzavirus B geleistet. Therapie unspezifisch entzündungshemmende Substanzen und Vermeiden bzw. Behandlung der bakteriellen Superinfektion mit Antibiotika. Spezifisch mit Neuraminidase-Inhibitoren wie Oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) und Zanamivir (Relenza®) innerhalb von 48h nach Beginn der Symptomatik. Abstract Virus Influenza virus is the only human-pathogenic member of orthomyxovirus, which during evolution acquired the capability to infect the cells of various mammals and birds. Besides man common hosts are domestic animals as horse, swine, cat and poultry, among the birds especially goose and duck, and nearly all mammals living in water. The influenza virus A and B genome is segmented, when two different viruses infect one cell whole genome-segments can be exchanged (reassortment). This capability leads to a high variability of the envelope surface proteins H (haemagglutinin) and N (neuraminidase), as well as the polymerase inside the virus particle. An influenza virus equipped with epitopes on its surface that are unknown by the human and animal immune system has the potential to initiate a new epidemic. Transmission for influenza virus main route is aerogene, especially by small droplets while coughing and sneezing and by smear infection, mostly by direct contact. Incubation time is usually 24 to 48hours. Early clinical symptoms are fever, all signs of inflammation in the upper respiratory tract with sore throat, nasal secretion, conjunctivitis that are associated with myalgia, chills and malaise. Prevention important is the distance from the infected, to avoid aerosol formation, and within care units disinfection of hands and utensils as from stethoscope to door handle. Essential for prevention of disease is the annual vaccination against the seasonal strains influenza virus A-H1N1, A-H3N2 and influenza virus B. Treatment unspecific by anti-inflammatory drugs and reduction of symptoms by therapy of bacterial superinfection with antibiotics. Specific: by application of neuraminidase inhibitors as oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) and zanamavir (Relenza®) within 48hours after onset of the symptoms.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.005022371,-0.050319829,-0.008919913,0.009193927,-0.020919085,0.142407726,-0.01875455,0.002035295,0.005160147,-0.025895355,0.001289888,0.006863027,0.013738971,-0.01964286,0.034950943,0.023886679,0.000719707,0.010899186,-0.010381007,0.017215098,0.013855718,-0.004710007,-0.02086814,0.005412427,-0.008760942,0.015564025,-0.018978383,0.000473744,0.014420531,-0.005555746
Inhibition of viral RNA polymerases by nucleoside and nucleotide analogs: therapeutic applications against positive-strand RNA viruses beyond hepatitis C virus,"A number of important human infections are caused by positive-strand RNA viruses, yet almost none can be treated with small molecule antiviral therapeutics. One exception is the chronic infection caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV), against which new generations of potent inhibitors are being developed. One of the main molecular targets for anti-HCV drugs is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, NS5B. This review summarizes the search for nucleoside and nucleotide analogs that inhibit HCV NS5B, which led to the FDA approval of sofosbuvir in 2013. Advances in anti-HCV therapeutics have also stimulated efforts to develop nucleoside analogs against other positive-strand RNA viruses. Although it remains to be validated in the clinic, the prospect of using nucleoside analogs to treat acute infections caused by RNA viruses represents an important paradigm shift and a new frontier for future antiviral therapies.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.120409515,-0.050708105,-0.067833573,0.107896405,-0.098298737,0.014466545,0.107095528,0.027620824,0.022445218,0.085156222,0.056550485,0.085399556,0.060390349,0.027585163,0.025155061,-0.051706392,-0.008792295,0.309051476,0.304283706,-0.083899851,-0.071228522,0.004769198,0.015190042,0.10145131,-0.044485365,-0.087192496,-0.04867461,0.021188087,0.029505046,-0.065138929
Antiproliferative effect of Toona sinensis leaf extract on non–small-cell lung cancer,"Toona sinensis (TS), which is also known as Cedrela sinensis, belongs to Meliaceae family, the compounds identified from this TS leaves possess a wide range of biologic functions, such as hypoglycemic effects, anti–LDL glycative activity, antioxidant activities, and inhibition of sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus replication. However, their effect against cancer cells is not well explored. In this study, to understand the cytotoxic effect and molecular mechanism stimulated by TSL-1 (TS leaf extract fraction) we employed three different non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines: H441 cells (lung adenocarcinoma), H661 cells (lung large cell carcinoma) and H520 cells (lung squamous cell carcinoma). IC50 value was varied between these three cell lines, the least IC50 value was observed in TSL-1–treated H661cells. Exposure of NSCLC cells to TSL-1 caused cell-cycle arrest in subG1 phase and caused apoptosis. Moreover, TSL-1 treatment decreased the cell-cycle regulators; cyclin D1 and CDK4 proteins by up regulating p27 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, the TSL-1–induced apoptosis was further confirmed by cell morphology, subG1 peak accumulation, poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, propidium iodide (PI)-Annexin-V double staining, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay. The decreased Bcl2 protein level was concurrent with an increased Bax protein level in all 3 cell lines. Additionally, the tumoricidal effect of TSL-1 was measured using a xenograft model, after 5 weeks of TSL-1 treatment by various regimen caused regression of tumor. Taken together both these in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that TSL-1 is a potent inhibitor against NSCLC growth and our provoking result suggest that TSL-1 can be a better nutriceutical as a singlet or along with doublet agents (taxane, vinorelbine, and gemcitabine) for treating NSCLC.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.09388338,-0.004949301,-0.038160432,-0.096473128,-0.113037047,0.061453887,0.034856783,-0.068380132,0.056224249,-0.024393778,-0.051728955,-0.025018418,-0.009723886,0.085141263,0.008266099,0.009604551,0.004255693,-0.018450216,0.03093759,-0.009552414,0.029971649,-0.0127485,0.025481777,-0.017707205,0.033809139,0.046631898,-0.032846525,0.035982337,-0.019837963,-0.071019253
Next-generation direct-acting influenza therapeutics,"Influenza viruses are a major threat to human health globally. In addition to further improving vaccine prophylaxis, disease management through antiviral therapeutics constitutes an important component of the current intervention strategy to prevent advance to complicated disease and reduce case-fatality rates. Standard-of-care is treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors that prevent viral dissemination. In 2018, the first mechanistically new influenza drug class for the treatment of uncomplicated seasonal influenza in 2 decades was approved for human use. Targeting the PA endonuclease subunit of the viral polymerase complex, this class suppresses viral replication. However, the genetic barrier against viral resistance to both drug classes is low, pre-existing resistance is observed in circulating strains, and resistant viruses are pathogenic and transmit efficiently. Addressing the resistance problem has emerged as an important objective for the development of next-generation influenza virus therapeutics.

"Emerging Developments on Pathogenicity, Molecular Virulence, Epidemiology and Clinical Symptoms of Current Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)","Abstract Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a recently reported virus that is associated with severe, life threatening and rapidly spreading primarily respiratory illness called the Middle East respiratory syndrome. MERS-CoV possesses a unique positive-sense single-stranded RNA and can undergo rapid mutation in the viral genome. This results in antigenic switching and genetic variation, finally leading to the emergence of novel and new MERS-CoV subtypes which are uncontrollable by vaccines. Researchers are also finding difficulties to sort out therapeutic intervention strategies for MERS-CoV. This virus can spread from human to human, but transmission from dromedary camels to humans plays a crucial epidemiological significance. Dromedary camel acts as “gene mixing vessels” for MERS-CoV and these virus particles undergo rapid change in them. Viral receptors called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 are important receptors for attachment and spread of MERS-CoV in humans. The current method of laboratory confirmation is through real-time polymerase chain reaction on bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum and tracheal aspirates. Unfortunately, till today there are no definite anti-viral drugs available for MERS-CoV.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.027241574,0.33490339,-0.162850231,0.061132073,0.003025327,0.036944597,0.01032711,0.370324031,0.358976885,0.041992939,0.033050652,-0.061122426,-0.005106002,-0.033352864,0.020639372,-0.035716574,-0.020174302,-0.067187939,-0.01831371,0.028274854,0.001414343,0.030845475,0.045330855,0.090983716,-0.018553013,-0.035782383,-0.011858856,-0.021147119,-0.002596439,0.034163102
Relationship between CD14-159C/T gene polymorphism and acute brucellosis risk,"Abstract Objective To investigate the association between the cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14)-159C/T (rs2569190) gene polymorphism and susceptibility to acute brucellosis in an Iranian population. Methods The study included 153 Iranian patients with active brucellosis and 128 healthy individuals as the control group. Genotyping of the CD14 variant was performed using an amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction method. Results The prevalence of CD14-159 TT and CT genotypes were associated with increased risk of brucellosis [odds ratio (OR) = 1.993, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.07–3.71, P = 0.03 for CT; OR = 3.869, 95% CI = 1.91–7.84, P = 0.01 for TT genotype. Additionally, the minor allele (T) was significantly more frequently present in brucellosis patients than in controls (61% vs. 45%, respectively), and was a risk factor for brucellosis (OR = 3.058, 95% CI = 1.507–6.315, P = 0.01).

Recent advances and perspectives of nucleic acid detection for coronavirus,"Abstract The recent pneumonia outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Chinais posing a great threat to global public health. Therefore, rapid and a accurate identification of pathogenic viruses plays a vital role in selecting appropriate treatments, saving people’s lives and preventing epidemics. It is important to establish a quick standard diagnostic test for the detection of the infectious disease (COVID-19) to prevent subsequent secondary spread. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is regarded as a gold standard test for the molecular diagnosis of viral and bacterial infections with high sensitivity and specificity. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification is considered to be a highly promising candidate method due to its fundamental advantage in quick procedure time at constant temperature without thermocycler operation. A variety of improved or new approaches also have been developed. This review summarizes the currently available detection methods for coronavirus nucleic acid. It is anticipated that this will assist researchers and clinicians in developing better techniques for timely and effective detection of coronavirus infection.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.043131374,0.162090566,0.109791833,0.04480911,-0.088739317,0.018960635,0.055949399,0.011385823,-0.015741976,0.102658301,-0.050927285,-0.019754812,0.117414586,-0.150892986,0.004670232,0.01403242,-0.062752138,0.054461628,-0.072904579,0.003173929,-0.059401103,-0.003701409,-0.008129722,-0.060523595,0.0268097,0.005421954,0.023085032,0.005946187,-0.056569255,0.024755913
Rapid Recovery of Classical Swine Fever Virus Directly from Cloned cDNA,"Abstract The reverse genetics for classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is currently based on the transfection of in vitro transcribed RNA from a viral genomic cDNA clone, which is inefficient and time-consuming. This study was aimed to develop an improved method for rapid recovery of CSFV directly from cloned cDNA. Full-length genomic cDNA from the CSFV Shimen strain, which was flanked by a T7 promoter, the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme and T7 terminator sequences, was cloned into the low-copy vector pOK12, producing pOKShimen-RzTΦ. Direct transfection of pOKShimen-RzTΦ into PK/T7 cells, a PK-15-derived cell line stably expressing bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase, allowed CSFV to be rescued rapidly and efficiently, i.e., at least 12 h faster and 31.6-fold greater viral titer when compared with the in vitro transcription-based rescue system. Furthermore, the progeny virus rescued from PK/T7 cells was indistinguishable, both in vitro and in vivo, from its parent virus and the virus rescued from classical reverse genetics. The reverse genetics based on intracellular transcription is efficient, convenient and cost-effective. The PK/T7 cell line can be used to rescue CSFV directly from cloned cDNA and it can also be used as an intracellular transcription and expression system for studying the structure and function of viral genes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.112169357,-0.036590388,0.033539396,0.007259006,-0.03683193,-0.007709182,-0.056626781,-0.018916206,0.026553276,0.007624559,-0.026759718,-0.069366842,0.019385393,0.038671421,0.061884337,0.028087805,-0.04493768,0.005084696,-0.017274054,0.002335361,-0.008254249,-0.012943485,0.04947857,0.001184532,-0.019431722,0.01835707,0.025347421,0.001009351,-0.047825307,0.050306374
A duplex RT-PCR assay for detection of H9 subtype avian influenza viruses and infectious bronchitis viruses,"Abstract H9 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) are major pathogens circulating in poultry and have resulted in great economic losses due to respiratory disease and reduced egg production. As similar symptoms are elicited by the two pathogens, it is difficult for their differential diagnosis. So far, no reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay has been found to differentiate between H9 AIV and IBV in one reaction. Therefore, developing a sensitive and specific method is of importance to simultaneously detect and differentiate H9 AIV and IBV. In this study, a duplex RT-PCR (dRT-PCR) was established. Two primer sets target the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of H9 AIV and the nucleocapsid (N) gene of IBV, respectively. Specific PCR products were obtained from all tested H9 AIVs and IBVs belonging to the major clades circulating in China, but not from AIVs of other subtypes or other infectious avian viruses. The sensitivity of the dRT-PCR assay corresponding to H9 AIV, IBV and mixture of H9 AIV and IBV were at a concentration of 1×101, 1.5×101 and 1.5×101 50% egg infective doses (EID50) mL−1, respectively. The concordance rates between the dRT-PCR and virus isolation were 99.1 and 98.2%, respectively, for detection of samples from H9N2 AIV or IBV infected chickens, while the concordance rate was 99.1% for detection of samples from H9N2 AIV and IBV co-infected chickens. Thus, the dRT-PCR assay reported herein is specific and sensitive, and suitable for the differential diagnosis of clinical infections and surveillance of H9 AIVs and IBVs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.01074707,0.017169515,0.170425923,-0.025684697,0.105336245,0.078911362,-0.132372735,-0.082104011,0.083468029,0.249951037,0.067988208,-0.002931556,-0.059852619,0.073643216,-0.099360078,0.11663842,0.038110797,0.001167806,0.029454147,-0.013687393,-0.041643521,-0.003914204,0.013325544,-0.044302223,0.003630785,0.025267923,-0.015418627,0.004659501,0.063691672,-0.025162468
Viral infections in patients with an acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia,"Abstract Background Patients with slowly progressive idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, often deteriorate, thus suggesting that the clinical course may be unpredictable. Such episodes are termed acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. The etiology of an acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia is unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that an acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia is induced by respiratory viral infections. Methods Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from patients with an acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia was tested for viral nucleic acid using polymerase chain reaction. Results Only 1 of the 14 patients with an acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia exhibited evidence of respiratory syncytial virus B, and 2 patients exhibited evidence of cytomegalovirus. Seven patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

Pathogen profiles and molecular epidemiology of respiratory viruses in Japanese inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia,"Abstract Background The etiological profile of viruses among adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has not been characterized yet. The aim of this study was twofold: first, investigate the pathogen profiles and the molecular epidemiology of respiratory viruses among Japanese CAP patients; and second, explore the clinical significance of viral infections. Methods A cross-sectional observational study was conducted at Kyorin University Hospital. To identify respiratory pathogens, hospitalized CAP patients were enrolled, and reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction technology was applied alongside conventional microbiological methods. Phylogenetic and pairwise distance analyses of 10 viruses were performed. CAP patients were divided into four etiological groups (virus alone, bacteria alone, co-detection of virus and bacteria, and not detected) and the clinical findings were compared. Results Seventy-six patients were enrolled. Bacteria alone were detected in 39.5% (n=30) of CAP patients. Virus alone or co-detection were found in 10.5% (n=8) and 11.8% (n=9) of cases, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae and human metapneumovirus were the most frequently detected bacterium and virus, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses of human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, and human respiratory syncytial virus showed that different subgroups and genotypes might be associated with CAP. Respiratory failure was more common when a virus was detected (both virus alone and co-detection groups; n=17, 100%, p<0.05) than when a bacteria alone was detected (n=17, 56.7%). Conclusion Prevalence of respiratory virus infection in CAP inpatients was 22.3%. The detected viruses display high genetic divergence and correlate with increased respiratory failure.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.257788543,-0.095427302,-0.083679349,0.012620095,0.029849205,-0.099671024,-0.002939887,0.080622054,-0.182742215,0.158906649,-0.093602091,-0.033970812,0.059650454,0.061753017,-0.055371734,-0.100916162,0.019140956,-0.022790048,-0.013167784,0.170915556,0.049123415,0.058416595,0.217855284,0.138210917,0.100887741,-0.063634315,-0.029183677,0.100956519,0.083160997,-0.029944076
"Nucleocapsid gene analysis from an imported case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Malaysia","Abstract Objective To describe the complete nucleocapsid (N) gene region of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) from imported case in Malaysia and the relations with human- and camel-derived MERS-CoV. Methods Combination of throat and nasal swab specimens was subjected to viral RNA extraction. For screening, the extracted RNA was subjected to real-time RT-PCR targeting upstream of E gene, open reading frame 1b and open reading frame 1a. For confirmation, the RNA was subjected to RT-PCR targeting partial part of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nucleocapsid, followed by amplification of complete N gene region. Nucleotide sequencing of the first Malaysian case of MERS-CoV was performed following the confirmation with real-time RT-PCR detection. Results Initial analysis of partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and N gene revealed that the nucleotides had high similarity to Jeddah_1_2013 strain. Analysis of complete N gene region (1 242 nucleotides) from the case showed high similarity and yet distinct to the nucleotide sequences of camel-derived MERS-CoV.

"Clinico-epidemiological characteristics of acute respiratory infections by coronavirus OC43, NL63 and 229E","Abstract Background and objectives Acute respiratory infection is a very common condition in the general population. The majority of these infections are due to viruses. This study attempted to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of adult patients with respiratory infection by the coronavirus OC43, NL63 and 229E. Patients and methods Between January 2013 and February 2014, we prospectively studied all patients with suspected clinical respiratory infection by taking throat swabs and performing a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in search of coronavirus. Results In 48 cases (7.0% of the 686 enrolled patients; 12.6% of the 381 in whom a virus was detected) the presence of a coronavirus demonstrated. In 24 cases, the virus was OC43 (50%); in 14 cases, the virus was NL63 (29%); and in 10 cases, the virus was 229E (21%). The mean age was 54.5 years, with a slight predominance of men. The most common clinical presentations were nonspecific influenza symptoms (43.7%), pneumonia (29.2%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (8.3%). Fifty-two percent of the patients required hospitalization, and 2 patients required intensive care. There were no deaths. Conclusion Acute respiratory infections caused by coronavirus mainly affect middle-aged male smokers, who are often affected by previous diseases. The most common clinical picture has been nonspecific influenza symptoms.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.287819952,-0.046156058,-0.161545755,-0.013202155,0.003342902,-0.026836892,-0.100380974,0.086457746,-0.073698858,0.028929664,-0.018266705,0.075826677,0.122426182,0.085092196,0.007690945,0.00462343,0.04858286,0.058647853,0.037665668,0.084026834,0.046982086,-0.080269111,-0.053493266,-0.001566935,0.026716049,0.018796706,-0.009394952,0.0697344,-0.054854031,-0.016972751
Acute respiratory viral infections in pediatric cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy,"Abstract Objective to estimate the prevalence of infection by respiratory viruses in pediatric patients with cancer and acute respiratory infection (ARI) and/or fever. Methods cross‐sectional study, from January 2011 to December 2012. The secretions of nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed in children younger than 21 years with acute respiratory infections. Patients were treated at the Grupo em Defesa da Criança Com Câncer (Grendacc) and University Hospital (HU), Jundiaí, SP. The rapid test was used for detection of influenza virus (Kit Biotrin, Inc. Ireland), and real‐time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (FTD, Respiratory pathogens, multiplex Fast Trade Kit, Malta) for detection of influenza virus (H1N1, B), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parechovirus, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, and human coronavirus. The prevalence of viral infection was estimated and association tests were used (χ2 or Fisher's exact test). Results 104 samples of nasopharyngeal aspirate and blood were analyzed. The median age was 12 ± 5.2 years, 51% males, 68% whites, 32% had repeated ARIs, 32% prior antibiotic use, 19.8% cough, and 8% contact with ARIs. A total of 94.3% were in good general status. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (42.3%) was the most prevalent neoplasia. Respiratory viruses were detected in 50 samples: rhinoviruses (23.1%), respiratory syncytial virus AB (8.7%), and coronavirus (6.8%). Co‐detection occurred in 19% of cases with 2 viruses and in 3% of those with 3 viruses, and was more frequent between rhinovirus and coronavirus 43. Fever in neutropenic patients was observed in 13%, of which four (30.7) were positive for viruses. There were no deaths. Conclusions the prevalence of respiratory viruses was relevant in the infectious episode, with no increase in morbidity and mortality. Viral co‐detection was frequent in patients with cancer and ARIs.

Viral respiratory tract infections in the neonatal intensive care unit,"Abstract Introduction Viral respiratory infections cause major morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. We have performed a prospective study in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to determine the incidence of respiratory infections, their impact and the epidemiology and outcome in high risk neonates. Patients and methods From September 2011 to May 2013 a prospective study was conducted in all preterm infants <32 weeks gestational age and in all term newborns admitted to NICU for any pathology that was anticipated to have an admission exceeding two weeks. A nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was collected the first day of life and weekly until discharge for virologic study with polymerase chain reaction. When these babies presented respiratory symptoms a new NPA was collected at this moment. A clinical form was filled by the physician. Results A total of 60 infants were analysed: 30 (50%) had a gestational age <32 weeks and 36 (60%) weighed less than 1500g. We collected a total of 256 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, 24 of them being positive (9.3%). These 24 positive samples corresponded to 13 infants in our cohort (21.6% of the patients). Of them, 9 were symptomatic and had 11 episodes of infection (2 patients had two different episodes with negative control between them). The most frequently identified virus was rhinovirus in (19) 79% of cases. The most frequent clinical data was the presence or increase in apneas (75%) and the need for oxygenotherapy.

"A prospective study to assess the burden of influenza-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits among children in Bilbao, Spain (2010–2011)","Abstract Introduction This study was undertaken to estimate the burden of morbidity associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza in children below 15 years of age. Patients and methods Children presenting with acute respiratory infection and/or isolated fever at the Basurto University Hospital, Bilbao, Spain between November 2010 and May 2011 were included in this study (NCT01592799). Two nasopharyngeal secretion samples were taken from each; one for a rapid influenza diagnostic test in the emergency department, and the second for laboratory analysis using real-time polymerase chain reaction and viral culture. Results A total of 501 children were recruited, of whom 91 were hospitalized. Influenza diagnosis was confirmed in 131 children (26.1%); 120 of 410 (29.3%) treated as outpatients and 11 of 91 (12.1%) hospitalized children. A total of 370 of 501 children (73.9%) had no laboratory test positive for influenza. The proportion of subjects with other respiratory viruses was 145/501 (28.9%) cases and co-infection with the influenza virus plus another respiratory virus was detected in 7/501 (1.4%) cases. Influenza virus types were: A (H1N1 and H3N2) 53.2% (67/126); B (Victoria and Yamagata) 46.0% (58/126); A+B 0.8% (1/126). The median direct medical costs associated with each case of laboratory-confirmed influenza was €177.00 (N =131). No significant differences were observed between the medical costs associated with influenza A and B. Conclusion Almost half of the cases were influenza virus B type. The administration of a vaccine containing influenza A and B types to children below 15 years of age might reduce the overall burden of the illness.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.261597221,-0.140340838,-0.087940732,0.151936271,0.006601356,0.177360169,-0.134925573,-0.03278355,0.0106296,-0.107686199,0.026457775,0.002761905,-0.030626333,-0.065827974,0.001887656,0.056977221,0.005903545,-0.024709254,-0.007753397,-0.014734568,-0.036386352,0.095201922,0.036517147,-0.033677704,-0.060550156,0.065688217,-0.061289294,0.013626136,0.005252574,0.048388331
Pathogenicity-associated protein domains: The fiercely-conserved evolutionary signatures,"Abstract Proteins have highly conserved domains that determine their functionality. Out of the thousands of domains discovered so far across all living forms, some of the predominant clinically-relevant domains include IENR1, HNHc, HELICc, Pro-kuma_activ, Tryp_SPc, Lactamase_B, PbH1, ChtBD3, CBM49, acidPPc, G3P_acyltransf, RPOL8c, KbaA, HAMP, HisKA, Hr1, Dak2, APC2, Citrate_ly_lig, DALR, VKc, YARHG, WR1, PWI, ZnF_BED, TUDOR, MHC_II_beta, Integrin_B_tail, Excalibur, DISIN, Cadherin, ACTIN, PROF, Robl_LC7, MIT, Kelch, GAS2, B41, Cyclin_C, Connexin_CCC, OmpH, Bac_rhodopsin, AAA, Knot1, NH, Galanin, IB, Elicitin, ACTH, Cache_2, CHASE, AgrB, PRP, IGR, and Antimicrobial21. These domains are distributed in nucleases/helicases, proteases, esterases, lipases, glycosylase, GTPases, phosphatases, methyltransferases, acyltransferase, acetyltransferase, polymerase, kinase, ligase, synthetase, oxidoreductase, protease inhibitors, nucleic acid binding proteins, adhesion and immunity-related proteins, cytoskeletal component-manipulating proteins, lipid biosynthesis and metabolism proteins, membrane-associated proteins, hormone-like and signaling proteins, etc. These domains are ubiquitous stretches or folds of the proteins in pathogens and allergens.

Bronchoalveolar lavage to evaluate new pulmonary infiltrates in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients: impact on antimicrobial optimization,"Summary Background Pulmonary complications cause significant morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT). Bronchoscopy with targeted bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is often used in AHSCT patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) to help guide management. Aim To evaluate how positive BAL results change antimicrobial management of AHSCT recipients with suspected LRTI. Methods We performed a retrospective review of BAL results from January 2014 to July 2016 for 54 AHSCT recipients. A positive BAL was determined by culture, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Aspergillus galactomannan antigen (AGA), and cytology. Findings BAL was positive for infectious etiologies in 63%, and antimicrobials were adjusted in 48/54 (89%) of patients. Antibacterial escalation was predicted by a positive BAL bacterial culture (OR 7.61, P=0.017). Antibiotic de-escalation was more likely with an elevated AGA (OR 3.86, P=0.035). Antiviral initiation was more likely with positive BAL multiplex PCR (OR 17.33, P=0.010). Antifungals were more likely to be escalated or changed with an elevated AGA (OR 4.33, P=0.020). The patients with a negative BAL were more likely to be started on steroids (OR 0.19, P= 0.043). Conclusions BAL was helpful to determine the etiology of pulmonary complications and optimize antimicrobials. The addition of AGA and multiplex PCR to standard BAL significantly impacted de-escalating antibiotics and adjusting antifungals to provide adequate coverage. The association with an elevated AGA with antibacterial de-escalation highlights a new role for BAL in antimicrobial optimization.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.07188615,-0.018651098,-0.007208765,-0.086980496,-0.041460509,-0.019414771,-0.015408269,0.058612562,-0.063456189,0.030017319,-0.011997855,0.0265883,0.011533417,0.030484783,-0.002721997,-0.016395679,0.028576172,0.038375378,-0.018148349,-0.03790353,0.037231218,-0.0249357,0.010388601,-0.053539056,0.002533409,-0.013616284,-0.006792163,-0.035929687,0.004404307,-0.012608356
Revisiting the dangers of the coronavirus in the ophthalmology practice,"A possible threat in the ophthalmology clinic While the 2019-nCoV transmission route is still unknown, countries have been preparing measures based on past experiences with coronaviruses namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These viruses transmit primarily through droplets and other bodily secretions. In the ophthalmology practice, healthcare workers may be particularly susceptible to these infections. Firstly, ophthalmologists are extremely reliant on physical examination during patient consultation. Of particular concern is the proximity between the patient and ophthalmologist during the slit lamp microscope examination. It has been shown that droplets from a cough or sneeze can be propelled for up to 6?m [8], a range that definitely encompasses the distance between the patient and ophthalmologist. Secondly, during the SARS-CoV epidemic, clinical reports have suggested tears as a medium of infection. In a case series by Loon et al., it was shown that viral RNA of the SARS-CoV can be detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the tears of infected individuals [9]. While anecdotal in nature, such accounts highlight the possible infectivity of tears, a fluid which ophthalmologists and instruments come in contact on a daily basis. If true, this represents a crucial need for further development of disinfection and personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols for the ophthalmology clinic.SN - 1476-5454",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.013102703,0.332248161,-0.105490974,0.014053794,-0.035649405,0.026204179,-0.014223447,0.016567835,0.066476985,0.002764854,0.028529101,-0.016022171,0.002290959,-0.036734362,0.042047066,0.032706249,-0.004343584,0.036594068,-0.058306596,-0.00199463,-0.052882394,0.022400504,-0.063323532,0.044688771,0.034396468,0.021574039,0.010101831,0.031341887,0.00670591,-0.009945079

"Potential Rapid Diagnostics, Vaccine and Therapeutics for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV): A Systematic Review","Rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics are important interventions for the management of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. It is timely to systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development. A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used. A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been published. A commercial RT-PCR kit developed by the Beijing Genomic Institute is currently widely used in China and likely in Asia. However, serological assays as well as point-of-care testing kits have not been developed but are likely in the near future. Several vaccine candidates are in the pipeline. The likely earliest Phase 1 vaccine trial is a synthetic DNA-based candidate. A number of novel compounds as well as therapeutics licensed for other conditions appear to have in vitro efficacy against the 2019-nCoV. Some are being tested in clinical trials against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, while others have been listed for clinical trials against 2019-nCoV.

Epidemiologic Features and Clinical Course of Patients Infected With SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has spread globally with sustained human-to-human transmission outside China.To report the initial experience in Singapore with the epidemiologic investigation of this outbreak, clinical features, and management.Descriptive case series of the first 18 patients diagnosed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at 4 hospitals in Singapore from January 23 to February 3, 2020; final follow-up date was February 25, 2020.Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected, including PCR cycle threshold values from nasopharyngeal swabs and viral shedding in blood, urine, and stool. Clinical course was summarized, including requirement for supplemental oxygen and intensive care and use of empirical treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir.Among the 18 hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (median age, 47 years; 9 [50%] women), clinical presentation was an upper respiratory tract infection in 12 (67%), and viral shedding from the nasopharynx was prolonged for 7 days or longer among 15 (83%). Six individuals (33%) required supplemental oxygen; of these, 2 required intensive care. There were no deaths. Virus was detectable in the stool (4/8 [50%]) and blood (1/12 [8%]) by PCR but not in urine. Five individuals requiring supplemental oxygen were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir. For 3 of the 5 patients, fever resolved and supplemental oxygen requirement was reduced within 3 days, whereas 2 deteriorated with progressive respiratory failure. Four of the 5 patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir developed nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea, and 3 developed abnormal liver function test results.Among the first 18 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Singapore, clinical presentation was frequently a mild respiratory tract infection. Some patients required supplemental oxygen and had variable clinical outcomes following treatment with an antiretroviral agent.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.190535013,0.27901808,-0.198609379,-0.068232659,-0.067739094,-0.036293132,-0.067586156,-0.013811091,-0.061686879,0.020144815,0.021994324,-0.001455403,0.025553816,0.043035507,0.011293615,-0.001031074,0.001409687,0.077040096,0.012139053,0.032617252,0.018084352,-0.0192937,-0.076801012,-0.038670474,-0.015715387,-0.001302941,0.023362801,0.004610016,-0.019909008,0.003868116
Learning from the Past: Possible Urgent Prevention and Treatment Options for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections Caused by 2019-nCoV,"With the current trajectory of the 2019-nCoV outbreak unknown, public health and medicinal measures will both be needed to contain spreading of the virus and to optimize patient outcomes. Although little is known about the virus, an examination of the genome sequence shows strong homology with its better-studied cousin, SARS-CoV. The spike protein used for host cell infection shows key nonsynonymous mutations that might hamper the efficacy of previously developed therapeutics but remains a viable target for the development of biologics and macrocyclic peptides. Other key drug targets, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro), share a strikingly high (>95 %) homology to SARS-CoV. Herein, we suggest four potential drug candidates (an ACE2-based peptide, remdesivir, 3CLpro-1 and a novel vinylsulfone protease inhibitor) that could be used to treat patients suffering with the 2019-nCoV. We also summarize previous efforts into drugging these targets and hope to help in the development of broad-spectrum anti-coronaviral agents for future epidemics.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.078614506,0.181320251,-0.124165911,0.009656595,-0.075105061,0.064123383,0.006810511,-0.026287933,0.00063827,0.030756399,-0.025357055,0.018987276,0.041879711,-0.075392377,-0.007827228,-0.018602553,-0.036584649,0.101349443,0.004612928,0.012106391,-0.036079478,0.043213222,-0.095104098,0.006984964,0.042885781,0.064100423,0.140594184,-0.021546885,0.03760152,-0.042240278
Antibodies to Coronaviruses Are Higher in Older Compared with Younger Adults and Binding Antibodies Are More Sensitive than Neutralizing Antibodies in Identifying Coronavirus-Associated Illnesses,"ABSTRACT Problem Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are common causes of respiratory illnesses (RI) despite pre-existing humoral immunity. Methods Sera were obtained near onset of RI and 3 to 4 weeks later as part of a prospective study of 200 subjects evaluated for RI from 2009 to 2013. Antibodies against common HCoV strains were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralization assay comparing older adults with cardiopulmonary diseases (99 subjects) to younger, healthy adults (101 subjects). Virus shedding was detected in respiratory secretions by polymerase chain reaction. Results Of 43 HCoV-associated illnesses, 15 (35%) occurred in 14 older adults (aged ≥ 60 years) and 28 (65%) in 28 younger adults (aged 21 to 40 years). Binding and neutralizing antibodies were higher in older adults. Only 16 (35.7%) of RI with increases in binding antibodies also had increases in neutralizing antibodies to HCoV. Increases in binding antibodies with RI were more frequent than increased neutralizing antibodies and virus shedding, and more frequent in younger compared to older adults. Conclusions Functional neutralizing antibodies were not stimulated as often as binding antibodies, explaining in part a susceptibility to reinfection with HCoV. Monitoring binding antibodies may be more sensitive for serologic detection of HCoV infections. This article is protected by copyright.

Evaluation of coronavirus in tears and conjunctival secretions of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the presence of novel coronavirus in tears and conjunctival secretions of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. METHODS: A prospective interventional case series study was performed, and 30 confirmed novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) patients were selected at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University from January 26, 2020 to February 9, 2020. At an interval of 2-3 days, tear and conjunctival secretions were collected twice with disposable sampling swabs for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. RESULTS: 21 common type and 9 severe type NCP patients were enrolled. Two samples of tear and conjunctival secretions were obtained from the only one patient with conjunctivitis yielded positive RT-PCR results. 58 samples from other patents were all negative. CONCLUSION: We speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may be detected in the tears and conjunctival secretions in NCP patients with conjunctivitis. This article is protected by copyright.

From SARS and MERS CoVs to SARS-CoV-2: moving toward more biased codon usage in viral structural and non-structural genes,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging disease with fatal outcomes. In this study, a fundamental knowledge gap question is to be resolved by evaluating the differences in biological and pathogenic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and the changes in SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with the two prior major COV epidemics, SARS and MERS coronaviruses. METHODS: The genome composition, nucleotides analysis, codon usage indices, relative synonymous codons usage (RESU) and effective number of codons (ENc) were analysed in the four structural genes; Spike (S), Envelope (E), membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) genes, and two of the most important non-structural genes comprising RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, Beta-CoV from pangolins, bat SARS, MERS and SARS CoVs. These genes include Spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), Envelop(E) and membrane (M) genes. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 prefers pyrimidine rich codons to purines. Most high-frequency codons were ending with A or T, while the low frequency and rare codons were ending with G or C. SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins showed 5-20 lower ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS and MERS CoVs. This implies higher codon bias and higher gene expression efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. SARS-CoV-2 encoded the highest number of over biased and negatively biased codons. Pangolin Beta-CoV showed little differences with SARS-CoV-2 ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS and MERS CoV. CONCLUSION: Extreme bias and lower ENc values of SARS-CoV-2, especially in Spike, Envelope and Mpro genes, are suggestive for higher gene expression efficiency, compared with SARS, bat SARS and MERS CoVs.

The potential chemical structure of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,"An outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan and it has rapidly spread to almost all parts of the world. For coronaviruses, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an important protease that catalyze the replication of RNA from RNA template and is an attractive therapeutic target. In this study, we screened these chemical structures from traditional Chinese medicinal compounds proven to show anti-viral activity in SARS-CoV and the similar chemical structures through a molecular docking study to target RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We found that theaflavin has a lower idock score in the catalytic pocket of RdRp in SARS-CoV-2 (-9.11 kcal/mol), SARS-CoV (-8.03 kcal/mol) and MERS-CoV (-8.26 kcal/mol) from idock. To confirm the result, we discovered that theaflavin has a lower binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol when it docks in the catalytic pocket of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by using the Blind Docking server. Regarding contact modes, hydrophobic interactions contribute significantly in binding and additional hydrogen bonds were found between theaflavin and RdRp. Moreover, one π-cation interaction was formed between theaflavin and Arg553 from the Blind Docking server. Our results suggest that theaflavin could be potential SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitor for further study. This article is protected by copyright.

The antiviral compound remdesivir potently inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,"Antiviral drugs for managing infections with human coronaviruses are not yet approved, posing a serious challenge to current global efforts aimed at containing the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Remdesivir (RDV) is an investigational compound with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). RDV is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). Here, we co-expressed the MERS-CoV nonstructural proteins nsp5, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 (RdRp) in insect cells as a part a polyprotein to study the mechanism of inhibition of MERS-CoV RdRp by RDV. We initially demonstrated that nsp8 and nsp12 form an active complex. The triphosphate form of the inhibitor (RDV-TP) competes with its natural counterpart ATP. Of note, the selectivity value for RDV-TP obtained here with a steady-state approach suggests that it is more efficiently incorporated than ATP and two other nucleotide analogues. Once incorporated at position i, the inhibitor caused RNA synthesis arrest at position i+3. Hence, the likely mechanism of action is delayed RNA chain termination. The additional three nucleotides may protect the inhibitor from excision by the viral 3'-5' exonuclease activity. Together, these results help to explain the high potency of RDV against RNA viruses in cell-based assays.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.115804623,0.209358039,-0.192103985,0.104026813,-0.049002485,-0.008406875,0.04867593,0.098360252,0.118043178,0.032125881,0.085215599,0.055365272,-0.034819188,-0.024173636,-0.010158695,-0.017473938,0.012863533,-0.016895729,0.03745098,-0.017371867,0.000472808,0.001478861,0.063928196,0.031025321,0.037553672,0.002922699,-0.028455657,0.016362336,0.04383748,0.018026142
2019 novel coronavirus: an emerging global threat,"The coronavirus (CoV) epidemic that began in China in December 2019 follows earlier epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV in China and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV in Saudi Arabia. The full genome of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has now been shared, and data have been gathered from several case series. As of February 11, 2020, there have been 45,182 laboratory-confirmed cases, the vast majority in China, with 1115 deaths, for an overall case-fatality rate of 2.5%. Cases have been confirmed in 27 countries. On average, each patient infects 2.2 other people. Symptomatic infection appears to predominantly affect adults, with a 5-day estimated incubation period between infection and symptom onset. The most common presenting symptoms are fever, cough, dyspnea, and myalgias and/or fatigue. All cases reported to date have shown radiographic evidence of pneumonia. 2019-nCoV is diagnosed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Treatment is largely supportive, with regimens including antiviral therapy. Corticosteroids are not routinely recommended.

De-isolating COVID-19 Suspect Cases: A Continuing Challenge,"As of 15 February 2020, Singapore had screened a total of 991 suspect cases for COVID-19, of which 72 cases tested positive, 812 cases tested negative, while the remaining 107 had pending results.(1) Besides optimising sample type to increase yield, (2) the challenge in clinical management of suspect cases lies in deciding whether they may be de-isolated or if further isolation and repeat testing is required. No single indicator may be effectively used to decide on de-isolation of a suspect case. In our series of positive cases, samples from one suspect case only returned positive on the fifth repeated sample (nasopharyngeal swab), on the seventh day of clinical illness. Current evidence suggests that transmission of COVID-19 may be possible even from asymptomatic contacts,(3) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing may not return positive initially. (4) Our suspect case was kept isolated because of a high index of clinical suspicion, with a clinically compatible illness and history of close contact with a laboratory-proven COVID-19 case. While multiplex respiratory virus panels, in general, may be helpful in the evaluation of other viral acute respiratory infections (ARIs), even the detection of an alternate respiratory pathogen may not definitively exclude COVID-19 infection. Dual infections can occur in 10- 20% of viral acute respiratory infections, as has been reported with SARS-CoV and MERSCoV. (5) In our case series, one patient with confirmed COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal aspirate also exhibited clinical symptoms compatible with dengue fever. This was laboratory confirmed by dengue NS1 antigen test.

Repurposing of clinically approved drugs for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 in a 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) related coronavirus model,"BACKGROUND: Medicines for the treatment of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections are urgently needed. However, drug screening using live 2019-nCoV requires high-level biosafety facilities, which imposes an obstacle for those without such facilities or 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This study aims to repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV related coronavirus model. METHODS: A 2019-nCoV related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/ Guangxi was described. Whether GX_P2X uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor was investigated by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated silencing of ACE2. The pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were screened for their ability to inhibit cytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells by GX_P2X infection. The antiviral activities and antiviral mechanisms of potential drugs were further investigated. Viral yields of RNAs and infectious particles were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and plaque assay, respectively. RESULTS: The spike protein of coronavirus GX_P2V shares 92.2% amino acid identity with that of 2019-nCoV isolate Wuhan-hu-1, and uses ACE2 as the receptor for infection just like 2019-nCoV. Three drugs-cepharanthine (CEP), selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride exhibited complete inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell culture at 10 μmol/L. CEP demonstrated the most potent inhibition of GX_P2V infection, with a concentration for 50% of maximal effect [EC50] of 0.98 μmol/L. The viral RNA yield in cells treated with 10 μmol/L CEP was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without CEP treatment ([6.48 ± 0.02] × 10vs. 1.00 ± 0.12, t = 150.38, P < 0.001) at 72 h post-infection (p.i.). Plaque assays found no production of live viruses in media containing 10 μmol/L CEP at 48 h p.i. Furthermore, we found CEP has potent antiviral activities against both viral entry (1.00 ± 0.37 vs. 0.46 ± 0.12, t = 2.42, P < 0.05) and viral replication (1.00 ± 0.43 vs. [6.18 ± 0.95] × 10, t = 3.98, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V is a workable model for 2019-nCoV research. CEP, selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride are potential drugs for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Our results strongly suggest that CEP is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of pan-betacoronavirus, and clinical trial of CEP for treatment of 2019-nCoV infection is warranted.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.033396208,0.028080403,-0.017533312,-0.073382787,-0.090899308,0.047710014,0.02412715,0.023791709,0.010430514,0.007625279,0.007908557,0.024375738,0.009615717,0.020886356,0.0167572,0.019714594,-0.055129298,0.136184916,0.012077761,-0.03956022,-0.045541845,0.074910725,-0.165677519,-0.074124192,0.061726079,0.142539459,0.202088692,0.001442541,0.06773997,-0.08191606

Besides, for patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the dynamic conversion of RT-PCR results (negative to positive, positive to negative, respectively) was analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans for those with time-interval of 4 days or more. Results Of 1014 patients, 59% (601/1014) had positive RT-PCR results, and 88% (888/1014) had positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97% (95%CI, 95-98%, 580/601 patients) based on positive RT-PCR results. In patients with negative RT-PCR results, 75% (308/413) had positive chest CT findings; of 308, 48% were considered as highly likely cases, with 33% as probable cases. By analysis of serial RT-PCR assays and CT scans, the mean interval time between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR results was 5.1 ± 1.5 days; the initial positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR result was 6.9 ± 2.3 days). 60% to 93% of cases had initial positive CT consistent with COVID-19 prior (or parallel) to the initial positive RT-PCR results. 42% (24/57) cases showed improvement in follow-up chest CT scans before the RT-PCR results turning negative. Conclusion Chest CT has a high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest CT may be considered as a primary tool for the current COVID-19 detection in epidemic areas.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.125523267,0.120853387,0.145650881,-0.034962104,-0.038034222,-0.068046534,-0.094119815,0.080761822,-0.109052,-0.048255582,0.053264195,0.068801459,-0.073909572,0.125689895,-0.016768466,0.015193818,0.056615325,0.092916189,-0.057197058,-0.128118488,-0.065321139,0.112891603,-0.160510219,-0.064841409,0.014017198,0.131399447,0.184634314,-0.067587206,0.044653057,-0.06103232
Potential preanalytical and analytical vulnerabilities in the laboratory diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"A novel zoonotic coronavirus outbreak is spreading all over the world. This pandemic disease has now been defined as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and is sustained by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As the current gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens, the diagnostic accuracy of this technique shall be considered a foremost prerequisite. Overall, potential RT-PCR vulnerabilities include general preanalytical issues such as identification problems, inadequate procedures for collection, handling, transport and storage of the swabs, collection of inappropriate or inadequate material (for quality or volume), presence of interfering substances, manual errors, as well as specific aspects such as sample contamination and testing patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. Some analytical problems may also contribute to jeopardize the diagnostic accuracy, including testing outside the diagnostic window, active viral recombination, use of inadequately validated assays, insufficient harmonization, instrument malfunctioning, along with other specific technical issues. Some practical indications can hence be identified for minimizing the risk of diagnostic errors, encompassing the improvement of diagnostic accuracy by combining clinical evidence with results of chest computed tomography (CT) and RT-PCR, interpretation of RT-PCR results according to epidemiologic, clinical and radiological factors, recollection and testing of upper (or lower) respiratory specimens in patients with negative RT-PCR test results and high suspicion or probability of infection, dissemination of clear instructions for specimen (especially swab) collection, management and storage, together with refinement of molecular target(s) and thorough compliance with analytical procedures, including quality assurance.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.135846898,0.237684134,0.057899982,0.041169778,-0.052343861,-0.043034891,-0.029461608,0.021652783,-0.035160588,0.052787626,0.004218913,-0.0041372,0.076185315,0.019304743,0.016918616,-0.001052524,0.006457163,0.057897995,-0.056264746,-0.092551381,0.000460679,0.004150614,-0.069643483,-0.087308518,0.027126661,0.037099254,0.092016875,-0.054607996,0.02715702,-0.040195678
"Clinical Features and Chest CT Manifestations of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Single-Center Study in Shanghai, China","OBJECTIVE. Confronting the new coronavirus infection known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is challenging and requires excluding patients with suspected COVID-19 who actually have other diseases. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical features and CT manifestations of COVID-19 by comparing patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia who presented at a fever observation department in Shanghai, China. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients were retrospectively enrolled in the study from January 19 through February 6, 2020. All patients underwent real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. RESULTS. Eleven patients had RT-PCR test results that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, whereas 22 patients had negative results. No statistical difference in clinical features was observed (p > 0.05), with the exception of leukocyte and platelet counts (p < 0.05). The mean (± SD) interval between onset of symptoms and admission to the fever observation department was 4.40 ± 2.00 and 5.52 ± 4.00 days for patients with positive and negative RT-PCR test results, respectively. The frequency of opacifications in patients with positive results and patients with negative results, respectively, was as follows: ground-glass opacities (GGOs), 100.0% versus 90.9%; mixed GGO, 63.6% versus 72.7%; and consolidation, 54.5% versus 77.3%. In patients with positive RT-PCR results, GGOs were the most commonly observed opacification (seen in 100.0% of patients) and were predominantly located in the peripheral zone (100.0% of patients), compared with patients with negative results (31.8%) (p = 0.05). The median number of affected lung lobes and segments was higher in patients with positive RT-PCR results than in those with negative RT-PCR results (five vs 3.5 affected lobes and 15 vs nine affected segments; p < 0.05). Although the air bronchogram reticular pattern was more frequently seen in patients with positive results, centrilobular nodules were less frequently seen in patients with positive results. CONCLUSION. At the point during the COVID-19 outbreak when this study was performed, imaging patterns of multifocal, peripheral, pure GGO, mixed GGO, or consolidation with slight predominance in the lower lung and findings of more extensive GGO than consolidation on chest CT scans obtained during the first week of illness were considered findings highly suspicious of COVID-19.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.214491939,0.079589763,-0.020855182,-0.124050546,-0.06871534,-0.094771848,-0.143351682,0.142175806,-0.226006203,0.016368614,0.002874642,0.074534052,-0.046322488,0.176590898,-0.056335932,-0.004280643,0.064718636,0.118986554,-0.03677067,-0.023756551,0.022847105,0.022410471,-0.15433354,-0.072381574,-0.005113968,0.100333965,0.135338704,0.006216288,-0.006807987,-0.041265559
False-Negative Results of Real-Time Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: Role of Deep-Learning-Based CT Diagnosis and Insights from Two Cases,"The epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus, later named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is still gradually spreading worldwide. The nucleic acid test or genetic sequencing serves as the gold standard method for confirmation of infection, yet several recent studies have reported false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).

Construction and evaluation of a novel diagnosis process for 2019-Corona Virus Disease,"Objective: To construct and evaluate a diagnosis process for 2019-Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19). Methods: A continuous cohort of adults and adolescent (≥12 years) who screened COVID-19 was included in Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from January 23 to February 3, 2020 in which cases were divided the test library and the verification library. Their gender, age, onset time were recorded. Take epidemiological history, fever, and the blood lymphocytes decline as clinical indicators, used CT to evaluate the possibility of COVID-19 and range of lung involvement. According to the current national standards, throat swabs of suspected cases were collected and the nucleic acid of COVID-19 was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The Xiangya process was constructed according to multi-index, compared with clinical indicators, CT results and national standards, the efficiency of detecting confirmed cases were verified in the test and verification library. Results: A continuous cohort of 382 adults who screened COVID-19 was included in which 261 cases were in the test library and 121 cases were in the verification library. In the 382 cases, 192 were males (50.3%) and 190 were females (49.7%), with a median age of 35 years (range: 15-92 years). There were 183 cases (47.9%) with epidemiological history, 275 cases (72.0%) with fever, 212 cases (55.5%) with decreased hemolytic lymphocytes, CT positive 114 cases (29.8%), 43 cases (11.3%) with positive CT-COVID-19, and 30 cases (7.9%) with positive throat swab nucleic acid. Compared with clinical indicators, the sensitivity and specificity of CT were 0.950 and 0.704, respectively. The accuracy of CT to make a definite diagnosis was higher than that of epidemiological history, fever, and blood lymph count decline (0.809 vs 0.660, 0.532, 0.596, P=0.001, 0.002, 0.003, respectively). The sensitivity of this process and the program recommended by the Health Commission all were high (all were 1.000) , and the specificity and accuracy of the process were higher than the program recommended by the Health Commission (0.872 vs 0.765, 0.778 vs 0.592, both P<0.001). The CT-COVID-19 would have reduced the missed diagnosis rate caused by false negative of nucleic acid test (31 vs 64, difference rate 51.6%), the positive rate of nucleic acid test was 64.5% (20/31). In validation library, the specificity and accuracy of the Xiangya process was 0.967, the positive rate of nucleic acid test was 76.9% (10/13). Conclusions: The Xiangya process can predict the nucleic acid test results of COVID-19 well, and can be applied as a reliable basis for confirmed cases detection in adults and adolescent (≥12 years) in areas other than Hubei during the epidemic period of COVID-19. The cohort size needs to be increased for further validation.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.109601148,0.03687865,0.01732601,-0.077643801,-0.053484961,-0.010503269,-0.042603137,0.069287628,-0.069048934,-0.030003828,0.02775043,0.052458126,-0.033753583,-0.075680225,0.001027234,0.03040082,-0.033419288,0.067857136,-0.03582621,-0.069626255,-0.089621729,0.053295585,-0.148217853,-0.131846353,0.001476476,0.155848155,0.1117931,0.073223518,-0.030515288,-0.035055684
Strategies for the development of drugs targeting novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; There is no specific drug that has been approved for 2019-nCoV. There are a number of factors that pose major challenges in their development. Approaches to the development of anti-2019-nCoV include screening existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, repositioning of readily available clinical compounds, and &lt;italic&gt;de novo&lt;/italic&gt; development of novel and specific agents for 2019-nCoV. Candidate compounds can be developed either to inhibit virus-based targets, such as RNA proteases, polymerase, spike glycoproteins, and viral envelop and membrane proteins, or to inhibit host-based targets, such as receptors and proteases that are utilized by virus for viral entry and endocytosis. Recently, the RNA polymerase remdesivir had demonstrated clinical efficacy in one patient with severe novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). The broad-spectrum viral protease inhibitor Kaletra&lt;sup&gt;&reg;&lt;/sup&gt; is also recommended in the current NCP clinical practice. Both drugs had lately been proceeded into multiple controlled phase III clinical trials to test their safety and efficacy in NCP. Combinational therapies consisting of multiple drugs provide other viable options against 2019-nCoV, based on scientific and clinical rationales. Using bioinformatics and database analysis, we have identified 75 clinically compounds, including 20 marketed compounds, that are efficacious in inhibiting key targets in virus- and host-based approaches, which may facilitate the development of new therapeutic options for 2019-nCoV. &lt;/p&gt;",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.048883036,0.007772317,-0.010067759,-0.021251405,-0.096618186,0.068759072,0.066853178,0.016473387,0.006731343,0.045527924,-0.006131481,0.027597654,0.034523793,-0.047111633,0.008325354,-0.002399981,-0.042472825,0.12886035,-0.006268805,-0.00607395,-0.044359859,0.059731447,-0.130347083,-0.029141006,0.062182227,0.058625464,0.145626893,-0.030381239,0.075031539,-0.024295503
Suggestions casted to the novel coronavirus nucleic acid amplification test from viral pneumonia pathogenesis,"An outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), results in Coronavirus disease that began in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly with cases now confirmed in multiple countries. Nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), represent by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) plays an important role in disease diagnosis and treatment evaluation. The test results by RT-PCR have attracted much attention recently. As understanding to this novel pathogen is still limited, it would be much help to combine the knowledge about its pathogenesis to judge the test results, in addition to review the quality control in laboratory. This review will focus on understanding the specific RT-PCR performance of the 2019-nCoV, under the background of viral pneumonia.

Persistence and clearance of viral RNA in 2019 novel coronavirus disease rehabilitation patients,"Background: A patient&rsquo;s infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in different body fluids, secretions, and excreta. The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear. This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence. Methods: The clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients&rsquo; oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed. Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs. The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed. Results: In the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study. In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0&ndash;62.0) years were analyzed. After in-hospital treatment, patients&rsquo; inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition. The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0&ndash;11.0) days. By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients&rsquo; stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0&ndash;16.0) days after symptom onset. Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0&ndash;4.0) days. Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients&rsquo; urine specimens after throat swabs were negative. Using a multiple linear regression model ( F =2.669, P =0.044, and adjusted R 2 =0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients&rsquo; stools ( t =-2.699, P =0.010). The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs 8.0 days, respectively; t =2.550, P =0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs 11 days, respectively; t =4.631, P &lt;0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results ( P &gt;0.05). Conclusions: In brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients&rsquo; stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence. Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease. The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.129467883,0.03345718,-0.076609243,-0.034171076,-0.070454845,-0.11696555,-0.083178316,0.149930671,-0.225470363,0.055988197,0.056516194,0.02248196,-0.046327713,0.161356625,-0.009619525,-0.012068357,-0.001987017,0.083585,0.034187803,-0.020805116,-0.059619791,0.015937748,-0.200740526,-0.097420263,-0.038240731,0.030994658,0.146533544,-0.021369667,-0.043688623,0.017148112
"In the pipeline Derek Lowe's commentary on drug discovery and the pharma industry. An editorially independent blog from the publishers of Science Translational Medicine. All content is Derek’s own, and he does not in any way speak for his employer","Let’s take inventory on the therapies that are being developed for the coronavirus epidemic. Here is a very thorough list of at Biocentury, and I should note that (like Stat and several other organizations) they’re making all their Covid-19 content free to all readers during this crisis. I’d like to zoom in today on the potential small-molecule therapies, since some of these have the most immediate prospects for use in the real world. The ones at the front of the line are repurposed drugs that are already approved for human use, for a lot of obvious reasons. The Biocentury list doesn’t cover these, but here’s an article at Nature Biotechnology that goes into detail. Clinical trials are a huge time sink – they sort of have to be, in most cases, if they’re going to be any good – and if you’ve already done all that stuff it’s a huge leg up, even if the drug itself is not exactly a perfect fit for the disease. So what do we have? The compound that is most advanced is probably remdesivir from Gilead, at right. This has been in development for a few years as an RNA virus therapy – it was originally developed for Ebola, and has been tried out against a whole list of single-strand RNA viruses. That includes the related coronaviruses SARS and MERS, so Covid-19 was an obvious fit. The compound is a prodrug – that phosphoramide gets cleaved off completely, leaving the active 5-OH compound GS-44-1524. It mechanism of action is to get incorporated into viral RNA, since it’s taken up by RNA polymerase and it largely seems to evade proofreading. This causes RNA termination trouble later on, since that alpha-nitrile C-nucleoside is not exactly what the virus is expecting in its genome at that point, and thus viral replication is inhibited.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.097732564,0.05267896,-0.07510587,0.086540901,-0.056515964,0.003428451,0.03514034,0.041474083,0.006034044,0.032495865,0.054859391,0.007568453,0.018571927,-0.007928883,0.019296781,0.018446356,-0.043024106,0.08927394,0.034246378,0.020701235,-0.038004473,0.054200825,-0.094197062,-0.010102299,-0.017319504,0.012718437,0.056994249,0.000550294,0.046982394,-0.018686375
Establishment and clinical performance evaluation of 2019 novel coronavirus antibody colloidal gold detection method,"Objective To establish a colloidal gold technique assay for the rapid detection of immunoglobulin(Ig) M and IgG antibodies against 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and to evaluate its clinical performance. Methods A total of 278 patients who were treated at Wuhan Hankou Hospital and the People's Hospital of Honghu from February 12, 2020 to February 20, 2020 were collected. According to the diagnostic criteria, 89 patients were confirmed with 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive diagnosis, and 189 were 2019-nCoV nucleic acid-negative suspected patients. A total of 273 medical examiners from Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University from 2015 to 2018 were selected as controls. The serum samples of patients were collected. 2019-nCoV nucleic proteins were obtained from prokaryotic expression vectors. Indirect IgM and IgG colloidal gold techniques were established by using recombinant N protein. 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as control. Serum specimens were tested for 2019-nCoV IgM and IgG. The specificity and sensitivity of colloidal gold assay were analyzed. Results The sensitivity and specificity of IgM detection reagents were 78.7% and 98.2%, respectively, those of IgG detection reagents were 73.0% and 99.3%, respectively, and those of IgM combined with IgG detection were 87.6% and 98.2%, respectively.

Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy: analysis of nine cases,"Objective To evaluate the clinical characteristics and pregnant outcomes of gravidae with COVID-19. Methods This study involved nine gravidae with COVID-19 admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 22 to February 1, 2020. Their clinical data, including epidemiological history, clinical symptoms, laboratory examinations, chest CT, treatment, delivery mode, and pregnancy outcomes, were analyzed retrospectively. Descriptive analysis was applied in this study. Results (1) Among the nine cases, five were admitted in the third trimester and four in the second trimester. The median incubation period of COVID-19 was 8 (1-14) d. Fever was presented in all cases on admission, and the other commonly seen symptoms were cough (seven cases) and diarrhea (five cases). Other signs and symptoms were also reported, including shortness of breath, myalgia and fatigue (four cases in each), nasal obstruction, pharyngalgia, chest pain, and headache/dizziness (three cases in each), rash (two cases), and chills and expectoration (one case in each). The most common laboratory abnormalities were a decreased number of lymphocytes (seven cases) and elevated C-reactive protein (six cases). Chest CT scans were performed in seven women, and all showed patchy areas or ground-glass opacity in both lungs. Oligohydramnios was detected in only one case at 37 +5 weeks, which was 7 d after the diagnosis of COVID-19. (2) All nine cases received empiric antibiotic and antiviral therapy with Chinese medicine as adjuvant treatment. Eight patients required oxygen inhalation, and seven were treated with glucocorticoid. One case received immunotherapy due to worsening conditions. (3) Four of the nine cases had delivered, including three cesarean sections and one spontaneous vaginal preterm birth after premature rupture of membranes, and the mother was transferred to the intensive care unit 2 d after delivery due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. One case was terminated at 26 gestational weeks. Of the four neonates, there were two term and two premature babies, and one preterm babies was small-for-gestational-age. No neonatal asphyxia was observed. Serial real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed negative results in the detection of 2019-novel coronavirus in all samples obtained from amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood, neonatal nasopharynx, breast milk, and vagina. Maternal conditions were all stable in all cases, including the four continuing pregnancy, and the terminated ones, except the case mentioned above. Conclusions There is no distinguishable clinical feature between pregnant and non-pregnant COVID-19 patients. Currently, the evidence for vertical transmission of COVID-19 needs further studies with larger size of examples, but pregnancy may deteriorate COVID-19. Given that COVID-19 may have adverse effects on perinatal outcomes, it's recommended to take positive and effective measures for COVID-19 women in the third trimester.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.117176009,0.041027033,-0.063331597,-0.121842255,-0.067727718,-0.000584917,-0.047076264,0.09715178,-0.058412723,-0.019570496,0.032704079,0.046993841,-0.040237476,-0.035119323,0.025540723,0.035535405,-0.025139162,0.095827833,-0.014785321,-0.050718307,-0.059486112,0.065346598,-0.223277703,-0.112515017,0.029942049,0.148784107,0.139383688,0.073421619,0.013295209,-0.059364679
Report of the first cases of mother and infant infections with 2019 novel coronavirus in Xinyang City Henan Province,"Objective To report the first case of a neonatal pneumonia with 2019-nCoV infection, and the experience of successfully diagnosis and treatment in late pregnancy woman with novel coronavirus pneumonia (critical type) in Xinyang city. Methods The successfully diagnosis and treatment of a woman with 38 weeks singleton pregnancy complicated with novel coronavirus pneumonia (critical type), and a case of neonatal pneumonia with 2019-nCoV infection were retrospectively analyzed. Results A single male was successfully delivered at 38-week gestation of his mother by cesarean section under third level protection in operation room. The delivery woman was diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection at day 2 of delivery. Dyspnea and severe hypoxemia soon developed, and invasive mechanical ventilation was given. After active rescue and treatment, the delivery woman had been taken off line successfully and the condition was stable.

Absence of association between angiotensin converting enzyme polymorphism and development of adult respiratory distress syndrome in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome: a case control study,"BACKGROUND: It has been postulated that genetic predisposition may influence the susceptibility to SARS-coronavirus infection and disease outcomes. A recent study has suggested that the deletion allele (D allele) of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene is associated with hypoxemia in SARS patients. Moreover, the ACE D allele has been shown to be more prevalent in patients suffering from adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a previous study. Thus, we have investigated the association between ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and the progression to ARDS or requirement of intensive care in SARS patients. METHOD: One hundred and forty genetically unrelated Chinese SARS patients and 326 healthy volunteers were recruited. The ACE I/D genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction and agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: There is no significant difference in the genotypic distributions and the allelic frequencies of the ACE I/D polymorphism between the SARS patients and the healthy control subjects. Moreover, there is also no evidence that ACE I/D polymorphism is associated with the progression to ARDS or the requirement of intensive care in the SARS patients. In multivariate logistic analysis, age is the only factor associated with the development of ARDS while age and male sex are independent factors associated with the requirement of intensive care. CONCLUSION: The ACE I/D polymorphism is not directly related to increased susceptibility to SARS-coronavirus infection and is not associated with poor outcomes after SARS-coronavirus infection.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.059792913,0.192849363,-0.154590905,-0.119797808,-0.052658622,-0.017307012,-0.071263947,-0.144939126,-0.137346839,-0.009711858,-0.037106381,0.03249838,0.00680773,0.004274043,-0.035085379,0.051303594,-0.022546995,0.004927706,-0.008041291,0.03846441,0.032850177,-0.065329615,-0.019135129,0.040322628,-0.028469909,-0.070518149,-0.0274606,-0.053838575,-0.039684979,-0.004273739
"Replicative homeostasis II: Influence of polymerase fidelity on RNA virus quasispecies biology: Implications for immune recognition, viral autoimmunity and other ""virus receptor"" diseases","Much of the worlds' population is in active or imminent danger from established infectious pathogens, while sporadic and pandemic infections by these and emerging agents threaten everyone. RNA polymerases (RNA(pol)) generate enormous genetic and consequent antigenic heterogeneity permitting both viruses and cellular pathogens to evade host defences. Thus, RNA(pol )causes more morbidity and premature mortality than any other molecule. The extraordinary genetic heterogeneity defining viral quasispecies results from RNA(pol )infidelity causing rapid cumulative genomic RNA mutation a process that, if uncontrolled, would cause catastrophic loss of sequence integrity and inexorable quasispecies extinction. Selective replication and replicative homeostasis, an epicyclical regulatory mechanism dynamically linking RNApol fidelity and processivity with quasispecies phenotypic diversity, modulating polymerase fidelity and, hence, controlling quasispecies behaviour, prevents this happening and also mediates immune escape. Perhaps more importantly, ineluctable generation of broad phenotypic diversity after viral RNA is translated to protein quasispecies suggests a mechanism of disease that specifically targets, and functionally disrupts, the host cell surface molecules – including hormone, lipid, cell signalling or neurotransmitter receptors – that viruses co-opt for cell entry. This mechanism – ""Viral Receptor Disease (VRD)"" – may explain so-called ""viral autoimmunity"", some classical autoimmune disorders and other diseases, including type II diabetes mellitus, and some forms of obesity. Viral receptor disease is a unifying hypothesis that may also explain some diseases with well-established, but multi-factorial and apparently unrelated aetiologies – like coronary artery and other vascular diseases – in addition to diseases like schizophrenia that are poorly understood and lack plausible, coherent, pathogenic explanations.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.143284812,-0.061286185,-0.04774239,0.07036184,-0.049494664,0.014543775,0.090866988,0.018285227,-0.013442844,0.089109505,0.0398864,-0.023789534,0.029949721,0.02563038,0.015610695,0.00701417,-0.044853303,-0.032827299,-0.084989447,0.029399653,0.029604026,0.013498191,-0.047917129,0.055770329,-0.044796504,-0.056593112,0.039261204,-0.033436722,-0.02108999,-0.063422764
Automated extraction protocol for quantification of SARS-Coronavirus RNA in serum: an evaluation study,"BACKGROUND: We have previously developed a test for the diagnosis and prognostic assessment of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) based on the detection of the SARS-coronavirus RNA in serum by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of automating the serum RNA extraction procedure in order to increase the throughput of the assay. METHODS: An automated nucleic acid extraction platform using the MagNA Pure LC instrument (Roche Diagnostics) was evaluated. We developed a modified protocol in compliance with the recommended biosafety guidelines from the World Health Organization based on the use of the MagNA Pure total nucleic acid large volume isolation kit for the extraction of SARS-coronavirus RNA. The modified protocol was compared with a column-based extraction kit (QIAamp viral RNA mini kit, Qiagen) for quantitative performance, analytical sensitivity and precision. RESULTS: The newly developed automated protocol was shown to be free from carry-over contamination and have comparable performance with other standard protocols and kits designed for the MagNA Pure LC instrument. However, the automated method was found to be less sensitive, less precise and led to consistently lower serum SARS-coronavirus concentrations when compared with the column-based extraction method. CONCLUSION: As the diagnostic efficiency and prognostic value of the serum SARS-CoV RNA RT-PCR test is critically associated with the analytical sensitivity and quantitative performance contributed both by the RNA extraction and RT-PCR components of the test, we recommend the use of the column-based manual RNA extraction method.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.013750614,0.243963298,0.07432675,0.101395234,-0.067130782,-0.084521128,-0.024564836,-0.092342663,-0.071120418,0.002516261,0.025581855,-0.0186099,0.032004861,-0.017952371,0.006930856,0.023738955,-0.012587311,-0.004919243,-0.010548898,-0.077764607,-0.039593956,-0.014890595,0.020214725,-0.064487899,-0.025922963,-0.032251615,0.009707001,-0.036542979,-0.00660638,0.025527892
Streptococcus pneumoniae induced c-Jun-N-terminal kinase- and AP-1 -dependent IL-8 release by lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells,"BACKGROUND: Although pneumococcal pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death due to infectious diseases, little is known about pneumococci-lung cell interaction. Herein we tested the hypothesis that pneumococci activated pulmonary epithelial cell cytokine release by c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) METHODS: Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) or epithelial HEK293 cells were infected with S. pneumoniae R6x and cytokine induction was measured by RT-PCR, ELISA and Bioplex assay. JNK-phosphorylation was detected by Western blot and nuclear signaling was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). JNK was modulated by the small molecule inhibitor SP600125 and AP1 by transfection of a dominant negative mutant. RESULTS: S. pneumoniae induced the release of distinct CC and CXC, as well as Th1 and Th2 cytokines and growth factors by human lung epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. Furthermore, pneumococci infection resulted in JNK phosphorylation in BEAS-2B cells. Inhibition of JNK by small molecule inhibitor SP600125 reduced pneumococci-induced IL-8 mRNA expression and release of IL-8 and IL-6. One regulator of the il8 promoter is JNK-phosphorylated activator protein 1 (AP-1). We showed that S. pneumoniae time-dependently induced DNA binding of AP-1 and its phosphorylated subunit c-Jun with a maximum at 3 to 5 h after infection. Recruitment of Ser(63/73)-phosphorylated c-Jun and RNA polymerase II to the endogenous il8 promoter was found 2 h after S. pneumoniae infection by chromatin immunoprecipitation. AP-1 repressor A-Fos reduced IL-8 release by TLR2-overexpressing HEK293 cells induced by pneumococci but not by TNFα. Antisense-constructs targeting the AP-1 subunits Fra1 and Fra2 had no inhibitory effect on pneumococci-induced IL-8 release. CONCLUSION: S. pneumoniae-induced IL-8 expression by human epithelial BEAS-2B cells depended on activation of JNK and recruitment of phosphorylated c-Jun to the il8 promoter.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.055674308,-0.039129969,0.005298719,-0.122024471,-0.103060902,0.024417364,0.028662549,-0.037445093,0.043770043,-0.05101355,-0.058973411,-0.050620403,-0.027319944,0.111083984,-0.02496802,0.0332813,-0.00122407,-0.058069711,-0.012749518,-0.045121163,0.038528609,0.010586706,0.100352629,-0.00854084,0.018900921,-0.00417577,0.02097681,0.082935196,0.053988756,-0.052684842
Association of SARS susceptibility with single nucleic acid polymorphisms of OAS1 and MxA genes: a case-control study,"BACKGROUND: Host genetic factors may play a role in susceptibility and resistance to SARS associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection. The study was carried out to investigate the association between the genetic polymorphisms of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) gene as well as myxovirus resistance 1 (MxA) gene and susceptibility to SARS in Chinese Han population. METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted. A collective of 66 SARS cases and 64 close contact uninfected controls were enrolled in this study. End point real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-based Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis were used to detect the single nucleic polymorphisms (SNPs) in OAS1 and MxA genes. Information on other factors associated with SARS infection was collected using a pre-tested questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were conducted. RESULTS: One polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the OAS1 gene was associated with SARS infection. Compared to AA genotype, AG and GG genotypes were found associated with a protective effect on SARS infection with ORs (95% CI) of 0.42 (0.20~0.89) and 0.30 (0.09~0.97), respectively. Also, a GT genotype at position 88 in the MxA gene promoter was associated with increased susceptibility to SARS infection compared to a GG genotype (OR = 3.06, 95% CI: 1.25~7.50). The associations of AG genotype in OAS1 and GT genotype in MxA remained significant in multivariate analyses after adjusting for SARS protective measures (OR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.14~0.98 and OR = 3.22, 95% CI: 1.13~9.18, respectively). CONCLUSION: SNPs in the OAS1 3'-UTR and MxA promoter region appear associated with host susceptibility to SARS in Chinese Han population.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.029218567,0.239483271,-0.130446239,-0.08586746,0.00289674,0.021993497,-0.068224338,-0.237427602,-0.087149221,-0.068865803,-0.029178784,0.054573148,-0.025857732,-0.068379536,-0.043667393,0.083783477,-0.093293407,-0.064760653,0.035141119,-0.030971422,-0.081288513,0.060480023,0.03294585,0.089953708,-0.056549818,-0.093281859,0.013246294,-0.178195926,-0.036115791,0.012379622
Surveillance recommendations based on an exploratory analysis of respiratory syncytial virus reports derived from the European Influenza Surveillance System,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important pathogen that can cause severe illness in infants and young children. In this study, we assessed whether data on RSV collected by the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS) could be used to build an RSV surveillance system in Europe. METHODS: Influenza and RSV data for the 2002–2003 winter season were analysed for England, France, the Netherlands and Scotland. Data from sentinel physician networks and other sources, mainly hospitals, were collected. Respiratory specimens were tested for influenza and RSV mainly by virus culture and polymerase chain reaction amplification. RESULTS: Data on RSV were entered timely into the EISS database. RSV contributed noticeably to influenza-like illness: in England sentinel RSV detections were common in all age groups, but particularly in young children with 20 (40.8%) of the total number of sentinel swabs testing positive for RSV. Scotland and France also reported the highest percentages of RSV detections in the 0–4 year age group, respectively 10.3% (N = 29) and 12.2% (N = 426). In the Netherlands, RSV was detected in one person aged over 65 years. CONCLUSION: We recommend that respiratory specimens collected in influenza surveillance are also tested systematically for RSV and emphasize the use of both community derived data and data from hospitals for RSV surveillance. RSV data from the EISS have been entered in a timely manner and we consider that the EISS model can be used to develop an RSV surveillance system equivalent to the influenza surveillance in Europe.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.202095179,-0.142802943,-0.070482145,0.142224298,0.040997871,0.050920244,-0.024689766,-0.129660941,0.137023171,-0.162409032,0.03527181,-0.088161721,-0.168902258,-0.103356619,-0.087666873,0.004855521,-0.040359768,0.063113056,-0.017252685,-0.047869817,-0.004615522,-0.147941163,0.035702772,-0.110652122,0.123652519,-0.194202576,0.2636454,0.186906405,-0.053604424,0.074560249
Different rates of (non-)synonymous mutations in astrovirus genes; correlation with gene function,"BACKGROUND: Complete genome sequences of the Astroviridae include human, non-human mammalian and avian species. A consensus topology of astroviruses has been derived from nucleotide substitutions in the full-length genomes and from non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions in each of the three ORFs. Analyses of synonymous substitutions displayed a loss of tree structure, suggesting either saturation of the substitution model or a deviant pattern of synonymous substitutions in certain virus species. RESULTS: We analyzed the complete Astroviridae family for the inference of adaptive molecular evolution at sites and in branches. High rates of synonymous mutations are observed among the non-human virus species. Deviant patterns of synonymous substitutions are found in the capsid structural genes. Purifying selection is a dominant force among all astrovirus genes and only few codon sites showed values for the dN/dS ratio that may indicate site-specific molecular adaptation during virus evolution. One of these sites is the glycine residue of a RGD motif in ORF2 of human astrovirus serotype 1. RGD or similar integrin recognition motifs are present in nearly all astrovirus species. CONCLUSION: Phylogenetic analysis directed by maximum likelihood approximation allows the inclusion of significantly more evolutionary history and thereby, improves the estimation of dN and dS. Sites with enhanced values for dN/dS are prominent at domains in charge of environmental communication (f.i. VP27 and domain 4 in ORF1a) more than at domains dedicated to intrinsic virus functions (f.i. VP34 and ORF1b (the virus polymerase)).

Using patient-collected clinical samples and sera to detect and quantify the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV),"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused a large outbreak of pneumonia in Beijing, China, in 2003. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect and quantify SARS-CoV in 934 sera and self-collected throat washes and fecal samples from 271 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS managed at a single institution. RESULTS: SARS-CoV detection rates in sera were highest in the first 9 days of illness, whereas detection was highest in throat washes 5–14 days after onset of symptoms. The highest SARS-CoV RT-PCR rates (70.4–86.3%) and viral loads (log(10 )4.5–6.1) were seen in fecal samples collected 2–4 weeks after the onset of clinical illness. Fecal samples were frequently SARS-CoV RT-PCR positive beyond 40 days, and occasional sera still had SARS-CoV detected after 3 weeks of illness. CONCLUSION: In the context of an extensive outbreak with major pressure on hospital resources, patient self-collected samples are an alternative to nasopharyngeal aspirates for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV infection.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.133015498,0.50597538,-0.15773539,0.015792074,-0.005481598,-0.026901155,-0.088156852,-0.191880575,-0.067566017,-0.026686534,0.033888625,-0.014570679,-0.038848647,-0.000651221,0.049935776,-1.58E-06,-0.006129777,-0.021994203,0.010117347,-0.035866198,-0.006101352,0.051741549,-0.039665069,0.030090887,-0.006131507,-0.008273605,0.0058293,0.018932552,-0.004789955,-0.004505589
Identification of new reference genes for the normalisation of canine osteoarthritic joint tissue transcripts from microarray data,"BACKGROUND: Real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-qPCR) is the most accurate measure of gene expression in biological systems. The comparison of different samples requires the transformation of data through a process called normalisation. Reference or housekeeping genes are candidate genes which are selected on the basis of constitutive expression across samples, and allow the quantification of changes in gene expression. At present, no reference gene has been identified for any organism which is universally optimal for use across different tissue types or disease situations. We used microarray data to identify new reference genes generated from total RNA isolated from normal and osteoarthritic canine articular tissues (bone, ligament, cartilage, synovium and fat). RT-qPCR assays were designed and applied to each different articular tissue. Reference gene expression stability and ranking was compared using three different mathematical algorithms. RESULTS: Twelve new potential reference genes were identified from microarray data. One gene (mitochondrial ribosomal protein S7 [MRPS7]) was stably expressed in all five of the articular tissues evaluated. One gene HIRA interacting protein 5 isoform 2 [HIRP5]) was stably expressed in four of the tissues evaluated. A commonly used reference gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was not stably expressed in any of the tissues evaluated. Most consistent agreement between rank ordering of reference genes was observed between Bestkeeper© and geNorm, although each method tended to agree on the identity of the most stably expressed genes and the least stably expressed genes for each tissue. New reference genes identified using microarray data normalised in a conventional manner were more stable than those identified by microarray data normalised by using a real-time RT-qPCR methodology. CONCLUSION: Microarray data normalised by a conventional manner can be filtered using a simple stepwise procedure to identify new reference genes, some of which will demonstrate good measures of stability. Mitochondrial ribosomal protein S7 is a new reference gene worthy of investigation in other canine tissues and diseases. Different methods of reference gene stability assessment will generally agree on the most and least stably expressed genes, when co-regulation is not present.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.069488454,0.01816525,0.11638168,-0.085658517,0.018732581,0.025419395,-0.030759568,-0.052094948,0.04908516,-0.034556375,-0.121935615,-0.045198768,0.000990363,0.053585277,-0.02299138,-0.074445301,0.010899879,-0.075773265,-0.028462414,-0.100177085,0.069452476,0.015704808,0.012224047,0.05169059,-0.097870848,-0.059553599,0.056435762,0.025293098,0.060604226,-0.017562356
Universal primers that amplify RNA from all three flavivirus subgroups,"BACKGROUND: Species within the Flavivirus genus pose public health problems around the world. Increasing cases of Dengue and Japanese encephalitis virus in Asia, frequent outbreaks of Yellow fever virus in Africa and South America, and the ongoing spread of West Nile virus throughout the Americas, show the geographical burden of flavivirus diseases. Flavivirus infections are often indistinct from and confused with other febrile illnesses. Here we review the specificity of published primers, and describe a new universal primer pair that can detect a wide range of flaviviruses, including viruses from each of the recognised subgroups. RESULTS: Bioinformatic analysis of 257 published full-length Flavivirus genomes revealed conserved regions not previously targeted by primers. Two degenerate primers, Flav100F and Flav200R were designed from these regions and used to generate an 800 base pair cDNA product. The region amplified encoded part of the methyltransferase and most of the RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (NS5) coding sequence. One-step RT-PCR testing was successful using standard conditions with RNA from over 60 different flavivirus strains representing about 50 species. The cDNA from each virus isolate was sequenced then used in phylogenetic analyses and database searches to confirm the identity of the template RNA. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive testing has revealed the broad specificity of these primers. We briefly discuss the advantages and uses of these universal primers.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.089188928,-0.001607554,0.057138689,0.070186255,0.07658839,-0.005520894,0.002301741,0.030777411,-0.036477198,0.031133943,0.014928181,0.014309112,-0.003273268,-0.02620622,0.013872836,-0.014978508,0.001183655,0.037647675,-0.027668577,-0.019668611,-0.003981564,0.020859699,-0.044240193,0.018337802,0.004995299,0.01869865,0.033116251,-0.001088566,-0.010179689,0.063258005
Deletion of human metapneumovirus M2-2 increases mutation frequency and attenuates growth in hamsters,"BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection can cause acute lower respiratory tract illness in infants, the immunocompromised, and the elderly. Currently there are no licensed preventative measures for hMPV infections. Using a variant of hMPV/NL/1/00 that does not require trypsin supplementation for growth in tissue culture, we deleted the M2-2 gene and evaluated the replication of rhMPV/ΔM2-2 virus in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: In vitro studies showed that the ablation of M2-2 increased the propensity for insertion of U nucleotides in poly-U tracts of the genomic RNA. In addition, viral transcription was up-regulated although the level of genomic RNA remained comparable to rhMPV. Thus, deletion of M2-2 alters the ratio between hMPV genome copies and transcripts. In vivo, rhMPV/ΔM2-2 was attenuated compared to rhMPV in the lungs and nasal turbinates of hamsters. Hamsters immunized with one dose of rhMPV/ΔM2-2 were protected from challenge with 10(6 )PFU of wild type (wt) hMPV/NL/1/00. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that hMPV M2-2 alters regulation of transcription and influences the fidelity of the polymerase complex during viral genome replication. In the hamster model, rhMPVΔM2-2 is attenuated and protective suggesting that deletion of M2-2 may result in a potential live vaccine candidate. A more thorough knowledge of the hMPV polymerase complex and the role of M2-2 during hMPV replication are being studied as we develop a potential live hMPV vaccine candidate that lacks M2-2 expression.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.016299592,-0.079973086,-0.04499735,0.041121001,-0.018399615,-0.059750597,0.038691348,-0.101926611,0.154101078,-0.056212947,0.026191941,-0.040411958,-0.11838864,0.036503242,-0.098781576,-0.032281604,-0.050904839,0.217241115,-0.173227238,0.07771204,0.19583657,0.021898656,0.013424733,-0.083322007,-0.075149001,0.007610846,-0.201051333,-0.17179403,0.016261989,-0.080567542
Ubiquitination Is Required for Effective Replication of Coxsackievirus B3,"BACKGROUND: Protein ubiquitination and/or degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) have been recognized as critical mechanisms in the regulation of numerous essential cellular functions. The importance of the UPS in viral pathogenesis has become increasingly apparent. Using murine cardiomyocytes, we have previously demonstrated that the UPS plays a key role in the replication of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), an important human pathogen associated with various diseases. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we examined the interplay between the UPS and CVB3, focusing on the role of ubiquitination in viral lifecycle. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: As assessed by in situ hybridization, Western blot, and plaque assay, we showed that proteasome inhibition decreased CVB3 RNA replication, protein synthesis, and viral titers in HeLa cells. There were no apparent changes in 20S proteasome activities following CVB3 infection. However, we found viral infection led to an accumulation of protein-ubiquitin conjugates, accompanied by a decreased protein expression of free ubiquitin, implicating an important role of ubiquitination in the UPS-mediated viral replication. Using small-interfering RNA, we demonstrated that gene-silencing of ubiquitin significantly reduced viral titers, possibly through downregulation of protein ubiquitination and subsequent alteration of protein function and/or degradation. Inhibition of deubiquitinating enzymes apparently enhances the inhibitory effects of proteasome inhibitors on CVB3 replication. Finally, by immunoprecipitation, we showed that coxsackieviral polymerase 3D was post-translationally modified by ubiquitination and such modification might be a prerequisite for its function in transcriptional regulation of viral genome. CONCLUSION: Coxsackievirus infection promotes protein ubiquitination, contributing to effective viral replication, probably through ubiquitin modification of viral polymerase.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.135303461,-0.063547511,-0.047054546,-0.01507696,-0.118387328,0.005806295,0.050214694,-0.032007104,0.049969125,0.015743988,-0.021701312,-0.039948947,-0.005598403,0.087754845,-0.018238912,-0.031863553,0.031960254,-0.048112087,-0.021529633,0.050877869,-0.024383826,0.056296558,-0.029801105,-0.020092726,0.037748366,0.033997723,0.013882755,-0.040273849,-0.020790317,0.042921747
Oct-4 Expression Maintained Cancer Stem-Like Properties in Lung Cancer-Derived CD133-Positive Cells,"CD133 (prominin-1), a 5-transmembrane glycoprotein, has recently been considered to be an important marker that represents the subset population of cancer stem-like cells. Herein we report the isolation of CD133-positive cells (LC-CD133(+)) and CD133-negative cells (LC-CD133(−)) from tissue samples of ten patients with non-small cell lung cancer (LC) and five LC cell lines. LC-CD133(+) displayed higher Oct-4 expressions with the ability to self-renew and may represent a reservoir with proliferative potential for generating lung cancer cells. Furthermore, LC-CD133(+), unlike LC-CD133(−), highly co-expressed the multiple drug-resistant marker ABCG2 and showed significant resistance to chemotherapy agents (i.e., cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel) and radiotherapy. The treatment of Oct-4 siRNA with lentiviral vector can specifically block the capability of LC-CD133(+) to form spheres and can further facilitate LC-CD133(+) to differentiate into LC-CD133(−). In addition, knock-down of Oct-4 expression in LC-CD133(+) can significantly inhibit the abilities of tumor invasion and colony formation, and increase apoptotic activities of caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Finally, in vitro and in vivo studies further confirm that the treatment effect of chemoradiotherapy for LC-CD133(+) can be improved by the treatment of Oct-4 siRNA. In conclusion, we demonstrated that Oct-4 expression plays a crucial role in maintaining the self-renewing, cancer stem-like, and chemoradioresistant properties of LC-CD133(+). Future research is warranted regarding the up-regulated expression of Oct-4 in LC-CD133(+) and malignant lung cancer.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.05185923,-0.023187448,0.00108643,-0.091744569,-0.053577755,0.041637506,0.021506885,-0.012616474,0.016121531,-0.025677004,-0.02438696,0.008037063,-0.013890537,0.011736636,0.007142308,0.020722097,-0.002242167,-0.002674518,-0.004629174,-0.029409393,0.018088748,-0.016036491,-0.004173649,-0.015574621,0.008859956,0.004255341,-0.026698941,0.016045742,0.022223988,-0.041452789
Loop-mediated isothermal amplification as an emerging technology for detection of Yersinia ruckeri the causative agent of enteric red mouth disease in fish,"BACKGROUND: Enteric Redmouth (ERM) disease also known as Yersiniosis is a contagious disease affecting salmonids, mainly rainbow trout. The causative agent is the gram-negative bacterium Yersinia ruckeri. The disease can be diagnosed by isolation and identification of the causative agent, or detection of the Pathogen using fluorescent antibody tests, ELISA and PCR assays. These diagnostic methods are laborious, time consuming and need well trained personnel. RESULTS: A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed and evaluated for detection of Y. ruckeri the etiological agent of enteric red mouth (ERM) disease in salmonids. The assay was optimised to amplify the yruI/yruR gene, which encodes Y. ruckeri quorum sensing system, in the presence of a specific primer set and Bst DNA polymerase at an isothermal temperature of 63°C for one hour. Amplification products were detected by visual inspection, agarose gel electrophoresis and by real-time monitoring of turbidity resulted by formation of LAMP amplicons. Digestion with HphI restriction enzyme demonstrated that the amplified product was unique. The specificity of the assay was verified by the absence of amplification products when tested against related bacteria. The assay had 10-fold higher sensitivity compared with conventional PCR and successfully detected Y. ruckeri not only in pure bacterial culture but also in tissue homogenates of infected fish. CONCLUSION: The ERM-LAMP assay represents a practical alternative to the microbiological approach for rapid, sensitive and specific detection of Y. ruckeri in fish farms. The assay is carried out in one hour and needs only a heating block or water bath as laboratory furniture. The advantages of the ERM-LAMP assay make it a promising tool for molecular detection of enteric red mouth disease in fish farms.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.033453734,0.099470015,0.324310683,0.057014798,-0.071244617,-0.066731755,0.029699886,-0.010851137,-0.012249849,-0.009831667,-0.0746169,0.004629645,-0.008104945,-0.004206788,-0.07300914,0.032855776,0.009705861,0.034939183,-0.069839012,0.019796567,-0.072879038,-0.054789913,0.004809451,0.113472454,0.056182311,0.015871022,-0.095902109,0.100175741,-0.086704008,0.008863217
Phi29 polymerase based random amplification of viral RNA as an alternative to random RT-PCR,"BACKGROUND: Phi29 polymerase based amplification methods provides amplified DNA with minimal changes in sequence and relative abundance for many biomedical applications. RNA virus detection using microarrays, however, can present a challenge because phi29 DNA polymerase cannot amplify RNA nor small cDNA fragments (<2000 bases) obtained by reverse transcription of certain viral RNA genomes. Therefore, ligation of cDNA fragments is necessary prior phi29 polymerase based amplification. We adapted the QuantiTect Whole Transcriptome Kit (Qiagen) to our purposes and designated the method as Whole Transcriptome Amplification (WTA). RESULTS: WTA successfully amplified cDNA from a panel of RNA viruses representing the diversity of ribovirus genome sizes. We amplified a range of genome copy numbers from 15 to 4 × 10(7 )using WTA, which yielded quantities of amplified DNA as high as 1.2 μg/μl or 10(10 )target copies. The amplification factor varied between 10(9 )and 10(6). We also demonstrated that co-amplification occurred when viral RNA was mixed with bacterial DNA. CONCLUSION: This is the first report in the scientific literature showing that a modified WGA (WTA) approach can be successfully applied to viral genomic RNA of all sizes.

Widespread distribution and a new recombinant species of Brazilian virus associated with cotton blue disease,"BACKGROUND: Cotton blue disease (CBD), an important global cotton crop pathology responsible for major economic losses, is prevalent in the major cotton-producing states of Brazil. Typical CBD symptoms include stunting due to internodal shortening, leaf rolling, intense green foliage, and yellowing veins. Atypical CBD symptoms, including reddish and withered leaves, were also observed in Brazilian cotton fields in 2007. Recently, a Polerovirus named Cotton leafroll dwarf virus (CLRDV) was shown to be associated with CBD. RESULTS: To understand the distribution and genetic diversity of CLRDV in Brazil, we analyzed 23 CBD-symptomatic plants from susceptible cotton varieties originating from five of the six most important cotton-growing states, from 2004–2007. Here, we report on CLRDV diversity in plants with typical or atypical CBD symptoms by comparing viral coat protein, RNA polymerase (RdRp), and intergenic region genomic sequences. CONCLUSION: The virus had a widespread distribution with a low genetic diversity; however, three divergent isolates were associated with atypical CBD symptoms. These divergent isolates had a CLRDV-related coat protein but a distinct RdRp sequence, and probably arose from recombination events. Based on the taxonomic rules for the family Luteoviridae, we propose that these three isolates represent isolates of a new species in the genus Polerovirus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.078234157,-0.032668037,-0.020477157,-0.034278582,0.075333702,0.018979158,0.040275889,0.002550215,-0.030001964,0.054372476,0.021749289,0.051847009,-0.036427467,-0.062271088,-0.006801977,-0.014510524,-0.017622814,-0.000590262,-0.047668762,-0.001048684,0.044841645,-0.010919298,-0.022601793,0.00999944,-0.028292185,0.031893956,0.043929646,0.015225546,0.022959155,0.023453598
The role of interleukin-12 in the heavy metal-elicited immunomodulation: relevance of various evaluation methods,"BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence exists that heavy metals modulate T helper cell (Th) responses and thereby elicit various pathological manifestation. Interleukin (IL)-12, a crucial innate cytokine, was found to be regulated by such xenobiotic agents. This study aimed at testing whether IL-12 profiles may be indicative of heavy metals-induced immunomodulation. METHODS: Human immunocompetent cells, activated either by monoclonal antibodies or heat-killed Salmonella enterica, were cultured in the absence or presence of cadmium (Cd) acetate or mercuric (Hg) chloride. In vivo experiments were set up where BALB/c mice were exposed to sub-lethal doses of Cd or Hg salts for 3 or 5 weeks. Cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT-reduction assay. Modulation of cytokine profiles was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), cytometric bead-based array (CBA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); the relevance of these methods of cytokine quantification was explored. RESULTS: Modulation of IL-12 profiles in Cd- or Hg-exposed human PBMC was dose-dependent and significantly related to IFN-γ levels as well as to the Th1- or Th2-polarized responses. Similarly, skewing the Th1/Th2 ratios in vivo correlated significantly with up- or down-regulation of IL-12 levels in both cases of investigated metals. CONCLUSION: It can be inferred that: (i) IL-12 profiles alone may represent a relevant indicator of heavy metal-induced immune modulation; (ii) evaluating cytokine profiles by CBA is relevant and can adequately replace other methods such as ELISA and RT-PCR in basic research as well as in immune diagnostics; and (iii) targeting IL-12 in therapeutic approaches may be promising to modify Th1/Th2-associated immune disorders.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.010076822,0.001977709,0.061562354,-0.112631526,-0.0926191,0.025890823,0.047275026,-0.038538704,0.053110682,-0.067427416,-0.029233423,-0.03516982,-0.028354419,0.096063339,-0.042107308,0.025400003,-0.000324448,-0.05464585,-0.025681658,-0.095851936,0.041870936,-0.056700792,0.055411646,0.005012569,-0.055797225,-0.031230697,0.075982202,0.025157482,0.078467725,-0.045432526
Complete genomic sequence analysis of infectious bronchitis virus Ark DPI strain and its evolution by recombination,"An infectious bronchitis virus Arkansas DPI (Ark DPI) virulent strain was sequenced, analyzed and compared with many different IBV strains and coronaviruses. The genome of Ark DPI consists of 27,620 nucleotides, excluding poly (A) tail, and comprises ten open reading frames. Comparative sequence analysis of Ark DPI with other IBV strains shows striking similarity to the Conn, Gray, JMK, and Ark 99, which were circulating during that time period. Furthermore, comparison of the Ark genome with other coronaviruses demonstrates a close relationship to turkey coronavirus. Among non-structural genes, the 5'untranslated region (UTR), 3C-like proteinase (3CL(pro)) and the polymerase (RdRp) sequences are 100% identical to the Gray strain. Among structural genes, S1 has 97% identity with Ark 99; S2 has 100% identity with JMK and 96% to Conn; 3b 99%, and 3C to N is 100% identical to Conn strain. Possible recombination sites were found at the intergenic region of spike gene, 3'end of S1 and 3a gene. Independent recombination events may have occurred in the entire genome of Ark DPI, involving four different IBV strains, suggesting that genomic RNA recombination may occur in any part of the genome at number of sites. Hence, we speculate that the Ark DPI strain originated from the Conn strain, but diverged and evolved independently by point mutations and recombination between field strains.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.119547674,-0.019792463,0.035772678,-0.080980177,0.173659403,0.026322737,-0.116660458,-0.031386919,0.040070229,0.106009211,0.019380784,0.055473232,-0.030917047,-0.063866608,-0.053263978,0.029295648,-0.017829766,0.014528433,0.003977349,0.012340394,0.03721074,-0.031976465,0.003771489,0.03532269,-0.004688034,-0.013986107,0.026385686,0.011904,-0.009895352,0.021475206
An Amphipathic α-Helix Controls Multiple Roles of Brome Mosaic Virus Protein 1a in RNA Replication Complex Assembly and Function,"Brome mosaic virus (BMV) protein 1a has multiple key roles in viral RNA replication. 1a localizes to perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes as a peripheral membrane protein, induces ER membrane invaginations in which RNA replication complexes form, and recruits and stabilizes BMV 2a polymerase (2a(Pol)) and RNA replication templates at these sites to establish active replication complexes. During replication, 1a provides RNA capping, NTPase and possibly RNA helicase functions. Here we identify in BMV 1a an amphipathic α-helix, helix A, and use NMR analysis to define its structure and propensity to insert in hydrophobic membrane-mimicking micelles. We show that helix A is essential for efficient 1a–ER membrane association and normal perinuclear ER localization, and that deletion or mutation of helix A abolishes RNA replication. Strikingly, mutations in helix A give rise to two dramatically opposite 1a function phenotypes, implying that helix A acts as a molecular switch regulating the intricate balance between separable 1a functions. One class of helix A deletions and amino acid substitutions markedly inhibits 1a–membrane association and abolishes ER membrane invagination, viral RNA template recruitment, and replication, but doubles the 1a-mediated increase in 2a(Pol) accumulation. The second class of helix A mutations not only maintains efficient 1a–membrane association but also amplifies the number of 1a-induced membrane invaginations 5- to 8-fold and enhances viral RNA template recruitment, while failing to stimulate 2a(Pol) accumulation. The results provide new insights into the pathways of RNA replication complex assembly and show that helix A is critical for assembly and function of the viral RNA replication complex, including its central role in targeting replication components and controlling modes of 1a action.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.188062148,-0.062231197,-0.068191383,0.05329146,-0.083942856,-0.055166513,0.019215381,0.0282177,-0.007640994,-0.005645799,0.04397938,0.012648433,-0.047842988,0.066494516,-0.011757155,0.031372483,0.029515617,-0.05692361,-0.001614631,0.026855296,-0.065754949,0.035426794,-0.069363761,-0.085517886,0.023148909,-0.062425327,-0.079893367,0.007015306,-0.0511547,-0.029468463
Detection of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) using isothermal amplification of target DNA sequences,"BACKGROUND: The most common method of GMO detection is based upon the amplification of GMO-specific DNA amplicons using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Here we have applied the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method to amplify GMO-related DNA sequences, 'internal' commonly-used motifs for controlling transgene expression and event-specific (plant-transgene) junctions. RESULTS: We have tested the specificity and sensitivity of the technique for use in GMO studies. Results show that detection of 0.01% GMO in equivalent background DNA was possible and dilutions of template suggest that detection from single copies of the template may be possible using LAMP. CONCLUSION: This work shows that GMO detection can be carried out using LAMP for routine screening as well as for specific events detection. Moreover, the sensitivity and ability to amplify targets, even with a high background of DNA, here demonstrated, highlights the advantages of this isothermal amplification when applied for GMO detection.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.006903595,0.075444115,0.307096755,0.083706135,-0.09078371,-0.070123348,0.058615032,0.007659438,-0.024052664,-0.021120222,-0.107166825,0.010562048,0.027878548,-0.072744435,-0.099876138,0.102296842,-0.040933921,-0.005584493,-0.106757251,-0.009717053,-0.140550772,-0.086039693,-0.024899054,0.132723208,0.055902646,-0.058213836,-0.169233232,0.159962635,-0.103095249,0.035613655
Avian Influenza Virus Glycoproteins Restrict Virus Replication and Spread through Human Airway Epithelium at Temperatures of the Proximal Airways,"Transmission of avian influenza viruses from bird to human is a rare event even though avian influenza viruses infect the ciliated epithelium of human airways in vitro and ex vivo. Using an in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium (HAE), we demonstrate that while human and avian influenza viruses efficiently infect at temperatures of the human distal airways (37°C), avian, but not human, influenza viruses are restricted for infection at the cooler temperatures of the human proximal airways (32°C). These data support the hypothesis that avian influenza viruses, ordinarily adapted to the temperature of the avian enteric tract (40°C), rarely infect humans, in part due to differences in host airway regional temperatures. Previously, a critical residue at position 627 in the avian influenza virus polymerase subunit, PB2, was identified as conferring temperature-dependency in mammalian cells. Here, we use reverse genetics to show that avianization of residue 627 attenuates a human virus, but does not account for the different infection between 32°C and 37°C. To determine the mechanism of temperature restriction of avian influenza viruses in HAE at 32°C, we generated recombinant human influenza viruses in either the A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) or A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) genetic background that contained avian or avian-like glycoproteins. Two of these viruses, A/Victoria/3/75 with L226Q and S228G mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) from A/Chick/Italy/1347/99 and A/PR/8/34 containing the H7 and N1 from A/Chick/Italy/1347/99, exhibited temperature restriction approaching that of wholly avian influenza viruses. These data suggest that influenza viruses bearing avian or avian-like surface glycoproteins have a reduced capacity to establish productive infection at the temperature of the human proximal airways. This temperature restriction may limit zoonotic transmission of avian influenza viruses and suggests that adaptation of avian influenza viruses to efficient infection at 32°C may represent a critical evolutionary step enabling human-to-human transmission.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.039701415,-0.103755319,-0.026198691,0.176164753,0.055162076,0.309761555,-0.064208485,-0.010072525,-0.007307277,-0.018829814,-0.00730967,-0.0054135,0.037987429,0.029654608,0.008359445,0.021155342,-0.013235725,-0.043032739,-0.020413001,0.036585495,0.053750437,0.00014981,-0.024995751,0.088959821,-0.088659982,5.83E-05,-0.066036774,0.016648644,-0.010382056,-0.071780251
Rapid and High-Throughput pan-Orthopoxvirus Detection and Identification using PCR and Mass Spectrometry,"The genus Orthopoxvirus contains several species of related viruses, including the causative agent of smallpox (Variola virus). In addition to smallpox, several other members of the genus are capable of causing human infection, including monkeypox, cowpox, and other zoonotic rodent-borne poxviruses. Therefore, a single assay that can accurately identify all orthopoxviruses could provide a valuable tool for rapid broad orthopovirus identification. We have developed a pan-Orthopoxvirus assay for identification of all members of the genus based on four PCR reactions targeting Orthopoxvirus DNA and RNA helicase and polymerase genes. The amplicons are detected using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) on the Ibis T5000 system. We demonstrate that the assay can detect and identify a diverse collection of orthopoxviruses, provide sub-species information and characterize viruses from the blood of rabbitpox infected rabbits.

RNA viruses in community-acquired childhood pneumonia in semi-urban Nepal; a cross-sectional study,"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is among the main causes of illness and death in children <5 years of age. There is a need to better describe the epidemiology of viral community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in developing countries. METHODS: From July 2004 to June 2007, we examined nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from 2,230 cases of pneumonia (World Health Organization criteria) in children 2 to 35 months old recruited in a randomized trial of zinc supplementation at a field clinic in Bhaktapur, Nepal. The specimens were examined for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus type A (InfA) and B (InfB), parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3 (PIV1, PIV2, and PIV3), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) using a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. RESULTS: We identified 919 virus isolates in 887 (40.0%) of the 2,219 NPA specimens with a valid PCR result, of which 334 (15.1%) yielded RSV, 164 (7.4%) InfA, 129 (5.8%) PIV3, 98 (4.4%) PIV1, 93 (4.2%) hMPV, 84 (3.8%) InfB, and 17 (0.8%) PIV2. CAP occurred in an epidemic pattern with substantial temporal variation during the three years of study. The largest peaks of pneumonia occurrence coincided with peaks of RSV infection, which occurred in epidemics during the rainy season and in winter. The monthly number of RSV infections was positively correlated with relative humidity (r(s )= 0.40, P = 0.01), but not with temperature or rainfall. An hMPV epidemic occurred during one of the three winter seasons and the monthly number of hMPV cases was also associated with relative humidity (r(s )= 0.55, P = 0.0005). CONCLUSION: Respiratory RNA viruses were detected from NPA in 40% of CAP cases in our study. The most commonly isolated viruses were RSV, InfA, and PIV3. RSV infections contributed substantially to the observed CAP epidemics. The occurrence of viral CAP in this community seemed to reflect more or less overlapping micro-epidemics with several respiratory viruses, highlighting the challenges of developing and implementing effective public health control measures.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.212063286,-0.124961532,-0.077140783,0.089328561,0.025563809,-0.079197539,0.012532015,-0.067718243,0.062386998,-0.027338737,0.008170963,-0.070495107,-0.111136184,-0.049752185,-0.104190729,-0.067393998,-0.044415092,0.129957926,-0.121072152,0.092394951,0.042661414,0.088304953,0.131981365,-0.029295721,0.066102182,-0.093997363,0.071738949,0.067870941,0.047574768,0.002857841
Reverse genetic characterization of the natural genomic deletion in SARS-Coronavirus strain Frankfurt-1 open reading frame 7b reveals an attenuating function of the 7b protein in-vitro and in-vivo,"During the outbreak of SARS in 2002/3, a prototype virus was isolated from a patient in Frankfurt/Germany (strain Frankfurt-1). As opposed to all other SARS-Coronavirus strains, Frankfurt-1 has a 45-nucleotide deletion in the transmembrane domain of its ORF 7b protein. When over-expressed in HEK 293 cells, the full-length protein but not the variant with the deletion caused interferon beta induction and cleavage of procaspase 3. To study the role of ORF 7b in the context of virus replication, we cloned a full genome cDNA copy of Frankfurt-1 in a bacterial artificial chromosome downstream of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Transfection of capped RNA transcribed from this construct yielded infectious virus that was indistinguishable from the original virus isolate. The presumed Frankfurt-1 ancestor with an intact ORF 7b was reconstructed. In CaCo-2 and HUH7 cells, but not in Vero cells, the variant carrying the ORF 7b deletion had a replicative advantage against the parental virus (4- and 6-fold increase of virus RNA in supernatant, respectively). This effect was neither associated with changes in the induction or secretion of type I interferon, nor with altered induction of apoptosis in cell culture. However, pretreatment of cells with interferon beta caused the deleted virus to replicate to higher titers than the parental strain (3.4-fold in Vero cells, 7.9-fold in CaCo-2 cells). In Syrian Golden Hamsters inoculated intranasally with 10e4 plaque forming units of either virus, mean titers of infectious virus and viral RNA in the lungs after 24 h were increased 23- and 94.8-fold, respectively, with the deleted virus. This difference could explain earlier observations of enhanced virulence of Frankfurt-1 in Hamsters as compared to other SARS-Coronavirus reference strains and identifies the SARS-CoV 7b protein as an attenuating factor with the SARS-Coronavirus genome. Because attenuation was focused on the early phase of infection in-vivo, ORF 7b might have contributed to the delayed accumulation of virus in patients that was suggested to have limited the spread of the SARS epidemic.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.125477597,0.119174523,-0.118145267,-0.016859052,-0.014872782,0.001212267,-0.119520709,-0.16114446,-0.012545253,0.017014465,-0.029153634,-0.064234532,0.020574516,0.028765449,0.050123307,-0.017302009,-0.006301308,-0.018150433,0.033506618,0.078641536,0.028671804,0.000922101,0.039021731,0.03731546,-0.015769959,0.033208059,0.036482146,-0.014014369,-0.119569064,0.015849495
Increased ATP generation in the host cell is required for efficient vaccinia virus production,"To search for cellular genes up-regulated by vaccinia virus (VV) infection, differential display-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (ddRT-PCR) assays were used to examine the expression of mRNAs from mock-infected and VV-infected HeLa cells. Two mitochondrial genes for proteins that are part of the electron transport chain that generates ATP, ND4 and CO II, were up-regulated after VV infection. Up-regulation of ND4 level by VV infection was confirmed by Western blotting analysis. Up-regulation of ND4 was reduced by the MAPK inhibitor, apigenin, which has been demonstrated elsewhere to inhibit VV replication. The induction of ND4 expression occurred after viral DNA replication since ara C, an inhibitor of poxviral DNA replication, could block this induction. ATP production was increased in the host cells after VV infection. Moreover, 4.5 μM oligomycin, an inhibitor of ATP production, reduced the ATP level 13 hr after virus infection to that of mock-infected cells and inhibited viral protein expression and virus production, suggesting that increased ATP production is required for efficient VV production. Our results further suggest that induction of ND4 expression is through a Bcl-2 independent pathway.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.112870141,-0.05012067,-0.015410584,-0.076352434,-0.122679869,0.047546829,0.020676467,-0.053716667,0.088336565,-0.019207413,-0.04285756,-0.081841377,-0.004428144,0.164105933,0.001638897,0.022429524,-0.00178133,-0.05932673,-0.00583652,0.00641907,0.010971078,0.032741493,0.016185788,-0.012036129,-0.005768613,-0.014867714,0.003885331,0.028881813,-0.033644813,0.005862362
Development of a fluorescent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection of Goose parvovirus in vivo,"BACKGROUND: Goose parvovirus (GPV) is a Dependovirus associated with latent infection and mortality in geese. Currently, it severely affects geese production worldwide. The objective of this study was to develop a fluorescent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (FQ-PCR) assay for fast and accurate quantification of GPV DNA in infected goslings, which can aid in the understanding of the regular distribution pattern and the nosogenesis of GPV in vivo. RESULTS: The detection limit of the assay was 2.8 × 10(1 )standard DNA copies, with a sensitivity of 3 logs higher than that of the conventional gel-based PCR assay targeting the same gene. The real-time PCR was reproducible, as shown by satisfactory low intraassay and interassay coefficients of variation.

"Genetics, Recombination and Clinical Features of Human Rhinovirus Species C (HRV-C) Infections; Interactions of HRV-C with Other Respiratory Viruses","To estimate the frequency, molecular epidemiological and clinical associations of infection with the newly described species C variants of human rhinoviruses (HRV), 3243 diagnostic respiratory samples referred for diagnostic testing in Edinburgh were screened using a VP4-encoding region-based selective polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HRV-C along with parallel PCR testing for 13 other respiratory viruses. HRV-C was the third most frequently detected behind respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus, with 141 infection episodes detected among 1885 subjects over 13 months (7.5%). Infections predominantly targeted the very young (median age 6–12 months; 80% of infections in those <2 years), occurred throughout the year but with peak incidence in early winter months. HRV-C was detected significantly more frequently among subjects with lower (LRT) and upper respiratory tract (URT) disease than controls without respiratory symptoms; HRV-C mono-infections were the second most frequently detected virus (behind RSV) in both disease presentations (6.9% and 7.8% of all cases respectively). HRV variants were classified by VP4/VP2 sequencing into 39 genotypically defined types, increasing the current total worldwide to 60. Through sequence comparisons of the 5′untranslated region (5′UTR), the majority grouped with species A (n = 96; 68%, described as HRV-Ca), the remainder forming a phylogenetically distinct 5′UTR group (HRV-Cc). Multiple and bidirectional recombination events between HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc variants and with HRV species A represents the most parsimonious explanation for their interspersed phylogeny relationships in the VP4/VP2-encoding region. No difference in age distribution, seasonality or disease associations was identified between HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc variants. HRV-C-infected subjects showed markedly reduced detection frequencies of RSV and other respiratory viruses, providing evidence for a major interfering effect of HRV-C on susceptibility to other respiratory virus infections. HRV-C's disease associations, its prevalence and evidence for interfering effects on other respiratory viruses mandates incorporation of rhinoviruses into future diagnostic virology screening.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.129646894,-0.091567804,-0.039626281,-0.011809689,0.070668155,-0.078280754,0.083719671,-0.04978635,0.063810013,0.013939466,0.007125499,-0.051613936,-0.027699923,-0.026695375,0.036513721,0.006326854,-0.016846992,-0.024783861,0.081620487,-0.078869158,0.038835294,-0.197398236,-0.115823703,0.13529552,-0.101306914,0.148108086,-0.092777849,0.012276272,0.133469557,0.321774302
"Single Assay for Simultaneous Detection and Differential Identification of Human and Avian Influenza Virus Types, Subtypes, and Emergent Variants","For more than four decades the cause of most type A influenza virus infections of humans has been attributed to only two viral subtypes, A/H1N1 or A/H3N2. In contrast, avian and other vertebrate species are a reservoir of type A influenza virus genome diversity, hosting strains representing at least 120 of 144 combinations of 16 viral hemagglutinin and 9 viral neuraminidase subtypes. Viral genome segment reassortments and mutations emerging within this reservoir may spawn new influenza virus strains as imminent epidemic or pandemic threats to human health and poultry production. Traditional methods to detect and differentiate influenza virus subtypes are either time-consuming and labor-intensive (culture-based) or remarkably insensitive (antibody-based). Molecular diagnostic assays based upon reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have short assay cycle time, and high analytical sensitivity and specificity. However, none of these diagnostic tests determine viral gene nucleotide sequences to distinguish strains and variants of a detected pathogen from one specimen to the next. Decision-quality, strain- and variant-specific pathogen gene sequence information may be critical for public health, infection control, surveillance, epidemiology, or medical/veterinary treatment planning. The Resequencing Pathogen Microarray (RPM-Flu) is a robust, highly multiplexed and target gene sequencing-based alternative to both traditional culture- or biomarker-based diagnostic tests. RPM-Flu is a single, simultaneous differential diagnostic assay for all subtype combinations of type A influenza viruses and for 30 other viral and bacterial pathogens that may cause influenza-like illness. These other pathogen targets of RPM-Flu may co-infect and compound the morbidity and/or mortality of patients with influenza. The informative specificity of a single RPM-Flu test represents specimen-specific viral gene sequences as determinants of virus type, A/HN subtype, virulence, host-range, and resistance to antiviral agents.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.069407296,-0.043800704,0.091144512,0.180570139,0.008742811,0.249561713,-0.084893511,0.001337482,-0.029579044,0.049944921,-0.03057811,-0.033182841,0.083219342,-0.029711861,0.006718157,-0.071412619,-0.03207721,0.023864909,-0.039178572,0.009875283,0.055728615,0.01780527,0.024442214,0.046683246,-0.029853016,-0.029227877,0.053005941,-0.043666005,-0.008360476,0.088729185
Descriptive distribution and phylogenetic analysis of feline infectious peritonitis virus isolates of Malaysia,"The descriptive distribution and phylogeny of feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) were studied in cats suspected of having feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in Malaysia. Ascitic fluids and/or biopsy samples were subjected to a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeted for a conserved region of 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of the FCoV genome. Eighty nine percent of the sampled animals were positive for the presence of FCoV. Among the FCoV positive cats, 80% of cats were males and 64% were below 2 years of age. The FCoV positive cases included 56% domestic short hair (DSH), 40% Persian, and 4% Siamese cats. The nucleotide sequences of 10 selected amplified products from FIP cases were determined. The sequence comparison revealed that the field isolates had 96% homology with a few point mutations. The extent of homology decreased to 93% when compared with reference strains. The overall branching pattern of phylogenetic tree showed two distinct clusters, where all Malaysian isolates fall into one main genetic cluster. These findings provided the first genetic information of FCoV in Malaysia.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.027582462,0.005591397,0.089906738,-0.176275569,0.120977224,0.024210955,-0.019715437,0.00660196,-0.061078721,-0.153156228,0.4245505,-0.097182803,0.196050678,-0.070261326,-0.133800154,-0.065683119,0.045915651,0.027369315,-0.011984737,0.071662029,-0.020856254,-0.000515155,0.018166202,0.059383222,-0.058484715,0.037331693,0.022111128,0.072968461,0.021855415,0.003890621
High-level expression and purification of soluble recombinant FGF21 protein by SUMO fusion in Escherichia coli,"BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a promising drug candidate to combat metabolic diseases. However, high-level expression and purification of recombinant FGF21 (rFGF21) in Escherichia coli (E. coli) is difficult because rFGF21 forms inclusion bodies in the bacteria making it difficult to purify and obtain high concentrations of bioactive rFGF21. To overcome this problem, we fused the FGF21 with SUMO (Small ubiquitin-related modifier) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and expressed the fused gene in E. coli BL21(DE3). RESULTS: By inducing with IPTG, SUMO-FGF21 was expressed at a high level. Its concentration reached 30% of total protein, and exceeded 95% of all soluble proteins. The fused protein was purified by DEAE sepharose FF and Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Once cleaved by the SUMO protease, the purity of rFGF21 by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was shown to be higher than 96% with low endotoxin level (<1.0 EU/ml). The results of in vivo animal experiments showed that rFGF21 produced by using this method, could decrease the concentration of plasma glucose in diabetic rats by streptozotocin (STZ) injection. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that SUMO, when fused with FGF21, was able to promote its soluble expression of the latter in E. coli, making it more convenient to purify rFGF21 than previously. This may be a better method to produce rFGF21 for pharmaceutical research and development.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.065673564,-0.019349586,0.037449425,-0.082796085,-0.062829207,0.025804271,0.015785389,-0.036209094,0.032323891,-0.025674624,-0.060408476,-0.001198504,-0.012634279,-0.005192138,-0.046893131,-0.022302241,0.014703547,-0.030050132,0.005492412,-0.049423035,-0.01618115,0.007801707,0.043434988,-0.006215473,0.003443724,0.029207423,0.018892477,-0.043480988,-0.00496983,0.005566609
"Secondary Syphilis in Cali, Colombia: New Concepts in Disease Pathogenesis","Venereal syphilis is a multi-stage, sexually transmitted disease caused by the spirochetal bacterium Treponema pallidum (Tp). Herein we describe a cohort of 57 patients (age 18–68 years) with secondary syphilis (SS) identified through a network of public sector primary health care providers in Cali, Colombia. To be eligible for participation, study subjects were required to have cutaneous lesions consistent with SS, a reactive Rapid Plasma Reagin test (RPR-titer ≥1∶4), and a confirmatory treponemal test (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption test- FTA-ABS). Most subjects enrolled were women (64.9%), predominantly Afro-Colombian (38.6%) or mestizo (56.1%), and all were of low socio-economic status. Three (5.3%) subjects were newly diagnosed with HIV infection at study entry. The duration of signs and symptoms in most patients (53.6%) was less than 30 days; however, some patients reported being symptomatic for several months (range 5–240 days). The typical palmar and plantar exanthem of SS was the most common dermal manifestation (63%), followed by diffuse hypo- or hyperpigmented macules and papules on the trunk, abdomen and extremities. Three patients had patchy alopecia. Whole blood (WB) samples and punch biopsy material from a subset of SS patients were assayed for the presence of Tp DNA polymerase I gene (polA) target by real-time qualitative and quantitative PCR methods. Twelve (46%) of the 26 WB samples studied had quantifiable Tp DNA (ranging between 194.9 and 1954.2 Tp polA copies/ml blood) and seven (64%) were positive when WB DNA was extracted within 24 hours of collection. Tp DNA was also present in 8/12 (66%) skin biopsies available for testing. Strain typing analysis was attempted in all skin and WB samples with detectable Tp DNA. Using arp repeat size analysis and tpr RFLP patterns four different strain types were identified (14d, 16d, 13d and 22a). None of the WB samples had sufficient DNA for typing. The clinical and microbiologic observations presented herein, together with recent Cali syphilis seroprevalence data, provide additional evidence that venereal syphilis is highly endemic in this region of Colombia, thus underscoring the need for health care providers in the region to be acutely aware of the clinical manifestations of SS. This study also provides, for the first time, quantitative evidence that a significant proportion of untreated SS patients have substantial numbers of circulating spirochetes. How Tp is able to persist in the blood and skin of SS patients, despite the known presence of circulating treponemal opsonizing antibodies and the robust pro-inflammatory cellular immune responses characteristic of this stage of the disease, is not fully understood and requires further study.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.068083086,0.000816223,0.019761466,-0.110177148,-0.036767803,-0.008566057,-0.015990874,0.041889778,-0.069675764,0.013683435,-0.003973912,0.016370403,0.003862891,0.005795288,-0.030977096,0.007046437,-0.015114638,-9.80E-05,0.012268604,-0.010105732,0.029443833,-0.037797916,-0.020062737,-0.025429064,-0.024816797,-0.034621808,-0.017954498,0.025222517,-0.017850075,0.044604563
Collection by trained pediatricians or parents of mid-turbinate nasal flocked swabs for the detection of influenza viruses in childhood,"This study evaluated the efficiency of pediatric mid-turbinate nasal flocked swabs used by parents in 203 children aged 6 months to 5 years with signs and symptoms of respiratory disease. Two nasal samples were collected from each child in a randomised sequence: one by a trained pediatrician and one by a parent. The real-time polymerase chain reaction influenza virus detection rates were similar in the samples collected using the two methods (Cohen's kappa = 0.86), as were the cycle threshold values. In comparison with the pediatrician-collected samples, the sensitivity and specificity of the parental collections were respectively 89.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 77.8-100%) and 97.7% (95% CI: 95.5-100%), and the positive and negative predictive values were respectively 86.2% (95% CI: 73.7-95.1%) and 98.2% (95% CI: 96.4-100%). The children were significantly more satisfied with the parental collections (median values ± standard deviation, 1.59 ± 0.55 vs 3.51 ± 0.36; p < 0.0001). These findings show that mid-turbinate nasal flocked swabs specifically designed for infants and children can be used by parents without reducing the influenza virus detection rate. Moreover, the direct involvement of parents significantly increases patient acceptance, thus simplifying collection and suggesting that this novel swab design should be considered for epidemiological surveys and vaccine efficacy studies.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.15339147,-0.063605043,0.018316098,-0.006357764,0.023295902,0.002707125,-0.036460164,-0.044324379,-0.015839049,-0.120134882,0.037422648,0.061430646,-0.111335196,-0.091616717,-0.043774269,0.101647645,-0.092901859,-0.126621239,0.098174243,-0.102817532,-0.193390098,0.079556924,0.04449129,0.050328088,0.015811163,-0.016205889,-0.010266418,-0.215333519,-0.081512674,-0.064563392
A multiplex reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction for detection and differentiation of wild-type and vaccine strains of canine distemper virus,"A multiplex reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) method was developed for the detection and differentiation of wild-type and vaccine strains of canine distemper virus (CDV). A pair of primers (P1 and P4) specific for CDV corresponding to the highly conserved region of the CDV genome were used as a common primer pair in the first-round PCR of the nested PCR. Primers P2 specific for CDV wild-type strains, were used as the forward primer together with the common reverse primer P4 in the second round of nested PCR. Primers P3, P5 specific for CDV wild-type strain or vaccine strain, were used as the forward primer together with the common reverse primer P4+P6 in the second round of nested PCR. A fragment of 177 bp was amplified from vaccine strain genomic RNA, and a fragment of 247 bp from wild-type strain genomic RNA in the RT-nPCR, and two fragments of 247 bp and 177 bp were amplified from the mixed samples of vaccine and wild-type strains. No amplification was achieved for uninfected cells, or cells infected with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), canine parvovirus (CPV), canine coronavirus (CCV), rabies virus (RV), or canine adenovirus (CAV). The RT-nPCR method was used to detect 30 field samples suspected of canine distemper from Heilongjiang and Jilin Provinces, and 51 samples in Shandong province. As a result of 30 samples, were found to be wild-type-like, and 5 to be vaccine-strain-like. The RT-nPCR method can be used to effectively detect and differentiate wild-type CDV-infected dogs from dogs vaccinated with CDV vaccine, and thus can be used in clinical detection and epidemiological surveillance.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.031262489,0.037986609,0.199769375,-0.005458717,0.092717296,0.001678064,-0.06635091,-0.045899023,-0.011424406,0.007890753,0.06642783,0.060394931,-0.060038817,0.007970366,0.058112128,-0.041243725,-0.018287736,-0.039389596,0.063406343,-0.00316547,0.248198524,0.13742169,-0.057073751,0.070067097,0.237690266,-0.121233482,-0.062820943,-0.007759122,-0.085894259,0.120496504
An emerging recombinant human enterovirus 71 responsible for the 2008 outbreak of Hand Foot and Mouth Disease in Fuyang city of China,"Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), a common contagious disease that usually affects children, is normally mild but can have life-threatening manifestations. It can be caused by enteroviruses, particularly Coxsackieviruses and human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) with highly variable clinical manifestations. In the spring of 2008, a large, unprecedented HFMD outbreak in Fuyang city of Anhui province in the central part of southeastern China resulted in a high aggregation of fatal cases. In this study, epidemiologic and clinical investigations, laboratory testing, and genetic analyses were performed to identify the causal pathogen of the outbreak. Of the 6,049 cases reported between 1 March and 9 May of 2008, 3023 (50%) were hospitalized, 353 (5.8%) were severe and 22 (0.36%) were fatal. HEV71 was confirmed as the etiological pathogen of the outbreak. Phylogenetic analyses of entire VP1 capsid protein sequence of 45 Fuyang HEV71 isolates showed that they belong to C4a cluster of the C4 subgenotype. In addition, genetic recombinations were found in the 3D region (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a major component of the viral replication complex of the genome) between the Fuyang HEV71 strain and Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), resulting in a recombination virus. In conclusion, an emerging recombinant HEV71 was responsible for the HFMD outbreak in Fuyang City of China, 2008.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.023192342,-0.012060309,-0.0452771,-0.027777334,0.038088868,0.004188961,0.005811841,0.010042595,-0.010976563,0.031599263,0.015665006,0.039373583,-0.012686918,-0.066698281,0.016316644,-0.020449445,-0.056541804,0.055112194,-0.044112752,0.020180637,0.037294572,0.067035797,-0.075175045,-0.000445462,-0.039123798,0.058502561,0.03058725,0.093404817,-0.048261233,0.017084326
A duplex real-time RT-PCR assay for detecting H5N1 avian influenza virus and pandemic H1N1 influenza virus,"A duplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was improved for simultaneous detection of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus and pandemic H1N1 (2009) influenza virus, which is suitable for early diagnosis of influenza-like patients and for epidemiological surveillance. The sensitivity of this duplex real-time RT-PCR assay was 0.02 TCID(50 )(50% tissue culture infective dose) for H5N1 and 0.2 TCID(50 )for the pandemic H1N1, which was the same as that of each single-target RT-PCR for pandemic H1N1 and even more sensitive for H5N1 with the same primers and probes. No cross reactivity of detecting other subtype influenza viruses or respiratory tract viruses was observed. Two hundred and thirty-six clinical specimens were tested by comparing with single real-time RT-PCR and result from the duplex assay was 100% consistent with the results of single real-time RT-PCR and sequence analysis.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.147796862,0.052805489,0.227423286,0.231623152,-0.015545262,0.154649665,-0.146876878,-0.000147898,-0.052009452,-0.095021415,0.015374318,0.02578318,-0.011154016,0.118660244,-0.015273725,-0.019934664,0.082899518,0.017198969,-0.005517968,-0.085464932,0.06072519,0.032110086,-0.012167616,0.011553657,-0.08791824,0.060931631,0.04812106,-0.01593242,0.079038904,0.001702079
Up-regulation of p21 and TNF-α is mediated in lycorine-induced death of HL-60 cells,"BACKGROUND: Leukemia is one of the most life-threatening cancers today, and acute promyelogenous leukemia (APL) is a common type of leukemia. Many natural compounds have already been found to exhibit significant anti-tumor effects. Lycorine, a natural alkaloid extracted from Amaryllidaceae, exhibited anti-leukemia effects in vitro and in vivo. The survival rate of HL-60 cells exposed to lycorine was decreased, cell growth was slowed down, and cell regeneration potential was inhibited. HL-60 cells exhibited typical apoptotic characteristic. Lycorine can suppress leukemia growth and reduce cell survival and inducing apoptosis of tumor cells. The purpose of this work is to elucidate the mechanism by which lycorine induces APL cells. RESULTS: When HL-60 cells were treated with different concentration of lycorine, the expression of p21 and TNF-α was up-regulated in a concentration-dependent manner as shown by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Lycorine also down-regulated p21-related gene expression, including Cdc2, Cyclin B, Cdk2 and Cyclin E, promoted Bid truncation, decreased IκB phosphorylation and blocked NF-κB nuclear import. Cytochrome c was released from mitochondria as observed with confocal laser microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: The TNF-α signal transduction pathway and p21-mediated cell-cycle inhibition were involved in the apoptosis of HL-60 cells induced by lycorine.

Diagnostic Methods for Feline Coronavirus: A Review,"Feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) are found throughout the world. Infection with FCoV can result in a diverse range of signs from clinically inapparent infections to a highly fatal disease called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). FIP is one of the most serious viral diseases of cats. While there is neither an effective vaccine, nor a curative treatment for FIP, a diagnostic protocol for FCoV would greatly assist in the management and control of the virus. Clinical findings in FIP are non-specific and not helpful in making a differential diagnosis. Haematological and biochemical abnormalities in FIP cases are also non-specific. The currently available serological tests have low specificity and sensitivity for detection of active infection and cross-react with FCoV strains of low pathogenicity, the feline enteric coronaviruses (FECV). Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used to detect FCoV and is rapid and sensitive, but results must be interpreted in the context of clinical findings. At present, a definitive diagnosis of FIP can be established only by histopathological examination of biopsies. This paper describes and compares diagnostic methods for FCoVs and includes a brief account of the virus biology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.014605787,0.036209715,0.129287275,-0.099909641,-0.007477152,0.035348312,0.048027374,0.001128032,-0.028597546,-0.074617373,0.347910008,-0.120430029,0.239161595,-0.068045991,-0.102978862,-0.040142444,0.034011327,0.050981241,-0.045689504,0.076205699,-0.037464693,-0.027702042,0.029065312,0.007801797,0.016960857,0.029764802,0.002715385,0.00342774,0.003684384,-0.010232179
Ambient Influenza and Avian Influenza Virus during Dust Storm Days and Background Days,"BACKGROUND: The spread of influenza and highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) presents a significant threat to human health. Avian influenza outbreaks in downwind areas of Asian dust storms (ADS) suggest that viruses might be transported by dust storms. OBJECTIVES: We developed a technique to measure ambient influenza and avian influenza viruses. We then used this technique to measure concentrations of these viruses on ADS days and background days, and to assess the relationships between ambient influenza and avian influenza viruses, and air pollutants. METHODS: A high-volume air sampler was used in parallel with a filter cassette to evaluate spiked samples and unspiked samples. Then, air samples were monitored during ADS seasons using a filter cassette coupled with a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay. Air samples were monitored during ADS season (1 January to 31 May 2006). RESULTS: We successfully quantified ambient influenza virus using the filtration/real-time qPCR method during ADS days and background days. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the concentration of influenza virus in ambient air. In both the spiked and unspiked samples, the concentration of influenza virus sampled using the filter cassette was higher than that using the high-volume sampler. The concentration of ambient influenza A virus was significantly higher during the ADS days than during the background days.

Zn(2+) Inhibits Coronavirus and Arterivirus RNA Polymerase Activity In Vitro and Zinc Ionophores Block the Replication of These Viruses in Cell Culture,"Increasing the intracellular Zn(2+) concentration with zinc-ionophores like pyrithione (PT) can efficiently impair the replication of a variety of RNA viruses, including poliovirus and influenza virus. For some viruses this effect has been attributed to interference with viral polyprotein processing. In this study we demonstrate that the combination of Zn(2+) and PT at low concentrations (2 µM Zn(2+) and 2 µM PT) inhibits the replication of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and equine arteritis virus (EAV) in cell culture. The RNA synthesis of these two distantly related nidoviruses is catalyzed by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is the core enzyme of their multiprotein replication and transcription complex (RTC). Using an activity assay for RTCs isolated from cells infected with SARS-CoV or EAV—thus eliminating the need for PT to transport Zn(2+) across the plasma membrane—we show that Zn(2+) efficiently inhibits the RNA-synthesizing activity of the RTCs of both viruses. Enzymatic studies using recombinant RdRps (SARS-CoV nsp12 and EAV nsp9) purified from E. coli subsequently revealed that Zn(2+) directly inhibited the in vitro activity of both nidovirus polymerases. More specifically, Zn(2+) was found to block the initiation step of EAV RNA synthesis, whereas in the case of the SARS-CoV RdRp elongation was inhibited and template binding reduced. By chelating Zn(2+) with MgEDTA, the inhibitory effect of the divalent cation could be reversed, which provides a novel experimental tool for in vitro studies of the molecular details of nidovirus replication and transcription.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.149638985,0.151756661,-0.145151032,0.107533416,-0.070914184,-0.005815926,0.004155757,-0.077937206,-0.024897883,-0.00361311,0.057591327,0.035058222,-0.046896682,0.01356441,-0.002860652,0.010642032,0.029278243,-0.048456899,0.019452359,-0.006855644,-0.008789308,0.011404224,0.046249441,-0.022494495,0.012643193,0.020729725,-0.043729941,0.024716461,-0.016791373,0.008453598
Antiviral Lead Compounds from Marine Sponges,"Marine sponges are currently one of the richest sources of pharmacologically active compounds found in the marine environment. These bioactive molecules are often secondary metabolites, whose main function is to enable and/or modulate cellular communication and defense. They are usually produced by functional enzyme clusters in sponges and/or their associated symbiotic microorganisms. Natural product lead compounds from sponges have often been found to be promising pharmaceutical agents. Several of them have successfully been approved as antiviral agents for clinical use or have been advanced to the late stages of clinical trials. Most of these drugs are used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). The most important antiviral lead of marine origin reported thus far is nucleoside Ara-A (vidarabine) isolated from sponge Tethya crypta. It inhibits viral DNA polymerase and DNA synthesis of herpes, vaccinica and varicella zoster viruses. However due to the discovery of new types of viruses and emergence of drug resistant strains, it is necessary to develop new antiviral lead compounds continuously. Several sponge derived antiviral lead compounds which are hopedto be developed as future drugs are discussed in this review. Supply problems are usually the major bottleneck to the development of these compounds as drugs during clinical trials. However advances in the field of metagenomics and high throughput microbial cultivation has raised the possibility that these techniques could lead to the cost-effective large scale production of such compounds. Perspectives on biotechnological methods with respect to marine drug development are also discussed.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.060196898,-0.025605253,0.006510136,0.016224432,-0.133373768,0.116510695,0.125524989,-0.004702677,0.043809502,0.091481149,-0.007157439,0.037804626,0.068982564,-0.074672084,0.015808555,-0.014276024,-0.059441101,0.162738365,0.049470382,0.037469345,-0.017465929,0.025817062,-0.056791757,0.07842361,0.045098745,-0.003625767,0.048203957,-0.057842166,0.08862654,0.045367926
Flocked nasal swab versus nasopharyngeal aspirate for detection of respiratory tract viruses in immunocompromised adults: a matched comparative study,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have compared nasal swabs to the more invasive nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) for detection of respiratory viruses. Mostly, the comparisons have been performed on immunocompetent children with upper respiratory tract symptoms. The results range from a relatively poor sensitivity for the swabs to an even higher sensitivity than for the NPA. We aimed to investigate the sensitivity of a flocked nasal swab (fNS) on immunocompromised adults with febrile neutropenia. METHODS: During 16 months, adults with a hematological disorder presenting with febrile neutropenia were enrolled in the study. Paired samples of the fNS and NPA were collected in the outer part of the nasal cavity and the nasopharynx, respectively. The samples were analyzed regarding a panel of 15 respiratory viruses by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, as an indirect measure of cell yield by either method, the copy number of the human beta actin gene was also determined. Cohen's kappa was calculated as a measure of agreement of the results obtained from either method. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for comparison of cell yield. RESULTS: A total of 98 paired samples from a total of 89 patients were collected. Twenty of the pairs had virus detected in at least one of the specimens; 11 in both, 7 in NPA only, and 2 in fNS only. For the fNS, the overall sensitivity for any virus and for rhinovirus only was 65% and 78%, respectively. NPA was significantly superior to the fNS in collecting epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: We found the overall sensitivity of 65% to be too low to replace NPA with this sampling technique in this patient category.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.133844685,-0.031851106,0.033619995,-0.015737307,0.0059079,-0.061792415,0.011272103,-0.019890879,-0.005566504,0.002017367,-0.015453268,-0.018318027,-0.020665842,0.01745882,0.024774416,-0.005440349,-0.003698284,-0.076066462,0.063279258,-0.068401761,-0.018101575,-0.040214999,0.019562908,-0.000613062,0.01964008,0.035005939,-0.027811192,0.020298755,-0.045531786,-0.062607597
Are there any differences in clinical and laboratory findings on admission between H1N1 positive and negative patients with flu-like symptoms?,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization alert for the H1N1 influenza pandemic led to the implementation of certain measures regarding admission of patients with flu-like symptoms. All these instructions were adopted by the Greek National Health System. The aim of this study was to retrospectively examine the characteristics of all subjects admitted to the Unit of Infectious Diseases with symptoms indicating H1N1 infection, and to identify any differences between H1N1 positive or negative patients. Patients from the ED (emergency department) with flu-like symptoms (sore throat, cough, rhinorhea, or nasal congestion) and fever >37.5°C were admitted in the Unit of Infectious diseases and gave pharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs. Swabs were tested with real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR). FINDINGS: Patients were divided into two groups. Group A comprised 33 H1N1 positive patients and Group B (control group) comprised of 27 H1N1 negative patients. The two groups did not differ in terms of patient age, co-morbidities, length of hospitalization, temperature elevation, hypoxemia, as well as renal and liver function. There were also no significant differences in severity on admission. C-reactive protein (CRP) (mean 12.8 vs. 5.74) and white blood count (WBC) (mean 10.528 vs. 7.114) were significantly higher in group B than in group A upon admission. Obesity was noted in 8 patients of Group A (mean 31.67) and 14 patients of Group B (mean 37.78). Body mass index (BMI) was lower in H1N1 positive than in H1N1 negative patients (mean 31.67 vs. 37.78, respectively; p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients in both groups were young male adults. CRP, WBC and BMI were higher among H1N1 negative patients. Finally, clinical course of patients in both groups was mild and uneventful.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.193299931,-0.022688525,-0.08250286,-0.100724376,-0.047806323,0.035718606,-0.149394315,0.134408611,-0.207604029,-0.030335424,-0.021065893,0.055021052,-0.048698928,0.104084535,-0.07355086,0.005166422,0.037344687,0.068100212,-0.013289052,0.006381934,0.017192659,-0.097904229,-0.090946791,-0.071493438,-0.103404021,0.019966424,-0.007555934,-0.031958071,-0.060816118,0.058270445
"Viral Etiology of Influenza-Like Illnesses in Antananarivo, Madagascar, July 2008 to June 2009","BACKGROUND: In Madagascar, despite an influenza surveillance established since 1978, little is known about the etiology and prevalence of viruses other than influenza causing influenza-like illnesses (ILIs). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From July 2008 to June 2009, we collected respiratory specimens from patients who presented ILIs symptoms in public and private clinics in Antananarivo (the capital city of Madagascar). ILIs were defined as body temperature ≥38°C and cough and at least two of the following symptoms: sore throat, rhinorrhea, headache and muscular pain, for a maximum duration of 3 days. We screened these specimens using five multiplex real time Reverse Transcription and/or Polymerase Chain Reaction assays for detection of 14 respiratory viruses. We detected respiratory viruses in 235/313 (75.1%) samples. Overall influenza virus A (27.3%) was the most common virus followed by rhinovirus (24.8%), RSV (21.2%), adenovirus (6.1%), coronavirus OC43 (6.1%), influenza virus B (3.9%), parainfluenza virus-3 (2.9%), and parainfluenza virus-1 (2.3%). Co-infections occurred in 29.4% (69/235) of infected patients and rhinovirus was the most detected virus (27.5%). Children under 5 years were more likely to have one or more detectable virus associated with their ILI. In this age group, compared to those ≥5 years, the risk of detecting more than one virus was higher (OR = 1.9), as was the risk of detecting of RSV (OR = 10.1) and adenovirus (OR = 4.7). While rhinovirus and adenovirus infections occurred year round, RSV, influenza virus A and coronavirus OC43 had defined period of circulation. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we found that respiratory viruses play an important role in ILIs in the Malagasy community, particularly in children under 5 years old. These data provide a better understanding of the viral etiology of outpatients with ILI and describe for the first time importance of these viruses in different age group and their period of circulation.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.275951434,-0.152846561,-0.089580394,0.200717809,0.087230051,0.091441432,-0.053511974,-0.051758103,0.011644128,-0.057380405,0.008541813,-0.055465043,-0.006624497,0.005924332,0.018042941,-0.023779062,5.07E-05,-0.057559031,0.056630739,0.010918422,-0.007060705,-0.051614174,0.000261177,0.003512449,0.019883307,-0.019863147,0.076957117,0.100848236,-0.054742487,-0.025881341
Human Rhinovirus Infections in Rural Thailand: Epidemiological Evidence for Rhinovirus as Both Pathogen and Bystander,"BACKGROUND: We describe human rhinovirus (HRV) detections in SaKaeo province, Thailand. METHODS: From September 1, 2003–August 31, 2005, we tested hospitalized patients with acute lower respiratory illness and outpatient controls without fever or respiratory symptoms for HRVs with polymerase chain reaction and molecularly-typed select HRVs. We compared HRV detection among hospitalized patients and controls and estimated enrollment adjusted incidence. RESULTS: HRVs were detected in 315 (16%) of 1919 hospitalized patients and 27 (9.6%) of 280 controls. Children had the highest frequency of HRV detections (hospitalized: <1 year: 29%, 1–4 year: 29%, ≥65 years: 9%; controls: <1 year: 24%, 1–4 year: 14%, ≥65 years: 2.8%). Enrollment adjusted hospitalized HRV detection rates were highest among persons aged <1 year (1038/100,000 persons/year), 1–4 years (457), and ≥65 years (71). All three HRV species were identified, HRV-A was the most common species in most age groups including children aged <1 year (61%) and all adult age groups. HRV-C was the most common species in the 1–4 year (51%) and 5–19 year age groups (54%). Compared to controls, hospitalized adults (≥19 years) and children were more likely to have HRV detections (odds ratio [OR]: 4.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5, 15.8; OR: 2.0, CI: 1.2, 3.3, respectively) and hospitalized children were more likely to have HRV-A (OR 1.7, CI: 0.8, 3.5) or HVR-C (OR 2.7, CI: 1.2, 5.9) detection. CONCLUSIONS: HRV rates were high among hospitalized children and the elderly but asymptomatic children also had substantial HRV detection. HRV (all species), and HRV-A and HRV-C detections were epidemiologically-associated with hospitalized illness. Treatment or prevention modalities effective against HRV could reduce hospitalizations due to HRV in Thailand.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.176591296,-0.106746313,-0.083292832,-0.05652675,0.04200069,-0.092800059,0.062955103,-0.041784644,0.014468684,-0.065527171,-0.014101997,0.0213074,-0.088839222,-0.052141277,-0.026469107,0.078677948,-0.054957358,-0.038853315,0.07306941,-0.071087376,-0.074340117,-0.061443017,-0.076443739,0.145481787,-0.140057169,0.186234574,-0.149934001,-0.047505717,0.128993603,0.319680304
Murine immune responses to a Plasmodium vivax-derived chimeric recombinant protein expressed in Brassica napus,"BACKGROUND: To develop a plant-based vaccine against Plasmodium vivax, two P. vivax candidate proteins were chosen. First, the merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1), a major asexual blood stage antigen that is currently considered a strong vaccine candidate. Second, the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), a component of sporozoites that contains a B-cell epitope. METHODS: A synthetic chimeric recombinant 516 bp gene encoding containing PvMSP-1, a Pro-Gly linker motif, and PvCSP was synthesized; the gene, named MLC, encoded a total of 172 amino acids. The recombinant gene was modified with regard to codon usage to optimize gene expression in Brassica napus. The Ti plasmid inducible gene transfer system was used for MLC chimeric recombinant gene expression in B. napus. Gene expression was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), beta-glucuronidase reporter gene (GUS) assay, and Western blot. RESULTS: The MLC chimeric recombinant protein expressed in B. napus had a molecular weight of approximately 25 kDa. It exhibited a clinical sensitivity of 84.21% (n = 38) and a clinical specificity of 100% (n = 24) as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Oral immunization of BALB/c mice with MLC chimeric recombinant protein successfully induced antigen-specific IgG1 production. Additionally, the Th1-related cytokines IL-12 (p40), TNF, and IFN-γ were significantly increased in the spleens of the BALB/c mice. CONCLUSIONS: The chimeric MLC recombinant protein produced in B. napus has potential as both as an antigen for diagnosis and as a valuable vaccine candidate for oral immunization against vivax malaria.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.101299306,-0.01608411,0.062259925,-0.111528929,-0.027381868,0.028910677,-0.072997584,-0.065009168,0.089124063,-0.058094607,-0.129129283,-0.053208931,-0.003715412,0.011377095,-0.083753755,-0.081495283,0.051115317,-0.056962397,-0.001875945,-0.031849724,0.04783187,-0.025064945,0.096225807,0.009977078,-0.008722741,0.072126804,0.085477109,-0.038794325,-0.036492649,0.035569025
"Access to a polymerase chain reaction assay method targeting 13 respiratory viruses can reduce antibiotics: a randomised, controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Viral respiratory infections are common worldwide and range from completely benign disease to life-threatening illness. Symptoms can be unspecific, and an etiologic diagnosis is rarely established because of a lack of suitable diagnostic tools. Improper use of antibiotics is common in this setting, which is detrimental in light of the development of bacterial resistance. It has been suggested that the use of diagnostic tests could reduce antibiotic prescription rates. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether access to a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay panel for etiologic diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) would have an impact on antibiotic prescription rate in primary care clinical settings. METHODS: Adult patients with symptoms of ARTI were prospectively included. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were analysed by using a multiplex real-time PCR method targeting thirteen viruses and two bacteria. Patients were recruited at 12 outpatient units from October 2006 through April 2009, and samples were collected on the day of inclusion (initial visit) and after 10 days (follow-up visit). Patients were randomised in an open-label treatment protocol to receive a rapid or delayed result (on the following day or after eight to twelve days). The primary outcome measure was the antibiotic prescription rate at the initial visit, and the secondary outcome was the total antibiotic prescription rate during the study period. RESULTS: A total sample of 447 patients was randomised. Forty-one were excluded, leaving 406 patients for analysis. In the group of patients randomised for a rapid result, 4.5% (9 of 202) of patients received antibiotics at the initial visit, compared to 12.3% (25 of 204) (P = 0.005) of patients in the delayed result group. At follow-up, there was no significant difference between the groups: 13.9% (28 of 202) in the rapid result group and 17.2% (35 of 204) in the delayed result group (P = 0.359), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Access to a rapid method for etiologic diagnosis of ARTIs may reduce antibiotic prescription rates at the initial visit in an outpatient setting. To sustain this effect, however, it seems necessary to better define how to follow and manage the patient according to the result of the test, which warrants further investigation.

PCR Improves Diagnostic Yield from Lung Aspiration in Malawian Children with Radiologically Confirmed Pneumonia,"BACKGROUND: Accurate data on childhood pneumonia aetiology are essential especially from regions where mortality is high, in order to inform case-management guidelines and the potential of prevention strategies such as bacterial conjugate vaccines. Yield from blood culture is low, but lung aspirate culture provides a higher diagnostic yield. We aimed to determine if diagnostic yield could be increased further by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae b) and viruses in lung aspirate fluid. METHODS: A total of 95 children with radiological focal, lobar or segmental consolidation had lung aspirate performed and sent for bacterial culture and for PCR for detection of bacteria, viruses and Pneumocystis jirovecii. In children with a pneumococcal aetiology, pneumococcal bacterial loads were calculated in blood and lung aspirate fluid. RESULTS: Blood culture identified a bacterial pathogen in only 8 patients (8%). With the addition of PCR on lung aspirate samples, causative pathogens (bacterial, viral, pneumocystis) were identified singly or as co-infections in 59 children (62%). The commonest bacterial organism was S.pneumoniae (41%), followed by H. influenzae b (6%), and the commonest virus identified was adenovirus (16%), followed by human bocavirus (HBoV) (4%), either as single or co-infection. CONCLUSIONS: In a select group of African children, lung aspirate PCR significantly improves diagnostic yield. Our study confirms a major role of S.pneumoniae and viruses in the aetiology of childhood pneumonia in Africa.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.145751068,-0.060279008,0.003300859,-0.065754245,-0.036085743,-0.073248757,0.05567422,0.005574568,-0.085751528,0.088947778,-0.033776294,-0.058162554,0.008094992,-0.04899712,-0.007134802,-0.037570714,-0.022632737,-0.041050367,-0.040395128,-0.051835703,-0.042474313,0.177585764,0.151366556,0.031220686,0.000223847,0.041647465,-0.001795109,-0.02109839,0.049466389,-0.036391163
StralSV: assessment of sequence variability within similar 3D structures and application to polio RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,"BACKGROUND: Most of the currently used methods for protein function prediction rely on sequence-based comparisons between a query protein and those for which a functional annotation is provided. A serious limitation of sequence similarity-based approaches for identifying residue conservation among proteins is the low confidence in assigning residue-residue correspondences among proteins when the level of sequence identity between the compared proteins is poor. Multiple sequence alignment methods are more satisfactory--still, they cannot provide reliable results at low levels of sequence identity. Our goal in the current work was to develop an algorithm that could help overcome these difficulties by facilitating the identification of structurally (and possibly functionally) relevant residue-residue correspondences between compared protein structures. RESULTS: Here we present StralSV (structure-alignment sequence variability), a new algorithm for detecting closely related structure fragments and quantifying residue frequency from tight local structure alignments. We apply StralSV in a study of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of poliovirus, and we demonstrate that the algorithm can be used to determine regions of the protein that are relatively unique, or that share structural similarity with proteins that would be considered distantly related. By quantifying residue frequencies among many residue-residue pairs extracted from local structural alignments, one can infer potential structural or functional importance of specific residues that are determined to be highly conserved or that deviate from a consensus. We further demonstrate that considerable detailed structural and phylogenetic information can be derived from StralSV analyses. CONCLUSIONS: StralSV is a new structure-based algorithm for identifying and aligning structure fragments that have similarity to a reference protein. StralSV analysis can be used to quantify residue-residue correspondences and identify residues that may be of particular structural or functional importance, as well as unusual or unexpected residues at a given sequence position.

Interplay between SIN3A and STAT3 Mediates Chromatin Conformational Changes and GFAP Expression during Cellular Differentiation,"BACKGROUND: Neurons and astrocytes are generated from common neural precursors, yet neurogenesis precedes astrocyte formation during embryogenesis. The mechanisms of neural development underlying suppression and de-suppression of differentiation- related genes for cell fate specifications are not well understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By using an in vitro system in which NTera-2 cells were induced to differentiate into an astrocyte-like lineage, we revealed a novel role for Sin3A in maintaining the suppression of GFAP in NTera-2 cells. Sin3A coupled with MeCP2 bound to the GFAP promoter and their occupancies were correlated with repression of GFAP transcription. The repression by Sin3A and MeCP2 may be an essential mechanism underlying the inhibition of cell differentiation. Upon commitment toward an astrocyte-like lineage, Sin3A- MeCP2 departed from the promoter and activated STAT3 simultaneously bound to the promoter and exon 1 of GFAP; meanwhile, olig2 was exported from nuclei to the cytoplasm. This suggested that a three-dimensional or higher-order structure was provoked by STAT3 binding between the promoter and proximal coding regions. STAT3 then recruited CBP/p300 to exon 1 and targeted the promoter for histone H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation. The CBP/p300-mediated histone modification further facilitates chromatin remodeling, thereby enhancing H3K4 trimethylation and recruitment of RNA polymerase II to activate GFAP gene transcription. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results provide evidence that exchange of repressor and activator complexes and epigenetic modifications are critical strategies for cellular differentiation and lineage-specific gene expression.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.119461267,-0.035149295,-0.014586439,-0.055475688,-0.040505861,0.023234669,0.010412749,-0.018753601,0.036319838,-0.038071549,-0.048001718,-0.016173824,-0.022351568,0.055568417,-0.021852197,0.028571686,-0.005674651,-0.057782393,-0.050046279,-0.028139297,0.036870895,-0.004045771,0.005591685,0.004860743,0.005693643,-0.019555458,-0.022728386,0.03280976,0.026195976,-0.048390577
"During the summer 2009 outbreak of ""swine flu"" in Scotland what respiratory pathogens were diagnosed as H1N1/2009?","BACKGROUND: During the April-July 2009 outbreak of H1N1/2009 in scotland the West of Scotland Specialist Virology Centre (WoSSVC) in Glasgow tested > 16 000 clinical samples for H1N1/2009. Most were from patients clinically diagnosed with H1N1/2009. Out of these, 9% were positive. This study sought to determine what respiratory pathogens were misdiagnosed as cases of H1N1/2009 during this time. METHODS: We examined the results from 3247 samples which were sent to the laboratory during April-July 2009. All were from patients clinically diagnosed as having H1N1/2009 (based on accepted criteria) and all were given a full respiratory screen using real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) assays. RESULTS: In total, respiratory pathogens were detected in 27.9% (95% confidence interval, 26.3-29.5%) of the samples submitted. Numerous pathogens were detected, the most common of which were rhinovirus (8.9% (95% confidence interval, 7.9-9.9%)), parainfluenza 1 (1.9% (95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.4%)) and 3 (4.1% (95% confidence interval, 3.3-4.9%)), and adenovirus ((3.5% (95% confidence interval, 2.9-4.2%)). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the problems of using a clinical algorithm to detect H1N1/2009. Clinicians frequently misdiagnosed common respiratory pathogens as H1N1/2009 during the spring/summer outbreak in Scotland. Many undesirable consequences would have resulted, relating to treatment, infection control, and public health surveillance.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.161428659,-0.029545503,-0.001084402,0.003879133,-0.010316842,0.074374452,-0.062930876,0.035400482,-0.067117703,-0.060860728,0.005655444,0.066623833,-0.011088301,-0.030284322,0.007652737,0.034323073,-0.026879226,-0.040748907,0.013031725,-0.086089587,-0.037803955,0.028088994,-0.033257591,-0.043830059,-0.042320298,0.031034083,-0.049950272,-0.034586208,-0.016340732,0.002396336
Severe community-acquired adenovirus pneumonia in an immunocompetent 44-year-old woman: a case report and review of the literature,"INTRODUCTION: This case report describes a rare condition: community-acquired adenovirus pneumonia in an immunocompetent adult. The diagnosis was achieved by using a multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and highlights the usefulness of these novel molecular diagnostic techniques in patients hospitalized with acute respiratory illness. We also performed a literature search for previously published cases and present a summary of the clinical, laboratory and radiological features of this condition. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old immunocompetent Caucasian woman was admitted to our hospital with an acute febrile respiratory illness associated with a rash. Her blood tests were non-specifically abnormal, and tests for bacterial pathogens were negative. Her condition rapidly deteriorated while she was in our hospital and required mechanical ventilation and inotropic support. A multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay performed on respiratory specimens to detect respiratory viruses was negative for influenza but positive for adenovirus DNA. The patient recovered on supportive treatment, and antibiotics were stopped after 5 days. CONCLUSIONS: Community-acquired adenovirus pneumonia in immunocompetent adult civilians presents as a non-specific acute febrile respiratory illness followed by the abrupt onset of respiratory failure, often requiring mechanical ventilation. Its laboratory and radiological features are typical of viral infections but also are non-specific. Novel multiplex real-time RT-PCR testing for respiratory viruses enabled us to rapidly make the diagnosis in this case. The new technology could be used more widely in patients with acute respiratory illness and has potential utility for rationalization of the use of antibiotics and improving infection control measures.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.257387636,0.039009785,0.025279032,0.057670865,-0.049939423,-0.055461313,-0.040283359,0.058232373,-0.049363491,0.04958708,-0.017563604,-0.02788645,0.060637451,0.028890424,0.010532664,-0.043721727,0.026391014,0.021741198,-0.014130252,-0.021692556,0.031416334,0.015108885,-0.029750768,-0.060474936,0.004240915,0.020883819,-0.009236634,0.001083522,0.028098185,-0.084264179
Real-world comparison of two molecular methods for detection of respiratory viruses,"BACKGROUND: Molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assays are increasingly used to diagnose viral respiratory infections and conduct epidemiology studies. Molecular assays have generally been evaluated by comparing them to conventional direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) or viral culture techniques, with few published direct comparisons between molecular methods or between institutions. We sought to perform a real-world comparison of two molecular respiratory viral diagnostic methods between two experienced respiratory virus research laboratories. METHODS: We tested nasal and throat swab specimens obtained from 225 infants with respiratory illness for 11 common respiratory viruses using both a multiplex assay (Respiratory MultiCode-PLx Assay [RMA]) and individual real-time RT-PCR (RT-rtPCR). RESULTS: Both assays detected viruses in more than 70% of specimens, but there was discordance. The RMA assay detected significantly more human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), while RT-rtPCR detected significantly more influenza A. We speculated that primer differences accounted for these discrepancies and redesigned the primers and probes for influenza A in the RMA assay, and for HMPV and RSV in the RT-rtPCR assay. The tests were then repeated and again compared. The new primers led to improved detection of HMPV and RSV by RT-rtPCR assay, but the RMA assay remained similar in terms of influenza detection. CONCLUSIONS: Given the absence of a gold standard, clinical and research laboratories should regularly correlate the results of molecular assays with other PCR based assays, other laboratories, and with standard virologic methods to ensure consistency and accuracy.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.230168059,0.018368427,0.178597266,0.24806934,-0.006491312,-0.070728376,0.0118982,-0.084744943,0.108413907,-0.041260936,-0.006572963,-0.062410626,-0.037421215,0.051339157,-0.062254558,-0.078219855,0.047404541,0.086039524,-0.036399189,-0.032395412,0.10657814,-0.055775136,0.04705708,-0.074010075,0.00030898,-0.021511189,0.049056379,-0.064960762,0.010743896,-0.047414427
The Microbial Detection Array Combined with Random Phi29-Amplification Used as a Diagnostic Tool for Virus Detection in Clinical Samples,"A common technique used for sensitive and specific diagnostic virus detection in clinical samples is PCR that can identify one or several viruses in one assay. However, a diagnostic microarray containing probes for all human pathogens could replace hundreds of individual PCR-reactions and remove the need for a clear clinical hypothesis regarding a suspected pathogen. We have established such a diagnostic platform for random amplification and subsequent microarray identification of viral pathogens in clinical samples. We show that Phi29 polymerase-amplification of a diverse set of clinical samples generates enough viral material for successful identification by the Microbial Detection Array, demonstrating the potential of the microarray technique for broad-spectrum pathogen detection. We conclude that this method detects both DNA and RNA virus, present in the same sample, as well as differentiates between different virus subtypes.

Viral Double-Strand RNA-Binding Proteins Can Enhance Innate Immune Signaling by Toll-Like Receptor 3,"Toll-like Receptor 3 (TLR3) detects double-stranded (ds) RNAs to activate innate immune responses. While poly(I:C) is an excellent agonist for TLR3 in several cell lines and in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, viral dsRNAs tend to be poor agonists, leading to the hypothesis that additional factor(s) are likely required to allow TLR3 to respond to viral dsRNAs. TLR3 signaling was examined in a lung epithelial cell line by quantifying cytokine production and in human embryonic kidney cells by quantifying luciferase reporter levels. Recombinant 1b hepatitis C virus polymerase was found to enhance TLR3 signaling in the lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells when added to the media along with either poly(I:C) or viral dsRNAs. The polymerase from the genotype 2a JFH-1 HCV was a poor enhancer of TLR3 signaling until it was mutated to favor a conformation that could bind better to a partially duplexed RNA. The 1b polymerase also co-localizes with TLR3 in endosomes. RNA-binding capsid proteins (CPs) from two positive-strand RNA viruses and the hepadenavirus hepatitis B virus (HBV) were also potent enhancers of TLR3 signaling by poly(I:C) or viral dsRNAs. A truncated version of the HBV CP that lacked an arginine-rich RNA-binding domain was unable to enhance TLR3 signaling. These results demonstrate that several viral RNA-binding proteins can enhance the dsRNA-dependent innate immune response initiated by TLR3.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.114930169,-0.048874299,-0.032254205,-0.03009904,-0.068395769,0.00651973,0.026618684,-0.011444449,0.026228137,-0.011536995,-0.01039189,-0.015249903,-0.000616716,0.067313545,0.00369811,0.015865837,0.001720444,-0.00418202,0.025922051,-0.020622769,-0.00392525,0.021044532,0.010568022,-0.01116516,-0.019320598,-0.020076967,-0.020438498,0.027932002,-0.008320987,-0.034384421
"FilmArray, an Automated Nested Multiplex PCR System for Multi-Pathogen Detection: Development and Application to Respiratory Tract Infection","The ideal clinical diagnostic system should deliver rapid, sensitive, specific and reproducible results while minimizing the requirements for specialized laboratory facilities and skilled technicians. We describe an integrated diagnostic platform, the “FilmArray”, which fully automates the detection and identification of multiple organisms from a single sample in about one hour. An unprocessed biologic/clinical sample is subjected to nucleic acid purification, reverse transcription, a high-order nested multiplex polymerase chain reaction and amplicon melt curve analysis. Biochemical reactions are enclosed in a disposable pouch, minimizing the PCR contamination risk. FilmArray has the potential to detect greater than 100 different nucleic acid targets at one time. These features make the system well-suited for molecular detection of infectious agents. Validation of the FilmArray technology was achieved through development of a panel of assays capable of identifying 21 common viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. Initial testing of the system using both cultured organisms and clinical nasal aspirates obtained from children demonstrated an analytical and clinical sensitivity and specificity comparable to existing diagnostic platforms. We demonstrate that automated identification of pathogens from their corresponding target amplicon(s) can be accomplished by analysis of the DNA melting curve of the amplicon.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.067608849,0.034748829,0.15083872,0.034807002,-0.067673117,-0.043044002,0.068752225,-0.004072591,-0.017166662,0.091650653,-0.056750962,-0.025392454,0.098615046,-0.126147276,0.009998485,-0.01559766,-0.036886456,-0.002798407,-0.032575394,-0.078228952,-0.035850233,-0.02485976,0.060784219,-0.089492391,0.012098202,-0.022259043,-0.034369809,-0.023851543,-0.014330215,0.032079762
Neuropathogenesis of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H7N1) in experimentally infected chickens,"In order to understand the mechanism of neuroinvasion of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) into the central nervous system (CNS) of chickens, specific pathogen free chickens were inoculated with a H7N1 HPAIV. Blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), nasal cavity and brain tissue samples were obtained from 1 to 4 days post-inoculation (dpi) of infected and control chickens. Viral antigen topographical distribution, presence of influenza A virus receptors in the brain, as well as, the role of the olfactory route in virus CNS invasion were studied using different immunohistochemistry techniques. Besides, viral RNA load in CSF and blood was quantified by means of a quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Viral antigen was observed widely distributed in the CNS, showing bilateral and symmetrical distribution in the nuclei of the diencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon. Viral RNA was detected in blood and CSF at one dpi, indicating that the virus crosses the blood-CSF-barrier early during infection. This early dissemination is possibly favoured by the presence of Siaα2,3 Gal and Siaα2,6 Gal receptors in brain vascular endothelial cells, and Siaα2,3 Gal receptors in ependymal and choroid plexus cells. No viral antigen was observed in olfactory sensory neurons, while the olfactory bulb showed only weak staining, suggesting that the virus did not use this pathway to enter into the brain. The sequence of virus appearance and the topographical distribution of this H7N1 HPAIV indicate that the viral entry occurs via the haematogenous route, with early and generalized spreading through the CSF.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.030437476,-0.048430083,0.015613053,-0.010589854,-0.036397859,0.068249251,-0.006033293,-0.021235496,0.002032404,0.024897557,0.051021441,-0.078767334,0.033200743,0.04866784,0.040507977,0.011608725,-0.022149426,-0.031719844,-0.009961311,0.023445479,-0.012958629,0.017391195,-0.014645434,-0.011595152,-0.008275059,-0.007227364,-0.010286316,-0.011590348,-0.041739702,0.03092977
Inhibition of Interferon Induction and Action by the Nairovirus Nairobi Sheep Disease Virus/Ganjam Virus,"The Nairoviruses are an important group of tick-borne viruses that includes pathogens of man (Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus) and livestock animals (Dugbe virus, Nairobi sheep disease virus (NSDV)). NSDV is found in large parts of East Africa and the Indian subcontinent (where it is known as Ganjam virus). We have investigated the ability of NSDV to antagonise the induction and actions of interferon. Both pathogenic and apathogenic isolates could actively inhibit the induction of type 1 interferon, and also blocked the signalling pathways of both type 1 and type 2 interferons. Using transient expression of viral proteins or sections of viral proteins, these activities all mapped to the ovarian tumour-like protease domain (OTU) found in the viral RNA polymerase. Virus infection, or expression of this OTU domain in transfected cells, led to a great reduction in the incorporation of ubiquitin or ISG15 protein into host cell proteins. Point mutations in the OTU that inhibited the protease activity also prevented it from antagonising interferon induction and action. Interestingly, a mutation at a peripheral site, which had little apparent effect on the ability of the OTU to inhibit ubiquitination and ISG15ylation, removed the ability of the OTU to block the induction of type 1 and the action of type 2 interferons, but had a lesser effect on the ability to block type 1 interferon action, suggesting that targets other than ubiquitin and ISG15 may be involved in the actions of the viral OTU.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.103798886,-0.054831992,-0.031815291,-0.024709814,-0.078234869,0.061455032,0.055545501,-0.021976629,0.035873386,0.019900487,-0.023546098,-0.024848914,-0.008959269,0.045900519,0.004016967,-0.025902967,0.009908896,-0.02855108,0.001782348,0.048163295,0.024854083,0.034040271,-0.021195637,0.019721892,0.033374971,0.029784077,0.02339953,-0.012772391,-0.047036241,-0.017100446
Multifaceted Regulation of Translational Readthrough by RNA Replication Elements in a Tombusvirus,"Translational readthrough of stop codons by ribosomes is a recoding event used by a variety of viruses, including plus-strand RNA tombusviruses. Translation of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in tombusviruses is mediated using this strategy and we have investigated this process using a variety of in vitro and in vivo approaches. Our results indicate that readthrough generating the RdRp requires a novel long-range RNA-RNA interaction, spanning a distance of ∼3.5 kb, which occurs between a large RNA stem-loop located 3'-proximal to the stop codon and an RNA replication structure termed RIV at the 3'-end of the viral genome. Interestingly, this long-distance RNA-RNA interaction is modulated by mutually-exclusive RNA structures in RIV that represent a type of RNA switch. Moreover, a different long-range RNA-RNA interaction that was previously shown to be necessary for viral RNA replicase assembly was also required for efficient readthrough production of the RdRp. Accordingly, multiple replication-associated RNA elements are involved in modulating the readthrough event in tombusviruses and we propose an integrated mechanistic model to describe how this regulatory network could be advantageous by (i) providing a quality control system for culling truncated viral genomes at an early stage in the replication process, (ii) mediating cis-preferential replication of viral genomes, and (iii) coordinating translational readthrough of the RdRp with viral genome replication. Based on comparative sequence analysis and experimental data, basic elements of this regulatory model extend to other members of Tombusviridae, as well as to viruses outside of this family.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.283385778,-0.067863022,-0.110407457,0.197201252,-0.024463045,-0.146827368,0.015314246,0.072751331,-0.097904432,0.047114569,0.102250861,0.029804812,-0.044902784,0.014560455,-0.010798507,0.017819666,-0.002474415,-0.03507485,-0.04506635,-0.032339235,-0.037922303,0.011613554,-0.074267896,-0.040595524,-0.086525758,-0.113115847,0.009059272,0.02942724,0.050853202,0.004954539
Synergistic Roles of Eukaryotic Translation Elongation Factors 1Bγ and 1A in Stimulation of Tombusvirus Minus-Strand Synthesis,"Host factors are recruited into viral replicase complexes to aid replication of plus-strand RNA viruses. In this paper, we show that deletion of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1Bgamma (eEF1Bγ) reduces Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) replication in yeast host. Also, knock down of eEF1Bγ level in plant host decreases TBSV accumulation. eEF1Bγ binds to the viral RNA and is one of the resident host proteins in the tombusvirus replicase complex. Additional in vitro assays with whole cell extracts prepared from yeast strains lacking eEF1Bγ demonstrated its role in minus-strand synthesis by opening of the structured 3′ end of the viral RNA and reducing the possibility of re-utilization of (+)-strand templates for repeated (-)-strand synthesis within the replicase. We also show that eEF1Bγ plays a synergistic role with eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A in tombusvirus replication, possibly via stimulation of the proper positioning of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase over the promoter region in the viral RNA template.These roles for translation factors during TBSV replication are separate from their canonical roles in host and viral protein translation.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.250287109,-0.097024145,-0.105863777,0.136225724,-0.088537899,-0.083303821,0.030078836,0.030283314,-0.02934099,0.033098156,0.03534049,-0.047983194,-0.009438929,0.125701535,-0.013615105,0.02488078,0.025107785,-0.068707475,-0.007081136,0.06706618,-0.10031427,0.104264693,-0.112858883,-0.069074629,-0.015649193,-0.12155181,-0.032812799,-0.024408149,0.002783537,0.047547562
Rapid detection of wheat yellow mosaic virus by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification,"For the detection of wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV), we established a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method. Using Primer Explorer software, four sets of primers were designed and RT-LAMP assay reaction conditions were optimized. The RT-LAMP was performed at different times by four primer sets. Agarose gel analysis showed that WYMV could be detected after 30 min with the primer set III and after 45 min with the other three primer sets, both under the 80-min reaction time. RT-LAMP had the same results with the four primer sets, thus primer set III and 65°C for 80 min reaction were selected for virus detection. There was no significant different when avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) and moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) RT-LAMP with the four primer sets and M-MLV was chosen due to its relatively cheap price. The result on specificity showed that the assay could amplify WYMV specifically, and the sensitivity comparison showed that the RT-LAMP was 100 times more sensitive than conventional reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Overall, RT-LAMP was found to be a simple, specific, sensitive, convenient and time-saving method for WYMV detection.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.016008763,0.114403589,0.33124694,0.114946766,-0.026802795,-0.081501808,-0.02504902,-0.021118172,-0.01491783,-0.087006249,-0.028241118,0.049293728,-0.078673328,0.104911822,-0.096105892,0.06308931,0.090633168,0.071249231,-0.143890087,0.034599203,-0.127090909,-0.047392652,-0.100716352,0.281219429,0.155067206,0.040028662,-0.094890341,0.115115774,-0.035673002,-0.019361868
Etiology and Clinical Characterization of Respiratory Virus Infections in Adult Patients Attending an Emergency Department in Beijing,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) represent a serious global health burden. To date, few reports have addressed the prevalence of respiratory viruses (RVs) in adults with ARTIs attending an emergency department (ED). Therefore, the potential impact of respiratory virus infections on such patients remains unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To determine the epidemiological and clinical profiles of common and recently discovered respiratory viruses in adults with ARTIs attending an ED in Beijing, a 1-year consecutive study was conducted from May, 2010, to April, 2011. Nose and throat swab samples from 416 ARTI patients were checked for 13 respiratory viruses using multiple reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) assays for common respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses (Flu) A, B, and adenoviruses (ADVs), picornaviruses (PICs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1–3, combined with real-time RT-PCR for human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human coronaviruses (HCoVs, -OC43, -229E, -NL63, and -HKU1). Viral pathogens were detected in 52.88% (220/416) of patient samples, and 7.21% (30/416) of patients tested positive for more than one virus. PICs (17.79%) were the dominant agents detected, followed by FluA (16.11%), HCoVs (11.78%), and ADV (11.30%). HMPV, PIVs, and FluB were also detected (<3%), but not RSV. The total prevalence and the dominant virus infections detected differed significantly between ours and a previous report. Co-infection rates were high for HCoV-229E (12/39, 30.76%), PIC (22/74, 29.73%), ADV (12/47, 25.53%) and FluA (15/67, 22.39%). Different patterns of clinical symptoms were associated with different respiratory viruses. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of RV involvement in adults with ARTIs attending an ED in China differs from that previously reported. The high prevalence of viruses (PIC, FluA, HCoVs and ADV) reported here strongly highlight the need for the development of safe and effective therapeutic approaches for these viruses.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.257926806,-0.081980407,-0.062227657,0.115976312,0.112217652,-0.07214968,0.045329087,-0.033732902,0.04057447,0.006993562,-0.003524457,0.060696645,0.081972964,0.106581766,-0.009260455,-0.060993744,0.014347974,0.027594962,-0.008222887,0.041988239,0.084123006,-0.045312056,-0.018970481,0.008917476,-8.22E-05,-0.015931551,0.022547509,0.021825859,-0.00658828,-0.061571862
A Surveillance System to Reduce Transmission of Pandemic H1N1 (2009) Influenza in a 2600-Bed Medical Center,"BACKGROUND: Concerns have been raised about how the transmission of emerging infectious diseases from patients to healthcare workers (HCWs) and vice versa could be recognized and prevented in a timely manner. An effective strategy to block transmission of pandemic H1N1 (2009) influenza in HCWs is important. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An infection control program was implemented to survey and prevent nosocomial outbreaks of H1N1 (2009) influenza at a 2,600-bed, tertiary-care academic hospital. In total, 4,963 employees at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital recorded their temperature and received online education on control practices for influenza infections. Administration records provided vaccination records and occupational characteristics of all HCWs. Early recognition of a pandemic H1N1 (2009) influenza case was followed by a semi-structured questionnaire to analyze possible routes of patient contact, household contact, or unspecified contact. Surveillance spanned August 1, 2009 to January 31, 2010; 51 HCWs were confirmed to have novel H1N1 (2009) influenza by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Prevalence of patient contact, household contact, or unspecified contact infection was 13.7% (7/51), 13.7% (7/51), and 72.5% (37/51), respectively. The prevalence of the novel H1N1 infection was significantly lower among vaccinated HCWs than among unvaccinated HCWs (p<0.001). Higher viral loads in throat swabs were found in HCWs with patient and household contact infection than in those with unspecified contact infection (4.15 vs. 3.53 copies/mL, log(10), p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: A surveillance system with daily temperature recordings and online education for HCWs is important for a low attack rate of H1N1 (2009) influenza transmission before H1N1 (2009) influenza vaccination is available, and the attack rate is further decreased after mass vaccination. Unspecified contact infection rates were significantly higher than that of patient contact and household contact infection, highlighting the need for public education of influenza transmission in addition to hospital infection control.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.102544492,-0.034068673,-0.027407372,0.036617138,-0.043572072,0.228969801,-0.108096028,0.075498831,-0.004513671,-0.093096333,0.020115658,0.033638587,-0.026279549,-0.023199945,0.018578136,0.05038082,-0.017147516,-0.008233106,-0.030429615,-0.037879732,-0.015130513,-0.024205348,-0.073295526,-0.067391956,-0.063454649,0.036932907,-0.040483432,0.042916324,-0.004956123,0.055159831
Surveillance of Airborne Adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in a Hospital Pediatric Department,This investigation evaluated the distributions of airborne adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in public areas in the pediatric department of Children's Hospital in northern Taiwan. The airborne viral and bacterial concentrations were evaluated twice a week for a year using filter sampling with an airflow rate of 12 liters per minute for eight hours in the pediatric outpatient department and 24 hours in the pediatric emergency room. Real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were conducted for analysis. Approximately 18% of the air samples from the pediatric emergency room were found to contain adenovirus. Approximately forty-six percent of the air samples from the pediatric outpatient department contained Mycoplasma pneumoniae DNA products. High detection rates of airborne adenovirus DNA were obtained in July and August in the pediatric public areas. Airborne Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected only in July in the pediatric emergency room and the peak levels were found from August to January in the pediatric outpatient department. Airborne particles that contained adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were the most prevalent in the pediatric public areas. The potential relationship between these airborne viral/bacterial particles and human infection should be examined further.

A Family-Wide RT-PCR Assay for Detection of Paramyxoviruses and Application to a Large-Scale Surveillance Study,"Family-wide molecular diagnostic assays are valuable tools for initial identification of viruses during outbreaks and to limit costs of surveillance studies. Recent discoveries of paramyxoviruses have called for such assay that is able to detect all known and unknown paramyxoviruses in one round of PCR amplification. We have developed a RT-PCR assay consisting of a single degenerate primer set, able to detect all members of the Paramyxoviridae family including all virus genera within the subfamilies Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae. Primers anneal to domain III of the polymerase gene, with the 3′ end of the reverse primer annealing to the conserved motif GDNQ, which is proposed to be the active site for nucleotide polymerization. The assay was fully optimized and was shown to indeed detect all available paramyxoviruses tested. Clinical specimens from hospitalized patients that tested positive for known paramyxoviruses in conventional assays were also detected with the novel family-wide test. A high-throughput fluorescence-based RT-PCR version of the assay was developed for screening large numbers of specimens. A large number of samples collected from wild birds was tested, resulting in the detection of avian paramyxoviruses type 1 in both barnacle and white-fronted geese, and type 8 in barnacle geese. Avian metapneumovirus type C was found for the first time in Europe in mallards, greylag geese and common gulls. The single round family-wide RT-PCR assay described here is a useful tool for the detection of known and unknown paramyxoviruses, and screening of large sample collections from humans and animals.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.02381365,0.079547348,0.202550786,0.091088763,0.038240823,-0.022039132,0.028012142,0.008205436,-0.038789913,-0.003033272,-0.022876135,0.016185989,-0.011462101,0.029025859,-0.018750936,-0.037525416,0.03987369,0.013974716,-0.021729077,-0.03926377,0.068140658,0.038652641,-0.013212195,0.02725586,-0.015684512,0.014115452,0.027628214,-0.015347657,0.017274284,-0.044288696
The CEA/CD3-Bispecific Antibody MEDI-565 (MT111) Binds a Nonlinear Epitope in the Full-Length but Not a Short Splice Variant of CEA,"MEDI-565 (also known as MT111) is a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE®) antibody in development for the treatment of patients with cancers expressing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). MEDI-565 binds CEA on cancer cells and CD3 on T cells to induce T-cell mediated killing of cancer cells. To understand the molecular basis of human CEA recognition by MEDI-565 and how polymorphisms and spliced forms of CEA may affect MEDI-565 activity, we mapped the epitope of MEDI-565 on CEA using mutagenesis and homology modeling approaches. We found that MEDI-565 recognized a conformational epitope in the A2 domain comprised of amino acids 326–349 and 388–410, with critical residues F(326), T(328), N(333), V(388), G(389), P(390), E(392), I(408), and N(410). Two non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs10407503, rs7249230) were identified in the epitope region, but they are found at low homozygosity rates. Searching the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank® database, we further identified a single, previously uncharacterized mRNA splice variant of CEA that lacks a portion of the N-terminal domain, the A1 and B1 domains, and a large portion of the A2 domain. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of multiple cancers showed widespread expression of full-length CEA in these tumors, with less frequent but concordant expression of the CEA splice variant. Because the epitope was largely absent from the CEA splice variant, MEDI-565 did not bind or mediate T-cell killing of cells solely expressing this form of CEA. In addition, the splice variant did not interfere with MEDI-565 binding or activity when co-expressed with full-length CEA. Thus MEDI-565 may broadly target CEA-positive tumors without regard for expression of the short splice variant of CEA. Together our data suggest that MEDI-565 activity will neither be impacted by SNPs nor by a splice variant of CEA.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.065694181,-0.026281855,0.000401311,-0.080785135,-0.034122135,0.026882483,0.006066345,-0.013181008,0.018800229,-0.029021476,-0.028435549,0.022232972,-0.01562761,-0.009649695,-0.007387928,0.005182948,0.005618255,-0.01066485,-0.015536846,-0.029686241,0.027445457,-0.01741595,0.017583125,-0.005832261,0.016736924,0.025356499,-0.011238123,0.012365667,0.005911442,-0.021282887
Mechanism of Nucleic Acid Unwinding by SARS-CoV Helicase,"The non-structural protein 13 (nsp13) of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a helicase that separates double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or DNA (dsDNA) with a 5′→3′ polarity, using the energy of nucleotide hydrolysis. We determined the minimal mechanism of helicase function by nsp13. We showed a clear unwinding lag with increasing length of the double-stranded region of the nucleic acid, suggesting the presence of intermediates in the unwinding process. To elucidate the nature of the intermediates we carried out transient kinetic analysis of the nsp13 helicase activity. We demonstrated that the enzyme unwinds nucleic acid in discrete steps of 9.3 base-pairs (bp) each, with a catalytic rate of 30 steps per second. Therefore the net unwinding rate is ∼280 base-pairs per second. We also showed that nsp12, the SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), enhances (2-fold) the catalytic efficiency of nsp13 by increasing the step size of nucleic acid (RNA/RNA or DNA/DNA) unwinding. This effect is specific for SARS-CoV nsp12, as no change in nsp13 activity was observed when foot-and-mouth-disease virus RdRp was used in place of nsp12. Our data provide experimental evidence that nsp13 and nsp12 can function in a concerted manner to improve the efficiency of viral replication and enhance our understanding of nsp13 function during SARS-CoV RNA synthesis.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.14531801,0.193296977,-0.141096154,0.083583593,-0.048901116,-0.048904086,0.01558843,-0.08124924,-0.031868257,0.022875005,0.053845347,0.048619448,-0.028220161,-0.082183444,-0.020918342,0.015860729,0.004793074,-0.040128175,-0.004595287,-0.016728688,-0.029111981,-0.027226331,0.043489476,-0.050421423,0.006336638,-0.007550332,-0.086238296,0.053085465,-0.007679646,0.035623986
A Real-Time PCR Assay for Bat SARS-Like Coronavirus Detection and Its Application to Italian Greater Horseshoe Bat Faecal Sample Surveys,"Bats are source of coronaviruses closely related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus. Numerous studies have been carried out to identify new bat viruses related to SARS-coronavirus (bat-SARS-like CoVs) using a reverse-transcribed-polymerase chain reaction assay. However, a qualitative PCR could underestimate the prevalence of infection, affecting the epidemiological evaluation of bats in viral ecology. In this work an SYBR Green-real time PCR assay was developed for diagnosing infection with SARS-related coronaviruses from bat guano and was applied as screening tool in a survey carried out on 45 greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) sampled in Italy in 2009. The assay showed high sensitivity and reproducibility. Its application on bats screening resulted in a prevalence of 42%. This method could be suitable as screening tool in epidemiological surveys about the presence of bat-SARS-like CoVs, consequently to obtain a more realistic scenario of the viral prevalence in the population.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0.004839359,0.302560902,-0.048072576,0.052063525,0.256540342,0.111968925,0.226662909,-0.115578143,-0.186063694,-0.076423005,-0.122914861,-0.146036839,-0.018397442,0.077644636,-0.040480223,0.082821993,0.032818995,0.052248582,0.048806311,-0.002200731,-0.023047364,-0.028313385,0.024782656,-0.090516128,0.028233376,0.032908564,-0.017916624,-0.007306686,0.002824862,0.006479069
Respiratory viruses in children hospitalized for acute lower respiratory tract infection in Ghana,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory tract infections are one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality among young children in developing countries. Information on the viral aetiology of acute respiratory infections in developing countries is very limited. The study was done to identify viruses associated with acute lower respiratory tract infection among children less than 5 years. METHOD: Nasopharyngeal samples and blood cultures were collected from children less than 5 years who have been hospitalized for acute lower respiratory tract infection. Viruses and bacteria were identified using Reverse Transcriptase Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction and conventional biochemical techniques. RESULTS: Out of 128 patients recruited, 33(25.88%%, 95%CI: 18.5% to 34.2%) were positive for one or more viruses. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) was detected in 18(14.1%, 95%CI: 8.5% to 21.3%) patients followed by Adenoviruses (AdV) in 13(10.2%, 95%CI: 5.5% to 16.7%), Parainfluenza (PIV type: 1, 2, 3) in 4(3.1%, 95%CI: 0.9% to 7.8%) and influenza B viruses in 1(0.8%, 95%CI: 0.0 to 4.3). Concomitant viral and bacterial co-infection occurred in two patients. There were no detectable significant differences in the clinical signs, symptoms and severity for the various pathogens isolated. A total of 61.1% (22/36) of positive viruses were detected during the rainy season and Respiratory Syncytial Virus was the most predominant. CONCLUSION: The study has demonstrated an important burden of respiratory viruses as major causes of childhood acute respiratory infection in a tertiary health institution in Ghana.

Thermostable DNA Polymerase from a Viral Metagenome Is a Potent RT-PCR Enzyme,"Viral metagenomic libraries are a promising but previously untapped source of new reagent enzymes. Deep sequencing and functional screening of viral metagenomic DNA from a near-boiling thermal pool identified clones expressing thermostable DNA polymerase (Pol) activity. Among these, 3173 Pol demonstrated both high thermostability and innate reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. We describe the biochemistry of 3173 Pol and report its use in single-enzyme reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Wild-type 3173 Pol contains a proofreading 3′-5′ exonuclease domain that confers high fidelity in PCR.

Clinical Relevance and Discriminatory Value of Elevated Liver Aminotransferase Levels for Dengue Severity,"BACKGROUND: Elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is prominent in acute dengue illness. The World Health Organization (WHO) 2009 dengue guidelines defined AST or ALT≥1000 units/liter (U/L) as a criterion for severe dengue. We aimed to assess the clinical relevance and discriminatory value of AST or ALT for dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and severe dengue. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We retrospectively studied and classified polymerase chain reaction positive dengue patients from 2006 to 2008 treated at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore according to WHO 1997 and 2009 criteria for dengue severity. Of 690 dengue patients, 31% had DHF and 24% severe dengue. Elevated AST and ALT occurred in 86% and 46%, respectively. Seven had AST or ALT≥1000 U/L. None had acute liver failure but one patient died. Median AST and ALT values were significantly higher with increasing dengue severity by both WHO 1997 and 2009 criteria. However, they were poorly discriminatory between non-severe and severe dengue (e.g., AST area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve = 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57–0.67) and between dengue fever (DF) and DHF (AST area under the ROC curve = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.52–0.61). There was significant overlap in AST and ALT values among patients with dengue with or without warning signs and severe dengue, and between those with DF and DHF. CONCLUSIONS: Although aminotransferase levels increased in conjunction with dengue severity, AST or ALT values did not discriminate between DF and DHF or non-severe and severe dengue.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.023659225,-0.007648618,-0.026298358,-0.09968171,-0.047265648,0.016535914,-0.003955228,0.024473131,-0.044285259,-0.039956106,-0.007986119,0.048861103,-0.045973256,-0.022663183,-0.035266989,0.046325619,-0.016214165,0.009026145,-0.002908705,-0.007757587,-0.021357468,-0.018160983,-0.037883016,-0.012361805,-0.004037978,0.027862416,-0.005640945,-0.049525841,-0.02292738,-0.006891171
Molecular and Microscopic Analysis of Bacteria and Viruses in Exhaled Breath Collected Using a Simple Impaction and Condensing Method,"Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is increasingly being used as a non-invasive method for disease diagnosis and environmental exposure assessment. By using hydrophobic surface, ice, and droplet scavenging, a simple impaction and condensing based collection method is reported here. Human subjects were recruited to exhale toward the device for 1, 2, 3, and 4 min. The exhaled breath quickly formed into tiny droplets on the hydrophobic surface, which were subsequently scavenged into a 10 µL rolling deionized water droplet. The collected EBC was further analyzed using culturing, DNA stain, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and colorimetry (VITEK 2) for bacteria and viruses. Experimental data revealed that bacteria and viruses in EBC can be rapidly collected using the method developed here, with an observed efficiency of 100 µL EBC within 1 min. Culturing, DNA stain, SEM, and qPCR methods all detected high bacterial concentrations up to 7000 CFU/m(3) in exhaled breath, including both viable and dead cells of various types. Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Kocuria variants were found dominant in EBC samples using VITEK 2 system. SEM images revealed that most bacteria in exhaled breath are detected in the size range of 0.5–1.0 µm, which is able to enable them to remain airborne for a longer time, thus presenting a risk for airborne transmission of potential diseases. Using qPCR, influenza A H3N2 viruses were also detected in one EBC sample. Different from other devices restricted solely to condensation, the developed method can be easily achieved both by impaction and condensation in a laboratory and could impact current practice of EBC collection. Nonetheless, the reported work is a proof-of-concept demonstration, and its performance in non-invasive disease diagnosis such as bacterimia and virus infections needs to be further validated including effects of its influencing matrix.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.041753514,-0.002066961,0.104167948,0.014143882,-0.028271846,0.047765131,0.045314077,0.006635933,-0.027550029,0.035527546,-0.024824089,-0.011783509,0.030056412,-0.039309526,0.030520737,0.006626031,-0.052604933,-0.052141438,-0.006756296,-0.03261096,-0.021815722,0.000632547,0.015270552,0.013757634,-0.013334406,-0.009236957,-0.035347515,0.042344596,-0.014818729,-0.018023025
"Detection of porcine circovirus genotypes 2a and 2b in aborted foetuses from infected swine herds in the State of São Paulo, Brazil","BACKGROUND: Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) has been associated with several disease complexes, including reproductive failure. The aim of this study was to identify the subtypes of PCV2 that are associated with reproductive failure in pigs from the State of São Paulo, Brazil and to investigate co-infections with other infectious organisms. FINDINGS: Samples of 168 aborted foetuses or mummified foetuses from five farrow-to-finish swine farms known to be infected with PCV2 and located in the State of São Paulo were tested for PCV2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Positive samples were additionally tested for porcine parvovirus (PPV), Leptospira spp. and Brucella spp. by PCR. PCV2 was detected in 18 of the samples (10.7%). PPV, Brucella spp. and Leptospira spp were found in 2, 10 and 0 cases, respectively. Eleven PCV2 strains were sequenced and determined to be either genotype 2a (n = 1) or 2b (n = 10). CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that the frequency of PCV2 infections in aborted porcine foetuses from the State of São Paulo is rather low (10.7%) and that co-infection with other pathogens is common and may be involved in PCV2 associated reproductive failure. No repeatable, characteristic amino acid motifs for regions of the PCV2 capsid protein seemed to be associated with abortion in sows.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.008366951,-0.016063099,0.053480533,-0.108451604,0.026594091,0.015522565,0.006751394,-0.012732096,0.001555391,-0.016923087,0.024028889,0.036887469,-0.063520608,-0.006692687,0.098852354,-0.085070722,-0.008396163,-0.030790736,0.014242918,0.009953673,-0.00772535,0.02091274,0.015386027,-0.039008269,0.02962418,-0.026999071,-0.057168423,-0.009068594,0.001051126,-0.011485891
Diagnostic Devices for Isothermal Nucleic Acid Amplification,"Since the development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, genomic information has been retrievable from lesser amounts of DNA than previously possible. PCR-based amplifications require high-precision instruments to perform temperature cycling reactions; further, they are cumbersome for routine clinical use. However, the use of isothermal approaches can eliminate many complications associated with thermocycling. The application of diagnostic devices for isothermal DNA amplification has recently been studied extensively.

Partial and Full PCR-Based Reverse Genetics Strategy for Influenza Viruses,"Since 1999, plasmid-based reverse genetics (RG) systems have revolutionized the way influenza viruses are studied. However, it is not unusual to encounter cloning difficulties for one or more influenza genes while attempting to recover virus de novo. To overcome some of these shortcomings we sought to develop partial or full plasmid-free RG systems. The influenza gene of choice is assembled into a RG competent unit by virtue of overlapping PCR reactions containing a cDNA copy of the viral gene segment under the control of RNA polymerase I promoter (pol1) and termination (t1) signals – herein referred to as Flu PCR amplicons. Transfection of tissue culture cells with either HA or NA Flu PCR amplicons and 7 plasmids encoding the remaining influenza RG units, resulted in efficient virus rescue. Likewise, transfections including both HA and NA Flu PCR amplicons and 6 RG plasmids also resulted in efficient virus rescue. In addition, influenza viruses were recovered from a full set of Flu PCR amplicons without the use of plasmids.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.006828795,-0.055943456,0.057100037,0.112283317,-0.001188877,0.174786473,-0.11982203,-0.005653631,-0.021027915,-0.045925474,-0.016309978,-0.040754151,0.031921464,0.026981542,0.022121005,0.002429036,0.017499982,-0.030211613,-0.022972379,-0.0631073,0.024915695,0.015293319,0.059552141,-0.006936562,-0.055216808,-0.009107784,0.008130552,-0.032202686,-0.007898365,0.042598538
Competition between Influenza A Virus Genome Segments,"Influenza A virus (IAV) contains a segmented negative-strand RNA genome. How IAV balances the replication and transcription of its multiple genome segments is not understood. We developed a dual competition assay based on the co-transfection of firefly or Gaussia luciferase-encoding genome segments together with plasmids encoding IAV polymerase subunits and nucleoprotein. At limiting amounts of polymerase subunits, expression of the firefly luciferase segment was negatively affected by the presence of its Gaussia luciferase counterpart, indicative of competition between reporter genome segments. This competition could be relieved by increasing or decreasing the relative amounts of firefly or Gaussia reporter segment, respectively. The balance between the luciferase expression levels was also affected by the identity of the untranslated regions (UTRs) as well as segment length. In general it appeared that genome segments displaying inherent higher expression levels were more efficient competitors of another segment. When natural genome segments were tested for their ability to suppress reporter gene expression, shorter genome segments generally reduced firefly luciferase expression to a larger extent, with the M and NS segments having the largest effect. The balance between different reporter segments was most dramatically affected by the introduction of UTR panhandle-stabilizing mutations. Furthermore, only reporter genome segments carrying these mutations were able to efficiently compete with the natural genome segments in infected cells. Our data indicate that IAV genome segments compete for available polymerases. Competition is affected by segment length, coding region, and UTRs. This competition is probably most apparent early during infection, when limiting amounts of polymerases are present, and may contribute to the regulation of segment-specific replication and transcription.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.114021508,-0.042665927,-0.002069429,-0.029710537,-0.018852561,0.024621534,-0.037683497,-0.007025242,0.010588084,-0.044489697,-0.029676129,-0.024445438,0.002390478,0.019040837,0.013789489,0.007040741,-0.008524624,-0.025714555,-0.026951629,-0.018035865,0.02483628,0.001558522,-0.015999327,-0.003494311,-0.052810986,-0.034914106,0.015741142,0.009855324,0.004973184,0.005938842
Visual detection of the human metapneumovirus using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification with hydroxynaphthol blue dye,"BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a major cause of acute respiratory infections ranging from wheezing to bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children worldwide. The objective of this study is to develop a visual reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the detection of hMPV and applied to the clinical samples. RESULTS: In this study, visual RT-LAMP assay for hMPV was performed in one step with the addition of hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB), and were used to detect respiratory samples. Six primers, including two outer primers (F3 and B3), two inner primers (FIP, BIP) and two loop primers (LF and LB), were designed for hMPV N gene by the online software. Moreover, the RT-LAMP assay showed good specificity and no cross-reactivity was observed with human rhinovirus (HRV), human respiratory syncytial Virus (RSV), or influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). The detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was approximately ten viral RNA copies, lower than that of traditional reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 100 RNA copies. In the 176 nasopharyngeal samples, 23 (13.1%) were conformed as hMPV positive by RT-LAMP, but 18 (10.2%) positive by RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional RT-PCR, the visual hMPV RT-LAMP assay performed well in the aspect of detect time, sensitivity, specificity and visibility. It is anticipated that the RT-LAMP will be used for clinical tests in hospital or field testing during outbreaks and in emergency.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.170004086,0.079766233,0.315636379,0.236470575,0.005419745,-0.182051732,-0.008123652,-0.0917761,0.091770406,-0.161335716,0.015751189,-0.004398428,-0.157717743,0.165475573,-0.184731204,-0.011442169,0.100718265,0.252493745,-0.235692885,0.079941604,0.002214461,0.005778522,-0.102920659,0.206184723,0.069288645,0.076237039,-0.184848399,0.003690315,0.003273073,-0.032613992
D471G Mutation in LCMV-NP Affects its Ability to Self-associate and Results in a Dominant Negative Effect in Viral RNA Synthesis,"Arenaviruses merit significant interest because several family members are etiological agents of severe hemorrhagic fevers, representing a major burden to public health. Currently, there are no FDA-licensed vaccines against arenaviruses and the only available antiviral therapy is limited to the use of ribavirin that is partially effective. Arenavirus nucleoprotein (NP) is found associated with the genomic RNA forming the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) that together with the polymerase (L) direct viral replication and transcription. Virion formation requires the recruitment of vRNPs into budding sites, a process in which the arenavirus matrix-like protein (Z) plays a major role. Therefore, proper NP-NP and NP-Z interactions are required for the generation of infectious progeny. In this work we demonstrate the role of the amino acid residue D471 in the self-association of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus nucleoprotein (LCMV-NP). Amino acid substitutions at this position abrogate NP oligomerization, affecting its ability to mediate replication and transcription of a minigenome reporter plasmid. However, its ability to interact with the Z protein, counteract the cellular interferon response and bind to dsRNA analogs was retained. Additionally, we also document the dominant negative effect of D471G mutation on viral infection, suggesting that NP self-association is an excellent target for the development of new antivirals against arenaviruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.101494629,-0.04450498,-0.026088498,-0.002251791,-0.084824094,0.050813789,0.038202796,-0.013394541,0.030691767,0.028053426,-0.022258379,-0.00095157,0.011221023,-0.025051428,-0.010588802,-0.018075059,-0.007057899,0.017691598,-0.016180876,0.036663312,-0.027456017,0.015707099,-0.045479217,-0.008307657,0.033756703,0.015911201,0.02932076,-0.049712392,-0.02388418,0.029072052
Genomic Sequences of two Novel Levivirus Single-Stranded RNA Coliphages (Family Leviviridae): Evidence for Recombinationin Environmental Strains,"Bacteriophages are likely the most abundant entities in the aquatic environment, yet knowledge of their ecology is limited. During a fecal source-tracking study, two genetically novel Leviviridae strains were discovered. Although the novel strains were isolated from coastal waters 1130 km apart (North Carolina and Rhode Island, USA), these strains shared 97% nucleotide similarity and 97–100% amino acid similarity. When the novel strains were compared to nine Levivirus genogroup I strains, they shared 95–100% similarity among the maturation, capsid and lysis proteins, but only 84–85% in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene. Further bioinformatic analyses suggested a recombination event occurred.

Bovine herpes virus type 1 induces apoptosis through Fas-dependent and mitochondria-controlled manner in Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells,"BACKGROUND: Bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) is an important pathogen in cattle that is responsible for substantial economic losses. Previous studies suggest that BHV-1 may induce apoptosis in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells via a mechanism only involving caspases and p53. However, the mechanism for BHV-1-induced MDBK cell apoptosis still requires more research. METHODS: MDBK was used as a model to study the precise signaling pathways of apoptosis induced by BHV-1 infection. RESULTS: BHV-1 infection activated a Fas/FasL-mediated apoptotic pathway, resulting in activation of caspase-8 and cleavage of Bid. In addition, BHV-1 infection down-regulated Bcl-2 and up-regulated Bax expression, thereby initiating the release of cytochrome c followed by caspase-9 activation. The combined activation of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways resulted in activation of downstream effecter caspase-3 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), leading to apoptosis. Furthermore, blocking apoptosis using caspase inhibitors improved BHV-1-infected MDBK cell viability to different extent. BHV-1 infection did not induce significant DNA fragmentation in MDBK cells pretreated with ammonium chloride (NH(4)Cl) or cells infected with UV-inactivated BHV-1. Blocking caspases activation increased BHV-1 replication. CONCLUSIONS: BHV-1 induces apoptosis in MDBK cells through extrinsic and intrinsic pathways and there might be cross-talk between the two pathways. In addition, BHV-1 replication may be necessary for the induction of apoptosis in BHV-1-infected cells, and prolonged cell viability benefits BHV-1 replication.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.071266456,-0.035356593,0.00013105,-0.105859303,-0.081426949,0.049583508,0.034171535,-0.036131986,0.060329999,-0.026625053,-0.031078051,-0.01517732,-0.024010781,0.067471809,0.010073709,0.050623932,-0.012960093,-0.029707257,0.008315655,-0.00628814,0.034072846,-0.000889309,0.01455209,-0.019293758,0.036650782,0.011119824,-0.046731398,0.046215746,0.002551747,-0.064071051
Diagnostic value of respiratory virus detection in symptomatic children using real-time PCR,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory tract infections are an important public health problem. Sensitive and rapid diagnostic techniques have been developed and are used in daily clinical practice. Here we evaluate the clinical relevance of detecting 20 common respiratory pathogens by molecular methods in a general pediatric clinic. METHODS: Nasopharynx samples of children < 18 years of age with respiratory symptoms referred to a general pediatric clinic were tested for the presence of 19 viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, using real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Of 177 patients included in this retrospective study, 73% were positive for at least one virus. Respiratory syncytial virus (36.6%) and human rhinovirus (24%) were most frequently detected. Patients in whom a respiratory virus or Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected, were younger (6 versus 24 months; p < 0.001) and more often hospitalized (116 versus 34; p = 0.001) than patients in whom no respiratory pathogen was detected. Also they were more likely to present with feeding problems, dyspnea, rhinorrhea and wheezing (all p < 0.05) than patients without a respiratory pathogen. In the majority of cases, clinicians did not change their antibiotic management after detecting a viral respiratory pathogen. No difference in mean Ct value was found between patients with one respiratory pathogen and those with >1 respiratory pathogen (30.5 versus 31.2; p = 0.573).

Diversity of Salmonella spp. serovars isolated from the intestines of water buffalo calves with gastroenteritis,"BACKGROUND: Salmonellosis in water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) calves is a widespread disease characterized by severe gastrointestinal lesions, profuse diarrhea and severe dehydration, occasionally exhibiting a systemic course. Several Salmonella serovars seem to be able to infect water buffalo, but Salmonella isolates collected from this animal species have been poorly characterized. In the present study, the prevalence of Salmonella spp. in water buffalo calves affected by lethal gastroenteritis was assessed, and a polyphasic characterization of isolated strains of S. Typhimurium was performed. RESULTS: The microbiological analysis of the intestinal contents obtained from 248 water buffalo calves affected by lethal gastroenteritis exhibited a significant prevalence of Salmonella spp. (25%), characterized by different serovars, most frequently Typhimurium (21%), Muenster (11%), and Give (11%). The 13 S. Typhimurium isolates were all associated with enterocolitis characterized by severe damage of the intestine, and only sporadically isolated with another possible causative agent responsible for gastroenteritis, such as Cryptosporidium spp., Rotavirus or Clostridium perfringens. Other Salmonella isolates were mostly isolated from minor intestinal lesions, and often (78% of cases) isolated with other microorganisms, mainly toxinogenic Escherichia coli (35%), Cryptosporidium spp. (20%) and Rotavirus (10%). The S. Typhimurium strains were characterized by phage typing and further genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of 24 virulence genes. The isolates exhibited nine different phage types and 10 different genetic profiles. Three monophasic S. Typhimurium (B:4,12:i:-) isolates were also found and characterized, displaying three different phage types and three different virulotypes. The molecular characterization was extended to the 7 S. Muenster and 7 S. Give isolates collected, indicating the existence of different virulotypes also within these serovars. Three representative strains of S. Typhimurium were tested in vivo in a mouse model of mixed infection. The most pathogenic strain was characterized by a high number of virulence factors and the presence of the locus agfA, coding for a thin aggregative fimbria. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence that Salmonella is frequently associated with gastroenteritis in water buffalo calves, particularly S. Typhimurium. Moreover, the variety in the number and distribution of different virulence markers among the collected S. Typhimurium strains suggests that within this serovar there are different pathotypes potentially responsible for different clinical syndromes.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.012935886,-0.011327781,0.045719191,-0.126256905,0.064093559,0.047913189,0.025020459,-0.022469649,-0.016697852,0.022808553,0.012547275,0.056891035,-0.049731968,-0.034131612,0.05859958,-0.017527131,-0.048235047,-0.000575373,-0.006614087,-0.006044185,0.035817535,0.025542044,-0.016163148,0.028517368,0.020988927,-0.028971679,-0.004135143,-0.007479481,-0.005293594,0.010209156
Respiratory Viruses in Hospitalized Children with Influenza-Like Illness during the H1n1 2009 Pandemic in Sweden,"BACKGROUND: The swine-origin influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic of 2009 had a slower spread in Europe than expected. The human rhinovirus (HRV) has been suggested to have delayed the pandemic through viral interference. The importance of co-infections over time during the pandemic and in terms of severity of the disease needs to be assessed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate respiratory viruses and specifically the presence of co-infections with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (H1N1) in hospitalized children during the H1N1 pandemic. A secondary aim was to investigate if co-infections were associated with severity of disease. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 502 children with influenza-like illness admitted to inpatient care at a pediatric hospital in Stockholm, Sweden during the 6 months spanning the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. Respiratory samples were analyzed for a panel of 16 viruses by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: One or more viruses were detected in 61.6% of the samples. Of these, 85.4% were single infections and 14.6% co-infections (2–4 viruses). The number of co-infections increased throughout the study period. H1N1 was found in 83 (16.5%) children and of these 12 (14.5%) were co-infections. HRV and H1N1 circulated to a large extent at the same time and 6.0% of the H1N1-positive children were also positive for HRV. There was no correlation between co-infections and severity of disease in children with H1N1. CONCLUSIONS: Viral co-infections were relatively common in H1N1 infected hospitalized children and need to be considered when estimating morbidity attributed to H1N1. Population-based longitudinal studies with repeated sampling are needed to improve the understanding of the importance of co-infections and viral interference.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.204191289,-0.130401347,-0.050837433,0.127586568,0.007095058,0.11074253,-0.019358964,-0.035744293,0.030529585,-0.043696606,0.024294953,0.002559135,0.006654905,-0.042548534,0.055500296,0.013406471,-0.017470616,-0.023447491,-0.008816368,-0.078508451,-0.016421131,0.019211213,-0.100883742,0.016854911,-0.140732689,0.128655905,-0.103024096,-0.007458162,0.107766071,0.161750521
Debate around infection-dependent hemophagocytic syndrome in paediatrics,"BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is clinically defined as a combination of fever, liver dysfunction, coagulation abnormalities, pancytopenia, progressive macrophage proliferation throughout the reticuloendothelial system, and cytokine over-production, and may be primary or secondary to infectious, auto-immune, and tumoral diseases. The most consistent association is with viral infections but, as it is still debated whether any micro-organisms are involved in its pathogenesis, we critically appraised the literature concerning HPS and its relationship with infections. DISCUSSION: Infection-dependent HPS has been widely observed, but there are no data concerning its incidence in children. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of HPS may clarify the interactions between the immune system and the variously implicated potential infectious agents. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has been prominently associated with HPS, with clonal proliferation and the hyperactivation of EBV-infected T cells. However, a number of other viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections have been reported in association with HPS. In the case of low-risk HPS, corticosteroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulin or cyclosporine A may be sufficient to control the biological process, but etoposide is recommended as a means of reversing infection-dependent lymphohistiocytic dysregulation in high-risk cases. SUMMARY: HPS is a potential complication of various infections. A polymerase chain reaction search for infectious agents including EBV, cytomegalovirus and Leishmania is recommended in clinical settings characterised by non-remitting fever, organomegaly, cytopenia and hyperferritinemia.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.032869292,-0.044150942,-0.036462772,-0.067625211,-0.07098982,0.024474737,0.076475614,-0.009792941,0.05261762,0.061195106,0.020358123,-0.048635278,0.03945041,-0.029234313,0.024604339,0.010469474,-0.037112159,0.013276051,-0.040426253,0.008143098,-0.040676118,0.02326558,-0.048318143,-0.018899426,0.008905306,-0.007789038,0.009008699,-0.012768879,0.028160872,0.00484843
Aerobiology and Its Role in the Transmission of Infectious Diseases,"Aerobiology plays a fundamental role in the transmission of infectious diseases. As infectious disease and infection control practitioners continue employing contemporary techniques (e.g., computational fluid dynamics to study particle flow, polymerase chain reaction methodologies to quantify particle concentrations in various settings, and epidemiology to track the spread of disease), the central variables affecting the airborne transmission of pathogens are becoming better known. This paper reviews many of these aerobiological variables (e.g., particle size, particle type, the duration that particles can remain airborne, the distance that particles can travel, and meteorological and environmental factors), as well as the common origins of these infectious particles. We then review several real-world settings with known difficulties controlling the airborne transmission of infectious particles (e.g., office buildings, healthcare facilities, and commercial airplanes), while detailing the respective measures each of these industries is undertaking in its effort to ameliorate the transmission of airborne infectious diseases.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.017767814,-0.001079194,0.034669301,-0.068507476,-0.022330575,0.060701612,0.040882304,0.025201399,0.028071348,0.052579611,0.008916691,-0.016254312,0.021498146,-0.060694788,0.053704044,0.046289219,-0.059709296,0.010714649,-0.042638589,-0.007304029,-0.020063348,-0.001444434,-0.018497637,-0.056158412,-0.003922627,0.010305892,-0.012672712,0.009397902,-0.028549538,-0.001118566
Detection of Bocavirus in Children Suffering from Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in Saudi Arabia,"Human bocavirus (HBoV) was recently discovered in children with respiratory distress and/or diarrhea. To our knowledge, no previous study has reported the existence of bocavirus in Saudi Arabia. Swabs samples from 80 children with respiratory tract infections were examined for the presence of HBoV. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used as a sensitive method to detect the HBoV. Direct gene sequencing was used to determine the genotype of the detected virus isolates. HBoV was detected in 22.5% of the examined patients. The NP1 partial gene sequence from all patients showed that the circulated strains were related to HBoV-1 genotype. Most of HBoV infected patients showed evidence of mixed coinfection with other viral pathogens. The current study clearly demonstrated that genetically conserved HBoV1 circulates in Saudi Arabia. Interestingly, most of the HBoV1 infected cases were associated with high rates of co-infections with other viruses.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.116835533,-0.049183925,-0.026647076,-0.057974501,0.072435967,-0.079791155,0.02178165,0.000199097,0.025568497,0.048057984,-0.034077569,0.018339126,0.014104637,0.017814035,0.012679499,-0.050567929,-0.046150127,-0.017894468,0.009567953,0.015202541,0.041503604,0.065165295,-0.002668734,0.081690328,-0.081463458,0.022679608,-0.080723327,0.010400016,8.87E-05,0.05440832
An Upstream Open Reading Frame Modulates Ebola Virus Polymerase Translation and Virus Replication,"Ebolaviruses, highly lethal zoonotic pathogens, possess longer genomes than most other non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses due in part to long 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) present in the seven viral transcriptional units. To date, specific functions have not been assigned to these UTRs. With reporter assays, we demonstrated that the Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) 5′-UTRs lack internal ribosomal entry site function. However, the 5′-UTRs do differentially regulate cap-dependent translation when placed upstream of a GFP reporter gene. Most dramatically, the 5′-UTR derived from the viral polymerase (L) mRNA strongly suppressed translation of GFP compared to a β-actin 5′-UTR. The L 5′-UTR is one of four viral genes to possess upstream AUGs (uAUGs), and ablation of each uAUG enhanced translation of the primary ORF (pORF), most dramatically in the case of the L 5′-UTR. The L uAUG was sufficient to initiate translation, is surrounded by a “weak” Kozak sequence and suppressed pORF translation in a position-dependent manner. Under conditions where eIF2α was phosphorylated, the presence of the uORF maintained translation of the L pORF, indicating that the uORF modulates L translation in response to cellular stress. To directly address the role of the L uAUG in virus replication, a recombinant EBOV was generated in which the L uAUG was mutated to UCG. Strikingly, mutating two nucleotides outside of previously-defined protein coding and cis-acting regulatory sequences attenuated virus growth to titers 10–100-fold lower than a wild-type virus in Vero and A549 cells. The mutant virus also exhibited decreased viral RNA synthesis as early as 6 hours post-infection and enhanced sensitivity to the stress inducer thapsigargin. Cumulatively, these data identify novel mechanisms by which EBOV regulates its polymerase expression, demonstrate their relevance to virus replication and identify a potential therapeutic target.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.149407812,-0.067663155,-0.032406236,0.007337581,-0.043383991,-0.013982405,-0.0317964,0.006595178,0.012835068,-0.003222409,-0.056241227,-0.070941463,0.013298748,0.032037449,-0.02064705,-0.024459171,0.011589663,-0.047862366,-0.029721864,0.024838393,-0.010625703,0.036595335,-0.020310912,0.036211278,-0.014634091,-0.070036347,0.012979667,0.007146849,0.05160126,0.005077469
Prescription Surveillance and Polymerase Chain Reaction Testing to Identify Pathogens during Outbreaks of Infection,"Syndromic surveillance, including prescription surveillance, offers a rapid method for the early detection of agents of bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases. However, it has the disadvantage of not considering definitive diagnoses. Here, we attempted to definitively diagnose pathogens using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) immediately after the prescription surveillance system detected an outbreak. Specimens were collected from 50 patients with respiratory infections. PCR was used to identify the pathogens, which included 14 types of common respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Infectious agents including M. pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, enterovirus, and parainfluenza virus were detected in 54% of patients. For the rapid RSV diagnosis kit, sensitivity was 80% and specificity was 85%. For the rapid adenovirus diagnosis kit, no positive results were obtained; therefore, sensitivity could not be calculated and specificity was 100%. Many patients were found to be treated for upper respiratory tract infections without the diagnosis of a specific pathogen. In Japan, an outbreak of M. pneumoniae infection began in 2011, and our results suggested that this outbreak may have included false-positive cases. By combining syndromic surveillance and PCR, we were able to rapidly and accurately identify causative pathogens during a recent respiratory infection outbreak.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.244079601,-0.014010455,0.037808156,0.061236641,-0.006723071,-0.069904702,-0.000251645,0.01651385,-0.024944785,0.099950683,-0.012023856,-0.060931932,0.044666298,-0.032750454,0.028171455,-0.058249554,0.019429611,0.003678952,0.022362413,-0.03451777,0.024196568,-0.049917109,0.062605251,-0.062827931,0.100544748,-0.033340351,0.045399774,0.12916352,-0.026120771,-0.056255051
First introduction of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 and detection of respiratory viruses in pediatric patients in Central African Republic,"BACKGROUND: Acute viral respiratory illnesses in children in sub-Saharan Africa have received relatively little attention, although they are much more frequent causes of morbidity and mortality than in developed countries. Active surveillance is essential to identify the causative agents and to improve clinical management, especially in the context of possible circulation of pandemic viruses. FINDINGS: A prospective study was conducted in the Central African Republic (CAR) between January and December 2010 among infants and children aged 0–15 years attending sentinel sites for influenza-like illness or acute respiratory illness. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected, and one-step real-time and multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to detect respiratory viruses. Respiratory viruses were detected in 49 of the 329 (14.9%) nasopharyngeal samples: 29 (8.8%) contained influenza viruses (5 (1.5%) had pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus and 24 (7.3%) had influenza B viruses), 11 (3.3%) contained parainfluenza viruses types 1 and 3 and 9 (2.7%) contained human respiratory syncytial virus. Most cases were detected during the rainy season in the CAR. Analysis of the amplicon sequences confirmed the identity of each detected virus. CONCLUSIONS: The influenza surveillance system in the CAR has provided valuable data on the seasonality of influenza and the circulation of other respiratory viruses. Our network could therefore play a valuable role in the prevention and control of influenza epidemics in the CAR.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.26990277,-0.150822372,-0.08397232,0.274320278,0.083161274,0.206694461,-0.090232581,-0.040873961,0.011857798,-0.042820436,0.01200743,-0.027027754,0.040226452,-0.030609814,0.06021066,-0.030094813,0.006659371,-0.099031505,0.041574921,-0.00682786,-0.003367576,0.01153904,-0.027267533,0.028657292,-0.005060377,0.023547663,-0.057448513,0.062644121,0.021924085,-0.089310098
"Accuracy of IgM antibody testing, FQ-PCR and culture in laboratory diagnosis of acute infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae in adults and adolescents with community-acquired pneumonia","BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae in adults and adolescents is hampered by a lack of rapid and standardized tests for detection. METHODS: CAP patients from 12 teaching hospitals were prospectively and consecutively recruited. Basic and clinical information, throat swabs and paired sera were collected. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected by IgG and IgM antibody tests, fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR) and culture. A comparative study of the diagnostic values of three methods, including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and positive likelihood ratio (PLR) was conducted. A fourfold or greater increase of IgG antibody titers of paired sera was set as the diagnostic “gold standard”. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-five CAP patients (52.8% males, median age 47 years, range 14–85) were enrolled. Twenty-seven (21.6%) patients were diagnosed with acute Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections by the “gold standard”. Specificity values of all three methods were around 90%. An increasing trend of sensitivity, positive predictive value and PLR was found, with the lowest in IgM testing (7.4%, 28.6% and 1.45), intermediate in FQ-PCR (40.7%, 50% and 3.63), and highest in culture (55.6%, 75% and 10.9). CONCLUSIONS: In the defined group of patients, there was a good agreement between positive rate of MP cultivation of throat swabs and acute M. pneumoniae infection (PLR of 10.9). Since the sensitivity is low in all of the evaluated methods, the logical approach would be to incorporate PCR, culture and serological tests for optimum diagnosis of acute Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in adults and adolescents.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.185774729,-0.000304316,0.034088498,-0.068370742,-0.072717567,-0.067438923,-0.029062757,0.073306947,-0.176483442,0.062808996,-0.038647986,-0.012473674,0.021963084,-0.022261523,-0.040603213,-0.036823466,0.012074896,0.01317551,-0.024713012,-0.053087661,-0.042031279,0.057651449,0.210646118,-0.050203492,0.079681986,-0.010097276,0.01379167,0.037110986,0.048252111,0.001721002
"Viral Aetiology in Adults with Acute Upper Respiratory Tract Infection in Jinan, Northern China","Our study investigated the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in adult patients with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) between August 2009 and September 2010 in Jinan, northern China. Nasal and throat swabs (n = 596) were collected from adult patients with URTIs. Nine respiratory-related viruses, including IFV, PIV, HRV, HMPV, HBoV, HCoV, ADV, RSV, and EV, were detected in all samples by conventional and reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions. Positive detection rate for respiratory virus was 38.76% and codetection rate was 4.70% in adults with acute respiratory tract infections. IFV (20.81%) was the dominant agent detected and IFVB had a higher incidence (12.58%) than IFVA (7.72%). Detection rates of 8.22%, 5.03%, 3.69%, and 2.52% were observed for HBoV, HRV, EV, and RSV, respectively. HCoV had the lowest detection rate of 0.50%. HBoV, HRV, EV, and ADV infection rates were higher in the 14–25-year-old group than in the 26–65-year-old group. Codetection rates were higher (7.52%) in the 14–25-year-old group than in the older age group (2.64%). The spectrum of respiratory virus infection in adult patients with URTIs was different in Jinan compared with other cities in China.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.237706157,-0.090809547,-0.086550472,-0.013724486,0.08990302,-0.118639373,0.045305657,-0.041369676,0.03192372,-0.026532248,-0.001388331,0.065053601,-0.012255326,0.081075902,-0.009780403,-0.018828979,-0.028886187,0.007183729,0.024414376,0.023839056,0.036890703,-0.136765486,-0.055829577,0.024113813,-0.054138453,0.031402403,-0.039879936,0.039894276,0.000383259,0.108599553
Transcription analysis of the porcine alveolar macrophage response to porcine circovirus type 2,"BACKGROUND: Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the causal agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), which has severely impacted the swine industry worldwide. PCV2 triggers a weak and atypical innate immune response, but the key genes and mechanisms by which the virus interferes with host innate immunity have not yet been elucidated. In this study, genes that control the response of primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), the main target of PCV2, were profiled in vitro. RESULTS: PAMs were successfully infected by PCV2-WH strain, as evidenced quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) results. Infection-related differential gene expression was investigated using pig microarrays from the US Pig Genome Coordination Program and validated by real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Microarray analysis at 24 and 48 hours post-infection (HPI) revealed 266 and 175 unique genes, respectively, that were differentially expressed (false discovery rate <0.05; fold-change >2). Only six genes were differentially expressed between 24 and 48 HPI. The up-regulated genes were principally related to immune response, cytokine activity, locomotion, regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell growth arrest, and antigen procession and presentation. The down-regulated genes were mainly involved in terpenoid biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, translation, proteasome degradation, signal transducer activity, and ribosomal proteins, which were representative of the reduced vital activity of PCV2-infected cells. CONCLUSIONS: PCV2 infection of PAMs causes up-regulation of genes related to inflammation, indicating that PCV2 may induce systematic inflammation. PCV2 persistently induced cytokines, mainly through the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1 and TLR9 pathways, which may promote high levels of cytokine secretion. PCV2 may prevent apoptosis in PAMs by up-regulating SERPINB9 expression, possibly to lengthen the duration of PCV2 replication-permissive conditions. The observed gene expression profile may provide insights into the underlying immunological response and pathological changes that occur in pigs following PCV2 infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.070667951,-0.014623208,0.04065685,-0.132540315,-0.059082145,0.06228973,0.019885671,-0.04617098,0.078687652,-0.04583982,-0.065221554,-0.035500408,-0.050115073,0.103429263,0.050424097,-0.074449946,0.003102827,-0.076139823,-0.025852518,-0.01520884,0.034742685,-0.008293089,0.045909113,-0.025910114,-0.06575932,-0.039169125,-0.001164123,0.039354651,0.038188777,-0.067658008
Evaluation and molecular characterization of human adenovirus in drinking water supplies: viral integrity and viability assays,"BACKGROUND: Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are the second-leading cause of childhood gastroenteritis worldwide. This virus is commonly found in environmental waters and is very resistant to water disinfection and environmental stressors, especially UV light inactivation. Molecular techniques, such as PCR-based methods (Polymerase Chain Reaction), are commonly used to detect and identify viral contamination in water, although PCR alone does not allow the discrimination between infectious and non-infectious viral particles. A combination of cell culture and PCR has allowed detection of infectious viruses that grow slowly or fail to produce cytopathic effects (CPE) in cell culture. This study aimed to assess the integrity and viability of human adenovirus (HAdV) in environmental water and evaluate circulating strains by molecular characterization in three sites of the water supply in Florianópolis, Santa Catarina Island, Brazil: Peri Lagoon water, spring source water, and water from the public water supply system. METHODS: Water samples were collected, concentrated and HAdV quantified by real-time PCR. Viral integrity was evaluated by enzymatic assay (DNase I) and infectivity by plaque assay (PA) and integrated cell culture using transcribed mRNA (ICC-RT-qPCR). Samples containing particles of infectious HAdV were selected for sequencing and molecular characterization. RESULTS: The analyzed sites contained 83, 66 and 58% undamaged HAdV particles (defined as those in which the genetic material is protected by the viral capsid) at Peri Lagoon, spring source water and public supply system water, respectively. Of these, 66% of the particles (by PA) and 75% (by ICC-RT-qPCR) HAdV were shown to be infectious, due to being undamaged in Peri Lagoon, 33% (by PA) and 58% (by ICC-RT-qPCR) in spring source water and 8% (by PA) and 25% (by ICC-RT-qPCR) in the public water supply system. ICC-RT-qPCR, a very sensitive and rapid technique, was able to detect as low as 1 × 10(2) HAdV genome copies per milliliter of infectious viral particles in the environmental water samples. The molecular characterization studies indicated that HAdV-2 was the prevalent serotype. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate a lack of proper public health measures. We suggest that HAdV can be efficiently used as a marker of environmental and drinking water contamination and ICC-RT-qPCR demonstrated greater sensitivity and speed of detection of infectious viral particles compared to PA.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.00271302,0.010858869,0.128103679,-0.017708123,-0.008888015,0.011473949,0.030737689,-0.019891521,0.002385039,0.021471719,-0.01995939,-0.008300929,-0.015711385,0.015662664,0.0412391,-0.012975922,-0.039223527,0.003645666,-0.04990921,-0.068010855,0.00982005,0.150725265,0.001199937,0.047650913,-0.078732609,0.08577651,0.014917631,0.149308528,-0.096963802,0.012177812
"Comparison among nasopharyngeal swab, nasal wash, and oropharyngeal swab for respiratory virus detection in adults with acute pharyngitis","BACKGROUND: Acute pharyngitis is frequently seen in primary care. Acute viral pharyngitis may be easily misdiagnosed as acute bacterial pharyngitis. Laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of respiratory viruses is recommended. The purpose of this study was to compare the sensitivities among oropharyngeal swab (OPS), nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), and nasal wash (NW) in adults with acute pharyngitis. METHODS: OPS, NPS, and NW were obtained from each participant with acute pharyngitis. The specimens were tested for 15 respiratory viruses by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction. A sample was considered to be a true positive if any of the specimens was positive. The sensitivities among samples were compared by chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. RESULTS: One hundred three triple samples collected consecutively by OPS, NPS, and NW were obtained. In 73 patients, one or more viruses were detected by any of the three methods. Among all viruses, the sensitivity of NPS was significantly higher than that of NW (74% vs. 49%, respectively; p < 0.01) and OPS (74% vs. 49%, respectively; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Flocked NPS collection may be the most effective alternative to NW and OPS for detection of respiratory viruses in adults with acute pharyngitis using TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.118049243,-0.006346862,0.015569085,-0.009205063,0.002729027,-0.03571327,0.011926706,0.003759166,-0.044424591,0.01408151,-0.002152799,0.001254093,-0.001719679,-0.002142184,0.024055134,-0.013576598,-0.003989373,-0.068533499,0.047550581,-0.053765048,-0.008110315,-0.016398844,-0.016144658,-0.02231855,-0.004000826,0.023184257,-0.031441484,-0.011946609,-0.00669987,-0.080229404
Real-Time Fluorescence Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification for the Detection of Acinetobacter baumannii,"BACKGROUND: Detection of Acinetobacter baumannii has been relying primarily on bacterial culture that often fails to return useful results in time. Although DNA-based assays are more sensitive than bacterial culture in detecting the pathogen, the molecular results are often inconsistent and challenged by doubts on false positives, such as those due to system- and environment-derived contaminations. In addition, these molecular tools require expensive laboratory instruments. Therefore, establishing molecular tools for field use require simpler molecular platforms. The loop-mediated isothermal amplification method is relatively simple and can be improved for better use in a routine clinical bacteriology laboratory. A simple and portable device capable of performing both the amplification and detection (by fluorescence) of LAMP in the same platform has been developed in recent years. This method is referred to as real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification. In this study, we attempted to utilize this method for rapid detection of A. baumannii. METHODOLOGY AND SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS: Species-specific primers were designed to test the utility of this method. Clinical samples of A. baumannii were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of this system compared to bacterial culture and a polymerase chain reaction method. All positive samples isolated from sputum were confirmed to be the species of Acinetobacter by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The RealAmp method was found to be simpler and allowed real-time detection of DNA amplification, and could distinguish A. baumannii from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Acinetobacter genomic species 3. DNA was extracted by simple boiling method. Compared to bacterial culture, the sensitivity and specificity of RealAmp in detecting A. baumannii was 98.9% and 75.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The RealAmp assay only requires a single unit, and the assay positivity can be verified by visual inspection. Therefore, this assay has great potential of field use as a molecular tool for detection of A. baumannii.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.034237848,0.073105389,0.249621591,0.038590634,-0.066084236,-0.043173866,0.054530113,0.018275419,-0.043785422,0.014855162,-0.09294388,-0.010523924,0.039581134,-0.082444215,-0.046719432,0.045279167,-0.046322089,-0.00155237,-0.04080659,0.00443201,-0.059711235,-0.049577241,0.053320456,0.0047022,-0.004529886,-0.017810165,-0.08296589,0.069060621,-0.05329194,0.04106166
The incidence and aetiology of hospitalised community-acquired pneumonia among Vietnamese adults: a prospective surveillance in Central Vietnam,"BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common infectious disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The patterns of aetiological pathogens differ by region and country. Special attention must be paid to CAP in Southeast Asia (SEA), a region facing rapid demographic transition. Estimates burden and aetiological patterns of CAP are essential for the clinical and public health management. The purposes of the study are to determine the incidence, aetiological pathogens, clinical pictures and risk factors of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the Vietnamese adult population. METHODS: A prospective surveillance for hospitalised adult CAP was conducted in Khanh Hoa Province, Central Vietnam. All adults aged ≥15 years with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) admitted to a provincial hospital from September 2009 to August 2010 were enrolled in the study. Patients were classified into CAP and non-pneumonic LRTI (NPLRTI) according to the radiological findings. Bacterial pathogens were identified from sputum samples by the conventional culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis; 13 respiratory viruses were identified from nasopharyngeal specimens by PCR. RESULTS: Of all 367 LRTI episodes examined, 174 (47%) were CAP. Older age, the presence of underlying respiratory conditions, and higher index score of smoking were associated with CAP. The one-year estimated incidence of hospitalised adult CAP in our study population was 0.81 per 1,000 person years. The incidence increased considerably with age and was highest among the elderly. The case fatality proportion of hospitalised CAP patients was 9.8%. Among 286 sputum samples tested for bacterial PCR, 79 (28%) were positive for H. influenzae, and 65 (23%) were positive for S. pneumoniae. Among 357 samples tested for viral PCR, 73 (21%) were positive for respiratory viruses; influenza A (n = 32, 9%) was the most common. CONCLUSIONS: The current adult CAP incidence in Vietnam was relatively low; this result was mainly attributed to the young age of our study population.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.225221297,-0.090912595,-0.073709669,-0.025605091,-0.005018767,-0.059323807,-0.024300248,0.072509372,-0.150123259,0.077951216,-0.047707341,-0.003849946,0.012871456,-0.023725977,-0.076145891,-0.06130435,0.002750391,-0.026157555,-0.06283713,0.072451177,-0.013988517,0.128168116,0.234725834,0.074126383,0.150926294,-0.102470053,-0.014677955,0.075684073,0.208151108,0.023869156
"Comprehensive analysis of the HEPN superfamily: identification of novel roles in intra-genomic conflicts, defense, pathogenesis and RNA processing","BACKGROUND: The major role of enzymatic toxins that target nucleic acids in biological conflicts at all levels has become increasingly apparent thanks in large part to the advances of comparative genomics. Typically, toxins evolve rapidly hampering the identification of these proteins by sequence analysis. Here we analyze an unexpectedly widespread superfamily of toxin domains most of which possess RNase activity. RESULTS: The HEPN superfamily is comprised of all α-helical domains that were first identified as being associated with DNA polymerase β-type nucleotidyltransferases in prokaryotes and animal Sacsin proteins. Using sensitive sequence and structure comparison methods, we vastly extend the HEPN superfamily by identifying numerous novel families and by detecting diverged HEPN domains in several known protein families. The new HEPN families include the RNase LS and LsoA catalytic domains, KEN domains (e.g. RNaseL and Ire1) and the RNase domains of RloC and PrrC. The majority of HEPN domains contain conserved motifs that constitute a metal-independent endoRNase active site. Some HEPN domains lacking this motif probably function as non-catalytic RNA-binding domains, such as in the case of the mannitol repressor MtlR. Our analysis shows that HEPN domains function as toxins that are shared by numerous systems implicated in intra-genomic, inter-genomic and intra-organismal conflicts across the three domains of cellular life. In prokaryotes HEPN domains are essential components of numerous toxin-antitoxin (TA) and abortive infection (Abi) systems and in addition are tightly associated with many restriction-modification (R-M) and CRISPR-Cas systems, and occasionally with other defense systems such as Pgl and Ter. We present evidence of multiple modes of action of HEPN domains in these systems, which include direct attack on viral RNAs (e.g. LsoA and RNase LS) in conjunction with other RNase domains (e.g. a novel RNase H fold domain, NamA), suicidal or dormancy-inducing attack on self RNAs (RM systems and possibly CRISPR-Cas systems), and suicidal attack coupled with direct interaction with phage components (Abi systems). These findings are compatible with the hypothesis on coupling of pathogen-targeting (immunity) and self-directed (programmed cell death and dormancy induction) responses in the evolution of robust antiviral strategies. We propose that altruistic cell suicide mediated by HEPN domains and other functionally similar RNases was essential for the evolution of kin and group selection and cell cooperation. HEPN domains were repeatedly acquired by eukaryotes and incorporated into several core functions such as endonucleolytic processing of the 5.8S-25S/28S rRNA precursor (Las1), a novel ER membrane-associated RNA degradation system (C6orf70), sensing of unprocessed transcripts at the nuclear periphery (Swt1). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that, similar to prokaryotes, HEPN proteins were recruited to antiviral, antitransposon, apoptotic systems or RNA-level response to unfolded proteins (Sacsin and KEN domains) in several groups of eukaryotes. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive sequence and structure comparisons reveal unexpectedly broad presence of the HEPN domain in an enormous variety of defense and stress response systems across the tree of life. In addition, HEPN domains have been recruited to perform essential functions, in particular in eukaryotic rRNA processing. These findings are expected to stimulate experiments that could shed light on diverse cellular processes across the three domains of life.

Lithium chloride promotes host resistance against Pseudomonas aeruginosa keratitis,"PURPOSE: To explore the role of lithium chloride (LiCl) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) keratitis. METHODS: B6 mice were subconjunctivally injected with LiCl in contrast to appropriate control sodium chloride (NaCl), and then routinely infected with PA. Clinical score, slit-lamp photography, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and bacterial plate counts were used to determine the role of LiCl in PA keratitis. Messenger ribonucleic acid and protein levels of inflammatory cytokines in PA-challenged mouse corneas and in vitro cultured macrophages and neutrophils were measured with real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Apoptosis of the infiltrating inflammatory cells in the PA-infected murine corneas was assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated uridine 5′-triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling staining and propidium iodide staining associated with flow cytometry. In cultured murine macrophages and neutrophils, cell apoptosis was determined with annexin V/propidium iodide double staining associated with flow cytometry and western blot analysis for cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. RESULTS: Treatment with LiCl reduced the severity of corneal disease by reducing corneal inflammatory response and bacterial burden. Moreover, LiCl increased anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 levels, decreased proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α levels, and enhanced apoptosis of infiltrating macrophages and neutrophils in the PA-infected mouse corneas. In vitro studies further confirmed that LiCl elevated anti-inflammatory cytokine expression but reduced proinflammatory cytokine production, as well as promoted cell apoptosis in murine macrophages and neutrophils. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a protective role of LiCl in PA keratitis. LiCl promotes host resistance against PA infection by suppressing inflammatory responses, enhancing inflammatory cell apoptosis, and promoting bacterial clearance.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.055249679,-0.03003794,0.017807836,-0.12442741,-0.107463453,0.063115897,0.029254152,-0.037336729,0.048508753,-0.051644557,-0.052282177,-0.033511678,-0.023367498,0.078060502,-0.022236507,0.027622551,-0.002785247,-0.046423833,-0.021911731,-0.026154935,0.020907881,-0.024710045,0.040275086,0.006327216,0.015390295,0.03104934,-0.017899296,0.028944622,0.02382449,-0.033785256
A Systematic Analysis of Host Factors Reveals a Med23-Interferon-λ Regulatory Axis against Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Replication,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a neurotropic virus causing vesicular oral or genital skin lesions, meningitis and other diseases particularly harmful in immunocompromised individuals. To comprehensively investigate the complex interaction between HSV-1 and its host we combined two genome-scale screens for host factors (HFs) involved in virus replication. A yeast two-hybrid screen for protein interactions and a RNA interference (RNAi) screen with a druggable genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) library confirmed existing and identified novel HFs which functionally influence HSV-1 infection. Bioinformatic analyses found the 358 HFs were enriched for several pathways and multi-protein complexes. Of particular interest was the identification of Med23 as a strongly anti-viral component of the largely pro-viral Mediator complex, which links specific transcription factors to RNA polymerase II. The anti-viral effect of Med23 on HSV-1 replication was confirmed in gain-of-function gene overexpression experiments, and this inhibitory effect was specific to HSV-1, as a range of other viruses including Vaccinia virus and Semliki Forest virus were unaffected by Med23 depletion. We found Med23 significantly upregulated expression of the type III interferon family (IFN-λ) at the mRNA and protein level by directly interacting with the transcription factor IRF7. The synergistic effect of Med23 and IRF7 on IFN-λ induction suggests this is the major transcription factor for IFN-λ expression. Genotypic analysis of patients suffering recurrent orofacial HSV-1 outbreaks, previously shown to be deficient in IFN-λ secretion, found a significant correlation with a single nucleotide polymorphism in the IFN-λ3 (IL28b) promoter strongly linked to Hepatitis C disease and treatment outcome. This paper describes a link between Med23 and IFN-λ, provides evidence for the crucial role of IFN-λ in HSV-1 immune control, and highlights the power of integrative genome-scale approaches to identify HFs critical for disease progression and outcome.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.11835052,-0.053495353,-0.041374977,-0.035508888,-0.095801449,0.035771003,0.037132732,-0.008237145,0.0316576,0.010641699,-0.023607116,-0.050087974,0.012857305,0.081821842,-0.020125853,-0.006018271,-0.003070586,-0.021124522,-0.024858258,0.036578324,0.009401474,0.01939985,-0.041143952,0.024343994,-0.016011302,-0.034769779,0.053778224,-0.030852115,-0.015204552,0.00049873
Identification and Survey of a Novel Avian Coronavirus in Ducks,"The rapid discovery of novel viruses using next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies including DNA-Seq and RNA-Seq, has greatly expanded our understanding of viral diversity in recent years. The timely identification of novel viruses using NGS technologies is also important for us to control emerging infectious diseases caused by novel viruses. In this study, we identified a novel duck coronavirus (CoV), distinct with chicken infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), using RNA-Seq. The novel duck-specific CoV was a potential novel species within the genus Gammacoronavirus, as indicated by sequences of three regions in the viral 1b gene. We also performed a survey of CoVs in domestic fowls in China using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), targeting the viral nucleocapsid (N) gene. A total of 102 CoV positives were identified through the survey. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral N sequences suggested that CoVs in domestic fowls have diverged into several region-specific or host-specific clades or subclades in the world, and IBVs can infect ducks, geese and pigeons, although they mainly circulate in chickens. Moreover, this study provided novel data supporting the notion that some host-specific CoVs other than IBVs circulate in ducks, geese and pigeons, and indicated that the novel duck-specific CoV identified through RNA-Seq in this study is genetically closer to some CoVs circulating in wild water fowls. Taken together, this study shed new insight into the diversity, distribution, evolution and control of avian CoVs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.075451594,0.126303125,-0.00994696,0.040796646,0.170789744,0.086207961,0.091507095,0.044674024,0.012291317,0.100408929,-0.016752001,-0.067058304,-0.006710644,0.032575521,-0.037174345,0.030856853,-0.020833748,0.016054391,-0.025248892,0.023704899,-0.031845271,0.043816341,-0.004663245,0.033141192,-0.021313448,-0.021550287,0.032958627,-0.013207913,0.019017074,0.022733006
Detection and Molecular Diversity of Spike Gene of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus in China,"Since late 2010, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has rapidly disseminated all over the China and caused considerable morbidity and high mortality (up to 100%) in neonatal piglets. 79.66% (141 of 177) pig farms in 29 provinces (excluding Tibet and Hainan, China) and 72.27% (417 of 577) samples were positive for PEDV confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The full-length S genes of representative field strains were sequenced. 33 field strains share 93.5%–99.9% homologies with each other at the nucleotide sequence level and 92.3%–99.8% homologies with each other at the amino acids sequence level. Most field strains have nucleotide deletion and insertion regions, and show lower homologies (93.5%–94.2%) with Chinese classical strain CH/S, however higher homologies (97.1%–99.3%) with recent strain CHGD-1. The phylogenetic analysis showed there are classical strains and variants prevailing in pig herd in China. PEDV has a high detection rate in pig herds in China.

Defects in Base Excision Repair Sensitize Cells to Manganese in S. cerevisiae,"Manganese (Mn) is essential for normal physiologic functioning; therefore, deficiencies and excess intake of manganese can result in disease. In humans, prolonged exposure to manganese causes neurotoxicity characterized by Parkinson-like symptoms. Mn(2+) has been shown to mediate DNA damage possibly through the generation of reactive oxygen species. In a recent publication, we showed that Mn induced oxidative DNA damage and caused lesions in thymines. This study further investigates the mechanisms by which cells process Mn(2+)-mediated DNA damage using the yeast S. cerevisiae. The strains most sensitive to Mn(2+) were those defective in base excision repair, glutathione synthesis, and superoxide dismutase mutants. Mn(2+) caused a dose-dependent increase in the accumulation of mutations using the CAN1 and lys2-10A mutator assays. The spectrum of CAN1 mutants indicates that exposure to Mn results in accumulation of base substitutions and frameshift mutations. The sensitivity of cells to Mn(2+) as well as its mutagenic effect was reduced by N-acetylcysteine, glutathione, and Mg(2+). These data suggest that Mn(2+) causes oxidative DNA damage that requires base excision repair for processing and that Mn interferes with polymerase fidelity. The status of base excision repair may provide a biomarker for the sensitivity of individuals to manganese.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.070652581,-0.020055318,0.023724496,-0.061451107,-0.041645036,0.028156611,0.040674381,-0.006197202,0.006130309,-0.0122296,-0.002114786,0.024997451,-0.031603908,-0.016767802,-0.000775513,0.047667204,-0.033782552,-0.017218845,-0.042461078,-0.024730347,0.031243736,-0.037629416,-0.004580852,0.016164214,-0.004216949,-0.004073136,-0.04765863,0.025589652,-0.005517355,-0.053529008
Efficient generation of recombinant RNA viruses using targeted recombination-mediated mutagenesis of bacterial artificial chromosomes containing full-length cDNA,"BACKGROUND: Infectious cDNA clones are a prerequisite for directed genetic manipulation of RNA viruses. Here, a strategy to facilitate manipulation and rescue of classical swine fever viruses (CSFVs) from full-length cDNAs present within bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) is described. This strategy allows manipulation of viral cDNA by targeted recombination-mediated mutagenesis within bacteria. RESULTS: A new CSFV-BAC (pBeloR26) derived from the Riems vaccine strain has been constructed and subsequently modified in the E2 coding sequence, using the targeted recombination strategy to enable rescue of chimeric pestiviruses (vR26_E2gif and vR26_TAV) with potential as new marker vaccine candidates. Sequencing of the BACs revealed a high genetic stability during passages within bacteria. The complete genome sequences of rescued viruses, after extensive passages in mammalian cells showed that modifications in the E2 protein coding sequence were stably maintained. A single amino acid substitution (D3431G) in the RNA dependent RNA polymerase was observed in the rescued viruses vR26_E2gif and vR26, which was reversion to the parental Riems sequence. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that targeted recombination-mediated mutagenesis provides a powerful tool for expediting the construction of novel RNA genomes and should be applicable to the manipulation of other RNA viruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14855347,-0.055238818,-0.009640272,0.048865377,0.071008857,-0.022824574,-0.033356727,0.025311046,-0.042499407,0.066579049,0.009719006,-0.006704897,0.022046601,-0.04176578,0.030595027,-0.018847408,-0.061272899,-0.014803385,-0.039641424,0.014152663,0.028999069,-0.006756268,0.017470675,0.068265102,-0.067208919,0.002580899,0.058509878,1.79E-05,-0.073037921,0.001626676
Detection of Coronaviruses in Bats of Various Species in Italy,"Bats are natural reservoirs for many mammalian coronaviruses, which have received renewed interest after the discovery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV in humans. This study describes the identification and molecular characterization of alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses in bats in Italy, from 2010 to 2012. Sixty-nine faecal samples and 126 carcasses were tested using pan-coronavirus RT-PCR. Coronavirus RNAs were detected in seven faecal samples and nine carcasses. A phylogenetic analysis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence fragments aided in identifying two alphacoronaviruses from Kuhl’s pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii), three clade 2b betacoronaviruses from lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros), and 10 clade 2c betacoronaviruses from Kuhl’s pipistrelle, common noctule (Nyctalus noctula), and Savi’s pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii). This study fills a substantive gap in the knowledge on bat-CoV ecology in Italy, and extends the current knowledge on clade 2c betacoronaviruses with new sequences obtained from bats that have not been previously described as hosts of these viruses.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.027791522,0.169786718,-0.063907168,0.019049694,0.221405347,0.050855814,0.14550101,0.092878087,-0.032399514,-0.04587426,-0.025287792,-0.090952985,-0.01794199,0.039018721,-0.000622443,0.037585456,0.023010871,0.018623867,0.023647224,-0.019058392,-0.013559351,-0.000693368,0.015616782,-0.036059867,0.046158489,0.002562773,-0.025967478,0.000837493,0.027580409,0.004797122
Diagnosis and treatment of viral diseases in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,"Viral infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic stem cell hematopoietic transplantation (allo-HSCT). Although most viral infections present with asymptomatic or subclinical manifestations, viruses may result in fatal complications in severe immunocompromised recipients. Reactivation of latent viruses, such as herpesviruses, is frequent during the immunosuppression that occurs with allo-HSCT. Viruses acquired from community, such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses, are also important pathogens of post-transplant viral diseases. Currently, molecular diagnostic methods have replaced or supplemented traditional methods, such as viral culture and antigen detection, in diagnosis of viral infections. The utilization of polymerase chain reaction facilitates the early diagnosis. In view of lacking efficacious agents for treatment of viral diseases, prevention of viral infections is extremely valuable. Application of prophylactic strategies including preemptive therapy reduces viral infections and diseases. Adoptive cellular therapy for restoring virus-specific immunity is a promising method in the treatment of viral diseases.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.066140074,-0.069467159,-0.007829909,0.050910748,-0.093297534,-0.000899126,0.124397917,0.006928763,0.018390808,0.166727285,-0.019275791,-0.085941858,0.131205189,-0.004293271,0.056898622,-0.060499444,-0.018194411,0.019343337,-0.029465571,0.055168614,-0.032955679,0.007714,-0.074063439,0.036217975,0.029700655,-0.061554168,0.020026171,-0.078036425,0.030319839,0.003699162
Cell Tropism Predicts Long-term Nucleotide Substitution Rates of Mammalian RNA Viruses,"The high rates of RNA virus evolution are generally attributed to replication with error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. However, these long-term nucleotide substitution rates span three orders of magnitude and do not correlate well with mutation rates or selection pressures. This substitution rate variation may be explained by differences in virus ecology or intrinsic genomic properties. We generated nucleotide substitution rate estimates for mammalian RNA viruses and compiled comparable published rates, yielding a dataset of 118 substitution rates of structural genes from 51 different species, as well as 40 rates of non-structural genes from 28 species. Through ANCOVA analyses, we evaluated the relationships between these rates and four ecological factors: target cell, transmission route, host range, infection duration; and three genomic properties: genome length, genome sense, genome segmentation. Of these seven factors, we found target cells to be the only significant predictors of viral substitution rates, with tropisms for epithelial cells or neurons (P<0.0001) as the most significant predictors. Further, one-tailed t-tests showed that viruses primarily infecting epithelial cells evolve significantly faster than neurotropic viruses (P<0.0001 and P<0.001 for the structural genes and non-structural genes, respectively). These results provide strong evidence that the fastest evolving mammalian RNA viruses infect cells with the highest turnover rates: the highly proliferative epithelial cells. Estimated viral generation times suggest that epithelial-infecting viruses replicate more quickly than viruses with different cell tropisms. Our results indicate that cell tropism is a key factor in viral evolvability.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.129452342,-0.065603437,-0.058296872,0.046995235,0.010018612,0.013116594,0.067548523,0.005444862,-0.033424752,0.043161158,0.00748581,-0.043219654,-0.000544687,0.059698371,0.031035056,0.007547605,-0.044793234,-0.074270374,-0.028732806,0.004158409,0.038160251,-0.011640596,-0.014409587,0.097327636,-0.121946349,-0.024399486,0.077145668,-0.00877635,-0.078632229,-0.06722293
Alphavirus Mutator Variants Present Host-Specific Defects and Attenuation in Mammalian and Insect Models,"Arboviruses cycle through both vertebrates and invertebrates, which requires them to adapt to disparate hosts while maintaining genetic integrity during genome replication. To study the genetic mechanisms and determinants of these processes, we use chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a re-emerging human pathogen transmitted by the Aedes mosquito. We previously isolated a high fidelity (or antimutator) polymerase variant, C483Y, which had decreased fitness in both mammalian and mosquito hosts, suggesting this residue may be a key molecular determinant. To further investigate effects of position 483 on RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) fidelity, we substituted every amino acid at this position. We isolated novel mutators with decreased replication fidelity and higher mutation frequencies, allowing us to examine the fitness of error-prone arbovirus variants. Although CHIKV mutators displayed no major replication defects in mammalian cell culture, they had reduced specific infectivity and were attenuated in vivo. Unexpectedly, mutator phenotypes were suppressed in mosquito cells and the variants exhibited significant defects in RNA synthesis. Consequently, these replication defects resulted in strong selection for reversion during infection of mosquitoes. Since residue 483 is conserved among alphaviruses, we examined the analogous mutations in Sindbis virus (SINV), which also reduced polymerase fidelity and generated replication defects in mosquito cells. However, replication defects were mosquito cell-specific and were not observed in Drosophila S2 cells, allowing us to evaluate the potential attenuation of mutators in insect models where pressure for reversion was absent. Indeed, the SINV mutator variant was attenuated in fruit flies. These findings confirm that residue 483 is a determinant regulating alphavirus polymerase fidelity and demonstrate proof of principle that arboviruses can be attenuated in mammalian and insect hosts by reducing fidelity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.157542504,-0.052924843,-0.045036816,0.026260747,-0.056179335,0.025127952,0.081344992,0.000734506,-0.016190439,0.051477929,0.079977057,0.060672679,-0.077300956,0.014561082,0.009425896,0.034954245,-0.043239329,-0.052739203,-0.085823913,0.001946043,0.119833675,-0.072041019,0.067051476,0.063955692,-0.046069869,0.071872921,0.025366005,-0.038161626,-0.113843457,-0.100910227
Presence of infectious agents and co-infections in diarrheic dogs determined with a real-time polymerase chain reaction-based panel,"BACKGROUND: Infectious diarrhea can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or protozoan organisms, or a combination of these. The identification of co-infections in dogs is important to determine the prognosis and to plan strategies for their treatment and prophylaxis. Although many pathogens have been individually detected with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a comprehensive panel of agents that cause diarrhea in privately owned dogs has not yet been established. The objective of this study was to use a real-time PCR diarrhea panel to survey the frequencies of pathogens and co-infections in owned dogs attended in a veterinary hospital with and without diarrhea, as well the frequency in different countries. Feces samples were tested for canine distemper virus, canine coronavirus, canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin (CPA), Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., and Salmonella spp. using molecular techniques. RESULTS: In total, 104 diarrheic and 43 control dogs that were presented consecutively at a major private veterinary hospital were included in the study. Overall, 71/104 (68.3%) dogs with diarrhea were positive for at least one pathogen: a single infection in 39/71 dogs (54.9%) and co-infections in 32/71 dogs (45.1%), including 21/32 dogs (65.6%) with dual, 5/32 (15.6%) with triple, and 6/32 (18.8%) with quadruple infections. In the control group, 13/43 (30.2%) dogs were positive, all with single infections only. The most prevalent pathogens in the diarrheic dogs were CPA (40/104 dogs, 38.5%), CPV-2 (36/104 dogs, 34.6%), and Giardia spp. (14/104 dogs, 13.5%). CPV-2 was the most prevalent pathogen in the dual co-infections, associated with CPA, Cryptosporidium spp., or Giardia spp. No statistical difference (P = 0.8374) was observed in the duration of diarrhea or the number of deaths (P = 0.5722) in the presence or absence of single or co-infections. CONCLUSIONS: Diarrheic dogs showed a higher prevalence of pathogen infections than the controls. Whereas the healthy dogs had only single infections, about half the diarrheic dogs had co-infections. Therefore, multiple pathogens should be investigated in dogs presenting with diarrhea. The effects of multiple pathogens on the disease outcomes remain unclear because the rate of death and the duration of diarrhea did not seem to be affected by these factors.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.060074442,-0.028730717,0.063408472,-0.103402117,0.027386682,-0.000216743,0.050098779,-0.003107821,-0.030920808,0.011057678,0.052347566,0.03715459,-0.039137415,-0.066309357,0.12390376,-0.066289345,-0.034198424,-0.056444278,0.109797198,-0.014209211,0.161969567,0.103960241,-0.105902784,-0.036674285,0.193873,-0.162196154,-0.108638319,-0.057022574,-0.00301939,0.071423796
"Nasal swab samples and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays in community-based, longitudinal studies of respiratory viruses: the importance of sample integrity and quality control","BACKGROUND: Carefully conducted, community-based, longitudinal studies are required to gain further understanding of the nature and timing of respiratory viruses causing infections in the population. However, such studies pose unique challenges for field specimen collection, including as we have observed the appearance of mould in some nasal swab specimens. We therefore investigated the impact of sample collection quality and the presence of visible mould in samples upon respiratory virus detection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. METHODS: Anterior nasal swab samples were collected from infants participating in an ongoing community-based, longitudinal, dynamic birth cohort study. The samples were first collected from each infant shortly after birth and weekly thereafter. They were then mailed to the laboratory where they were catalogued, stored at -80°C and later screened by PCR for 17 respiratory viruses. The quality of specimen collection was assessed by screening for human deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) using endogenous retrovirus 3 (ERV3). The impact of ERV3 load upon respiratory virus detection and the impact of visible mould observed in a subset of swabs reaching the laboratory upon both ERV3 loads and respiratory virus detection was determined. RESULTS: In total, 4933 nasal swabs were received in the laboratory. ERV3 load in nasal swabs was associated with respiratory virus detection. Reduced respiratory virus detection (odds ratio 0.35; 95% confidence interval 0.27-0.44) was observed in samples where the ERV3 could not be identified. Mould was associated with increased time of samples reaching the laboratory and reduced ERV3 loads and respiratory virus detection. CONCLUSION: Suboptimal sample collection and high levels of visible mould can impact negatively upon sample quality. Quality control measures, including monitoring human DNA loads using ERV3 as a marker for epithelial cell components in samples should be undertaken to optimize the validity of real-time PCR results for respiratory virus investigations in community-based studies.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.172119414,-0.007692566,0.07368452,0.063680521,0.00997755,-0.047850248,0.041445097,-0.017150774,0.014732324,0.048097083,0.00472534,-0.030336719,0.028497547,-0.022994082,0.061286938,-0.011324881,-0.027517884,-0.132782301,0.080204601,-0.08432254,-0.040217144,-0.050313619,-0.013222424,-0.047734017,0.030206127,-0.0040041,-0.014259776,-0.031576145,-0.038910322,-0.094170752
Transmission of Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) Virus in a Train in China,"BACKGROUND: Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged in North America in April 2009 and spread globally. We describe the epidemiology and public health response to the first known outbreak of 2009 H1N1 in a train, which occurred in June 2009 in China. METHODS: After 2 provinces provided initial reports of 2009 H1N1 infection in 2 persons who had travelled on the same train, we conducted a retrospective epidemiologic investigation to collect information from the passengers, crew members, contacts, and health care providers. We explored the source of infection and possible routes of transmission in the train. All cases were confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. RESULTS: Train #1223 traveled 40 hours, made 28 stops in 4 Chinese provinces, and boarded 2555 passengers, who logged a total of 59 144 person-hours of travel time. Nineteen confirmed 2009 H1N1 cases were identified. Of these, 13 were infected and developed symptoms on the train and 6 occurred among contacts who developed illness during medical monitoring. In addition, 3 asymptomatic cases were identified based on RT-PCR testing of respiratory swabs from contacts. The attack rate among contacts of confirmed cases in the same car was higher than that among contacts in other cars (3.15% vs. 0%, P < 0.001). Attack rates increased with exposure time. CONCLUSIONS: Close contact and long exposure may have contributed to the transmission of 2009 H1N1 virus in the train.

"Clinical Epidemiology of Bocavirus, Rhinovirus, Two Polyomaviruses and Four Coronaviruses in HIV-Infected and HIV-Uninfected South African Children","BACKGROUND: Advances in molecular diagnostics have implicated newly-discovered respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. We aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of human bocavirus (hBoV), human rhinovirus (hRV), polyomavirus-WU (WUPyV) and –KI (KIPyV) and human coronaviruses (CoV)-OC43, -NL63, -HKU1 and -229E among children hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). METHODS: Multiplex real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was undertaken on archived nasopharyngeal aspirates from HIV-infected and –uninfected children (<2 years age) hospitalized for LRTI, who had been previously investigated for respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza I–III, adenovirus and influenza A/B. RESULTS: At least one of these viruses were identified in 274 (53.0%) of 517 and in 509 (54.0%) of 943 LRTI-episodes in HIV-infected and -uninfected children, respectively. Human rhinovirus was the most prevalent in HIV-infected (31.7%) and –uninfected children (32.0%), followed by CoV-OC43 (12.2%) and hBoV (9.5%) in HIV-infected; and by hBoV (13.3%) and WUPyV (11.9%) in HIV-uninfected children. Polyomavirus-KI (8.9% vs. 4.8%; p = 0.002) and CoV-OC43 (12.2% vs. 3.6%; p<0.001) were more prevalent in HIV-infected than –uninfected children. Combined with previously-tested viruses, respiratory viruses were identified in 60.9% of HIV-infected and 78.3% of HIV-uninfected children. The newly tested viruses were detected at high frequency in association with other respiratory viruses, including previously-investigated viruses (22.8% in HIV-infected and 28.5% in HIV–uninfected children). CONCLUSIONS: We established that combined with previously-investigated viruses, at least one respiratory virus was identified in the majority of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children hospitalized for LRTI. The high frequency of viral co-infections illustrates the complexities in attributing causality to specific viruses in the aetiology of LRTI and may indicate a synergetic role of viral co-infections in the pathogenesis of childhood LRTI.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.148831238,-0.067335795,-0.094279454,0.045414379,0.057595718,-0.069589323,0.095885894,-0.066058062,0.106520792,0.001472491,-0.006660511,0.008740405,0.032330954,-0.011392216,0.026557044,0.00140615,-0.035014529,-0.025153915,0.017871878,0.003182222,-0.020487861,0.076425333,0.018702864,0.103193179,-0.042854842,0.060776579,-0.054762406,-0.019311823,0.023047661,0.026834255
Emergence of Enteric Viruses in Production Chickens Is a Concern for Avian Health,"Several viruses have been identified in recent years in the intestinal contents of chickens and turkeys with enteric problems, which have been observed in commercial farms worldwide, including Brazil. Molecular detection of these viruses in Brazil can transform to a big threat for poultry production due to risk for intestinal integrity. This disease is characterized by severely delayed growth, low uniformity, lethargy, watery diarrhea, delayed feed consumption, and a decreased conversion rate. Chicken astrovirus (CAstV), rotavirus, reovirus, chicken parvovirus (ChPV), fowl adenovirus of subgroup I (FAdV-1), and avian nephritis virus (ANV) were investigated using the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which may play a role in enteric disease, was included. The viruses most frequently detected, either alone or in concomitance with other viruses, were IBV, ANV, rotavirus, and CAstV followed by parvovirus, reovirus, and adenovirus. This study demonstrates the diversity of viruses in Brazilian chicken flocks presenting enteric problems characterized by diarrhea, growth retard, loss weight, and mortality, which reflects the multicausal etiology of this disease.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.022902865,-0.024347039,0.107328694,-0.043327206,0.115809623,0.066448355,-0.022900948,-0.053981008,0.033658028,0.211500008,0.073673854,-0.00550455,-0.049697648,0.041151033,0.004014179,0.026565465,0.001831455,-0.044280171,-0.001004295,0.013040974,-0.017395923,0.045944987,-0.040656514,0.024978273,0.006585686,-0.032951541,-0.013845844,-0.026477998,-0.007734547,-0.08202368
"Vaccine Effectiveness against Medically Attended Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza in Japan, 2011–2012 Season","The objective of this study was to estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza during the 2011–2012 season in Japan using a test-negative case-control study design. The effect of co-circulating non-influenza respiratory viruses (NIRVs) on VE estimates was also explored. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from outpatients with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) in a community hospital in Nagasaki, Japan. Thirteen respiratory viruses (RVs), including influenza A and B, were identified from the samples using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The difference in VE point estimates was assessed using three different controls: ILI patients that tested negative for influenza, those that tested negative for all RVs, and those that tested positive for NIRVs. The adjusted VE against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza using all influenza-negative controls was 5.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], −60.5 to 44.1).

Recent developments in antiviral agents against enterovirus 71 infection,"Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is the main etiological agent of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). Recent EV-71 outbreaks in Asia-Pacific were not limited to mild HFMD, but were associated with severe neurological complications such as aseptic meningitis and brainstem encephalitis, which may lead to cardiopulmonary failure and death. The absence of licensed therapeutics for clinical use has intensified research into anti-EV-71 development. This review highlights the potential antiviral agents targeting EV-71 attachment, entry, uncoating, translation, polyprotein processing, virus-induced formation of membranous RNA replication complexes, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The strategies for antiviral development include target-based synthetic compounds, anti-rhinovirus and poliovirus libraries screening, and natural compound libraries screening. Growing knowledge of the EV-71 life cycle will lead to successful development of antivirals. The continued effort to develop antiviral agents for treatment is crucial in the absence of a vaccine. The coupling of antivirals with an effective vaccine will accelerate eradication of the disease.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.075244353,-0.027632023,-0.024838888,0.001892442,-0.096272568,0.060618058,0.078728539,0.006991814,0.031546137,0.044214999,0.019924753,0.038326367,0.003943534,-0.042628114,0.010546612,0.001670831,-0.038448628,0.100161361,0.02664379,0.008033422,0.001877936,0.006006983,-0.065473039,0.027424574,0.053875035,-0.002206222,0.012902838,-0.01322383,0.064128531,0.022984295
Distinct Immune Response in Two MERS-CoV-Infected Patients: Can We Go from Bench to Bedside?,"One year after the occurrence of the first case of infection by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) there is no clear consensus on the best treatment to propose. The World Health Organization, as well as several other national agencies, are still working on different clinical approaches to implement the most relevant treatment in MERS-CoV infection. We compared innate and adaptive immune responses of two patients infected with MERS-CoV to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in the response and propose potential therapeutic approaches. Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) of the first week and sera of the first month from the two patients were used in this study. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) was performed after extraction of RNA from BAL cells of MERS-CoV infected patients and control patients. BAL supernatants and sera were used to assess cytokines and chemokines secretion by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The first patient died rapidly after 3 weeks in the intensive care unit, the second patient still recovers from infection. The patient with a poor outcome (patient 1), compared to patient 2, did not promote type-1 Interferon (IFN), and particularly IFNα, in response to double stranded RNA (dsRNA) from MERS-CoV. The absence of IFNα, known to promote antigen presentation in response to viruses, impairs the development of a robust antiviral adaptive Th-1 immune response. This response is mediated by IL-12 and IFNγ that decreases viral clearance; levels of both of these mediators were decreased in patient 1. Finally, we confirm previous in vitro findings that MERS-CoV can drive IL-17 production in humans. Host recognition of viral dsRNA determines outcome in the early stage of MERS-CoV infection. We highlight the critical role of IFNα in this initial stage to orchestrate a robust immune response and bring substantial arguments for the indication of early IFNα treatment during MERS-CoV infection.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.034101776,0.273372211,-0.168943397,-0.060813793,-0.103564931,0.032149212,0.000317535,0.333775204,0.254088151,0.021718689,0.017555795,-0.068703577,-0.023799815,0.068163903,-0.027614,-0.014272375,-0.003247244,-0.054062629,-0.036397771,0.014922306,0.028211016,-0.022404159,0.042716673,0.040055996,-0.040379094,-0.064867548,0.015551374,-0.010474373,-0.026097558,0.048103664
Selection of Suitable Reference Genes for Normalization of Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction in Human Cartilage Endplate of the Lumbar Spine,"The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is one of the most widely used methods to study gene expression profiles, and it requires appropriate normalization for accurate and reliable results. Although several genes are commonly used as reference genes (such as GAPDH, ACTB, and 18S rRNA), they are also regulated and can be expressed at varying levels. In this study, we evaluated twelve well-known reference genes to identify the most suitable housekeeping gene for normalization of qRT-PCR in human lumbar vertebral endplate with Modic changes, by using the geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper algorithms. Our results showed that the rarely-used SDHA was the most stable single reference gene, and a combination of three, SDHA, B2M, and LDHA, was the most suitable gene set for normalization in all samples. In addition, the commonly-used genes, GAPDH, ACTB and 18S rRNA, were all inappropriate as internal standards. The rankings of reference genes for the three types of Modic change differed, although SDHA and RPL13A uniformly ranked in the first and last position, respectively. Further simulated expression analysis validated that the arbitrary use of a reference gene could lead to the misinterpretation of data. Our study confirmed the necessity of exploring the expression stability of potential reference genes in each specific tissue and experimental situation before quantitative evaluation of gene expression by qRT-PCR.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.050095045,0.016539329,0.104946626,-0.104723792,0.00968294,0.035889145,-0.039012896,-0.051616125,0.052431041,-0.036233454,-0.12113943,-0.055120629,0.006255406,0.070877803,-0.028473726,-0.056019265,0.000141313,-0.071618169,-0.043059865,-0.147212911,0.071638649,0.00731793,0.049754756,0.029857365,-0.143438392,-0.065403164,0.069150393,0.028056544,0.090300187,-0.02925475
"Population-Based Incidence of Severe Acute Respiratory Virus Infections among Children Aged <5 Years in Rural Bangladesh, June–October 2010","BACKGROUND: Better understanding the etiology-specific incidence of severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) in resource-poor, rural settings will help further develop and prioritize prevention strategies. To address this gap in knowledge, we conducted a longitudinal study to estimate the incidence of SARIs among children in rural Bangladesh. METHODS: During June through October 2010, we followed children aged <5 years in 67 villages to identify those with cough, difficulty breathing, age-specific tachypnea and/or danger signs in the community or admitted to the local hospital. A study physician collected clinical information and obtained nasopharyngeal swabs from all SARI cases and blood for bacterial culture from those hospitalized. We tested swabs for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, human metapneumoviruses, adenoviruses and human parainfluenza viruses 1–3 (HPIV) by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We calculated virus-specific SARI incidence by dividing the number of new illnesses by the person-time each child contributed to the study. RESULTS: We followed 12,850 children for 279,029 person-weeks (pw) and identified 141 SARI cases; 76 (54%) at their homes and 65 (46%) at the hospital. RSV was associated with 7.9 SARI hospitalizations per 100,000 pw, HPIV3 2.2 hospitalizations/100,000 pw, and influenza 1.1 hospitalizations/100,000 pw. Among non-hospitalized SARI cases, RSV was associated with 10.8 illnesses/100,000 pw, HPIV3 1.8/100,000 pw, influenza 1.4/100,000 pw, and adenoviruses 0.4/100,000 pw. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses, particularly RSV, were commonly associated with SARI among children. It may be useful to explore the value of investing in prevention strategies, such as handwashing and respiratory hygiene, to reduce respiratory infections among young children in such settings.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.226828077,-0.117816143,-0.07234185,0.092471819,0.039612432,0.003020068,-0.000420397,-0.081532608,0.093151583,-0.087806839,0.015995418,-0.006606817,-0.068094221,-0.086669843,-0.027983569,0.030916152,-0.050808768,-0.022019361,0.016583422,-0.020060606,-0.046959285,0.042972212,0.009729917,-0.005454109,0.013724678,-0.00688913,0.050845164,0.118648052,-0.017202956,0.003317356
Rapid PCR/ESI-MS-based molecular genotyping of Staphylococcus aureus from nasal swabs of emergency department patients,"BACKGROUND: A limitation of both culture-based and molecular methods of screening for staphylococcal infection is that current tests determine only the presence or absence of colonization with no information on the colonizing strain type. A technique that couples polymerase chain reaction to mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) has recently been developed and an assay validated to identify and genotype S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). METHODS: This study was conducted to determine the rates, risk factors, and molecular genotypes of colonizing Staphylococcus aureus in adult patients presenting to an inner-city academic emergency department. Participants completed a structured questionnaire to assess hospital and community risks for infection with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Nasal swabs were analyzed by PCR/ESI-MS to identify and genotype S. aureus and CoNS. RESULTS: Of 200 patients evaluated, 59 were colonized with S. aureus; 27 of these were methicillin-resistant strains. Twenty-four of the 59 S. aureus carriers were co-colonized with a CoNS and 140 of the 200 patients were colonized exclusively with CoNS. The molecular genotypes of the 59 S. aureus strains were diverse; 21 unique molecular genotypes belonging to seven major clonal complexes were identified. Eighty-five of 200 patients carried strains with high-level mupirocin resistance. Of these eighty-five participants, 4 were colonized exclusively with S. aureus, 16 were co-colonized with S. aureus and CoNS, and 65 were colonized exclusively with CoNS. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus colonization in a random sample of patients seeking care in Emergency Department was 29.5% and 13.5%, respectively. A substantial fraction of the S. aureus-colonized patients were co-colonized with CoNS and high-level mupirocin-resistant CoNS. Determining the molecular genotype of S. aureus during intake screening may prove valuable in the future if certain molecular genotypes become associated with increased infection risk.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.042197154,-0.015009325,0.01499391,-0.095121662,-0.017377288,0.012418776,-0.001545274,0.036990546,-0.061403012,0.026521372,-0.021706046,0.061869326,-0.008820754,-0.005573106,-0.017107438,0.014679304,-0.013549238,0.023373834,-0.001528629,-0.025996472,0.025088281,-0.01831733,0.023658617,0.000552135,0.0073949,-0.026132018,0.008127968,-0.025169814,-0.020765617,0.010152359
Transcriptome Analysis of the Initial Stage of Acute WSSV Infection Caused by Temperature Change,"White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is the most devastating virosis threatening the shrimp culture industry worldwide. Variations of environmental factors in shrimp culture ponds usually lead to the outbreak of white spot syndrome (WSS). In order to know the molecular mechanisms of WSS outbreak induced by temperature variation and the biological changes of the host at the initial stage of WSSV acute infection, RNA-Seq technology was used to analyze the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in shrimp with a certain amount of WSSV cultured at 18°C and shrimp whose culture temperature were raised to 25°C. To analyze whether the expression changes of the DEGs were due to temperature rising or WSSV proliferation, the expression of selected DEGs was analyzed by real-time PCR with another shrimp group, namely Group T, as control. Group T didn’t suffer WSSV infection but was subjected to temperature rising in parallel. At the initial stage of WSSV acute infection, DEGs related to energy production were up-regulated, whereas most DEGs related to cell cycle and positive regulation of cell death and were down-regulated. Triose phosphate isomerase, enolase and alcohol dehydrogenase involved in glycosis were up-regulated, while pyruvate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase with NAD as the coenzyme involved in TCA pathway were down-regulated. Also genes involved in host DNA replication, including DNA primase, DNA topoisomerase and DNA polymerase showed down-regulated expression. Several interesting genes including crustin genes, acting binding or inhibiting protein genes, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 9 (ADAM9) gene and a GRP 78 gene were also analyzed. Understanding the interactions between hosts and WSSV at the initial stage of acute infection will not only help to get a deep insight into the pathogenesis of WSSV but also provide clues for therapies.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.068980258,-0.007666204,0.003399525,-0.091239697,-0.044671018,0.039174689,0.027704053,-0.025196506,0.033690357,-0.015835731,-0.071805162,-0.037257238,0.000403698,0.042989762,-0.017667281,-0.005683238,-0.010009968,-0.047666176,-0.03209826,-0.027343831,0.019855859,-0.00357455,-0.016358143,-0.010338753,-0.080550071,-0.042298726,-0.002016424,0.029209366,0.011146359,-0.036488088
"Prevalence and correlates of influenza-a in piggery workers and pigs in two communities in Lagos, Nigeria","INTRODUCTION: Worldwide, three Influenza-A virus subtypes (H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2) in swine are major public health issues. In Nigeria, the existence of these subtypes in pigs has not been well studied. This study aimed at determining the prevalence and correlates of Influenza-A viruses circulating in piggery workers and pigs in Oke-aro and Goshen communities in Lagos, Nigeria. METHODS: Nasal swabs were taken from 197 consenting piggery workers and 281 randomly selected pigs to determine the prevalence of Influenza-A (H1, H3, H5) using Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction test (gene M). An interviewer administered questionnaire was used to collect information on demography, Influenza-A related symptoms experienced, personal hygiene and management practices from the piggery workers. Descriptive statistics was used and chi square test performed at 5% significant level. RESULTS: All piggery workers and pigs’ nasal swabs tested negative for Influenza-A viruses, hence, association could not be tested. Mean age of piggery workers was 41 ± 13.6 years and 60% were females. Forty two percent were farm attendants, 38.0% were pig farmers and the rest butchers. Nineteen percent had history of headache; 14.0% had catarrh and cough; 4.0% had sore-throat; 5.0% had diarrhea; while 48.0% had muscle pain at the time of data collection. The mean body temperature for the pig workers was 36.5 ± 0.5 °C. A significant difference (p<0.05) existed among piggery workers who had muscle pains. CONCLUSION: Piggery workers and pigs in study area were free of Influenza-A (H1, H3, H5) viruses. The current practices of the piggery workers should be encouraged.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.082434726,-0.05027219,0.005104796,0.038585948,0.008227245,0.189467963,-0.089807874,0.025772839,-0.026597924,-0.083161822,0.018000148,0.031267693,-0.043801121,-0.012718452,0.063321661,-0.009745239,-0.014772786,-0.03960833,0.001331318,-0.017111018,-0.039168631,-0.030033427,-0.00229562,-0.03877976,-0.025831013,0.015321471,-0.03920274,0.007527878,0.022158569,-0.025559302
Viral Infection Is Not Uncommon in Adult Patients with Severe Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia,"BACKGROUND: Viral pathogens have not generally been regarded as important causes of severe hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), except in patients with hematologic malignancy or transplant recipients. We investigated the role and distribution of viruses in adult with severe HAP who required intensive care. METHODS: From March 2010 to February 2012, adult patients with severe HAP required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), 28-bed medical ICU in a tertiary care hospital, were prospectively enrolled. Respiratory viruses were detected using multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and/or shell vial culture. RESULTS: A total of 262 patients were enrolled and 107 patients (40.8%) underwent bronchoscopic BAL for etiologic diagnosis. One hundred and fifty-six patients (59.5%) had bacterial infections and 59 patients (22.5%) had viral infections. Viruses were detected in BAL fluid specimens of 37 patients (62.7%, 37/59). The most commonly identified viruses were respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus (both 27.1%, 16/59), followed by rhinovirus (25.4%, 15/59), and influenza virus (16.9%, 10/59). Twenty-one patients (8.0%, 21/262) had bacterial-viral coinfections and Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly coexisting bacteria (n = 10). Viral infection in non-immunocompromised patients was not uncommon (11.1%, 16/143), although it was not as frequent as that in immunocompromised patients (36.4%, 43/119). Non-immunocompromised patients were significantly older than immunocompromised patients and had significantly higher rates of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tuberculous destroyed lung and chronic kidney disease. The 28 day mortalities of patients with bacterial infections, viral infections and bacterial-viral coinfections were not significantly different (29.5%, 35.6% and 19.0%, respectively; p = 0.321). CONCLUSIONS: Viral pathogens are not uncommon in adult patients with severe HAP who required ICU admission. Since viral pathogens may cause severe HAP and could be a potential source of viral transmission, further investigation is required to delineate the role of viral pathogens in severe HAP.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.212422496,-0.062551598,-0.133650671,-0.070677877,-0.080036159,-0.066878039,-0.036581772,0.103617663,-0.189394959,0.119989808,-0.05761126,-0.009889061,0.030914084,0.099036983,-0.042431362,-0.036675229,0.031449638,0.037464134,-0.008212417,0.102073636,0.03964203,-0.030227816,-0.017849995,0.037281244,-0.010162945,-0.036751698,0.022529428,-0.024068539,-0.038400729,0.017959163
Amino acid changes in the spike protein of feline coronavirus correlate with systemic spread of virus from the intestine and not with feline infectious peritonitis,"Recent evidence suggests that a mutation in the spike protein gene of feline coronavirus (FCoV), which results in an amino acid change from methionine to leucine at position 1058, may be associated with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Tissue and faecal samples collected post mortem from cats diagnosed with or without FIP were subjected to RNA extraction and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to detect FCoV RNA. In cats with FIP, 95% of tissue, and 81% of faecal samples were PCR-positive, as opposed to 22% of tissue, and 60% of faecal samples in cats without FIP. Relative FCoV copy numbers were significantly higher in the cats with FIP, both in tissues (P < 0.001) and faeces (P = 0.02). PCR-positive samples underwent pyrosequencing encompassing position 1058 of the FCoV spike protein. This identified a methionine codon at position 1058, consistent with the shedding of an enteric form of FCoV, in 77% of the faecal samples from cats with FIP, and in 100% of the samples from cats without FIP. In contrast, 91% of the tissue samples from cats with FIP and 89% from cats without FIP had a leucine codon at position 1058, consistent with a systemic form of FCoV. These results suggest that the methionine to leucine substitution at position 1058 in the FCoV spike protein is indicative of systemic spread of FCoV from the intestine, rather than a virus with the potential to cause FIP.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.039650706,0.007218958,0.091296787,-0.17457762,0.040077476,0.007817914,0.007857051,-0.014499687,-0.05759841,-0.184104754,0.47110033,-0.143331676,0.231303724,-0.036069253,-0.139757109,-0.071221983,0.083213721,-0.013926133,0.004657903,0.055718378,-0.048184979,-0.007714954,0.055546653,0.036545866,-0.032688661,0.047874545,0.002971655,0.008021571,0.020096002,-0.024363773
Epidemiology of Acute Respiratory Infections in Children in Guangzhou: A Three-Year Study,"Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) are some of the most common human diseases worldwide. However, they have a complex and diverse etiology, and the characteristics of the pathogens involved in respiratory infections in developing countries are not well understood. In this work, we analyzed the characteristics of 17 common respiratory pathogens in children (≤14 years old) with ARI in Guangzhou, southern China over a 3-year period using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Pathogens were identified in 2361/4242 (55.7%) patients, and the positivity rate varied seasonally. Ten of the 17 pathogens investigated showed positivity rates of more than 5%. The most frequently detected pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus (768/2361, 32.5%), influenza A virus (428/2361, 18.1%), enterovirus (138/2361, 13.3%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (267/2361, 11.3%) and adenovirus (213/2361, 9.0%). Co-pathogens were common and found in 503 of 2361 (21.3%) positive samples. When ranked according to frequency of occurrence, the pattern of co-pathogens was similar to that of the primary pathogens, with the exception of human bocavirus, human coronavirus and human metapneumovirus. Significant differences were found in age prevalence in 10 of the 17 pathogens (p≤0.009): four basic patterns were observed, A: detection rates increased with age, B: detection rates declined with age, C: the detection rate showed distinct peaks or D: numbers of patients were too low to detect a trend or showed no significant difference among age groups (p>0.05). These data will be useful for planning vaccine research and control strategies and for studies predicting pathogen prevalence.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.22906455,-0.092062305,-0.047332949,0.033328635,0.052308623,-0.057730212,0.048879277,-0.012034877,-0.026303347,0.076095015,-0.020777088,-0.014546082,0.044708763,-0.032365987,0.031172816,-0.055274843,-0.016763348,-0.069044597,0.039084463,0.023871792,0.022245725,0.013065507,0.06499833,0.035191393,0.041482232,0.024304028,-0.040385918,0.092326897,0.039278397,-0.093748029
Haemoproteus iwa in Great Frigatebirds (Fregata minor) in the Islands of the Western Indian Ocean,"Blood parasites of the sub-genus Haemoproteus have been reported in seabirds, in particular in species in the Suliformes order. These parasites are transmitted by hippoboscid flies of the genus Olfersia; strong specificity has been suggested between the vector and its vertebrate host. We investigated the prevalence of Haemoproteus infection in Suliformes and hippoboscid flies in two oceanic islands of the Western Indian Ocean: Europa and Tromelin. In total, 209 blood samples were collected from great frigatebirds (Fregata minor), masked boobies (Sula dactylatra) and red-footed boobies (Sula sula). Forty-one hippoboscid flies were also collected from birds. Seventeen frigatebirds and one fly collected on Europa tested positive for the presence of Haemoproteus parasites by polymerase chain reaction. Phylogenetic analyses based on partial sequences of the Cytochrome b gene showed that parasites were closely related to Haemoproteus iwa reported from frigatebirds in the Pacific Ocean and in the Caribbean. Plasmodium was also detected in a frigatebird on Europa; however, its placement on the phylogenetic tree could not be resolved. We provide strong support for transmission of blood parasites in seabirds in the Western Indian Ocean and suggest that migrations between the Pacific and the Indian oceans could favor the large-scale distribution of Haemoproteus iwa in frigatebird populations.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.026167867,-0.006364934,0.024767415,-0.089759347,0.077341593,0.048817397,0.055670694,0.013559947,-0.01616207,-0.02851509,0.00172359,-0.004047362,-0.008641302,-0.009490113,0.000979288,0.004319956,-0.008612473,-0.015515499,0.002472951,-0.027727356,0.012189487,0.017014617,-0.031843388,-0.003422986,0.003907576,-0.004129056,-0.022002421,0.015361285,-0.013216659,-9.39E-05
"Prevalence of adenovirus in children with acute respiratory tract infection in Lanzhou, China","BACKGROUND: Human adenovirus (HAdV) is an important agent causing respiratory tract infection in children. Information on the epidemiological and clinical features of HAdV is limited in children with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in China, especially those of a novel genotype, Ad55. METHODS: In total, 1169 nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children younger than 14 years with ARTIs between November 2006 and November 2009. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to screen HAdVs. All PCR-positive products were sequenced. RESULTS: 74 of 1169 (6.33%) specimens were positive for HAdVs. Among positive cases, AdV3 (58/74) was detected most frequently, followed by AdV11 (10/74), AdV2 (2/74), AdV7 (2/69), AdV6 (1/74), and AdV1 (1/74). AdV55 was found in one case. The incidence of HAdV infection peaked in children aged 3–7 years. The most common clinical diagnosis was upper respiratory infection, and the most common syndrome was fever and cough.The comparison of HAdV and RSV group revealed that Children infected with group AdV were significant older than children infected with group RSV, had more fever but less frequently wheezing, and cough, crackles, and cyanosis, The duration of hospitalization between the AdV group and RSV group was not significant, but a greater frequency of LRTIs was observed in RSV group. CONCLUSIONS: HAdV is an important viral agent in children with ARTIs in Lanzhou City, China. Multiple HAdV serotypes co-circulated with Ad3, which was predominant in this 3-year study. The novel AdV55 genotype was found in one case. No fixed seasonal rhythm could be identified.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.20451522,-0.096309447,-0.078469905,-0.036005046,0.08263739,-0.111766678,0.062129358,-0.091709941,0.10159287,-0.054784544,0.022382334,-0.01684107,-0.108131182,-0.066164244,-0.00385064,-0.020619105,-0.081034215,0.06198177,-0.023431881,-0.053520106,-0.02196689,0.171598411,-0.032822848,-0.005627817,-0.103356376,0.065607253,0.052166356,0.235164809,-0.123898251,0.055407836
Antibody-dependent infection of human macrophages by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,"BACKGROUND: Public health risks associated to infection by human coronaviruses remain considerable and vaccination is a key option for preventing the resurgence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We have previously reported that antibodies elicited by a SARS-CoV vaccine candidate based on recombinant, full-length SARS-CoV Spike-protein trimers, trigger infection of immune cell lines. These observations prompted us to investigate the molecular mechanisms and responses to antibody-mediated infection in human macrophages. METHODS: We have used primary human immune cells to evaluate their susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV in the presence of anti-Spike antibodies. Fluorescence microscopy and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were utilized to assess occurrence and consequences of infection. To gain insight into the underlying molecular mechanism, we performed mutational analysis with a series of truncated and chimeric constructs of fragment crystallizable γ receptors (FcγR), which bind antibody-coated pathogens. RESULTS: We show here that anti-Spike immune serum increased infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages by replication-competent SARS-CoV as well as Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles (SARS-CoVpp). Macrophages infected with SARS-CoV, however, did not support productive replication of the virus. Purified anti-viral IgGs, but not other soluble factor(s) from heat-inactivated mouse immune serum, were sufficient to enhance infection. Antibody-mediated infection was dependent on signaling-competent members of the human FcγRII family, which were shown to confer susceptibility to otherwise naïve ST486 cells, as binding of immune complexes to cell surface FcγRII was necessary but not sufficient to trigger antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. Furthermore, only FcγRII with intact cytoplasmic signaling domains were competent to sustain ADE of SARS-CoVpp infection, thus providing additional information on the role of downstream signaling by FcγRII. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that human macrophages can be infected by SARS-CoV as a result of IgG-mediated ADE and indicate that this infection route requires signaling pathways activated downstream of binding to FcγRII receptors.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.032512966,0.358052897,-0.190937633,-0.030246227,-0.070821673,0.050292649,-0.005344072,-0.197960587,0.077676755,-0.018435876,-0.034507538,-0.062798537,0.041376757,0.04824599,0.01427758,-0.000451674,-0.007034012,-0.04995448,-0.026457981,0.024587961,0.033366103,0.000409008,0.057945696,0.027472437,0.026033605,0.004532382,-0.020253252,0.014673026,-0.016611185,-0.001482503
The 3′-Terminal 55 Nucleotides of Bovine Coronavirus Defective Interfering RNA Harbor Cis-Acting Elements Required for Both Negative- and Positive-Strand RNA Synthesis,"The synthesis of the negative-strand [(−)-strand] complement of the ∼30 kilobase, positive-strand [(+)-strand] coronaviral genome is a necessary early step for genome replication. The identification of cis-acting elements required for (−)-strand RNA synthesis in coronaviruses, however, has been hampered due to insufficiencies in the techniques used to detect the (−)-strand RNA species. Here, we employed a method of head-to-tail ligation and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to detect and quantitate the synthesis of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) defective interfering (DI) RNA (−) strands. Furthermore, using the aforementioned techniques along with Northern blot assay, we specifically defined the cis-acting RNA elements within the 3′-terminal 55 nucleotides (nts) which function in the synthesis of (−)- or (+)-strand BCoV DI RNA. The major findings are as follows: (i) nts from -5 to -39 within the 3′-terminal 55 nts are the cis-acting elements responsible for (−)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis, (ii) nts from −3 to −34 within the 3′-terminal 55 nts are cis-acting elements required for (+)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis, and (iii) the nucleotide species at the 3′-most position (−1) is important, but not critical, for both (−)- and (+)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis. These results demonstrate that the 3′-terminal 55 nts in BCoV DI RNA harbor cis-acting RNA elements required for both (−)- and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis and extend our knowledge on the mechanisms of coronavirus replication. The method of head-to-tail ligation and qRT-PCR employed in the study may also be applied to identify other cis-acting elements required for (−)-strand RNA synthesis in coronaviruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.200376146,-0.04116611,-0.022883953,0.113235998,0.006269548,-0.16838866,-0.09390232,0.082179459,-0.0793742,-0.05164758,0.067164707,-0.040189595,-8.65E-06,0.045114314,0.118867088,0.161493366,-0.113151465,0.07159914,0.020566683,-0.066507244,-0.01553134,0.003917298,-0.001851439,-0.090611991,0.030197176,-0.040324279,-0.070648049,0.006301694,0.126834707,-0.009517732
A highly conserved WDYPKCDRA epitope in the RNA directed RNA polymerase of human coronaviruses can be used as epitope-based universal vaccine design,"BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses are the diverse group of RNA virus. From 1960, six strains of human coronaviruses have emerged that includes SARS-CoV and the recent infection by deadly MERS-CoV which is now going to cause another outbreak. Prevention of these viruses is urgent and a universal vaccine for all strain could be a promising solution in this circumstance. In this study we aimed to design an epitope based vaccine against all strain of human coronavirus. RESULTS: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) approach was employed among spike (S), membrane (M), enveloped (E) and nucleocapsid (N) protein and replicase polyprotein 1ab to identify which one is highly conserve in all coronaviruses strains. Next, we use various in silico tools to predict consensus immunogenic and conserved peptide. We found that conserved region is present only in the RNA directed RNA polymerase protein. In this protein we identified one epitope WDYPKCDRA is highly immunogenic and 100% conserved among all available human coronavirus strains. CONCLUSIONS: Here we suggest in vivo study of our identified novel peptide antigen in RNA directed RNA polymerase protein for universal vaccine – which may be the way to prevent all human coronavirus disease.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.135863299,0.130610674,-0.107817609,0.051599607,0.122398874,0.007628296,-0.03630526,0.020573048,0.076111012,0.034026024,0.00620944,0.037326312,0.034074523,-0.055259627,-0.031299544,-0.092647912,0.022026656,-0.005707762,0.007009373,0.06941608,0.026324566,0.03343481,0.002432239,0.047598986,0.06239923,0.010974469,0.009578697,-0.000548791,-0.047303009,0.054829383
RIG-I Enhanced Interferon Independent Apoptosis upon Junin Virus Infection,"Junin virus (JUNV) is the etiological agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF), a human disease with a high case-fatality rate. It is widely accepted that arenaviral infections, including JUNV infections, are generally non-cytopathic. In contrast, here we demonstrated apoptosis induction in human lung epithelial carcinoma (A549), human hepatocarcinoma and Vero cells upon infection with the attenuated Candid#1 strain of, JUNV as determined by phosphatidylserine (PS) translocation, Caspase 3 (CASP3) activation, Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and/or chromosomal DNA fragmentation. Moreover, as determined by DNA fragmentation, we found that the pathogenic Romero strain of JUNV was less cytopathic than Candid#1 in human hepatocarcinoma and Vero, but more apoptotic in A549 and Vero E6 cells. Additionally, we found that JUNV-induced apoptosis was enhanced by RIG-I signaling. Consistent with the previously reported role of RIG-I like helicase (RLH) signaling in initiating programmed cell death, we showed that cell death or DNA fragmentation of Candid#1-infected A549 cells was decreased upon siRNA or shRNA silencing of components of RIG-I pathway in spite of increased virus production. Similarly, we observed decreased DNA fragmentation in JUNV-infected human hepatocarcinoma cells deficient for RIG-I when compared with that of RIG-I-competent cells. In addition, DNA fragmentation detected upon Candid#1 infection of type I interferon (IFN)-deficient Vero cells suggested a type I IFN-independent mechanism of apoptosis induction in response to JUNV. Our work demonstrated for the first time apoptosis induction in various cells of mammalian origin in response to JUNV infection and partial mechanism of this cell death.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.07855668,-0.041306947,-0.010439702,-0.112081164,-0.09226406,0.075797608,0.052932238,-0.069745967,0.103972443,-0.007376014,-0.0500415,-0.04957013,0.01412182,0.112165891,0.011449983,0.030841808,-0.037572238,-0.045990232,0.002633379,0.030041843,0.075090182,0.016368,0.03116419,0.013249823,0.014868067,0.023901498,-0.069740678,0.095927739,-0.073012646,-0.064951121
Influenza and other respiratory virus infections in outpatients with medically attended acute respiratory infection during the 2011-12 influenza season,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory tract infections are a major cause of outpatient visits, yet only a portion is tested to determine the etiologic organism. Multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (MRT-PCR) assays for detection of multiple viruses are being used increasingly in clinical settings. METHODS: During January–April 2012, outpatients with acute respiratory illness (≤7 days) were tested for influenza using singleplex RT-PCR (SRT-PCR). A subset was assayed for 18 viruses using MRT-PCR to compare detection of influenza and examine the distribution of viruses and characteristics of patients using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 662 participants (6 months–82 years), detection of influenza was similar between the MRT-PCR and SRT-PCR (κ = 0·83). No virus was identified in 267 (40.3%) samples. Commonly detected viruses were human rhinovirus (HRV, 15·4%), coronavirus (CoV, 10·4%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 8·4%), human metapneumovirus (hMPV, 8·3%), and influenza (6%). Co-detections were infrequent (6·9%) and most commonly occurred among those <18 years old. In regression analyses, compared with non-viral illnesses, RSV and hMPV were significantly more frequent in children and less frequent in 18- to 49-year-olds than in those ≥50 years (P = 0·01), fever was more common in hMPV and influenza infections (P = 0·008), nasal congestion was more frequent in CoV, HRV, hMPV, influenza and RSV infections (P = 0·001), and body mass index was higher among those with influenza (P = 0·036). CONCLUSIONS: Using MRT-PCR, a viral etiology was found in three-fifths of patients with medically attended outpatient visits for acute respiratory illness during the influenza season; co-detected viruses were infrequent. Symptoms varied by viral etiology.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.33089306,-0.082632154,-0.045846131,0.264659846,0.053251856,0.047442096,-0.067507908,-0.074393547,0.07863985,-0.070428357,0.031695743,-0.093781506,-0.057090317,0.052715059,-0.057132163,-0.077166263,0.038834793,0.066991928,-0.042180831,-0.044809078,0.079635534,-0.032214004,0.027090183,-0.026029297,-0.047706872,-0.01066648,-0.074707393,-0.077296179,0.051206463,0.065422617
"Prevalence and Genetic Diversity Analysis of Human Coronavirus OC43 among Adult Patients with Acute Respiratory Infections in Beijing, 2012","To determine the prevalence, epidemiology and genetic diversity of human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) among adult patients with acute respiratory infections (ARI) in Beijing,five hundred and fifty-nine nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from adult patients with ARI in Beijing. The prevalence of HCoV-OC43 infection among these patients was assessed using two different OneStep reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. The epidemiological profiles of the patients with HCoV-OC43 infection were described. Partial S and N genes of HCoV-OC43 circulating strains were sequenced followed by phylogenetic analysis and amino acid alignment. Our results showed that the prevalence of HCoV-OC43 infection was 12.52% (95% CI: 9.78–15.26%), and the epidemic peak occurred in autumn. Fifty partial S and 40 partial N fragments were obtained from these patients. Phylogenetic analysis based on neighbour-joining method showed that at least three distinct clusters (A, B, C/D) of HCoV-OC43 strains were circulating among adult patients with ARI in Beijing. In addition, some novel unique clusters (UNT) of HCoV-OC43 were found in the S- and N-based phylogenetic trees. Furthermore, consensus amino acids substitutes for each cluster were also found after alignment of partial S or N sequence coding region in this study. In conclusion, we herein describe the prevalence of HCoV-OC43 among adult patients and provide substantial evidence for the genetic diversity of HCoV-OC43 circulating in Beijing.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.09479251,-0.017053499,-0.048584547,-0.092290282,0.187539606,-0.054791505,0.011625736,-0.006172782,0.03337329,-0.062039812,-0.062822523,0.395771674,0.275839083,0.183257335,-0.034287622,0.032572594,-0.043457893,-0.006899034,-0.056052188,0.033794518,0.016108277,-0.028225474,0.037429184,-0.008093835,0.007996373,-0.04016596,0.091307454,0.013291954,-0.035861237,0.0867075
"Viral etiology and seasonality of influenza-like illness in Gabon, March 2010 to June 2011","BACKGROUND: Surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) in Central Africa began only recently, and few data are therefore available on the circulation of influenza virus and other respiratory viruses. In Gabon, a Central African country, we established a surveillance network in four major towns in order to analyze cases of ILI among patients who visited health centers between March 2010 and June 2011, and to determine the viral etiology. METHODS: Nasal swabs were sent for analysis to the Centre International de Recherches Médicales de Franceville, where they were screened for 17 respiratory viruses in a multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for all pathogens according the following pairs: adenovirus/parainfluenza virus 4, respiratory syncytial virus/human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 1/parainfluenza virus 2, pandemic influenza virus A/seasonal influenza virus A (H1N1, H3N2)/seasonal influenza virus B, human coronaviruses 229E/OC43, human coronaviruses NL63/HKU1, rhinovirus/human parechovirus, and enterovirus/parainfluenza virus 3. RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 1041 specimens, of which 639 (61%) were positive for at least one virus. Three-quarters of the patients were children under five years old. We therefore focused on this age group, in which 68.1% of patients were positive for at least one virus. The most common viruses were adenoviruses (17.5%), followed by parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1–4 (16.8%), enteroviruses (EV) (14.7%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (13.5%), and influenza virus (11.9%). The prevalence of some viruses was subject to geographic and seasonal variations. One-third of positive samples contained more than one virus. CONCLUSIONS: Like most studies in the world, the virus PIVs, EV, RSV, Influenza virus, HRV were predominant among children under five years old in Gabon. An exception is made for adenoviruses which have a high prevalence in our study. However adenoviruses can be detected in asymptomatic persons. These finding gave a better knowledge of the circulation and the seasonality of the viruses involved in ILI in Gabon.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.270356462,-0.178181195,-0.108654033,0.260587696,0.121799218,0.162958351,-0.074148336,-0.044693646,0.016366508,-0.043713413,0.009066697,-0.034214269,0.044498706,0.030756018,0.032821165,-0.050938286,0.020091603,-0.057789406,0.048875359,0.031177544,0.020408087,-0.035585866,0.006382322,0.035888623,-0.008489275,0.027067851,0.025703372,0.119562858,-0.04070698,-0.024292826
Human Coronaviruses Associated with Upper Respiratory Tract Infections in Three Rural Areas of Ghana,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries, especially in Africa. This study sought to determine whether human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are associated with upper respiratory tract infections among older children and adults in Ghana. METHODS: We conducted a case control study among older children and adults in three rural areas of Ghana using asymptomatic subjects as controls. Nasal/Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), HCoV-22E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 using Reverse Transcriptase Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction. RESULTS: Out of 1,213 subjects recruited, 150 (12.4%) were positive for one or more viruses. Of these, single virus detections occurred in 146 subjects (12.0%) and multiple detections occurred in 4 (0.3%). Compared with control subjects, infections with HCoV-229E (OR = 5.15, 95%CI = 2.24–11.78), HCoV-OC43 (OR = 6.16, 95%CI = 1.77–21.65) and combine HCoVs (OR = 2.36, 95%CI = 1.5 = 3.72) were associated with upper respiratory tract infections. HCoVs were found to be seasonally dependent with significant detections in the harmattan season (mainly HCoV-229E) and wet season (mainly HCoV-NL63). A comparison of the obtained sequences resulted in no differences to sequences already published in GenBank. CONCLUSION: HCoVs could play significant role in causing upper respiratory tract infections among adults and older children in rural areas of Ghana.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.200394382,-0.050876293,-0.124637594,-0.00852351,0.160052807,-0.107438106,0.080450422,-0.033403348,0.203311174,-0.112362803,-0.03026996,0.371717986,0.26550221,0.117166472,-0.018360774,0.110838605,-0.097441486,-0.112866877,-0.018772037,0.012158788,-0.133931538,0.001986334,0.066693144,-0.005918997,0.015933496,-0.018698523,0.032700996,-0.097853779,0.035910783,0.025139631
Establishment and Clinical Applications of a Portable System for Capturing Influenza Viruses Released through Coughing,"Coughing plays an important role in influenza transmission; however, there is insufficient information regarding the viral load in cough because of the lack of convenient and reliable collection methods. We developed a portable airborne particle-collection system to measure the viral load; it is equipped with an air sampler to draw air and pass it through a gelatin membrane filter connected to a cone-shaped, megaphone-like device to guide the cough airflow to the membrane. The membrane was dissolved in a medium, and the viral load was measured using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and a plaque assay. The approximate viral recovery rate of this system was 10% in simulation experiments to collect and quantify the viral particles aerosolized by a nebulizer. Using this system, cough samples were collected from 56 influenza A patients. The total viral detection rate was 41% (23/56), and the viral loads varied significantly (from <10, less than the detection limit, to 2240 viral gene copies/cough). Viable viruses were detected from 3 samples with ≤18 plaque forming units per cough sample. The virus detection rates were similar among different groups of patients infected with different viral subtypes and during different influenza seasons. Among patients who did not receive antiviral treatment, viruses were detected in one of six cases in the vaccinated group and four of six cases in the unvaccinated group. We found cases with high viral titers in throat swabs or oral secretions but very low or undetectable in coughs and vice versa suggesting other possible anatomical sites where the viruses might be mixed into the cough. Our system is easy to operate, appropriate for bedside use, and is useful for comparing the viral load in cough samples from influenza patients under various conditions and settings. However, further large-scale studies are warranted to validate our results.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.115760986,-0.040828439,-0.002491418,0.066084982,-0.056511426,0.061843786,-0.02494506,0.044369199,-0.093274938,0.027221753,-0.007867146,-0.047111199,-0.013354947,0.056330692,-9.95E-05,-0.032729836,-0.031753432,-0.044548134,0.032653032,0.031603204,-0.046792485,0.038317773,-0.074221075,0.016103246,-0.078132998,-0.012029747,0.046159239,-0.019120392,-0.091227663,0.058876898
Involvement of the ERK pathway in the protective effects of glycyrrhizic acid against the MPP(+)-induced apoptosis of dopaminergic neuronal cells,"Glycyrrhizic acid (GA), a major compound separated from Radix Glycyrrhizae, has been shwon to exert various biochemical effects, including neuroprotective effects. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of GA against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-induced damage to differentiated PC12 (DPC12) cells. Compared with the MPP(+)-treated cells, GA markedly improved cell viability, restored mitochondrial dysfunction, suppressed the overexpression of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and suppressed the overproduction of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and intracellular Ca(2+) overload. The protective effects of GA on cell survival were further confirmed in primary cortical neurons. GA markedly increased the expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), as well as its migration from the cytoplasm to nucleus. PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK, blocked GA-enhanced ERK activation and reduced cell viability. However, pre-treatment with GA had no effects on the expression of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) and total AKT (t-AKT). These results indicate that the GA-mediated neuroprotective effects are associated with its modulation of multiple anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic factors, particularly the ERK signaling pathway. This study provides evidence supporting the use of GA as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and neuronal injury.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.066394347,-0.030189436,-0.008370424,-0.115259572,-0.098383579,0.065975207,0.04127929,-0.032837168,0.051789496,-0.030693758,-0.043857353,-0.009840616,-0.016718192,0.048828831,-0.001822176,0.029483215,-0.006425963,-0.020940796,-0.012637727,-0.022234608,0.011396065,-0.012236992,0.006598626,-0.022597134,0.020130909,0.005436105,-0.021754389,0.026477371,0.021681626,-0.049826676
"Molecular Detection of Adenoviruses, Rhabdoviruses, and Paramyxoviruses in Bats from Kenya","We screened 217 bats of at least 20 species from 17 locations in Kenya during July and August of 2006 for the presence of adenovirus, rhabdovirus, and paramyxovirus nucleic acids using generic reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and PCR assays. Of 217 bat fecal swabs examined, 4 bats were adenovirus DNA-positive, 11 bats were paramyxovirus RNA-positive, and 2 bats were rhabdovirus RNA-positive. Three bats were coinfected by two different viruses. By sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis, the Kenya bat paramyxoviruses and rhabdoviruses from this study may represent novel viral lineages within their respective families; the Kenya bat adenoviruses could not be confirmed as novel, because the same region sequences from other known bat adenovirus genomes for comparison were lacking. Our study adds to previous evidence that bats carry diverse, potentially zoonotic viruses and may be coinfected with more than one virus.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.045868087,0.051773589,0.018367069,0.026983526,0.361453527,0.099994849,0.277784471,0.1034042,-0.185300353,-0.079378514,-0.119181966,-0.150572212,-0.058912128,0.105747259,-0.038158798,0.065035215,0.03770892,0.062201605,0.023840159,-0.069779455,-0.058472607,0.037691096,0.001976241,-0.109006985,0.025552206,0.049235514,0.007198144,0.026523886,-0.012110077,0.018176636
Single detection of human bocavirus 1 with a high viral load in severe respiratory tract infections in previously healthy children,"BACKGROUND: Human bocavirus is a newly discovered parvovirus. Multiple studies have confirmed the presence of human bocavirus1 (HBoV1) in respiratory tract samples of children. The viral load, presentation of single detection and its role as a causative agent of severe respiratory tract infections have not been thoroughly elucidated. METHODS: We investigated the presence of HBoV1 by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from 1229 children hospitalized for respiratory tract infections. The samples were analyzed for 15 respiratory viruses by PCR and 7 respiratory viruses by viral culture. RESULTS: At least one virus was detected in 652 (53.1%) of 1229 children, and two or more viruses were detected in 266 (21.6%) children. HBoV1 was detected in 127 children (10.3%), in which 66/127 (52%) of the cases were the only HBoV1 virus detected. Seasonal variation was observed with a high HBoV1 infection rate in summer. A cutoff value of 10(7) copies/mL was used to distinguish high and low HBoV1 viral loads in the nasopharyngeal aspirates. High viral loads of HBoV1 were noted predominantly in the absence of other viral agents (28/39, 71.8%) whereas there was primarily co-detection in cases of low HBoV1 viral loads (50/88, 56.8%). There were no differences in the clinical symptoms and severity between HBoV1 single detection and co-detection. In cases of HBoV1 single detection, the high viral load group was more prevalent among children with dyspnea and wheezing than was the low viral load group (42.9% vs. 23.7%, P = 0.036; 60.7% vs. 31.6%, P = 0.018). In clinical severity, a significant difference was recorded (25.0% vs. 5.3%, P = 0.003) between high viral load and low viral load groups. Of the HBoV1 positive patients associated with severe respiratory tract infections, 10/18 (55.6%) patients belonged to the HBoV1 high viral load group, and 7/10 (70%) patients had cases of HBoV1 single detection. CONCLUSIONS: HBoV1 at a high viral load is not frequently found in co-detection with other respiratory viruses, and a single detection with a high viral load could be an etiological agent of severe respiratory tract infections.

Rapid Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by Recombinase Polymerase Amplification,"Improved access to effective tests for diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) has been designated a public health priority by the World Health Organisation. In high burden TB countries nucleic acid based TB tests have been restricted to centralised laboratories and specialised research settings. Requirements such as a constant electrical supply, air conditioning and skilled, computer literate operators prevent implementation of such tests in many settings. Isothermal DNA amplification technologies permit the use of simpler, less energy intensive detection platforms more suited to low resource settings that allow the accurate diagnosis of a disease within a short timeframe. Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) is a rapid, low temperature isothermal DNA amplification reaction. We report here RPA-based detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) DNA in <20 minutes at 39°C. Assays for two MTC specific targets were investigated, IS6110 and IS1081. When testing purified MTC genomic DNA, limits of detection of 6.25 fg (IS6110) and 20 fg (IS1081)were consistently achieved. When testing a convenience sample of pulmonary specimens from suspected TB patients, RPA demonstrated superior accuracy to indirect fluorescence microscopy. Compared to culture, sensitivities for the IS1081 RPA and microscopy were 91.4% (95%CI: 85, 97.9) and 86.1% (95%CI: 78.1, 94.1) respectively (n = 71). Specificities were 100% and 88.6% (95% CI: 80.8, 96.1) respectively. For the IS6110 RPA and microscopy sensitivities of 87.5% (95%CI: 81.7, 93.2) and 70.8% (95%CI: 62.9, 78.7) were obtained (n = 90). Specificities were 95.4 (95% CI: 92.3,98.1) and 88% (95% CI: 83.6, 92.4) respectively. The superior specificity of RPA for detecting tuberculosis was due to the reduced ability of fluorescence microscopy to distinguish Mtb complex from other acid fast bacteria. The rapid nature of the RPA assay and its low energy requirement compared to other amplification technologies suggest RPA-based TB assays could be of use for integration into a point-of-care test for use in resource constrained settings.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.045209267,0.035692144,0.180915074,-0.002476769,-0.10419266,-0.027185489,0.039448555,0.034680132,-0.051290608,-0.1023582,-0.088454718,0.101313503,-0.038099372,-0.185941488,-0.147693957,0.18878213,-0.158936861,-0.130613314,0.160170078,0.177276618,-0.080048765,0.011549249,0.053146288,-0.046529299,-0.074485056,-0.010562159,-0.00833553,-0.162604848,-0.06647034,-0.032593309
Association of Cytokines in Individuals Sensitive and Insensitive to Dust Mites in a Brazilian Population,"INTRODUCTION: Allergic reaction to dust mites is a relatively common condition among children, triggering cutaneous and respiratory responses that have a great impact on the health of this population. Anaphylactic hypersensitivity is characterized by an exacerbated response involving the production of regulatory cytokines responsible for stimulating the production of IgE antibodies. OBJECTIVE: To investigate an association of variants in cytokine genes (IL1A (−889), IL1B (−511, +3962), IL1R (1970), IL1RA (11100), IL4RA (+1902), IL12 (−1188), IFNG (+874), TGFB1 (codon 10, codon 25), TNFA (−308, −238), IL2 (−330, +166), IL4 (−1098, −590, −33), IL6 (−174, nt565), and IL10 (−1082, −819, −592)) between patients sensitive to dust mites and a control group. METHODS: A total of 254 patients were grouped as atopic and non-atopic according to sensitivity as evaluated by the Prick Test and to cytokine genotyping by the polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP) method using the Cytokine Genotyping Kit. RESULTS: A comparison between individuals allergic to Dermatophagoides farinae, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, and Blomia tropicalis and a non-atopic control group showed significant differences between allele and genotype frequencies in the regulatory regions of cytokine genes, with important evidence for IL4 (−590) in T/C (10.2% vs. 43.1%, odd ratio [OR] = 0.15, p = 5.2 10(−8), pc = 0.0000011, and 95% confidence interval [95%CI] = 0.07–0.32) and T/T genotypes (42.9% vs. 13.8%, OR = 4.69, p = 2.5 10(−6), pc = 0.000055, and 95%CI = 2.42–9.09). Other associations were observed in the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1A (−889) (T/T, C, and T) and IL2 (−330) (G/T and T/T) and the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL4RA (+1902) (A and G), IL4 (−590) (T/C, T/T, C, and T), and IL10 (−592) (A/A, C/A, A, and C).

"Docetaxel induces moderate ovarian toxicity in mice, primarily affecting granulosa cells of early growing follicles","Advances in cancer therapy have focused attention on the quality of life of cancer survivors. Since infertility is a major concern following chemotherapy, it is important to characterize the drug-specific damage to the reproductive system to help find appropriate protective strategies. This study investigates the damage on neonatal mouse ovary maintained in vitro for 6 days, and exposed for 24 h (on Day 2) to clinically relevant doses of Docetaxel (DOC; low: 0.1 µM, mid: 1 µM, high: 10 µM). Furthermore, the study explores the putative protective action exerted by Tri-iodothyronine (T3; 10(−7) M). At the end of culture, morphological analyses and follicle counts showed that DOC negatively impacts on early growing follicles, decreasing primary follicle number and severely affecting health at the transitional and primary stages. Poor follicle health was mainly due to effects on granulosa cells, indicating that the effects of DOC on oocytes were likely to be secondary to granulosa cell damage. DOC damages growing follicles specifically, with no direct effect on the primordial follicle reserve. Immunostaining and western blotting showed that DOC induces activation of intrinsic, type II apoptosis in ovarian somatic cells; increasing the levels of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 8, Bax and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, while also inducing movement of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol. T3 did not prevent the damage induced by the low dose of DOC. These results demonstrated that DOC induces a gonadotoxic effect on the mouse ovary through induction of somatic cell apoptosis, with no evidence of direct effects on the oocyte, and that the damaging effect is not mitigated by T3.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.06783368,-0.028723406,-0.004965837,-0.114079474,-0.097305472,0.067886306,0.035166909,-0.036960326,0.052842312,-0.018070225,-0.044194868,-0.022575378,-0.021183782,0.046804167,0.007867024,0.030747436,-0.022115544,-0.000135361,0.016016945,-0.007709831,0.0162395,-0.010221785,0.015234435,-0.016329653,0.032057065,0.025860152,-0.033022753,0.041784447,0.008043782,-0.076357729
Rapid and sensitive detection of canine distemper virus by one-tube reverse transcription-insulated isothermal polymerase chain reaction,"BACKGROUND: Canine distemper virus (CDV) has been associated with outbreaks of canine infectious respiratory disease in shelters and boarding kennel environments. POCKIT(TM) Nucleic Acid Analyzer is a field-deployable device capable of generating automatically interpreted insulated isothermal polymerase chain reaction (iiPCR) results from extracted nucleic acid within one hour. In this study, reverse transcription iiPCR (RT-iiPCR) was developed to facilitate point-of-need diagnosis of CDV infection. RESULTS: Analytical sensitivity (limit of detection 95%) of the established CDV RT-iiPCR was about 11 copies of in vitro transcribed RNA per reaction. CDV RT-iiPCR generated positive signals from CDV, but not Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine parvovirus, canine herpesvirus, canine adenovirus 2, canine influenza virus (subtype H3N8), canine parainfluenza virus, and canine respiratory coronavirus. To evaluate accuracy of the established reaction in canine distemper clinical diagnosis, 110 specimens from dogs, raccoons, and foxes suspected with CDV infection were tested simultaneously by CDV RT-iiPCR and real-time RT-PCR. CDV RT-iiPCR demonstrated excellent sensitivity (100%) and specificity (100%), compared to real-time RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated an excellent correlation between RT-iiPCR and a reference real time RT-PCR method. Working in a lyophilized format, the established method has great potential to be used for point-of-care diagnosis of canine distemper in animals, especially in resource-limited facilities.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.059124349,0.07978111,0.249341079,0.04351285,0.005379459,-0.024433066,-0.024052254,-0.007354573,-0.020088568,-0.062756956,0.043923435,0.05409698,-0.04656688,0.0191801,0.023607179,-0.01392302,0.008811387,-0.052776421,0.094687806,0.014505444,0.225324731,0.147574926,-0.126038639,0.007751316,0.241962501,-0.11791501,-0.051002635,-0.04020397,-0.039974075,0.071537209
A novel porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus vector system that stably expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein as a separate transcription unit,"Here we report the rescue of a recombinant porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) carrying an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene as a separate transcription unit. A copy of the transcription regulatory sequence for ORF6 (TRS6) was inserted between the N protein and 3′-UTR to drive the transcription of the EGFP gene and yield a general purpose expression vector. Successful recovery of PRRSV was obtained using an RNA polymerase II promoter to drive transcription of the full-length virus genome, which was assembled in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). The recombinant virus showed growth replication characteristics similar to those of the wild-type virus in the infected cells. In addition, the recombinant virus stably expressed EGFP for at least 10 passages. EGFP expression was detected at approximately 10 h post infection by live-cell imaging to follow the virus spread in real time and the infection of neighbouring cells occurred predominantly through cell-to-cell-contact. Finally, the recombinant virus generated was found to be an excellent tool for neutralising antibodies and antiviral compound screening. The newly established reverse genetics system for PRRSV could be a useful tool not only to monitor virus spread and screen for neutralising antibodies and antiviral compounds, but also for fundamental research on the biology of the virus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.113013031,-0.04398998,0.007701757,-0.010090582,-0.052296869,0.029967712,-0.053498427,-0.058390555,0.094142278,0.009087443,-0.069083078,-0.111524046,0.01506324,0.122778291,0.06644406,-0.074213234,0.022543683,-0.049375977,0.016800682,0.080825871,0.018362911,0.004361373,0.070328409,-0.006102421,0.00732152,0.086283019,0.074268755,-0.003710698,-0.12738364,0.062050707
Epidemiology of respiratory viral infections in children enrolled in a study of influenza vaccine effectiveness,"BACKGROUND: Influenza-like illness (ILI) confers a high annual morbidity in young children. We report the epidemiology of ILIs in children who participated in an influenza vaccine effectiveness study during the 2010 Southern Hemisphere influenza season in Sydney, Australia. METHODS: Children aged 0·5–3 years were prospectively recruited from child care centres (CCCs). We classified them as fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated and unvaccinated according to their receipt of unadjuvanted vaccines containing influenza A (H1N1)pdm09. For 13 weeks commencing 30 July 2010, parents reported when their children developed an ILI (fever ≥37·8°C/feverishness plus ≥1 respiratory symptom) and collected nose and/or throat swabs for multiplex respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Health impacts were assessed by telephone interview at enrolment and two weeks after each ILI. RESULTS: There were 124 ILIs reported in 105 of 381 enrolled children. Swabs were taken in 117 ILIs: 175 viruses were identified from 103 swabs. Adeno- and rhinoviruses were most frequently identified; 44% of swabs yielded multiple viruses. No virus was associated with more severe symptoms, although rhinovirus-related ILIs lasted longer. Nose swabs had a higher virus detection rate than throat swabs. Influenza-vaccinated children were 1·6 times (P = 0·001) more likely than unvaccinated children to have a non-influenza ILI. CONCLUSION: Adeno- and rhinoviruses were the most common viruses causing ILI. Swabs taken by parents are an effective method for sample collection. Influenza-like illness was more common in children vaccinated against influenza in this observational study, but prior health-seeking behaviour may have contributed to this difference.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.211016013,-0.136860426,-0.06750627,0.156997954,0.045923721,0.155074306,-0.079178492,-0.056721333,0.027161596,-0.105028435,0.028953226,-0.010858364,-0.052200993,-0.086164374,0.008329043,0.033411315,-0.026947924,-0.079647672,0.023687288,-0.069700282,-0.067105729,0.046386749,-0.002913746,-0.019565082,-0.022938085,0.062543002,-0.037436433,0.048246459,0.040459281,-0.005664453
Impact of 2009 pandemic influenza among Vietnamese children based on a population-based prospective surveillance from 2007 to 2011,"BACKGROUND: Influenza virus is one of the major viral pathogens causing pediatric acute respiratory infection (ARI). The spread of pandemic influenza A (A(H1N1)pdm09) in 2009 around the globe had a huge impact on global health. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of A(H1N1)pdm09 on pediatric ARI in Vietnam. STUDY DESIGN: An ongoing population-based prospective surveillance in central Vietnam was used. All children aged <15 years residing in Nha Trang city, enrolled to the ARI surveillance in Khanh Hoa General Hospital, from February 2007 through March 2011 were studied. Clinical data and nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected. Influenza A was detected and genotyped by multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays and sequencing. RESULTS: Among enrolled 2736 hospitalized ARI cases, 354 (13%) were positive for influenza A. Genotyping results revealed that seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 (sea-H1N1) viruses were cocirculating before A(H1N1)pdm09 appeared in July 2009. The A(H1N1)pdm09 replaced the sea-H1N1 after the pandemic. The majority of influenza A cases (90%) were aged <5 years with incidence rate of 537 (387–775) per 100 000 population. Annual incidence rates of hospitalized influenza cases for pre-, initial and post-pandemic periods among children aged <5 year were 474, 452, and 387 per 100 000, respectively. Children with A(H1N1)pdm09 were elder, visited the hospital earlier, less frequently had severe signs, and were less frequently associated with viral coinfection compared with seasonal influenza cases. CONCLUSIONS: The A(H1N1)pdm09 did not increase the influenza annual hospitalization incidence or disease severity compared with seasonal influenza among pediatric ARI cases in central Vietnam.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.199807115,-0.126387186,-0.069016218,0.150036935,-0.003218264,0.249338368,-0.1388996,-0.007798738,-0.020809816,-0.131048697,0.029647424,0.043906657,-0.016094909,-0.06840448,0.012547996,0.046704122,-0.023973628,-0.038483329,-0.033297486,-0.070879987,-0.040941443,0.05640825,-0.044935306,-0.029883141,-0.052368798,0.063695247,-0.041471856,0.068861838,0.038793657,0.056255885
Verifying the Stability of Selected Genes for Normalization in Q PCR Experiments of Spodoptera frugiperda Cells during AcMNPV Infection,"It is challenging to find genes with stable transcripts for use as reference genes for quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) during viral infection. Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) is known to globally shut off host gene transcription in Sf21 cells and to modify their cytoskeletons. In this study, seven host genes were selected for validation as references for gene expression experiments using qRT-PCR. Two of them, ecdysoneless (ECD) and myosin showed stable RNA levels in our previous microarray study at 6, 12, and 24 hpi for both genes and 48 hpi for ECD. The others, actin, tubulin, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and 28S ribosome (28S), are commonly employed as reference genes for qRT-PCR. Ribosomal protein L35 (L35) gene was selected to test if ribosomal protein genes show stable RNA transcript levels similar to 28S and 18S rRNA and to validate the microarray data. In addition to 28S, previously known to have stable transcript levels, qRT-PCR showed that ECD transcript levels remained constant throughout the time course of AcMNPV infection. Transcripts of cytoskeleton genes such as actin, tubulin, and myosin declined dramatically as the infection progressed. GAPDH and L35 transcripts also declined over time. These results indicate that ECD is a reliable reference gene for qRT-PCR experiments during AcMNPV infection of Spodoptera frugiperda cells. Although 28S could be used as a reference gene for these experiments, it is less useful than ECD because of its abundance, which might make it difficult to establish an accurate baseline value for data analysis.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.075867329,-0.001529846,0.062784432,-0.077370122,-0.003599707,0.01156125,-0.039218203,-0.026552079,0.041715587,-0.02548931,-0.085899865,-0.080217072,0.009606477,0.102172039,-0.016726726,-0.039700112,0.015358794,-0.058578498,-0.042709012,-0.111502752,0.044131475,0.021343404,0.023973893,0.00403813,-0.122562291,-0.055194524,0.076450546,-0.000210285,0.076017677,0.002021656
Cryptosporidiosis caused by Cryptosporidium parvum subtype IIdA15G1 at a dairy farm in Northwestern China,"BACKGROUND: Cryptosporidium spp. are zoonotic parasites responsible for diarrhoeal diseases in animals and humans worldwide. Cattle are the most common mammalian species in which Cryptosporidium is detected, with pre-weaned calves considered to be reservoirs for zoonotic C. parvum. In October 2013, severe diarrhoea was observed in 396 pre-weaned calves at a farm in the Ningxia Autonomous Region of Northwestern China. 356 of the infected calves died despite antibiotic therapy. FINDINGS: 252 faecal samples were collected from the investigated farm. The identity of Cryptosporidium species was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, and by DNA sequence analysis of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene. C. parvum was subtyped using sequence analysis of the 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene. The highest infection rate of 83.3% (40/48) was seen in 2–3-week-old calves with diarrhoea, corresponding to the age at which animals died. Three Cryptosporidium species were identified, including C. parvum (n = 51), C. bovis (n = 1), and C. ryanae (n = 1). All C. parvum isolates were further identified as subtype IIdA15G1. CONCLUSIONS: Cryptosporidium parvum was likely to be most responsible for diarrhoea and death. This is the first report of a cryptosporidiosis outbreak caused by C. parvum IIdA15G1 in Chinese dairy cattle.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.025127933,-0.003704945,0.031971636,-0.122001706,0.078136397,0.038621194,0.022752728,-0.000970813,-0.024215483,-0.0408063,-0.007833475,0.023210847,-0.033553124,-0.045584733,0.038031215,-0.025082307,-0.025819886,0.005859909,0.000627366,-0.033964296,0.024951212,0.013926801,-0.047963194,-0.001477951,0.025285264,-0.041578229,-0.026908382,-0.056218674,0.016142704,-0.00201898
A Novel Psittacine Adenovirus Identified During an Outbreak of Avian Chlamydiosis and Human Psittacosis: Zoonosis Associated with Virus-Bacterium Coinfection in Birds,"Chlamydophila psittaci is found worldwide, but is particularly common among psittacine birds in tropical and subtropical regions. While investigating a human psittacosis outbreak that was associated with avian chlamydiosis in Hong Kong, we identified a novel adenovirus in epidemiologically linked Mealy Parrots, which was not present in healthy birds unrelated to the outbreak or in other animals. The novel adenovirus (tentatively named Psittacine adenovirus HKU1) was most closely related to Duck adenovirus A in the Atadenovirus genus. Sequencing showed that the Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 genome consists of 31,735 nucleotides. Comparative genome analysis showed that the Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 genome contains 23 open reading frames (ORFs) with sequence similarity to known adenoviral genes, and six additional ORFs at the 3′ end of the genome. Similar to Duck adenovirus A, the novel adenovirus lacks LH1, LH2 and LH3, which distinguishes it from other viruses in the Atadenovirus genus. Notably, fiber-2 protein, which is present in Aviadenovirus but not Atadenovirus, is also present in Psittacine adenovirus HKU1. Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 had pairwise amino acid sequence identities of 50.3–54.0% for the DNA polymerase, 64.6–70.7% for the penton protein, and 66.1–74.0% for the hexon protein with other Atadenovirus. The C. psittaci bacterial load was positively correlated with adenovirus viral load in the lung. Immunostaining for fiber protein expression was positive in lung and liver tissue cells of affected parrots, confirming active viral replication. No other viruses were found. This is the first documentation of an adenovirus-C. psittaci co-infection in an avian species that was associated with a human outbreak of psittacosis. Viral-bacterial co-infection often increases disease severity in both humans and animals. The role of viral-bacterial co-infection in animal-to-human transmission of infectious agents has not received sufficient attention and should be emphasized in the investigation of disease outbreaks in human and animals.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.033228586,-0.050253442,-0.03110709,-0.055641154,0.088393184,0.001484266,0.035905007,-0.012531189,0.014782122,0.021976361,-0.083909824,-0.027079555,0.074645554,-0.024572706,0.001641083,-0.092935668,-0.027254078,-0.02632419,-0.003751139,-0.004302659,0.025469879,0.134752624,-0.049499398,0.056662753,-0.076759305,0.013976746,0.029598408,0.07518338,-0.070954974,-0.010656187
Molecular detection and genotypic characterization of Toxoplasma gondii infection in bats in four provinces of China,"BACKGROUND: Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan parasite that infects a wide variety of warm-blooded hosts, including humans. Limited information about T. gondii infection in bats is available in China. The objective of the present study was to determine prevalence and genetic characterization of T. gondii infection in bats in Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangxi and Guangdong provinces, China. METHODS: During May 2005 to August 2013, bats were sampled from Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces, China, and liver tissues were collected for the detection of T. gondii by a nested PCR targeting the B1 gene. The positive samples were genotyped at 11 genetic markers (SAG1, 5′-and 3′-SAG2, alternative SAG2, SAG3, BTUB, GRA6, L358, PK1, c22-8, c29-2, and Apico) using multilocus polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: A total of 626 bats representing 10 species were examined for T. gondii infection, 38 (6.1%) were tested positive with by PCR, 8 positive DNA samples were completely genotyped, of which 3 samples (2 from Cynopterus sphinx, and 1 from Murina leucogaster) represented ToxoDB#10, and 5 samples (2 from Murina leucogaster, 2 from Myotis chinensis, and 1 from Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) belonged to ToxoDB#9 (http://toxodb.org/toxo/). CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed an overall T. gondii prevalence of 6.1% in bats from Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangxi and Guangdong provinces in China, and reported two T. gondii genotypes (ToxoDB#9 and #10) having a wide geographical distribution in China. These results provide new genetic information about T. gondii infection in bats, and have implications for better understanding of the genetic diversity of T. gondii in China and elsewhere.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.00300615,0.03254554,0.039096278,-0.077469596,0.163482898,0.073781499,0.131824739,0.030723137,-0.07789002,-0.045331999,-0.02017417,-0.033427382,-0.051353852,0.041879638,0.014901798,0.028070301,-0.014925974,0.030258209,0.016826161,-0.040932552,-0.002128828,0.026354805,-0.012591193,-0.078529652,0.002773247,0.014145421,-0.005385555,0.034097249,-0.011874178,0.016949876
Isothermal Amplification Methods for the Detection of Nucleic Acids in Microfluidic Devices,"Diagnostic tools for biomolecular detection need to fulfill specific requirements in terms of sensitivity, selectivity and high-throughput in order to widen their applicability and to minimize the cost of the assay. The nucleic acid amplification is a key step in DNA detection assays. It contributes to improving the assay sensitivity by enabling the detection of a limited number of target molecules. The use of microfluidic devices to miniaturize amplification protocols reduces the required sample volume and the analysis times and offers new possibilities for the process automation and integration in one single device. The vast majority of miniaturized systems for nucleic acid analysis exploit the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification method, which requires repeated cycles of three or two temperature-dependent steps during the amplification of the nucleic acid target sequence. In contrast, low temperature isothermal amplification methods have no need for thermal cycling thus requiring simplified microfluidic device features.

Cytoplasmic Translocation of Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein and Its Binding to Viral RNA during Japanese Encephalitis Virus Infection Inhibits Virus Replication,"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome containing a single open reading frame flanked by the 5′- and 3′-non-coding regions (NCRs). The virus genome replicates via a negative-sense RNA intermediate. The NCRs and their complementary sequences in the negative-sense RNA are the sites for assembly of the RNA replicase complex thereby regulating the RNA synthesis and virus replication. In this study, we show that the 55-kDa polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) interacts in vitro with both the 5′-NCR of the positive-sense genomic RNA - 5NCR(+), and its complementary sequence in the negative-sense replication intermediate RNA - 3NCR(-). The interaction of viral RNA with PTB was validated in infected cells by JEV RNA co-immunoprecipitation and JEV RNA-PTB colocalization experiments. Interestingly, we observed phosphorylation-coupled translocation of nuclear PTB to cytoplasmic foci that co-localized with JEV RNA early during JEV infection. Our studies employing the PTB silencing and over-expression in cultured cells established an inhibitory role of PTB in JEV replication. Using RNA-protein binding assay we show that PTB competitively inhibits association of JEV 3NCR(-) RNA with viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5 protein), an event required for the synthesis of the plus-sense genomic RNA. cAMP is known to promote the Protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated PTB phosphorylation. We show that cells treated with a cAMP analogue had an enhanced level of phosphorylated PTB in the cytoplasm and a significantly suppressed JEV replication. Data presented here show a novel, cAMP-induced, PTB-mediated, innate host response that could effectively suppress JEV replication in mammalian cells.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.198476663,-0.053355505,-0.061728836,0.06563048,-0.041059665,-0.076894088,-0.021148534,0.028571866,-0.017891866,-0.01470188,0.040811812,-0.020842188,-0.027503244,0.084321999,0.012451423,0.02468278,0.009316974,-0.030697118,0.005705408,0.008809206,-0.036952606,0.032987591,-0.032874529,-0.058497863,-0.027945192,-0.022805697,-0.010603226,0.00827158,-0.024718982,0.024077559
Subgenomic promoter recognition by the norovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerases,"The replication enzyme of RNA viruses must preferentially recognize their RNAs in an environment that contains an abundance of cellular RNAs. The factors responsible for specific RNA recognition are not well understood, in part because viral RNA synthesis takes place within enzyme complexes associated with modified cellular membrane compartments. Recombinant RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) from the human norovirus and the murine norovirus (MNV) were found to preferentially recognize RNA segments that contain the promoter and a short template sequence for subgenomic RNA synthesis. Both the promoter and template sequence contribute to stable RdRp binding, accurate initiation of the subgenomic RNAs and efficient RNA synthesis. Using a method that combines RNA crosslinking and mass spectrometry, residues near the template channel of the MNV RdRp were found to contact the hairpin RNA motif. Mutations in the hairpin contact site in the MNV RdRp reduced MNV replication and virus production in cells. This work demonstrates that the specific recognition of the norovirus subgenomic promoter is through binding by the viral RdRp.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.25932623,-0.063131329,-0.080914084,0.156908048,-0.041528116,-0.128252089,0.00193163,0.05727051,-0.07066692,0.01113253,0.100371666,0.071654539,-0.065464425,0.017888625,0.000565745,0.041606203,-0.016269746,-0.043465596,-0.017264069,-0.015285465,0.015906287,0.000814028,0.003861661,-0.057650745,-0.011498988,-0.02888941,-0.01611046,0.033942876,0.065838765,0.052713054
Viral etiology of community-acquired pneumonia among adolescents and adults with mild or moderate severity and its relation to age and severity,"BACKGROUND: Better knowledge of distribution of respiratory viruses (RVs) in adolescents and adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is needed. METHODS: To investigate the RVs etiology among adolescents and adults with CAP, according to age and pneumonia severity index (PSI), a multi-center, prospective study was conducted from November 2010 to April 2012. Fifteen RVs were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Bacteria were detected by urinary antigen, conventional culture and PCR. RESULTS: Mean (SD) age and median (IQR) PSI score of 954 patients enrolled was 45.2 (19.5) years (range 14–94) and 42 (36). RVs were found in 262 patients (27.5%): influenza virus A (IFV A, 9.9%) comprised of pandemic H1N1 (6.7%) and seasonal H3N2 (3.5%), human rhinovirus (4.3%), adenovirus (4.2%), human metapneumovirus (1.8%), parainfluenza virus 1, 3 and 2 (1.7%, 1.5% and 1.2%). Influenza virus B, enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human coronavirus and parainfluenza virus 4 were rarely detected (<1%). Frequency of IFV A was highest among patients aged between 45–64 years (p < 0.001), while adenovirus among patients aged 14–17 years (p < 0.001), no differences was found in other RVs. The proportion of pandemic H1N1 increased with severity of pneumonia evaluated by PSI (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of RVs in CAP is higher than previously reported. IFV A pneumonia are usually found in patients older than 45 years, while, adenovirus pneumonia are common in adolescents and young adults. Pandemic H1N1 virus is still recognized by PSI as a high-severity pathogen.

Viral infections in outpatients with medically attended acute respiratory illness during the 2012–2013 influenza season,"BACKGROUND: While it is known that acute respiratory illness (ARI) is caused by an array of viruses, less is known about co-detections and the resultant comparative symptoms and illness burden. This study examined the co-detections, the distribution of viruses, symptoms, and illness burden associated with ARI between December 2012 and March 2013. METHODS: Outpatients with ARI were assayed for presence of 18 viruses using multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (MRT-PCR) to simultaneously detect multiple viruses. RESULTS: Among 935 patients, 60% tested positive for a single virus, 9% tested positive for ≥1 virus and 287 (31%) tested negative. Among children (<18 years), the respective distributions were 63%, 14%, and 23%; whereas for younger adults (18–49 years), the distributions were 58%, 8%, and 34% and for older adults (≥50 years) the distributions were 61%, 5%, and 32% (P < 0.001). Co-detections were more common in children than older adults (P = 0.01), and less frequent in households without children (P = 0.003). Most frequently co-detected viruses were coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A virus. Compared with single viral infections, those with co-detections less frequently reported sore throat (P = 0.01), missed fewer days of school (1.1 vs. 2 days; P = 0.04), or work (2 vs. 3 days; P = 0.03); other measures of illness severity did not vary. CONCLUSIONS: Among outpatients with ARI, 69% of visits were associated with a viral etiology. Co-detections of specific clusters of viruses were observed in 9% of ARI cases particularly in children, were less frequent in households without children, and were less symptomatic (e.g., lower fever) than single infections.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.214055036,-0.113258363,-0.08765691,0.061157376,0.050614153,-0.050002219,0.016423359,-0.036007286,0.01937639,-0.008250642,0.031170726,-0.020429667,-0.013954715,-0.023644855,0.027709317,0.00455394,-0.018584054,-0.065033396,0.027272794,-0.025722767,-0.072038306,0.041873184,-0.041503187,0.047696266,-0.027795577,0.061627224,-0.001645927,-0.00961197,0.025621303,-0.031463575
Novel adenovirus detected in captive bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) suffering from self-limiting gastroenteritis,"BACKGROUND: Adenoviruses are common pathogens in vertebrates, including humans. In marine mammals, adenovirus has been associated with fatal hepatitis in sea lions. However, only in rare cases have adenoviruses been detected in cetaceans, where no clear correlation was found between presence of the virus and disease status. CASE PRESENTATION: A novel adenovirus was identified in four captive bottlenose dolphins with self-limiting gastroenteritis. Viral detection and identification were achieved by: PCR-amplification from fecal samples; sequencing of partial adenovirus polymerase (pol) and hexon genes; producing the virus in HeLa cells, with PCR and immunofluorescence detection, and with sequencing of the amplified pol and hexon gene fragments. A causative role of this adenovirus for gastroenteritis was suggested by: 1) we failed to identify other potential etiological agents; 2) the exclusive detection of this novel adenovirus and of seropositivity for canine adenoviruses 1 and 2 in the four sick dolphins, but not in 10 healthy individuals of the same captive population; and 3) the virus disappeared from feces after clinical signs receded. The partial sequences of the amplified fragments of the pol and hexon genes were closest to those of adenoviruses identified in sea lions with fatal adenoviral hepatitis, and to a Genbank-deposited sequence obtained from a harbour porpoise. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that adenovirus can cause self-limiting gastroenteritis in dolphins. This adenoviral infection can be detected by serology and by PCR detection in fecal material. Lack of signs of hepatitis in sick dolphins may reflect restricted tissue tropism or virulence of this adenovirus compared to those of the adenovirus identified in sea lions. Gene sequence-based phylogenetic analysis supports a common origin of adenoviruses that affect sea mammals. Our findings suggest the need for vigilance against adenoviruses in captive and wild dolphin populations.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.004439537,-0.021673944,0.066364719,-0.049742656,0.069629429,0.003801303,0.032479839,-0.006745889,-0.012067863,0.00804822,-0.039463053,-0.042993677,0.017982045,-0.029464695,0.036994422,-0.0452286,-0.030046445,-0.028136051,0.00387258,-0.063333877,0.062047221,0.107746824,-0.011685896,0.054981467,-0.013956772,-0.018378315,0.005161486,0.076989403,-0.059188736,-0.018603675
Bovine Rhinitis Viruses Are Common in U.S. Cattle with Bovine Respiratory Disease,"Bovine rhinitis viruses (BRV) are established etiological agents of bovine respiratory disease complex however little research into their epidemiology and ecology has been published for several decades. In the U.S., only bovine rhinitis A virus 1 (BRAV1) has been identified while bovine rhinitis A virus 2 (BRAV2) and bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) were previously only identified in England and Japan, respectively. Metagenomic sequencing of a nasal swab from a bovine respiratory disease (BRD) diagnostic submission from Kansas identified contigs with approximately 90% nucleotide similarity to BRAV2 and BRBV. A combination of de novo and templated assemblies using reference genomes yielded near complete BRAV2 and BRBV genomes. The near complete genome of bovine rhinitis A virus 1 (BRAV1) was also determined from a historical isolate to enable further molecular epidemiological studies. A 5’-nuclease reverse transcription PCR assay targeting the 3D polymerase gene was designed and used to screen 204 archived BRD clinical specimens. Thirteen (6.4%) were positive. Metagenomic sequencing of six positive samples identified mixed BRAV1/BRAV2, BRAV1/BRBV and BRAV2/BRBV infections for five samples. One sample showed infection only with BRAV1. Seroprevalence studies using a cell culture adapted BRBV found immunofluorescence assay-reactive antibodies were common in the herds analyzed. Altogether, these results demonstrate that BRV infections are common in cattle with respiratory disease and that BRAV1, BRAV2 and BRBV co-circulate in U.S. cattle and have high similarity to viruses isolated more than 30 years ago from diverse locations.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.030288351,-0.015727459,0.06354338,-0.004451038,0.056933576,-0.018020394,0.015186685,-0.012545916,0.01063749,0.024446009,-0.012216401,-0.004444698,0.021781236,-0.019041368,0.05810603,-0.060027757,0.009170467,-0.017866038,0.038895717,-0.01338726,0.061354607,-0.017769853,-0.027132701,0.02749175,0.015400473,0.00933606,0.009283129,-0.045435445,0.009005857,-0.058643465
Molecular Typing and Epidemiology Profiles of Human Adenovirus Infection among Paediatric Patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Infection in China,"BACKGROUND: Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) have been recognised as pathogens that cause a broad spectrum of diseases. The studies on HAdV infection among children with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) are limited. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence, epidemiology, and genotype of HAdV among children with SARI in China. STUDY DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) or induced sputum (IS) was collected from hospitalised children with SARIs in Beijing (representing Northern China; n = 259) and Zhejiang Province (representing Eastern China; n = 293) from 2007 to 2010. The prevalence of HAdV was screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by sequence typing of PCR fragments that targeted the second half of the hexon gene. In addition, co-infection with other human respiratory viruses, related epidemiological profiles and clinical presentations were investigated. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In total, 76 (13.8%) of 552 SARI patients were positive for HAdV, and the infection rates of HAdV in Northern and Eastern China were 20.1% (n = 52) and 8.2% (n = 24), respectively. HAdV co-infection with other respiratory viruses was frequent (infection rates: Northern China, 90.4%; Eastern China, 70.8%). The peak seasons for HAdV-B infection was winter and spring. Additionally, members of multiple species (Human mastadenovirus B, C, D and E) were circulating among paediatric patients with SARI, of which HAdV-B (34/52; 65.4%) and HAdV-C (20/24, 83.3%) were the most predominant in Northern and Eastern China, respectively. These findings provide a benchmark for future epidemiology and prevention strategies for HAdV.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.107429512,-0.049884863,-0.046314955,-0.069259191,0.074104178,-0.023185837,0.039932142,-0.031190811,0.025701465,-0.018779879,-0.021870324,0.056706775,-0.029677576,-0.033027753,0.032812205,-0.0238056,-0.094656023,0.03633904,-0.030642216,-0.053704525,0.036337913,0.236394374,-0.031905493,0.05549119,-0.141806773,0.137882157,-0.034029968,0.326958778,-0.126090266,0.020447585
Antiviral Activity and Possible Mechanism of Action of Constituents Identified in Paeonia lactiflora Root toward Human Rhinoviruses,"Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are responsible for more than half of all cases of the common cold and cost billions of USD annually in medical visits and missed school and work. An assessment was made of the antiviral activities and mechanisms of action of paeonol (PA) and 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-β-D-glucopyranose (PGG) from Paeonia lactiflora root toward HRV-2 and HRV-4 in MRC5 cells using a tetrazolium method and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results were compared with those of a reference control ribavirin. Based on 50% inhibitory concentration values, PGG was 13.4 and 18.0 times more active toward HRV-2 (17.89 μM) and HRV-4 (17.33 μM) in MRC5 cells, respectively, than ribavirin. The constituents had relatively high selective index values (3.3–>8.5). The 100 μg/mL PA and 20 μg/mL PGG did not interact with the HRV-4 particles. These constituents inhibited HRV-4 infection only when they were added during the virus inoculation (0 h), the adsorption period of HRVs, but not after 1 h or later. Moreover, the RNA replication levels of HRVs were remarkably reduced in the MRC5 cultures treated with these constituents. These findings suggest that PGG and PA may block or reduce the entry of the viruses into the cells to protect the cells from the virus destruction and abate virus replication, which may play an important role in interfering with expressions of rhinovirus receptors (intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and low-density lipoprotein receptor), inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor, interferon beta, and IL-1β), and Toll-like receptor, which resulted in diminishing symptoms induced by HRV. Global efforts to reduce the level of synthetic drugs justify further studies on P. lactiflora root-derived materials as potential anti-HRV products or lead molecules for the prevention or treatment of HRV.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.01948041,-0.057371668,-0.013782167,-0.060194469,-0.093915913,0.022208583,0.069523999,-0.042585884,0.067792646,-0.020827726,-0.012391408,-0.045146564,-0.050868071,0.099493679,0.019524454,0.031373339,-0.023897947,-0.020692527,0.100446278,-0.078316996,0.01877763,-0.114259027,-0.046988393,0.125923572,-0.135182449,0.166622214,-0.075947559,0.021525324,0.134498294,0.25856653
mRNA maturation in giant viruses: variation on a theme,"Giant viruses from the Mimiviridae family replicate entirely in their host cytoplasm where their genes are transcribed by a viral transcription apparatus. mRNA polyadenylation uniquely occurs at hairpin-forming palindromic sequences terminating viral transcripts. Here we show that a conserved gene cluster both encode the enzyme responsible for the hairpin cleavage and the viral polyA polymerases (vPAP). Unexpectedly, the vPAPs are homodimeric and uniquely self-processive. The vPAP backbone structures exhibit a symmetrical architecture with two subdomains sharing a nucleotidyltransferase topology, suggesting that vPAPs originate from an ancestral duplication. A Poxvirus processivity factor homologue encoded by Megavirus chilensis displays a conserved 5′-GpppA 2′O methyltransferase activity but is also able to internally methylate the mRNAs’ polyA tails. These findings elucidate how the arm wrestling between hosts and their viruses to access the translation machinery is taking place in Mimiviridae.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.125390829,-0.062627863,-0.036566128,0.001490263,-0.004212518,0.0010838,0.014947281,0.001983717,-0.001574462,-0.007391839,-0.049608164,-0.031787235,0.01457122,0.014996854,-0.028256399,-0.03238253,0.0329353,-0.060393724,-0.04606489,0.008559,-0.007305844,0.048161427,-0.069419339,0.03501028,-0.033716663,-0.063651074,0.002470545,-0.00565599,0.072794185,-0.020932411
Detection of new genetic variants of Betacoronaviruses in Endemic Frugivorous Bats of Madagascar,"BACKGROUND: Bats are amongst the natural reservoirs of many coronaviruses (CoVs) of which some can lead to severe infection in human. African bats are known to harbor a range of pathogens (e.g., Ebola and Marburg viruses) that can infect humans and cause disease outbreaks. A recent study in South Africa isolated a genetic variant closely related to MERS-CoV from an insectivorous bat. Though Madagascar is home to 44 bat species (41 insectivorous and 3 frugivorous) of which 34 are endemic, no data exists concerning the circulation of CoVs in the island’s chiropteran fauna. Certain Malagasy bats can be frequently found in close contact with humans and frugivorous bats feed in the same trees where people collect and consume fruits and are hunted and consumed as bush meat. The purpose of our study is to detect and identify CoVs from frugivorous bats in Madagascar to evaluate the risk of human infection from infected bats. METHODS: Frugivorous bats belonging to three species were captured in four different regions of Madagascar. We analyzed fecal and throat swabs to detect the presence of virus through amplification of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, which is highly conserved in all known coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses were performed from positive specimens. RESULTS: From 351 frugivorous bats, we detected 14 coronaviruses from two endemic bats species, of which 13 viruses were identified from Pteropus rufus and one from Eidolon dupreanum, giving an overall prevalence of 4.5%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Malagasy strains belong to the genus Betacoronavirus but form three distinct clusters, which seem to represent previously undescribed genetic lineages. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that CoVs circulate in frugivorous bats of Madagascar, demonstrating the needs to evaluate spillover risk to human populations especially for individuals that hunt and consume infected bats. Possible dispersal mechanisms as to how coronaviruses arrived on Madagascar are discussed.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.050395171,0.092397446,-0.061330112,0.003417784,0.386136159,0.148303803,0.338458469,0.133836246,-0.141732166,-0.069334941,-0.107970574,-0.131873554,-0.071260258,0.073657314,-0.060878847,0.085816547,0.016048298,0.06786177,0.021996374,-0.007920335,-0.040660871,-0.02816112,0.034914485,-0.087770025,0.062356121,0.054041442,-0.028517099,0.017636627,0.00052733,0.015334006
Laboratory Investigation and Phylogenetic Analysis of an Imported Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Case in Greece,"Rapid and reliable laboratory diagnosis of persons suspected of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection is important for timely implementation of infection control practices and disease management. In addition, monitoring molecular changes in the virus can help elucidate chains of transmission and identify mutations that might influence virus transmission efficiency. This was illustrated by a recent laboratory investigation we conducted on an imported MERS-CoV case in Greece. Two oropharyngeal swab specimens were collected on the 1(st) and 2(nd) day of patient hospitalization and tested using two real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays targeting the UpE and Orf-1a regions of the MERS-CoV genome and RT-PCR and partial sequencing of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nucleocapsid genes. Serum specimens were also collected and serological test were performed. Results from the first swab sample were inconclusive while the second swab was strongly positive for MERS-CoV RNA by rRT-PCR and confirmed positive by RT-PCR and partial gene sequencing. Positive serologic test results further confirmed MERS-CoV infection. Full-length nucleocapsid and spike gene coding sequences were later obtained from the positive swab sample. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus was closely related to recent human-derived MERS-CoV strains obtained in Jeddah and Makkah, Saudi Arabia, in April 2014 and dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. These findings were consistent with the patient’s history. We also identified a unique amino acid substitution in the spike receptor binding domain that may have implications for receptor binding efficiency. Our initial inconclusive rRT-PCR results highlight the importance of collecting multiple specimens from suspect MERS-CoV cases and particularly specimens from the lower respiratory tract.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.057791182,0.347261294,-0.052079615,0.054968833,0.080148245,-0.015698019,-0.087572067,0.357732695,0.288854017,-0.000172479,0.058915977,-0.027134166,-0.027501622,0.015419511,0.002036026,-0.070158305,0.04299306,-0.064562164,-0.028273349,-0.086403656,0.002274571,0.054736234,0.041564404,0.002098097,-0.027847569,0.000545829,0.036087651,-0.03597672,-0.011041212,0.013800514
Resolution of the cellular proteome of the nucleocapsid protein from a highly pathogenic isolate of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus identifies PARP-1 as a cellular target whose interaction is critical for virus biology,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a major threat to the swine industry and food security worldwide. The nucleocapsid (N) protein is a major structural protein of PRRSV. The primary function of this protein is to encapsidate the viral RNA genome, and it is also thought to participate in the modulation of host cell biology and recruitment of cellular factors to facilitate virus infection. In order to the better understand these latter roles the cellular interactome of PRRSV N protein was defined using label free quantitative proteomics. This identified several cellular factors that could interact with the N protein including poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1), a cellular protein, which can add adenosine diphosphate ribose to a protein. Use of the PARP-1 small molecule inhibitor, 3-AB, in PRRSV infected cells demonstrated that PARP-1 was required and acted as an enhancer factor for virus biology. Serial growth of PRRSV in different concentrations of 3-AB did not yield viruses that were able to grow with wild type kinetics, suggesting that by targeting a cellular protein crucial for virus biology, resistant phenotypes did not emerge. This study provides further evidence that cellular proteins, which are critical for virus biology, can also be targeted to ablate virus growth and provide a high barrier for the emergence of drug resistance.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.135400747,-0.064656189,-0.038816168,-0.010082903,-0.083523237,0.045123501,0.018189311,-0.053603128,0.082624999,0.023823843,-0.077659941,-0.058541621,0.019268294,0.058283061,0.02462873,-0.105806823,0.079607311,-0.08170251,-0.011610968,0.131008165,-0.058327074,0.041189274,0.010153024,-0.061154404,0.068210554,0.101483177,0.045163941,-0.060343268,-0.09205816,0.056630197
Diversity of coronavirus in bats from Eastern Thailand,"BACKGROUND: Bats are reservoirs for a diverse range of coronaviruses (CoVs), including those closely related to human pathogens such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV. There are approximately 139 bat species reported to date in Thailand, of which two are endemic species. Due to the zoonotic potential of CoVs, standardized surveillance efforts to characterize viral diversity in wildlife are imperative. FINDINGS: A total of 626 bats from 19 different bat species were individually sampled from 5 provinces in Eastern Thailand between 2008 and 2013 (84 fecal and 542 rectal swabs). Samples collected (either fresh feces or rectal swabs) were placed directly into RNA stabilization reagent, transported on ice within 24 hours and preserved at −80°C until further analysis. CoV RNA was detected in 47 specimens (7.6%), from 13 different bat species, using broadly reactive consensus PCR primers targeting the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase gene designed to detect all CoVs. Thirty seven alphacoronaviruses, nine lineage D betacoronaviruses, and one lineage B betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV related) were identified. Six new bat CoV reservoirs were identified in our study, namely Cynopterus sphinx, Taphozous melanopogon, Hipposideros lekaguli, Rhinolophus shameli, Scotophilus heathii and Megaderma lyra. CONCLUSIONS: CoVs from the same genetic lineage were found in different bat species roosting in similar or different locations. These data suggest that bat CoV lineages are not strictly concordant with their hosts. Our phylogenetic data indicates high diversity and a complex ecology of CoVs in bats sampled from specific areas in eastern regions of Thailand. Further characterization of additional CoV genes may be useful to better describe the CoV divergence.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.043712787,0.3125435,-0.161007675,0.042689381,0.354301513,0.106900773,0.273481213,0.102634422,-0.078669949,-0.075202241,-0.091226811,-0.153742483,-0.075201494,0.058517049,-0.036380127,0.069981435,0.003244214,0.033128957,0.030961048,-0.01024252,-0.052758894,-0.009781101,0.074579107,-0.04434861,0.049396401,0.019459719,-0.036613922,0.018920996,0.033696192,0.028076803
Perturbations at the ribosomal genes loci are at the centre of cellular dysfunction and human disease,"Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene (rDNA) transcription by RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) drives cell growth and underlies nucleolar structure and function, indirectly coordinating many fundamental cellular processes. The importance of keeping rDNA transcription under tight control is reflected by the fact that deranged Pol I transcription is a feature of cancer and other human disorders. In this review, we discuss multiple aspects of rDNA function including the relationship between Pol I transcription and proliferative capacity, the role of Pol I transcription in mediating nucleolar structure and integrity, and rDNA/nucleolar interactions with the genome and their influence on heterochromatin and global genome stability. Furthermore, we discuss how perturbations in the structure of the rDNA loci might contribute to human disease, in some cases independent of effects on ribosome biogenesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.126440617,-0.036704309,-0.021509172,-0.007804561,-0.04059931,-0.012225523,0.018737103,0.002467294,0.023577469,-0.018017476,-0.025405389,0.004197144,0.004059077,0.008924428,-0.021803727,0.016090112,0.007071152,-0.038523393,-0.10373557,-0.023349938,-0.010914209,0.021730472,-0.081328053,0.018662617,-0.01551047,-0.074134793,-0.015868366,0.046581134,0.051850337,-0.098264535
Neopterin in Diagnosis and Monitoring of Infectious Diseases,"Neopterin is produced by activated monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells upon stimulation by interferon gamma produced by T-lymphocytes. Quantification of neopterin in body fluids has been achieved by standard high-performance liquid chromatography, radioimmunoassays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Neopterin levels predict HIV-related mortality more efficiently than clinical manifestations. Successful highly active antiretroviral therapy is associated with a decrease in neopterin levels. Elevated neopterin levels were associated with hepatitis by hepatitis A, B, and C viruses. Serum neopterin levels were found to be a predictor of response to treatment of chronic HCV infection with pegylated interferon combined with ribavirin. Neopterin levels of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were found to be higher in patients with more extensive radiological changes. Elimination of blood donors with elevated neopterin levels to reduce risk of transmission of infections with known and unknown viral pathogens has been undertaken. Neopterin measurement is hereby more cost effective but less sensitive than screening using polymerase chain reaction based assays. In conclusion neopterin is a nonspecific marker of activated T-helper cell 1 dominated immune response. It may be a useful marker for monitoring of infectious disease activity during treatment and for more accurate estimation of extent of disease and prognosis.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.014675534,-0.017992333,0.004134911,-0.091847162,-0.083891599,0.029557817,0.035030318,0.015282607,0.00270398,0.007052781,-0.01548629,0.000514749,0.012428037,0.023423642,-0.012780485,0.017675684,-0.014507929,0.041115903,0.015023199,-0.035999617,0.01333228,-0.037098197,0.01396751,0.003989643,-0.020532193,-0.020116724,-0.003896951,-0.015439452,0.003012148,-0.015851557
CXCR2 is essential for cerebral endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment during neuroinflammation,"BACKGROUND: Chemokines and chemokine receptors cooperate to promote immune cell recruitment to the central nervous system (CNS). In this study, we investigated the roles of CXCR2 and CXCL1 in leukocyte recruitment to the CNS using a murine model of neuroinflammation. METHODS: Wild-type (WT), CXCL1(−/−), and CXCR2(−/−) mice each received an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Esterase staining and intravital microscopy were performed to examine neutrophil recruitment to the brain. To assess endothelial activation in these mice, the expression of adhesion molecules was measured via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting. To identify the cellular source of functional CXCR2, chimeric mice were generated by transferring bone marrow cells between the WT and CXCR2(−/−) mice. RESULTS: Expression levels of the chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5 were significantly increased in the brain following the i.c.v. injection of LPS. CXCR2 or CXCL1 deficiency blocked neutrophil infiltration and leukocyte recruitment in the cerebral microvessels. In the CXCR2(−/−) and CXCL1(−/−) mice, the cerebral endothelial expression of adhesion molecules such as P-selectin and VCAM-1 was dramatically reduced. Furthermore, the bone marrow transfer experiments demonstrated that CXCR2 expression on CNS-residing cells is essential for cerebral endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment. Compared with microglia, cultured astrocytes secreted a much higher level of CXCL1 in vitro. Astrocyte culture conditioned medium significantly increased the expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in cerebral endothelial cells in a CXCR2-dependent manner. Additionally, CXCR2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in cerebral endothelial cells but not in microglia or astrocytes was increased following tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) stimulation. The intravenous injection of the CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 significantly inhibited endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment to cerebral microvessels. CONCLUSIONS: CXCL1 secreted by astrocytes and endothelial CXCR2 play essential roles in cerebral endothelial activation and subsequent leukocyte recruitment during neuroinflammation.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.064804106,-0.032528577,0.007629323,-0.11025522,-0.076510264,0.039083915,0.020285793,-0.025917392,0.03318302,-0.049399926,-0.036788028,-0.020585932,-0.027420556,0.062658499,-0.003814656,0.031966123,-0.008676835,-0.053582938,-0.024591254,-0.057475209,0.041719361,-0.017513651,0.031238134,-0.012050976,-0.018940721,-0.009718835,-0.004855002,0.0180441,0.020596003,-0.043968583
Fecal virome analysis of three carnivores reveals a novel nodavirus and multiple gemycircularviruses,"BACKGROUND: More knowledge about viral populations in wild animals is needed in order to better understand and assess the risk of zoonotic diseases. In this study we performed viral metagenomic analysis of fecal samples from three healthy carnivores: a badger (Meles meles), a mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon) and an otter (Lutra lutra) from Portugal. RESULTS: We detected the presence of novel highly divergent viruses in the fecal material of the carnivores analyzed, such as five gemycircularviruses. Four of these gemycircularviruses were found in the mongoose and one in the badger. In addition we also identified an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene from a putative novel member of the Nodaviridae family in the fecal material of the otter. CONCLUSIONS: Together these results underline that many novel viruses are yet to be discovered and that fecal associated viruses are not always related to disease. Our study expands the knowledge of viral species present in the gut, although the interpretation of the true host species of such novel viruses needs to be reviewed with great caution.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.046880121,-0.023423415,-0.000916116,0.022699445,0.104257087,0.026505794,0.12151588,0.038721555,-0.067201272,0.040278707,0.005643252,-0.039192958,-0.009306546,0.015128807,0.021738345,-0.037189167,-0.020295453,-0.027187254,0.006411472,0.012880554,0.011608188,0.070488072,-0.09403683,0.051544693,-0.030948385,-0.043924248,0.042895084,-0.03282983,-0.007471465,-0.012923728
LeishVet update and recommendations on feline leishmaniosis,"Limited data is available on feline leishmaniosis (FeL) caused by Leishmania infantum worldwide. The LeishVet group presents in this report a review of the current knowledge on FeL, the epidemiological role of the cat in L. infantum infection, clinical manifestations, and recommendations on diagnosis, treatment and monitoring, prognosis and prevention of infection, in order to standardize the management of this disease in cats. The consensus of opinions and recommendations was formulated by combining a comprehensive review of evidence-based studies and case reports, clinical experience and critical consensus discussions. While subclinical feline infections are common in areas endemic for canine leishmaniosis, clinical illness due to L. infantum in cats is rare. The prevalence rates of feline infection with L. infantum in serological or molecular-based surveys range from 0 % to more than 60 %. Cats are able to infect sand flies and, therefore, they may act as a secondary reservoir, with dogs being the primary natural reservoir. The most common clinical signs and clinicopathological abnormalities compatible with FeL include lymph node enlargement and skin lesions such as ulcerative, exfoliative, crusting or nodular dermatitis (mainly on the head or distal limbs), ocular lesions (mainly uveitis), feline chronic gingivostomatitis syndrome, mucocutaneous ulcerative or nodular lesions, hypergammaglobulinaemia and mild normocytic normochromic anaemia. Clinical illness is frequently associated with impaired immunocompetence, as in case of retroviral coinfections or immunosuppressive therapy. Diagnosis is based on serology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cytology, histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) or culture. If serological testing is negative or low positive in a cat with clinical signs compatible with FeL, the diagnosis of leishmaniosis should not be excluded and additional diagnostic methods (cytology, histology with IHC, PCR, culture) should be employed. The most common treatment used is allopurinol. Meglumine antimoniate has been administered in very few reported cases. Both drugs are administered alone and most cats recover clinically after therapy. Follow-up of treated cats with routine laboratory tests, serology and PCR is essential for prevention of clinical relapses. Specific preventative measures for this infection in cats are currently not available.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.057449929,0.018455461,0.064618696,-0.151583815,-0.040276695,0.047989427,0.064323637,0.037732076,-0.027397035,-0.065586788,0.323568807,-0.122449283,0.237231618,-0.093583328,-0.058112727,-0.049500988,0.006003069,0.067009307,-0.02202537,0.041156068,0.024293492,-0.013624975,-0.008617988,-0.062970071,0.017086059,0.001688752,-0.016298889,0.002457081,0.029008925,0.012449696
Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Assay for Rapid Diagnostics of Dengue Infection,"BACKGROUND: Over 2.5 billion people are exposed to the risk of contracting dengue fever (DF). Early diagnosis of DF helps to diminish its burden on public health. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase amplification assays (RT-PCR) are the standard method for molecular detection of the dengue virus (DENV). Real-time RT-PCR analysis is not suitable for on-site screening since mobile devices are large, expensive, and complex. In this study, two RT-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assays were developed to detect DENV1-4. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using two quantitative RNA molecular standards, the analytical sensitivity of a RT-RPA targeting the 3´non-translated region of DENV1-4 was found to range from 14 (DENV4) to 241 (DENV1-3) RNA molecules detected. The assay was specific and did not cross detect other Flaviviruses. The RT-RPA assay was tested in a mobile laboratory combining magnetic-bead based total nucleic acid extraction and a portable detection device in Kedougou (Senegal) and in Bangkok (Thailand). In Kedougou, the RT-RPA was operated at an ambient temperature of 38°C with auxiliary electricity tapped from a motor vehicle and yielded a clinical sensitivity and specificity of 98% (n=31) and 100% (n=23), respectively. While in the field trial in Bangkok, the clinical sensitivity and specificity were 72% (n=90) and 100%(n=41), respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: During the first 5 days of infection, the developed DENV1-4 RT-RPA assays constitute a suitable accurate and rapid assay for DENV diagnosis. Moreover, the use of a portable fluorescence-reading device broadens its application potential to the point-of-care for outbreak investigations.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.051419455,0.163647207,0.386926472,0.160980395,-0.086843893,-0.106116476,0.021458753,0.046775509,-0.037089952,-0.108257929,-0.063667994,0.062190608,-0.061831275,-0.021961618,-0.117294984,0.097714164,-0.019121201,-0.031145186,0.127693407,0.202283815,0.047234904,-0.001625752,-0.051318917,-0.048327745,-0.049196755,0.092165948,0.117056555,0.000816213,0.076662657,-0.037865468
"Alternative divalent cations (Zn(2+), Co(2+), and Mn(2+)) are not mutagenic at conditions optimal for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity","BACKGROUND: Fidelity of DNA polymerases can be influenced by cation co-factors. Physiologically, Mg(2+) is used as a co-factor by HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) to perform catalysis; however, alternative cations including Mn(2+), Co(2+), and Zn(2+) can also support catalysis. Although Zn(2+) supports DNA synthesis, it inhibits HIV RT by significantly modifying RT catalysis. Zn(2+) is currently being investigated as a component of novel treatment options against HIV and we wanted to investigate the fidelity of RT with Zn(2+). METHODS: We used PCR-based and plasmid-based alpha complementation assays as well as steady-state misinsertion and misincorporation assays to examine the fidelity of RT with Mn(2+), Co(2+), and Zn(2+). RESULTS: The fidelity of DNA synthesis by HIV-1 RT was approximately 2.5 fold greater in Zn(2+) when compared to Mg(2+) at cation conditions optimized for nucleotide catalysis. Consistent with this, RT extended primers with mismatched 3′ nucleotides poorly and inserted incorrect nucleotides less efficiently using Zn(2+) than Mg(2+). In agreement with previous literature, we observed that Mn(2+) and Co(2+) dramatically decreased the fidelity of RT at highly elevated concentrations (6 mM). However, surprisingly, the fidelity of HIV RT with Mn(2+) and Co(2+) remained similar to Mg(2+) at lower concentrations that are optimal for catalysis. CONCLUSION: This study shows that Zn(2+), at optimal extension conditions, increases the fidelity of HIV-1 RT and challenges the notion that alternative cations capable of supporting polymerase catalysis are inherently mutagenic.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.048522288,0.030530892,0.089946606,0.01747031,-0.049254328,-0.009727001,0.034458593,-0.001533814,-0.017677042,-0.028370891,0.051376443,0.085258058,-0.084734244,0.021457173,-0.029014929,0.043649052,0.015759512,0.010192661,-0.087849819,-0.041985456,0.046772461,-0.030286883,0.003742609,0.109746194,0.022801312,0.059934665,0.033509755,-0.055969045,0.016551664,-0.077259175
Sequence-Specific Fidelity Alterations Associated with West Nile Virus Attenuation in Mosquitoes,"High rates of error-prone replication result in the rapid accumulation of genetic diversity of RNA viruses. Recent studies suggest that mutation rates are selected for optimal viral fitness and that modest variations in replicase fidelity may be associated with viral attenuation. Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are unique in their requirement for host cycling and may necessitate substantial genetic and phenotypic plasticity. In order to more thoroughly investigate the correlates, mechanisms and consequences of arbovirus fidelity, we selected fidelity variants of West Nile virus (WNV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) utilizing selection in the presence of a mutagen. We identified two mutations in the WNV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase associated with increased fidelity, V793I and G806R, and a single mutation in the WNV methyltransferase, T248I, associated with decreased fidelity. Both deep-sequencing and in vitro biochemical assays confirmed strain-specific differences in both fidelity and mutational bias. WNV fidelity variants demonstrated host-specific alterations to replicative fitness in vitro, with modest attenuation in mosquito but not vertebrate cell culture. Experimental infections of colonized and field populations of Cx. quinquefaciatus demonstrated that WNV fidelity alterations are associated with a significantly impaired capacity to establish viable infections in mosquitoes. Taken together, these studies (i) demonstrate the importance of allosteric interactions in regulating mutation rates, (ii) establish that mutational spectra can be both sequence and strain-dependent, and (iii) display the profound phenotypic consequences associated with altered replication complex function of flaviviruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.125558853,-0.053785178,-0.044632606,0.055679354,-0.029245196,0.011506335,0.101090067,0.006907042,-0.041086366,0.076232387,0.096156649,0.072300608,-0.068660113,-0.018966384,0.00951417,0.023586706,-0.052272517,-0.075104128,-0.116870985,-0.007937708,0.124926329,-0.080985329,0.046036486,0.139013124,-0.070777168,0.047684407,0.055619336,-0.078614813,-0.122355049,-0.11906736
Specificity and Strain-Typing Capabilities of Nanorod Array-Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy for Mycoplasma pneumoniae Detection,"Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a cell wall-less bacterial pathogen of the human respiratory tract that accounts for > 20% of all community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). At present the most effective means for detection and strain-typing is quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), which can exhibit excellent sensitivity and specificity but requires separate tests for detection and genotyping, lacks standardization between available tests and between labs, and has limited practicality for widespread, point-of-care use. We have developed and previously described a silver nanorod array-surface enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (NA-SERS) biosensing platform capable of detecting M. pneumoniae with statistically significant specificity and sensitivity in simulated and true clinical throat swab samples, and the ability to distinguish between reference strains of the two main genotypes of M. pneumoniae. Furthermore, we have established a qualitative lower endpoint of detection for NA-SERS of < 1 genome equivalent (cell/μl) and a quantitative multivariate detection limit of 5.3 ± 1 cells/μl. Here we demonstrate using partial least squares- discriminatory analysis (PLS-DA) of sample spectra that NA-SERS correctly identified M. pneumoniae clinical isolates from globally diverse origins and distinguished these from a panel of 12 other human commensal and pathogenic mycoplasma species with 100% cross-validated statistical accuracy. Furthermore, PLS-DA correctly classified by strain type all 30 clinical isolates with 96% cross-validated accuracy for type 1 strains, 98% cross-validated accuracy for type 2 strains, and 90% cross-validated accuracy for type 2V strains.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.045275994,0.00696087,0.114315578,-0.041931044,0.00025494,0.011199661,0.021816966,0.006915763,-0.049387896,0.059571403,-0.056243873,0.022489074,0.024833219,-0.064241437,0.001954727,-0.036149305,-0.056069655,-0.017695458,-0.008175217,0.004419894,0.045672159,0.064747169,0.142599574,0.032235343,0.077150139,-0.026643626,-0.008273305,0.067244983,0.006882911,0.003937294
Characterisation of Structural Proteins from Chronic Bee Paralysis Virus (CBPV) Using Mass Spectrometry,"Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) is the etiological agent of chronic paralysis, an infectious and contagious disease in adult honeybees. CBPV is a positive single-stranded RNA virus which contains two major viral RNA fragments. RNA 1 (3674 nt) and RNA 2 (2305 nt) encode three and four putative open reading frames (ORFs), respectively. RNA 1 is thought to encode the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) since the amino acid sequence derived from ORF 3 shares similarities with the RdRP of families Nodaviridae and Tombusviridae. The genomic organization of CBPV and in silico analyses have suggested that RNA 1 encodes non-structural proteins, while RNA 2 encodes structural proteins, which are probably encoded by ORFs 2 and 3. In this study, purified CBPV particles were used to characterize virion proteins by mass spectrometry. Several polypeptides corresponding to proteins encoded by ORF 2 and 3 on RNA 2 were detected.

Development of Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Assays for Detection of Orientia tsutsugamushi or Rickettsia typhi,"Sensitive, specific and rapid diagnostic tests for the detection of Orientia tsutsugamushi (O. tsutsugamushi) and Rickettsia typhi (R. typhi), the causative agents of scrub typhus and murine typhus, respectively, are necessary to accurately and promptly diagnose patients and ensure that they receive proper treatment. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assays using a lateral flow test (RPA-nfo) and real-time fluorescent detection (RPA-exo) were developed targeting the 47-kDa gene of O. tsutsugamushi or 17 kDa gene of R. typhi. The RPA assay was capable of detecting O. tsutsugamushi or R. typhi at levels comparable to that of the quantitative PCR method. Both the RPA-nfo and RPA-exo methods performed similarly with regards to sensitivity when detecting the 17 kDa gene of R. typhi. On the contrary, RPA-exo performed better than RPA-nfo in detecting the 47 kDa gene of O. tsutsugamushi. The clinical performance of the O. tsutsugamushi RPA assay was evaluated using either human patient samples or infected mouse samples. Eight out of ten PCR confirmed positives were determined positive by RPA, and all PCR confirmed negative samples were negative by RPA. Similar results were obtained for R. typhi spiked patient sera. The assays were able to differentiate O. tsutsugamushi and R. typhi from other phylogenetically related bacteria as well as mouse and human DNA. Furthermore, the RPA-nfo reaction was completed in 20 minutes at 37(o)C followed by a 10 minute incubation at room temperature for development of an immunochromatographic strip. The RPA-exo reaction was completed in 20 minutes at 39(o)C. The implementation of a cross contamination proof cassette to detect the RPA-nfo fluorescent amplicons provided an alternative to regular lateral flow detection strips, which are more prone to cross contamination. The RPA assays provide a highly time-efficient, sensitive and specific alternative to other methods for diagnosing scrub typhus or murine typhus.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.014190831,0.076026152,0.241499758,0.021187717,-0.075121294,-0.052052581,0.025575679,0.045954975,-0.01745787,-0.104885068,-0.108885467,0.052387859,-0.038588322,-0.085826561,-0.101223869,0.118679431,-0.078419546,-0.118944934,0.249707101,0.295173118,0.144627007,-0.005868098,0.021798021,-0.111790006,-0.130221132,0.094001984,0.074138033,0.00892099,0.098274912,-0.056053769
A case of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia in an HIV-infected Korean patient successfully treated with clarithromycin,"BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is a type of diffuse interstitial lung disease characterized by the pathology of fibroblastic plugs in the lumens of the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli. The occurrence of BOOP in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients has rarely been described, and there have been no clinical case reports in Korea. CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old female who had been diagnosed with HIV ten years prior was admitted due to a 1-year history of cough and sputum production and a 3-day history of fever. She had poor adherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) due to gastrointestinal troubles. At the time of admission, her CD4 T-cell count was 5 cells/mm(3). A high resolution computed tomography (CT) scan showed tiny centrilobular nodules with a tree-in-bud pattern in both lungs. Bacterial culture, Pneumocystis jirovecii polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Aspergillus galactomannan antigen (Ag) assay, and respiratory virus PCR were negative. Rapid chest x-ray improvement was seen after a 7-day treatment with anti-tuberculosis medication, ceftriaxone, and clarithromycin. Miliary tuberculosis seemed unlikely considering the rapid radiologic improvement and negative tuberculosis PCR results. Due to the unknown etiology, we performed video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) to determine the cause of the diffuse lung infiltration. Pathologic findings were consistent with BOOP, while tissue acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain and tuberculosis PCR results were negative. Tuberculosis medication and intravenous ceftriaxone were discontinued, while treatment with clarithromycin monotherapy was sustained. Five months after discharge, the patient was asymptomatic with a normal chest x-ray and as her adherence to ART improved, her CD4 T-cell count rose to 181 cells/mm(3). Clarithromycin was discontinued at that time and the patient is currently receiving regular outpatient follow-up. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that macrolides are a potential treatment option in HIV-infected patients with mild BOOP. In cases that are otherwise unexplained or unresponsive to treatment, BOOP should be taken into consideration and surgical biopsy performed to confirm a diagnosis of BOOP.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.088897095,0.019427015,-0.001627494,-0.098408078,-0.100172781,0.011310774,-0.017036504,0.055620794,-0.019456531,0.022822772,0.003934018,-0.010602577,0.000218877,0.042073118,0.015264683,-0.000651938,-0.008045579,0.07374668,-0.021885152,-0.021299315,0.020955317,0.024540347,-0.017657776,-0.055986698,-0.01416755,0.054955026,0.024246873,-0.020714535,-0.008605609,-0.025372256
Inhibitory effect of Phyllanthus urinaria L. extract on the replication of lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus in vitro,"BACKGROUND: Long-term treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) with nucleos(t)ide analogs results in the emergence of drug-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) harboring mutations in the polymerase (P) gene. The Phyllanthus extract has anti-HBV activity; however, its antiviral activity against lamivudine (LMV)-resistant mutants has not been examined. METHODS: HBV harboring LMV-resistant mutations (rtM204I, rtM204V, and rtM204S) in the P gene at the YMDD ((203)tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate(206)) reverse transcriptase (RT) active site were generated and their sensitivity to Phyllanthus urinaria koreanis extract examined. Southern blotting and real-time PCR were used to determine the concentration of plant extract required to inhibit HBV DNA synthesis by 50 and 90 % (EC(50) and EC(90), respectively). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the EC(50) of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV core antigen (HBcAg) secretion, and the 50 % cytotoxic concentration of the extract was measured in a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Real-time RT-PCR was used to measure mRNA expression levels. RESULTS: The expression of intracellular HBV DNAs in HBV WT- or mutant-transfected HepG2 cells decreased upon treatment with Phyllanthus extract. The secretion of HBsAg and HBcAg also fell in a dose-dependent manner. Phyllanthus extract induced interferon-beta (IFN-β), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA expression in HBV WT-transfected HepG2 cells, possibly via activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases and c-jun N-terminal kinases and the induction of retinoic acid inducible gene-I, toll-like receptor 3, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88, and/or tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 gene expression. HBV transfection in the absence of extract or exposure of cells to extract alone did not trigger these signaling cascades. CONCLUSIONS: Phyllanthus extract inhibited HBV DNA synthesis and HBsAg and HBcAg secretion by replicating cells harboring HBV wild-type and LMV-resistant mutants, likely by inducing the expression of IFN-β, COX-2, and IL-6. These data indicate that Phyllanthus extract may be useful as an alternative therapeutic agent for the treatment of drug-resistant CHB patients.

Highly conserved regions in Ebola virus RNA dependent RNA polymerase may be act as a universal novel peptide vaccine target: a computational approach,"PURPOSE: Ebola virus (EBOV) is such kind of virus which is responsible for 23,825 cases and 9675 deaths worldwide only in 2014 and with an average diseases fatality rate between 25 % and 90 %. Although, medical technology has tried to handle the problems, there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutics or vaccines available for the prevention, post exposure, or treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD). METHODS: In the present study, we used the immunoinformatics approach to design a potential epitope-based vaccine against the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-L of EBOV. BioEdit v7.2.3 sequence alignment editor, Jalview v2 and CLC Sequence Viewer v7.0.2 were used for the initial sequence analysis for securing the conservancy from the sequences. Later the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB-AR) was used for the identification of T-cell and B-cellepitopes associated with type I and II major histocompatibility complex molecules analysis. Finally, the population coverage analysis was employed. RESULTS: The core epitope “FRYEFTAPF” was found to be the most potential one, with 100 % conservancy among all the strains of EBOV. It also interacted with both type I and II major histocompatibility complex molecules and is considered as nonallergenic in nature. Finally, with impressive cumulative population coverage of 99.87 % for the both MHC-I and MHC-II class throughout the world population was found for the proposed epitope. CONCLUSION: To end, the projected peptide gave us a solid stand to propose for vaccine consideration and that might be experimented for its potency in eliciting immunity through humoral and cell mediated immune responses in vitro and in vivo.

"Concentration, Size Distribution, and Infectivity of Airborne Particles Carrying Swine Viruses","When pathogens become airborne, they travel associated with particles of different size and composition. Particle size determines the distance across which pathogens can be transported, as well as the site of deposition and the survivability of the pathogen. Despite the importance of this information, the size distribution of particles bearing viruses emitted by infectious animals remains unknown. In this study we characterized the concentration and size distribution of inhalable particles that transport influenza A virus (IAV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) generated by acutely infected pigs and assessed virus viability for each particle size range. Aerosols from experimentally infected pigs were sampled for 24 days using an Andersen cascade impactor able to separate particles by size (ranging from 0.4 to 10 micrometer (μm) in diameter). Air samples collected for the first 9, 20 and the last 3 days of the study were analyzed for IAV, PRRSV and PEDV, respectively, using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantified as geometric mean copies/m(3) within each size range. IAV was detected in all particle size ranges in quantities ranging from 5.5x10(2) (in particles ranging from 1.1 to 2.1μm) to 4.3x10(5) RNA copies/m(3) in the largest particles (9.0–10.0μm). PRRSV was detected in all size ranges except particles between 0.7 and 2.1μm in quantities ranging from 6x10(2) (0.4–0.7μm) to 5.1x10(4) RNA copies/m(3) (9.0–10.0μm). PEDV, an enteric virus, was detected in all particle sizes and in higher quantities than IAV and PRRSV (p < 0.0001) ranging from 1.3x10(6) (0.4–0.7μm) to 3.5x10(8) RNA copies/m(3) (9.0–10.0μm). Infectious status was demonstrated for the 3 viruses, and in the case of IAV and PRRSV, viruses were isolated from particles larger than 2.1μm. In summary, our results indicated that airborne PEDV, IAV and PRRSV can be found in a wide range of particle sizes. However, virus viability is particle size dependent.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.035084557,-0.032072154,0.047949132,-0.013738357,0.015380308,0.024769155,-0.019706541,-0.009310618,-0.005401942,-0.015365962,0.029086729,-0.006668321,-0.086103275,0.063268618,0.200186464,-0.091601236,-0.037577267,-0.012946888,-0.000752831,0.09843445,-0.106491488,-0.012920994,0.063840122,-0.057957474,-0.026355517,0.027982607,0.007044308,0.009140534,-0.04034108,0.023407509
Viral Co-Infections in Pediatric Patients Hospitalized with Lower Tract Acute Respiratory Infections,"BACKGROUND: Molecular techniques can often reveal a broader range of pathogens in respiratory infections. We aim to investigate the prevalence and age pattern of viral co-infection in children hospitalized with lower tract acute respiratory infection (LT-ARI), using molecular techniques. METHODS: A nested polymerase chain reaction approach was used to detect Influenza (A, B), metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza (1–4), rhinovirus, adenovirus (A—F), bocavirus and coronaviruses (NL63, 229E, OC43) in respiratory samples of children with acute respiratory infection prospectively admitted to any of the GENDRES network hospitals between 2011–2013. The results were corroborated in an independent cohort collected in the UK. RESULTS: A total of 204 and 97 nasopharyngeal samples were collected in the GENDRES and UK cohorts, respectively. In both cohorts, RSV was the most frequent pathogen (52.9% and 36.1% of the cohorts, respectively). Co-infection with multiple viruses was found in 92 samples (45.1%) and 29 samples (29.9%), respectively; this was most frequent in the 12–24 months age group. The most frequently observed co-infection patterns were RSV—Rhinovirus (23 patients, 11.3%, GENDRES cohort) and RSV—bocavirus / bocavirus—influenza (5 patients, 5.2%, UK cohort). CONCLUSION: The presence of more than one virus in pediatric patients admitted to hospital with LT-ARI is very frequent and seems to peak at 12–24 months of age. The clinical significance of these findings is unclear but should warrant further analysis.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.289960522,-0.126856348,-0.104811907,0.053000647,0.06988045,-0.085381381,0.01459198,-0.069361568,0.060656314,-0.01647439,0.014610768,-0.033298415,-0.013816113,0.001860147,-0.006619376,-0.009909772,0.025967473,-0.00363286,0.044155489,0.001448189,0.0061472,-0.093313378,0.009165844,-0.021111657,0.073610725,-0.085332559,0.077557261,0.07403548,-0.059046791,0.01160576
Controlled Microwave Heating Accelerates Rolling Circle Amplification,"Rolling circle amplification (RCA) generates single-stranded DNAs or RNA, and the diverse applications of this isothermal technique range from the sensitive detection of nucleic acids to analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Microwave chemistry is widely applied to increase reaction rate as well as product yield and purity. The objectives of the present research were to apply microwave heating to RCA and indicate factors that contribute to the microwave selective heating effect. The microwave reaction temperature was strictly controlled using a microwave applicator optimized for enzymatic-scale reactions. Here, we showed that microwave-assisted RCA reactions catalyzed by either of the four thermostable DNA polymerases were accelerated over 4-folds compared with conventional RCA. Furthermore, the temperatures of the individual buffer components were specifically influenced by microwave heating. We concluded that microwave heating accelerated isothermal RCA of DNA because of the differential heating mechanisms of microwaves on the temperatures of reaction components, although the overall reaction temperatures were the same.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.048817872,-0.008051843,0.060319774,-0.037618341,-0.036711706,0.004335053,0.033755589,0.003385211,-0.003901465,-0.011603617,-0.018398083,0.022520655,-0.00288632,-0.052208798,-0.000273548,0.040218339,-0.023830245,-0.009153573,-0.026689111,-0.010146382,-0.030704804,-0.029010473,-0.004013178,-0.008293057,-0.006867772,-0.014711421,-0.05171779,0.027728304,-0.023686943,-0.000481703
"Low prevalence of equine coronavirus in foals in the largest thoroughbred horse breeding region of Japan, 2012–2014","BACKGROUND: Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is considered to be a diarrheic pathogen in foals. In central Kentucky in the United States, it has been shown that approximately 30 % of thoroughbred foals are infected with ECoV and thus it is considered widely prevalent. In contrast, the epidemiology of ECoV and its relationship to diarrhea in foals are poorly understood in Japan. We investigated ECoV in rectal swabs collected from thoroughbred foals in Japan. RESULTS: We collected 337 rectal swabs from 307 diarrheic foals in the Hidaka district of Hokkaido, the largest thoroughbred horse breeding region in Japan, between 2012 and 2014. In addition, 120 rectal swabs were collected from 120 healthy foals in 2012. These samples were tested by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification and a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. All samples collected from diarrheic foals were negative, and only three samples (2.5 %) collected from healthy foals were positive for ECoV. Compared with central Kentucky, ECoV is not prevalent among thoroughbred foals in the Hidaka district of Hokkaido. CONCLUSION: ECoV is not prevalent and was not related to diarrhea in thoroughbred foals in the Hidaka district of Hokkaido between 2012 and 2014.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.001937289,-0.00332695,0.048773744,-0.076386822,0.018452217,0.008704495,0.004020564,0.008568383,-0.005896592,-0.048298444,0.024341309,0.043770655,-0.042514392,-0.015884557,0.035243573,0.008854449,0.002175943,-0.01477384,-0.003029125,-0.035273951,-0.022138993,0.000614422,-0.04725097,-0.002895755,0.041561295,-0.010726083,-0.047935395,0.029682942,0.016352992,-0.036973995
New Epidemiological and Clinical Signatures of 18 Pathogens from Respiratory Tract Infections Based on a 5-Year Study,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a heavy burden on society. However, due to the complex etiology of RTIs, the clinical diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of these infections remain challenging, especially in developing countries. METHODS: To determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 18 respiratory pathogens, we analyzed 12,502 patients with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) by performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on patient pharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: Samples positive for at least 1 pathogen were obtained from 48.42% of the total patients. Of these pathogen-positive patients, 17.99% were infected with more than 1 pathogen. Of the 18 pathogens analyzed, four were detected with a positive detection rate (PDR) > 5%: influenza A virus (IAV) > respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) >Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) > human coronavirus (HCoV). The pathogens with the 4 highest co-infection rates (CIRs) were as follows: HCoV > human bocavirus (HBoV) > enterovirus (EV) > parainfluenza virus (PIV). The overall positive detection rate (PDR) varied significantly according to patient age, the season and year of detection, and the disease subgroup, but not according to patient sex. The individual PDRs of the pathogens followed 3 types of distributions for patient sex, 4 types of distributions for patient age, 4 types of seasonal distributions, 2 types of seasonal epidemic trends, 4 types of yearly epidemic trends, and different susceptibility distributions in the disease subgroups. Additionally, the overall CIR showed significantly different distributions according to patient sex, patient age, and the disease subgroup, whereas the CIRs of individual pathogens suggested significant preference characteristics. CONCLUSION: IAV remains the most common pathogen among the pathogens analyzed. More effort should be directed toward the prevention and control of pathogens that show a trend of increasing incidence such as HCoV, human adenovirus (ADV), and RSV. Although clinically distinguishing specific pathogens responsible for RTIs is difficult, the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the various RTI-causing agents could provide clues for clinicians, thereby informing decisions regarding prevention and medication and guiding appropriate public health strategies.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.203165199,-0.057445266,-0.042998905,0.005135567,0.031267455,-0.041058705,0.041757364,0.005666873,0.02702429,0.043044035,-0.01870181,0.064598634,0.099962824,0.014587008,0.029037386,-0.016650171,-0.041768962,-0.008436451,-0.015345214,0.004624235,0.01631345,-0.025543126,0.034163348,-0.052461827,0.044211043,-0.024947193,0.044793346,0.089768793,0.003375914,0.001726743
Effect of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Infectious Doses on Infection Outcomes in Naïve Conventional Neonatal and Weaned Pigs,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was identified in the United States (U.S.) swine population for the first time in April 2013 and rapidly spread nationwide. However, no information has been published regarding the minimum infectious dose (MID) of PEDV in different pig models. The main objective of this study was to determine the oral minimum infectious dose of PEDV in naïve conventional neonatal piglets and weaned pigs. A U.S. virulent PEDV prototype isolate (USA/IN19338/2013) with known infectious titer was serially ten-fold diluted in virus-negative cell culture medium. Dilutions with theoretical infectious titers from 560 to 0.0056 TCID(50)/ml together with a medium control were orogastrically inoculated (10ml/pig) into 7 groups of 5-day-old neonatal pigs (n = 4 per group) and 7 groups of 21-day-old weaned pigs (n = 6 per group). In 5-day-old pigs, 10ml of inoculum having titers 560–0.056 TCID(50)/ml, corresponding to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) values 24.2–37.6, resulted in 100% infection in each group; 10ml of inoculum with titer 0.0056 TCID(50)/ml (Ct>45) caused infection in 25% of the inoculated pigs. In 21-day-old pigs, 10ml of inoculum with titers 560–5.6 TCID(50)/ml (Ct 24.2–31.4) resulted in 100% infection in each group while 10ml of inoculum with titers 0.56–0.0056 TCID(50)/ml (Ct values 35.3 –>45) did not establish infection in any pigs under study conditions as determined by clinical signs, PCR, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and antibody response. These data reveal that PEDV infectious dose is age-dependent with a significantly lower MID for neonatal pigs compared to weaned pigs. This information should be taken into consideration when interpreting clinical relevance of PEDV PCR results and when designing a PEDV bioassay model. The observation of such a low MID in neonates also emphasizes the importance of strict biosecurity and thorough cleaning/disinfection on sow farms.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.016560371,-0.002996795,0.068406353,-0.145015562,0.022841522,0.052199719,-0.014835736,-0.017755503,-0.005235109,-0.018195863,0.064449201,0.063954107,-0.174669236,0.054799387,0.247807535,-0.161584597,-0.040281325,0.068007121,-0.018393634,0.112489286,-0.184318288,-0.093884436,0.085888329,-0.072112353,-0.076071306,-0.018957711,-0.011294059,-0.009483703,0.017313305,-0.009352813
"Viral and atypical bacterial aetiologies of infection in hospitalised patients admitted with clinical suspicion of influenza in Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia","BACKGROUND: Influenza constitutes a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. There is limited information about the aetiology of infection presenting clinically as influenza in hospitalised adults and children in South-East Asia. Such data are important for future management of respiratory infections. OBJECTIVES: To describe the aetiology of infection presenting clinically as influenza in those hospitalised in South-East Asia. METHODS: Respiratory specimens archived from July 2008 to June 2009 from patients hospitalised with suspected influenza from Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam were tested for respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A total of 1222 patients’ samples were tested. Of 1222, 776 patients (63·5%) were under the age of 5. Viruses detected included rhinoviruses in 229 of 1222 patients (18·7%), bocaviruses in 200 (16·4%), respiratory syncytial viruses in 144 (11·8%), parainfluenza viruses in 140 (11·5%; PIV1: 32; PIV2: 12; PIV3: 71; PIV4: 25), adenovirus in 102 (8·4%), influenza viruses in 93 (7·6%; influenza A: 77; influenza B: 16) and coronaviruses in 23 (1·8%; OC43: 14; E229: 9). Bacterial pathogens were Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 33, 2·7%), Chlamydophila psittaci (n = 2), C. pneumoniae (n = 1), Bordetella pertussis (n = 1) and Legionella pneumophila (n = 2). Overall, in-hospital case fatality rate was 29 of 1222 (2·4%). CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses were the most commonly detected pathogens in patients hospitalised with a clinical suspicion of influenza. Rhinovirus was the most frequently detected virus, and M. pneumoniae, the most common atypical bacterium. The low number of detected influenza viruses demonstrates a low benefit for empirical oseltamivir therapy, unless during an influenza outbreak.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.292263678,-0.141577819,-0.115391432,0.153830976,0.02447912,0.175676752,-0.115872922,0.064383411,-0.116339569,0.005324291,-0.011768726,0.002943018,0.049775747,0.00210333,-0.004500483,-0.029349011,0.035167575,-0.051009162,0.035171645,0.03184531,0.033731467,0.022874896,0.088100189,0.036121308,0.029966537,-0.005264441,-0.063845297,0.071664441,0.04206393,-0.063721606
Perspective of Use of Antiviral Peptides against Influenza Virus,"The threat of a worldwide influenza pandemic has greatly increased over the past decade with the emergence of highly virulent avian influenza strains. The increased frequency of drug-resistant influenza strains against currently available antiviral drugs requires urgent development of new strategies for antiviral therapy, too. The research in the field of therapeutic peptides began to develop extensively in the second half of the 20(th) century. Since then, the mechanisms of action for several peptides and their antiviral prospect received large attention due to the global threat posed by viruses. Here, we discussed the therapeutic properties of peptides used in influenza treatment. Peptides with antiviral activity against influenza can be divided into three main groups. First, entry blocker peptides such as a Flupep that interact with influenza hemagglutinin, block its binding to host cells and prevent viral fusion. Second, several peptides display virucidal activity, disrupting viral envelopes, e.g., Melittin. Finally, a third set of peptides interacts with the viral polymerase complex and act as viral replication inhibitors such as PB1 derived peptides. Here, we present a review of the current literature describing the antiviral activity, mechanism and future therapeutic potential of these influenza antiviral peptides.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.034741793,-0.075208334,-0.03916837,0.100526476,-0.101192827,0.265461727,-0.009470505,-0.008920607,0.017479723,-0.006548537,0.006542893,0.036822278,0.026094936,-0.01996944,-0.007643749,-0.015071998,-0.019395784,0.071925912,0.027711808,0.028125132,0.000603173,0.022459924,-0.016111843,0.043168758,0.040781042,0.00423894,0.016617567,-0.039938618,0.076385144,0.053590955
Nucleobase but not Sugar Fidelity is Maintained in the Sabin I RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase,"The Sabin I poliovirus live, attenuated vaccine strain encodes for four amino acid changes (i.e., D53N, Y73H, K250E, and T362I) in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We have previously shown that the T362I substitution leads to a lower fidelity RdRp, and viruses encoding this variant are attenuated in a mouse model of poliovirus. Given these results, it was surprising that the nucleotide incorporation rate and nucleobase fidelity of the Sabin I RdRp is similar to that of wild-type enzyme, although the Sabin I RdRp is less selective against nucleotides with modified sugar groups. We suggest that the other Sabin amino acid changes (i.e., D53N, Y73H, K250E) help to re-establish nucleotide incorporation rates and nucleotide discrimination near wild-type levels, which may be a requirement for the propagation of the virus and its efficacy as a vaccine strain. These results also suggest that the nucleobase fidelity of the Sabin I RdRp likely does not contribute to viral attenuation.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.173801206,-0.048834217,-0.065486223,0.059457025,0.003781981,-0.00811079,0.057396525,0.008205874,-0.062835302,0.072019993,0.139755428,0.20415816,-0.156652092,-0.117079794,-0.043237737,-0.046893735,-0.004733518,-0.070154496,-0.104859744,-0.060844631,0.203979765,-0.136604276,0.136447127,0.085548086,0.009400459,0.116891398,0.066451758,-0.035490311,-0.067791546,-0.038119798
Viral and bacterial etiology of severe acute respiratory illness among children < 5 years of age without influenza in Niger,"BACKGROUND: Globally, pneumonia is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children, with the highest burden experienced in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. However, there is a dearth of information on the etiology of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in Africa, including Niger. METHODS: We implemented a retrospective study as part of national influenza sentinel surveillance in Niger. We randomly selected a sample of nasopharyngeal specimens collected from children <5 years of age hospitalized with SARI from January 2010 through December 2012 in Niger. The samples were selected from individuals that tested negative by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for influenza A and B virus. The samples were analyzed using the Fast Track Diagnostic Respiratory Pathogens 21plus Kit (BioMérieux, Luxemburg), which detects 23 respiratory pathogens including 18 viral and 5 bacterial agents. RESULTS: Among the 160 samples tested, 138 (86 %) tested positive for at least one viral or bacterial pathogen; in 22 (16 %) sample, only one pathogen was detected. We detected at least one respiratory virus in 126 (78 %) samples and at least one bacterium in 102 (64 %) samples. Respiratory syncytial virus (56/160; 35 %), rhinovirus (47/160; 29 %) and parainfluenza virus (39/160; 24 %) were the most common viral pathogens detected. Among bacterial pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae (90/160; 56 %) and Haemophilus influenzae type b (20/160; 12 %) predominated. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of certain viral and bacterial pathogens among children <5 years of age with SARI highlights the need for continued and expanded surveillance in Niger.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.232593059,-0.094693574,-0.03499056,0.068480731,0.040859725,-0.023205966,0.010222469,-0.018691054,-0.012191526,0.033478528,0.009220359,-0.027229751,0.018445277,-0.034232486,0.041083909,-0.035163135,-0.020741241,-0.093318107,0.041976608,-0.016073427,-0.049740927,0.105938136,0.06735858,-0.002983847,0.056346421,0.032398056,-0.034930101,0.069702586,0.057684913,-0.034536843
Impact of antibacterials on subsequent resistance and clinical outcomes in adult patients with viral pneumonia: an opportunity for stewardship,"INTRODUCTION: Respiratory viruses are increasingly recognized as significant etiologies of pneumonia among hospitalized patients. Advanced technologies using multiplex molecular assays and polymerase-chain reaction increase the ability to identify viral pathogens and may ultimately impact antibacterial use. METHOD: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study to evaluate the impact of antibacterials in viral pneumonia on clinical outcomes and subsequent multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infections/colonization. Patients admitted from March 2013 to November 2014 with positive respiratory viral panels (RVP) and radiographic findings of pneumonia were included. Patients transferred from an outside hospital or not still hospitalized 72 hours after the RVP report date were excluded. Patients were categorized based on exposure to systemic antibacterials: less than 3 days representing short-course therapy and 3 to 10 days being long-course therapy. RESULTS: A total of 174 patients (long-course, n = 67; short-course, n = 28; mixed bacterial-viral infection, n = 79) were included with most being immunocompromised (56.3 %) with active malignancy the primary etiology (69.4 %). Rhinovirus/Enterovirus (23 %), Influenza (19 %), and Parainfluenza (15.5 %) were the viruses most commonly identified. A total of 13 different systemic antibacterials were used as empiric therapy in the 95 patients with pure viral infection for a total of 466 days-of-therapy. Vancomycin (50.7 %), cefepime (40.3 %), azithromycin (40.3 %), meropenem (23.9 %), and linezolid (20.9 %) were most frequently used. In-hospital mortality did not differ between patients with viral pneumonia in the short-course and long-course groups. Subsequent infection/colonization with a MDRO was more frequent in the long-course group compared to the short-course group (53.2 vs 21.1 %; P = 0.027). CONCLUSION: This study found that long-course antibacterial use in the setting of viral pneumonia had no impact on clinical outcomes but increased the incidence of subsequent MDRO infection/colonization.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.171073681,-0.059391044,-0.097630575,-0.070891082,-0.076316589,-0.038173885,-0.031911609,0.09741761,-0.143542665,0.066849502,-0.037153278,-0.01391244,0.006602294,0.039288423,-0.04492153,-0.008480415,0.005568787,0.049288077,-0.019053269,0.070658668,-0.008252188,0.000657902,-0.018714106,-0.001850421,-0.01014667,-0.044366994,0.021888325,-0.048780576,-0.056621439,0.027752746
Viral aetiology of common colds of outpatient children at primary care level and the use of antibiotics,"Although antibiotics are ineffective against viral respiratory infections, studies have shown high rates of prescriptions worldwide. We conducted a study in Brazil to determine the viral aetiologies of common colds in children and to describe the use of antibiotics for these patients. Children up to 12 years with common colds were enrolled from March 2008-February 2009 at a primary care level facility and followed by regular telephone calls and medical consultations. A nasopharyngeal wash was obtained at enrollment and studied by direct fluorescence assay and polymerase chain reaction for nine different types of virus. A sample of 134 patients was obtained, median age 2.9 years (0.1-11.2 y). Respiratory viruses were detected in 73.9% (99/134) with a coinfection rate of 30.3% (30/99). Rhinovirus was the most frequent virus (53/134; 39.6%), followed by influenza (33/134; 24.6%) and respiratory syncytial virus (8/134; 13.4%). Antibiotic prescription rate was 39.6% (53/134) and 69.8% (37/53) were considered inappropriate. Patients with influenza infection received antibiotics inappropriately in a greater proportion of cases when compared to respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus infections (p = 0.016). The rate of inappropriate use of antibiotics was very high and patients with influenza virus infection were prescribed antibiotics inappropriately in a greater proportion of cases.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.192624985,-0.100592472,-0.081321766,0.040369715,-0.00925613,0.005714894,-0.034467608,0.011041642,-0.032094291,0.010887507,-0.004212125,-0.016284131,-0.003694889,-0.003304868,0.003150406,0.004196591,0.01874501,-0.013723764,0.028572469,0.045786134,0.016647054,-0.039954354,-0.011242533,0.02050256,-0.001238716,0.034538409,-0.01015669,0.018736986,-0.018924251,0.006039375
Detection of respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus in healthy infants,"BACKGROUND: Despite the research importance of rhinovirus detection in asymptomatic healthy infants, the literature remains sparse. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (and its species). METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 110 healthy, non-hospitalized infants without acute illness at an academic medical center from November 2013 through May 2014. We tested nasal swab specimens by using polymerase chain reaction and genetic sequencing. RESULTS: Overall, the median age was 3.8 months (IQR 2.0–5.1 months), 56 % were male, and 90 % were born >37 weeks. RSV was detected in nasal swabs from infants (1.8 %). By contrast, rhinovirus was detected in nasal swabs from 16 infants (14.5 %). Molecular typing assay revealed rhinovirus species: six rhinovirus-A (5.5 %), one rhinovirus-B (0.9 %), eight rhinovirus-C (7.3 %), and one untypeable (0.9 %). CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study of healthy, community-based infants, RSV was rare (<2 %) in nasal swabs, while rhinovirus was detected in 14.5 % with a predominance of rhinovirus-A and -C. These finding are important for understanding the clinical significance of rhinovirus detection among infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.164913902,-0.091083881,-0.028173342,-0.001144035,0.053534617,-0.082995295,0.080306591,-0.064320976,0.067538706,-0.041009796,0.031313155,-0.06111226,-0.078090508,-0.086629313,0.040643168,0.051032306,0.014867683,-0.069735574,0.104832094,-0.054896458,-0.043256862,-0.144118698,-0.047559826,-0.013806743,0.126459672,-0.053129515,0.10661992,0.11362454,0.004701454,-0.037553249
Retroviral DNA—the silent winner: blood transfusion containing latent feline leukemia provirus causes infection and disease in naïve recipient cats,"BACKGROUND: The feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a gamma-retrovirus of domestic cats that was discovered half a century ago. Cats that are infected with FeLV may develop a progressive infection resulting in persistent viremia, immunodeficiency, tumors, anemia and death. A significant number of cats mount a protective immune response that suppresses viremia; these cats develop a regressive infection characterized by the absence of viral replication and the presence of low levels of proviral DNA. The biological importance of these latter provirus carriers is largely unknown. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that ten cats that received a transfusion of blood from aviremic provirus carriers developed active FeLV infections, some with a progressive outcome and the development of fatal FeLV-associated disease. The infection outcome, disease spectrum and evolution into FeLV-C in one cat mirrored those of natural infection. Two cats developed persistent antigenemia; six cats were transiently antigenemic. Reactivation of infection occurred in some cats. One recipient developed non-regenerative anemia associated with FeLV-C, and four others developed a T-cell lymphoma, one with secondary lymphoblastic leukemia. Five of the ten recipient cats received provirus-positive aviremic blood, whereas the other five received provirus- and viral RNA-positive but aviremic blood. Notably, the cats that received blood containing only proviral DNA exhibited a later onset but graver outcome of FeLV infection than the cats that were transfused with blood containing proviral DNA and viral RNA. Leukocyte counts and cytokine analyses indicated that the immune system of the latter cats reacted quicker and more efficiently. CONCLUSIONS: Our results underline the biological and epidemiological relevance of FeLV provirus carriers and the risk of inadvertent FeLV transmission via blood transfusion and demonstrate the replication capacity of proviral DNA if uncontrolled by the immune system. Our results have implications not only for veterinary medicine, such as the requirement for testing blood donors and blood products for FeLV provirus by sensitive polymerase chain reaction, but are also of general interest by revealing the importance of latent retroviral DNA in infected hosts. When aiming to eliminate a retroviral infection from a population, provirus carriers must be considered.

"MERS coronavirus: diagnostics, epidemiology and transmission","The first known cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), associated with infection by a novel coronavirus (CoV), occurred in 2012 in Jordan but were reported retrospectively. The case first to be publicly reported was from Jeddah, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Since then, MERS-CoV sequences have been found in a bat and in many dromedary camels (DC). MERS-CoV is enzootic in DC across the Arabian Peninsula and in parts of Africa, causing mild upper respiratory tract illness in its camel reservoir and sporadic, but relatively rare human infections. Precisely how virus transmits to humans remains unknown but close and lengthy exposure appears to be a requirement. The KSA is the focal point of MERS, with the majority of human cases. In humans, MERS is mostly known as a lower respiratory tract (LRT) disease involving fever, cough, breathing difficulties and pneumonia that may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure and death in 20 % to 40 % of those infected. However, MERS-CoV has also been detected in mild and influenza-like illnesses and in those with no signs or symptoms. Older males most obviously suffer severe disease and MERS patients often have comorbidities. Compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), another sometimes- fatal zoonotic coronavirus disease that has since disappeared, MERS progresses more rapidly to respiratory failure and acute kidney injury (it also has an affinity for growth in kidney cells under laboratory conditions), is more frequently reported in patients with underlying disease and is more often fatal. Most human cases of MERS have been linked to lapses in infection prevention and control (IPC) in healthcare settings, with approximately 20 % of all virus detections reported among healthcare workers (HCWs) and higher exposures in those with occupations that bring them into close contact with camels. Sero-surveys have found widespread evidence of past infection in adult camels and limited past exposure among humans. Sensitive, validated reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-rtPCR)-based diagnostics have been available almost from the start of the emergence of MERS. While the basic virology of MERS-CoV has advanced over the past three years, understanding of the interplay between camel, environment, and human remains limited.

Alphacoronaviruses Detected in French Bats Are Phylogeographically Linked to Coronaviruses of European Bats,"Bats are a reservoir for a diverse range of viruses, including coronaviruses (CoVs). To determine the presence of CoVs in French bats, fecal samples were collected between July and August of 2014 from four bat species in seven different locations around the city of Bourges in France. We present for the first time the presence of alpha-CoVs in French Pipistrellus pipistrellus bat species with an estimated prevalence of 4.2%. Based on the analysis of a fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, phylogenetic analyses show that alpha-CoVs sequences detected in French bats are closely related to other European bat alpha-CoVs. Phylogeographic analyses of RdRp sequences show that several CoVs strains circulate in European bats: (i) old strains detected that have probably diverged a long time ago and are detected in different bat subspecies; (ii) strains detected in Myotis and Pipistrellus bat species that have more recently diverged. Our findings support previous observations describing the complexity of the detected CoVs in bats worldwide.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.085598995,0.074538382,-0.040355564,-0.012156292,0.405874644,0.135818446,0.332613606,0.093615025,-0.176320455,-0.075268216,-0.103392076,-0.102592574,-0.101277557,0.063342643,-0.062355689,0.09366557,0.022058038,0.074209051,0.028375672,-0.027507672,-0.017772807,-0.040900891,0.073592042,-0.095350636,0.090591674,0.042313228,-0.043008857,0.002785432,0.037285634,0.047600065
Two novel regulators of N‐acetyl‐galactosamine utilization pathway and distinct roles in bacterial infections,"Bacterial pathogens can exploit metabolic pathways to facilitate their successful infection cycles, but little is known about roles of d‐galactosamine (GalN)/N‐acetyl‐d‐galactosamine (GalNAc) catabolism pathway in bacterial pathogenesis. Here, we report the genomic reconstruction of GalN/GalNAc utilization pathway in Streptococci and the diversified aga regulons. We delineated two new paralogous AgaR regulators for the GalN/GalNAc catabolism pathway. The electrophoretic mobility shift assays experiment demonstrated that AgaR2 (AgaR1) binds the predicted palindromes, and the combined in vivo data from reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and RNA‐seq suggested that AgaR2 (not AgaR1) can effectively repress the transcription of the target genes. Removal of agaR2 (not agaR1) from Streptococcus suis 05ZYH33 augments significantly the abilities of both adherence to Hep‐2 cells and anti‐phagocytosis against RAW264.7 macrophage. As anticipated, the dysfunction in AgaR2‐mediated regulation of S. suis impairs its pathogenicity in experimental models of both mice and piglets. Our finding discovered two novel regulators specific for GalN/GalNAc catabolism and assigned them distinct roles into bacterial infections. To the best of our knowledge, it might represent a first paradigm that links the GalN/GalNAc catabolism pathway to bacterial pathogenesis.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.058014709,-0.02781611,0.00630415,-0.064485712,-0.059253046,0.019049457,0.048105138,-0.004266633,-0.002992599,0.018153561,-0.040277995,-0.026508291,0.005998595,0.023333306,0.01381518,-0.010664869,-0.017940472,-0.009416811,-0.039676137,-0.016189439,-0.013107222,0.023211113,0.016984518,0.012253612,0.015593629,-0.030121455,-0.003587383,0.026401561,0.07009677,-0.017712218
A simple novel device for air sampling by electrokinetic capture,"BACKGROUND: A variety of different sampling devices are currently available to acquire air samples for the study of the microbiome of the air. All have a degree of technical complexity that limits deployment. Here, we evaluate the use of a novel device, which has no technical complexity and is easily deployable. RESULTS: An air-cleaning device powered by electrokinetic propulsion has been adapted to provide a universal method for collecting samples of the aerobiome. Plasma-induced charge in aerosol particles causes propulsion to and capture on a counter-electrode. The flow of ions creates net bulk airflow, with no moving parts. A device and electrode assembly have been re-designed from air-cleaning technology to provide an average air flow of 120 lpm. This compares favorably with current air sampling devices based on physical air pumping. Capture efficiency was determined by comparison with a 0.4 μm polycarbonate reference filter, using fluorescent latex particles in a controlled environment chamber. Performance was compared with the same reference filter method in field studies in three different environments. For 23 common fungal species by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), there was 100 % sensitivity and apparent specificity of 87 %, with the reference filter taken as “gold standard.” Further, bacterial analysis of 16S RNA by amplicon sequencing showed equivalent community structure captured by the electrokinetic device and the reference filter. Unlike other current air sampling methods, capture of particles is determined by charge and so is not controlled by particle mass. We analyzed particle sizes captured from air, without regard to specific analyte by atomic force microscopy: particles at least as low as 100 nM could be captured from ambient air. CONCLUSIONS: This work introduces a very simple plug-and-play device that can sample air at a high-volume flow rate with no moving parts and collect particles down to the sub-micron range. The performance of the device is substantially equivalent to capture by pumping through a filter for microbiome analysis by quantitative PCR and amplicon sequencing.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.023533036,0.004740914,0.086129004,-0.041387692,-0.017038609,0.026130342,0.034418773,0.00695571,-0.027483922,-0.000154504,-0.022274639,0.001952966,-0.017476888,-0.044809957,0.019090552,0.030764543,-0.047206483,-0.034427585,-0.007071303,-0.047697675,-0.015891443,-0.005031978,0.02367298,-0.013513865,-0.009106911,-0.010911634,-0.012317444,0.029988581,-0.015972899,0.00444358
Subcellular fractionation method to study endosomal trafficking of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus,"BACKGROUND: Virus entry involves multiple steps and is a highly orchestrated process on which successful infection collectively depends. Entry processes are commonly analyzed by monitoring internalized virus particles via Western blotting, polymerase chain reaction, and imaging techniques that allow scientist to track the intracellular location of the pathogen. Such studies have provided abundant direct evidence on how viruses interact with receptor molecules on the cell surface, induce cell signaling at the point of initial contact with the cell to facilitate internalization, and exploit existing endocytic mechanisms of the cell for their ultimate infectious agenda. However, there is dearth of knowledge in regards to trafficking of a virus via endosomes. Herein, we describe an optimized laboratory procedure to isolate individual organelles during different stages of endocytosis by performing subcellular fractionation. This methodology is established using Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection of human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells as a model. With KSHV and other herpesviruses alike, envelope glycoproteins have been widely reported to physically engage target cell surface receptors, such as integrins, in interactions leading to entry and subsequent infection. RESULTS: Subcellular fractionation was used to isolate early and late endosomes (EEs and LEs) by performing a series of centrifugations steps. Specifically, a centrifugation step post-homogenization was utilized to obtain the post-nuclear supernatant containing intact intracellular organelles in suspension. Successive fractionation via sucrose density gradient centrifugation was performed to isolate specific organelles including EEs and LEs. Intracellular KSHV trafficking was directly traced in the isolated endosomal fractions. Additionally, the subcellular fractionation approach demonstrates a key role for integrins in the endosomal trafficking of KSHV. The results obtained from fractionation studies corroborated those obtained by traditional imaging studies. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first of its kind to employ a sucrose flotation gradient assay to map intracellular KSHV trafficking in HFF cells. We are confident that such an approach will serve as a powerful tool to directly study intracellular trafficking of a virus, signaling events occurring on endosomal membranes, and dynamics of molecular events within endosomes that are crucial for uncoating and virus escape into the cytosol.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.053675603,-0.028646384,0.021900551,-0.038982707,-0.068989388,0.055795389,0.049636958,-0.026125025,0.044604205,0.024795357,-0.031504223,-0.04205643,0.020816943,0.039426406,0.049985391,0.039826273,0.005170056,-0.024765692,-0.023524575,0.009492576,0.013989077,0.006758774,0.014126833,-0.006224211,0.011172134,0.027218122,0.002327239,0.016364048,-0.047504378,-0.012339561
"Co-Circulation of Canine Coronavirus I and IIa/b with High Prevalence and Genetic Diversity in Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China","To trace the evolution of canine coronavirus (CCoV), 201 stool samples from diarrheic dogs in northeast China were subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) targeting the partial M and S genes of CCoV, followed by an epidemiological analysis. M gene RT-PCRs showed that 28.36% (57/201) of the samples were positive for CCoV; of the 57 positive samples, CCoV-I and CCoV-II accounted for 15.79% (9/57) and 84.21% (48/57), respectively. A sequence comparison of the partial M gene revealed nucleotide homologies of 88.4%–100% among the 57 CCoV strains, and 88.7%–96.2% identity between the 57 CCoV strains and the Chinese reference strain HF3. The CCoV-I and CCoV-II strains exhibited genetic diversity when compared with reference strains from China and other countries. The 57 CCoV strains exhibited high co-infection rates with canine kobuvirus (CaKV) (33.33%) and canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2) (31.58%). The CCoV prevalence in diarrheic dogs differed significantly with immunization status, regions, seasons, and ages. Moreover, 28 S genes were amplified from the 57 CCoV-positive samples, including 26 CCoV-IIa strains, one CCoV-IIb strain, and one CCoV-I strain. A sequence comparison of the partial S gene revealed 86.3%–100% nucleotide identity among the 26 CCoV-IIa strains, and 89.6%–92.2% identity between the 26 CCoV-IIa strains and the Chinese reference strain V1. The 26 CCoV-IIa strains showed genetic diversity when compared with reference strains from China and other countries. Our data provide evidence that CCoV-I, CCoV-IIa, and CCoV-IIb strains co-circulate in the diarrhoetic dogs in northeast China, high co-infection rates with CaKV and CPV-2 were observed, and the CCoV-II strains exhibited high prevalence and genetic diversity.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.033587323,-0.005129825,0.065435013,-0.10683411,0.089096993,0.042363928,-0.015901823,-0.014305907,-0.001361875,-0.028883959,0.025796081,0.073047558,-0.050528048,-0.019889484,0.029285342,-0.027014177,-0.025889777,-0.017765958,0.03002427,-0.011815146,0.128554205,0.073392521,-0.058590798,0.036242252,0.09349238,-0.084198226,-0.017495739,0.009139768,-0.023034084,0.062690137
Prevalence and characteristics of hypoxic hepatitis in the largest single-centre cohort of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus-infected patients with severe liver impairment in the intensive care unit,"Avian influenza A(H7N9) virus (A(H7N9)) emerged in February 2013. Liver impairment of unknown cause is present in 29% of patients with A(H7N9) infection, some of whom experience severe liver injury. Hypoxic hepatitis (HH) is a type of acute severe liver injury characterized by an abrupt, massive increase in serum aminotransferases resulting from anoxic centrilobular necrosis of liver cells. In the intensive care unit (ICU), the prevalence of HH is ∼1%–2%. Here, we report a 1.8% (2/112) incidence of HH in the largest single-centre cohort of ICU patients with A(H7N9) infection. Both HH patients presented with multiple organ failure (MOF) involving respiratory, cardiac, circulatory and renal failure and had a history of chronic heart disease. On admission, severe liver impairment was found. Peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values were 937 and 1281 U/L, and 3117 and 3029 U/L, respectively, in the two patients. Unfortunately, both patients died due to deterioration of MOF. A post-mortem biopsy in case 1 confirmed the presence of centrilobular necrosis of the liver, and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of A(H7N9)-specific genes was negative, which excluded A(H7N9)-related hepatitis. The incidence of HH in A(H7N9) patients is similar to that in ICU patients with other aetiologies. It seems that patients with A(H7N9) infection and a history of chronic heart disease with a low left ventricular ejection fraction on admission are susceptible to HH, which presents as a marked elevation in ALT at the time of admission.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.085718104,-0.003910269,-0.063320625,-0.114617985,-0.062829421,0.034578803,-0.067803394,0.082035633,-0.085957813,0.008015555,-0.019911659,0.029338727,-0.00135283,0.075315311,-0.038533077,0.026468755,0.007796103,0.065765069,0.005376205,0.038543647,0.077421185,-0.075655885,-0.049194618,0.001809285,-0.039439825,-0.031727552,-0.021930836,0.009422729,-0.047601993,-0.010722364
"Molecular characterization of human coronaviruses and their circulation dynamics in Kenya, 2009–2012","BACKGROUND: Human Coronaviruses (HCoV) are a common cause of respiratory illnesses and are responsible for considerable morbidity and hospitalization across all age groups especially in individuals with compromised immunity. There are six known species of HCoV: HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV and SARS-HCoV. Although studies have shown evidence of global distribution of HCoVs, there is limited information on their presence and distribution in Kenya. METHODS: HCoV strains that circulated in Kenya were retrospectively diagnosed and molecularly characterized. A total of 417 nasopharyngeal specimens obtained between January 2009 and December 2012 from around Kenya were analyzed by a real time RT-PCR using HCoV-specific primers. HCoV-positive specimens were subsequently inoculated onto monolayers of LL-CMK2 cells. The isolated viruses were characterized by RT-PCR amplification and sequencing of the partial polymerase (pol) gene. RESULTS: The prevalence of HCoV infection was as follows: out of the 417 specimens, 35 (8.4 %) were positive for HCoV, comprising 10 (2.4 %) HCoV-NL63, 12 (2.9 %) HCoV-OC43, 9 (2.1 %) HCoV-HKU1, and 4 (1 %) HCoV-229E. The Kenyan HCoV strains displayed high sequence homology to the prototypes and contemporaneous strains. Evolution analysis showed that the Kenyan HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 isolates were under purifying selection. Phylogenetic evolutionary analyses confirmed the identities of three HCoV-HKU1, five HCoV-NL63, eight HCoV-OC43 and three HCoV-229E. CONCLUSIONS: There were yearly variations in the prevalence and circulation patterns of individual HCoVs in Kenya.

Multiple Cis-acting elements modulate programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting in Pea enation mosaic virus,"Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) is used by many positive-strand RNA viruses for translation of required products. Despite extensive studies, it remains unresolved how cis-elements just downstream of the recoding site promote a precise level of frameshifting. The Umbravirus Pea enation mosaic virus RNA2 expresses its RNA polymerase by -1 PRF of the 5′-proximal ORF (p33). Three hairpins located in the vicinity of the recoding site are phylogenetically conserved among Umbraviruses. The central Recoding Stimulatory Element (RSE), located downstream of the p33 termination codon, is a large hairpin with two asymmetric internal loops. Mutational analyses revealed that sequences throughout the RSE and the RSE lower stem (LS) structure are important for frameshifting. SHAPE probing of mutants indicated the presence of higher order structure, and sequences in the LS may also adapt an alternative conformation. Long-distance pairing between the RSE and a 3′ terminal hairpin was less critical when the LS structure was stabilized. A basal level of frameshifting occurring in the absence of the RSE increases to 72% of wild-type when a hairpin upstream of the slippery site is also deleted. These results suggest that suppression of frameshifting may be needed in the absence of an active RSE conformation.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.146432408,-0.059341436,-0.027359646,-0.001937149,0.035603083,-0.055792131,-0.066165713,0.035791012,-0.023907769,-0.048893786,-0.04048011,0.022818416,-0.010328802,-0.097762888,-0.038312781,-0.016558661,0.029154521,-0.00537932,-0.03164137,-0.053335322,0.000506181,-0.045986439,-0.063930681,0.010189474,-0.050111214,-0.085623451,-0.040532324,0.027759467,0.102933784,-0.103190962
"Influenza hospitalization epidemiology from a severe acute respiratory infection surveillance system in Jordan, January 2008–February 2014","BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Influenza typically contributes substantially to the burden of ARI, but only limited data are available on influenza activity and seasonality in Jordan. METHODS: Syndromic case definitions were used to identify individuals with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) admitted to four sentinel hospitals in Jordan. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza using real‐time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and typed as influenza A or B, with influenza A further subtyped. RESULTS: From January 2008–February 2014, 2891 SARI cases were tested for influenza, and 257 (9%) were positive. While 73% of all SARI cases were under 5 years of age, only 57% of influenza‐positive cases were under 5 years of age. Eight (3%) influenza‐positive cases died. An annual seasonal pattern of influenza activity was observed. The proportion of influenza‐positive cases peaked during November–January (14–42%) in the non‐pandemic years. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in Jordan. The seasonal pattern of influenza aligns with known Northern Hemisphere seasonality. Further characterization of the clinical and financial burden of influenza in Jordan will be critical in supporting decisions regarding disease control activities.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.21707011,-0.119470123,-0.087806113,0.204674777,-0.011392168,0.326577014,-0.186622764,0.011294729,-0.021391508,-0.152048096,0.042644182,0.051162463,-0.004788487,-0.034593808,-0.013458244,0.028560904,-0.010923971,-0.039337289,0.005445149,-0.031062721,-0.029877341,0.036390743,-0.02293518,-0.056338807,0.003796281,0.029544397,-0.077202451,0.082520035,0.03953172,0.00264027
A Rapid and Low-Cost PCR Thermal Cycler for Infectious Disease Diagnostics,"The ability to make rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases broadly available in a portable, low-cost format would mark a great step forward in global health. Many molecular diagnostic assays are developed based on using thermal cyclers to carry out polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse-transcription PCR for DNA and RNA amplification and detection, respectively. Unfortunately, most commercial thermal cyclers are expensive and need continuous electrical power supply, so they are not suitable for uses in low-resource settings. We have previously reported a low-cost and simple approach to amplify DNA using vacuum insulated stainless steel thermoses food cans, which we have named it thermos thermal cycler or TTC. Here, we describe the use of an improved set up to enable the detection of viral RNA targets by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), thus expanding the TTC’s ability to identify highly infectious, RNA virus-based diseases in low resource settings. The TTC was successful in demonstrating high-speed and sensitive detection of DNA or RNA targets of sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, and dengue fever. Our innovative TTC costs less than $200 to build and has a capacity of at least eight tubes. In terms of speed, the TTC’s performance exceeded that of commercial thermal cyclers tested. When coupled with low-cost endpoint detection technologies such as nucleic acid lateral-flow assay or a cell-phone-based fluorescence detector, the TTC will increase the availability of on-site molecular diagnostics in low-resource settings.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.030098168,0.059400789,0.202927845,0.087263828,-0.079807208,-0.02713597,0.059551433,0.024520296,-0.01373485,0.066111995,-0.011290882,-0.002725296,0.058975501,-0.080150413,-0.018615742,0.052524512,-0.06092795,0.006602471,-0.045647117,-0.03572971,-0.044755861,-0.025620005,0.016763521,-0.072757242,-0.037386816,-0.038452798,-0.017555219,-0.00671512,-0.03635781,0.041638843
Pathogenesis and Diagnostic Approaches of Avian Infectious Bronchitis,"Infectious bronchitis (IB) is one of the major economically important poultry diseases distributed worldwide. It is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and affects both galliform and nongalliform birds. Its economic impact includes decreased egg production and poor egg quality in layers, stunted growth, poor carcass weight, and mortality in broiler chickens. Although primarily affecting the respiratory tract, IBV demonstrates a wide range of tissues tropism, including the renal and reproductive systems. Thus, disease outcome may be influenced by the organ or tissue involved as well as pathotypes or strain of the infecting virus. Knowledge on the epidemiology of the prevalent IBV strains in a particular region is therefore important to guide control and preventions. Meanwhile previous diagnostic methods such as serology and virus isolations are less sensitive and time consuming, respectively; current methods, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), and sequencing, offer highly sensitive, rapid, and accurate diagnostic results, thus enabling the genotyping of new viral strains within the shortest possible time.

"Construction and characterization of recombinant human adenovirus type 5 expressing foot-and-mouth disease virus capsid proteins of Indian vaccine strain, O/IND/R2/75","AIM: Generation of recombinant human adenovirus type 5 expressing foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) capsid protein genes along with full-length 2B, 3B and 3C(pro) and its characterization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FMD viral RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and polymerase chain reaction were performed to synthesize expression cassettes (P1-2AB3BC(wt) and P1-2AB3BC(m)) followed by cloning in pShuttle-CMV vector. Chemically competent BJ5183-AD-1 cells were transformed with the recombinant pShuttle-CMV to produce recombinant adenoviral plasmids. HEK-293 cells were transfected with the recombinant adenoviral plasmids to generate recombinant adenoviruses (hAd5/P1-2AB3BC(wt) and hAd5/P1-2AB3BC(m)). Expression of the target proteins was analyzed by sandwich ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence assay. The recombinant adenoviruses were purified and concentrated by CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation. Growth kinetics and thermostability of the recombinant adenoviruses were compared with that of non-recombinant replication-defective adenovirus (dAd5). RESULTS: The recombinant adenoviruses containing capsid protein genes of the FMDV O/IND/R2/75 were generated and amplified in HEK-293 cells. The titer of the recombinant adenoviruses was approximately 10(8), 10(9.5) and 10(11) TCID(50)/ml in supernatant media, cell lysate and CsCl purified preparation, respectively. Expression of the FMDV capsid protein was detectable in sandwich ELISA and confirmed by immunofluorescence assay. Growth kinetics of the recombinant adenoviruses did not reveal a significant difference when compared with that of dAd5. A decrement of up to 10-fold at 4°C and 21-fold at 37°C was recorded in the virus titers during 60 h incubation period and found to be statistically significant (p<0.01).

"Epidemiological study of canine parvovirus infection in and around Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India","AIM: An epidemiological study of canine parvovirus infection in dogs in and around Bhubaneswar, Odisha was conducted between December 2012 to March 2013 and prevalence rate was studied on the basis of age, breed, and sex. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 71 fecal samples from suspected diarrheic dogs were collected in sterile phosphate buffer saline (10% W/V) and examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of canine parvo virus infection, followed by epidemiological study in relation to age, breed, and sex. RESULTS: Of 71 samples analyzed, 29 (40.85%) were found to be positive by PCR assay. The infection was higher in Deshi/local breeds (34.48%), followed by German shepherd (17.24%), equal incidences in mixed and Labrador retriever (10.34%), Rottweiler and German spitz showed 6.90% each and finally lower incidences in four breeds (3.45%) such as Dalmatians, Nea politan mastiff, Pug and Great Dane. Age-wise prevalence study revealed the infection being more in the age group of 3-6 months (41.37%), followed by equal incidences of 27.59% in 1-3 months and 6-12 months age group, and a low incidence in age groups above 12 months (3.45%). The incidence was predominantly higher in males (86.21%) than females (13.79%). CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological analysis revealed that the breed wise prevalence was found to be more in Deshi breeds as compared to others, age groups below 6 months were found to be more prone to parvovirus infection and males were mostly infected.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.116801733,-0.042521172,0.023552744,-0.105617184,0.069983516,-0.037243818,0.019889092,-0.016927486,-0.003701383,-0.063885171,0.070968776,0.025027681,-0.082105818,-8.22E-05,0.010417531,0.008391607,-0.004361433,-0.042048122,0.080459942,-0.017173258,0.049922629,0.059653065,-0.026696265,-0.016959808,0.080637097,-0.083835089,-0.014308196,-0.001072253,-0.051411394,0.057768421
Predominant Bacteria Detected from the Middle Ear Fluid of Children Experiencing Otitis Media: A Systematic Review,"BACKGROUND: Otitis media (OM) is amongst the most common childhood diseases and is associated with multiple microbial pathogens within the middle ear. Global and temporal monitoring of predominant bacterial pathogens is important to inform new treatment strategies, vaccine development and to monitor the impact of vaccine implementation to improve progress toward global OM prevention. METHODS: A systematic review of published reports of microbiology of acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME) from January, 1970 to August 2014, was performed using PubMed databases. RESULTS: This review confirmed that Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, remain the predominant bacterial pathogens, with S. pneumoniae the predominant bacterium in the majority reports from AOM patients. In contrast, H. influenzae was the predominant bacterium for patients experiencing chronic OME, recurrent AOM and AOM with treatment failure. This result was consistent, even where improved detection sensitivity from the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) rather than bacterial culture was conducted. On average, PCR analyses increased the frequency of detection of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae 3.2 fold compared to culture, whilst Moraxella catarrhalis was 4.5 times more frequently identified by PCR. Molecular methods can also improve monitoring of regional changes in the serotypes and identification frequency of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae over time or after vaccine implementation, such as after introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Globally, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae remain the predominant otopathogens associated with OM as identified through bacterial culture; however, molecular methods continue to improve the frequency and accuracy of detection of individual serotypes. Ongoing monitoring with appropriate detection methods for OM pathogens can support development of improved vaccines to provide protection from the complex combination of otopathogens within the middle ear, ultimately aiming to reduce the risk of chronic and recurrent OM in vulnerable populations.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.080531591,-0.022396651,0.034113707,-0.06546735,-0.056784349,-0.011353774,0.047860137,0.043122314,-0.05881731,0.110688788,-0.046578067,-0.019940498,0.017228003,-0.088505989,0.007273256,-0.012682324,-0.030122259,-0.029369032,-0.02713681,-0.054346835,-0.022319589,0.070384564,0.135036677,0.016773274,0.053057312,0.007041974,0.009912792,0.006860665,0.097390802,-0.013527571
"Epidemiology, Seasonality and Treatment of Hospitalized Adults and Adolescents with Influenza in Jingzhou, China, 2010-2012","BACKGROUND: After the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, we conducted hospital-based severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance in one central Chinese city to assess disease burden attributable to influenza among adults and adolescents. METHODS: We defined an adult SARI case as a hospitalized patient aged ≥ 15 years with temperature ≥38.0°C and at least one of the following: cough, sore throat, tachypnea, difficulty breathing, abnormal breath sounds on auscultation, sputum production, hemoptysis, chest pain, or chest radiograph consistent with pneumonia. For each enrolled SARI case-patient, we completed a standardized case report form, and collected a nasopharyngeal swab within 24 hours of admission. Specimens were tested for influenza viruses by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). We analyzed data from adult SARI cases in four hospitals in Jingzhou, China from April 2010 to April 2012. RESULTS: Of 1,790 adult SARI patients enrolled, 40% were aged ≥ 65 years old. The median duration of hospitalization was 9 days. Nearly all were prescribed antibiotics during their hospitalization, less than 1% were prescribed oseltamivir, and 28% were prescribed corticosteroids. Only 0.1% reported receiving influenza vaccination in the past year. Of 1,704 samples tested, 16% were positive for influenza. Influenza activity in all age groups showed winter-spring and summer peaks. Influenza-positive patients had a longer duration from illness onset to hospitalization and a shorter duration from hospital admission to discharge or death compared to influenza negative SARI patients. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial burden of influenza-associated SARI hospitalizations in Jingzhou, China, especially among older adults. More effective promotion of annual seasonal influenza vaccination and timely oseltamivir treatment among high risk groups may improve influenza prevention and control in China.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.241036168,-0.091442238,-0.097367272,0.108238418,-0.018406217,0.254100658,-0.196619955,0.059398063,-0.076424504,-0.138702196,0.021658737,0.080249449,-0.035415122,0.004107535,-0.037946797,0.036884518,-0.028987339,0.008478793,-0.029435999,-0.02211446,-0.026107132,0.038116773,-0.02791918,-0.072098032,-0.036439952,0.024160457,-0.043862029,0.090165915,0.004644574,0.029672236
Phylogenetic evidence for intratypic recombinant events in a novel human adenovirus C that causes severe acute respiratory infection in children,"Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are prevalent in hospitalized children with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). Here, we report a unique recombinant HAdV strain (CBJ113) isolated from a HAdV-positive child with SARI. The whole-genome sequence was determined using Sanger sequencing and high-throughput sequencing. A phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome indicated that the CBJ113 strain shares a common origin with HAdV-C2, HAdV-C6, HAdV-C1, HAdV-C5, and HAdV-C57 and formed a novel subclade on the same branch as other HAdV-C subtypes. BootScan and single nucleotide polymorphism analyses showed that the CBJ113 genome has an intra-subtype recombinant structure and comprises gene regions mainly originating from two circulating viral strains: HAdV-1 and HAdV-2. The parental penton base, pVI, and DBP genes of the recombinant strain clustered with the HAdV-1 prototype strain, and the E1B, hexon, fiber, and 100 K genes of the recombinant clustered within the HAdV-2 subtype, meanwhile the E4orf1 and DNA polymerase genes of the recombinant shared the greatest similarity with those of HAdV-5 and HAdV-6, respectively. All of these findings provide insight into our understanding of the dynamics of the complexity of the HAdV-C epidemic. More extensive studies should address the pathogenicity and clinical characteristics of the novel recombinant.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.023827378,-0.041856486,-0.000826468,-0.096935485,0.07724216,0.000603856,0.007455592,-0.036477595,0.032497288,-0.018817045,-0.0417569,0.059564486,-0.03681791,-0.085020012,0.019174319,-0.038604011,-0.109342848,0.033513879,-0.054656143,-0.071899268,0.063137397,0.266544388,-0.023454992,0.087968794,-0.166023698,0.132961654,-0.032425617,0.36425265,-0.185913579,0.05187879
Infection with and Carriage of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in Children,"“Atypical” pneumonia was described as a distinct and mild form of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) already before Mycoplasma pneumoniae had been discovered and recognized as its cause. M. pneumoniae is detected in CAP patients most frequently among school-aged children from 5 to 15 years of age, with a decline after adolescence and tapering off in adulthood. Detection rates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or serology in children with CAP admitted to the hospital amount 4–39%. Although the infection is generally mild and self-limiting, patients of every age can develop severe or extrapulmonary disease. Recent studies indicate that high rates of healthy children carry M. pneumoniae in the upper respiratory tract and that current diagnostic PCR or serology cannot discriminate between M. pneumoniae infection and carriage. Further, symptoms and radiologic features are not specific for M. pneumoniae infection. Thus, patients may be unnecessarily treated with antimicrobials against M. pneumoniae. Macrolides are the first-line antibiotics for this entity in children younger than 8 years of age. Overall macrolides are extensively used worldwide, and this has led to the emergence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae, which may be associated with severe clinical features and more extrapulmonary complications. This review focuses on the characteristics of M. pneumoniae infections in children, and exemplifies that simple clinical decision rules may help identifying children at high risk for CAP due to M. pneumoniae. This may aid physicians in prescribing appropriate first-line antibiotics, since current diagnostic tests for M. pneumoniae infection are not reliably predictive.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.207100939,-0.085548504,-0.075177841,-0.070973096,-0.049419426,-0.107482496,0.038905519,0.030386603,-0.103214016,0.088115158,-0.059227593,-0.036272474,0.016443616,-0.087889542,-0.060817312,-0.006678392,-0.025445697,0.01982251,-0.075731396,0.03757028,-0.043111609,0.202222467,0.252268316,0.039852328,0.087361042,0.003678421,-0.006154756,0.064962298,0.155885837,0.010809198
Discovery of Novel Alphacoronaviruses in European Rodents and Shrews,"Eight hundred and thirteen European rodents and shrews encompassing seven different species were screened for alphacoronaviruses using PCR detection. Novel alphacoronaviruses were detected in the species Rattus norvegicus, Microtus agrestis, Sorex araneus and Myodes glareolus. These, together with the recently described Lucheng virus found in China, form a distinct rodent/shrew-specific clade within the coronavirus phylogeny. Across a highly conserved region of the viral polymerase gene, the new members of this clade were up to 22% dissimilar at the nucleotide level to the previously described Lucheng virus. As such they might represent distinct species of alphacoronaviruses.

Low-Fidelity Polymerases of Alphaviruses Recombine at Higher Rates To Overproduce Defective Interfering Particles,"Low-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerases for many RNA virus mutators have been shown to confer attenuated phenotypes, presumably due to increased mutation rates. Additionally, for many RNA viruses, replication to high titers results in the production of defective interfering particles (DIs) that also attenuate infection. We hypothesized that fidelity, recombination, and DI production are tightly linked. We show that a Sindbis virus mutator replicating at a high multiplicity of infection manifests an earlier and greater accumulation of DIs than its wild-type counterpart. The isolated DIs interfere with the replication of full-length virus in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, the ability of the mutator virus to overproduce DIs could be linked to an increased recombination frequency. These data confirm that RNA-dependent RNA polymerase fidelity and recombination are inversely correlated for this mutator. Our findings suggest that defective interference resulting from higher recombination rates may be more detrimental to RNA virus mutators than the increase in mutational burden. IMPORTANCE Replication, adaptation, and evolution of RNA viruses rely in large part on their low-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Viruses artificially modified in their polymerases to decrease fidelity (mutator viruses) are attenuated in vivo, demonstrating the important role of fidelity in viral fitness. However, attenuation was attributed solely to the modification of the viral mutation rate and the accumulation of detrimental point mutations. In this work, we described an additional phenotype of mutator viruses: an increased recombination rate leading to defective interfering particle (DI) overproduction. Because DIs are known for their inhibitory effect on viral replication, our work suggests that fidelity variants may be attenuated in vivo via several mechanisms. This has important implications in the development of fidelity variants as live attenuated vaccine strains.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.182775028,-0.082887146,-0.077556691,0.122019867,-0.008879401,-0.038515832,0.048127276,0.041620574,-0.06591033,0.082335349,0.151525938,0.039278838,-0.078194841,0.01250166,0.072464553,0.098873052,-0.132690298,-0.03501465,-0.094101557,0.003099681,0.160354561,-0.097914914,0.086759193,0.130534502,-0.05905978,0.064189943,0.073576955,-0.071604674,-0.119439131,-0.120323187
"Surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections in Southern Arizona, 2010–2014","BACKGROUND: The Binational Border Infectious Disease Surveillance program began surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) on the US–Mexico border in 2009. Here, we describe patients in Southern Arizona. METHODS: Patients admitted to five acute care hospitals that met the SARI case definition (temperature ≥37·8°C or reported fever or chills with history of cough, sore throat, or shortness of breath in a hospitalized person) were enrolled. Staff completed a standard form and collected a nasopharyngeal swab which was tested for selected respiratory viruses by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: From October 2010–September 2014, we enrolled 332 SARI patients. Fifty‐two percent were male and 48% were white non‐Hispanic. The median age was 63 years (47% ≥65 years and 5·2% <5 years). During hospitalization, 51 of 230 (22%) patients required intubation, 120 of 297 (40%) were admitted to intensive care unit, and 28 of 278 (10%) died. Influenza vaccination was 56%. Of 309 cases tested, 49 (16%) were positive for influenza viruses, 25 (8·1%) for human metapneumovirus, 20 (6·5%) for parainfluenza viruses, 16 (5·2%) for coronavirus, 11 (3·6%) for respiratory syncytial virus, 10 (3·2%) for rhinovirus, 4 (1·3%) for rhinovirus/enterovirus, 3 (1·0%) for enteroviruses, and 3 (1·0%) for adenovirus. Among the 49 influenza‐positive specimens, 76% were influenza A (19 H3N2, 17 H1N1pdm09, and 1 not subtyped), and 24% were influenza B. CONCLUSION: Influenza viruses were a frequent cause of SARI in hospitalized patients in Southern Arizona.

Clinical Presentation and Birth Outcomes Associated with Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Pregnancy,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of viral pneumonia in children worldwide. A maternal vaccine may protect both the mother and infant from RSV illness. The epidemiology and clinical presentation of RSV in pregnant and postpartum women is not well-described. METHODS: Data were collected from a prospective, randomized trial of influenza immunization in pregnant women in rural southern Nepal. Women were enrolled in their second trimester of pregnancy and followed until six months postpartum. Active weekly home-based surveillance for febrile respiratory illness was performed. Mid-nasal swabs collected with episodes of respiratory illness were tested for RSV by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: RSV was detected in 14 (0.4%) illness episodes in 3693 women over 3554 person-years of surveillance from 2011–2014. RSV incidence was 3.9/1000 person-years overall, and 11.8/1000 person-years between September and December. Seven (50%) women sought care for RSV illness; none died. Of the 7 (50%) illness episodes during pregnancy, all had live births with 2 (29%) preterm births and a median birthweight of 3060 grams. This compares to 469 (13%) preterm births and a median birthweight of 2790 grams in women without RSV during pregnancy. Of the 7 mothers with postpartum RSV infection, RSV was detected in 4 (57%) of their infants.

Detection of Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin gene in lambs by loop mediated isothermal amplification,"AIM: The loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was standardized for rapid detection of Clostridium perfringens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 120 fecal samples were collected from enterotoxemia suspected lambs were used for screening of C. perfringens cpa gene by LAMP. The specificity of the LAMP amplified products was tested by digesting with restriction enzyme XmnI for alpha toxin gene. RESULTS: Out of 120 samples screened 112 (93.3%) samples were positive by both LAMP and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of cpa gene which indicated the equal sensitivity of both the tests. The enzyme produced single cut in 162 base pair amplified product of alpha toxin gene at 81 base pair resulting in a single band in gel electrophoresis. CONCLUSION: Both LAMP and PCR for detection of cpa gene indicated the equal sensitivity of both the tests. Standardization of LAMP reaction for amplification of epsilon and beta toxin genes will help to identify the C. perfringens toxin types from the clinical samples. The test could be a suitable alternative to the PCR in detection of toxin types without the help of sophisticated machinery like thermal cycler.

Does Viral Co-Infection Influence the Severity of Acute Respiratory Infection in Children?,"BACKGROUND: Multiple viruses are often detected in children with respiratory infection but the significance of co-infection in pathogenesis, severity and outcome is unclear. OBJECTIVES: To correlate the presence of viral co-infection with clinical phenotype in children admitted with acute respiratory infections (ARI). METHODS: We collected detailed clinical information on severity for children admitted with ARI as part of a Spanish prospective multicenter study (GENDRES network) between 2011–2013. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach was used to detect respiratory viruses in respiratory secretions. Findings were compared to an independent cohort collected in the UK. RESULTS: 204 children were recruited in the main cohort and 97 in the replication cohort. The number of detected viruses did not correlate with any markers of severity. However, bacterial superinfection was associated with increased severity (OR: 4.356; P-value = 0.005), PICU admission (OR: 3.342; P-value = 0.006), higher clinical score (1.988; P-value = 0.002) respiratory support requirement (OR: 7.484; P-value < 0.001) and longer hospital length of stay (OR: 1.468; P-value < 0.001). In addition, pneumococcal vaccination was found to be a protective factor in terms of degree of respiratory distress (OR: 2.917; P-value = 0.035), PICU admission (OR: 0.301; P-value = 0.011), lower clinical score (-1.499; P-value = 0.021) respiratory support requirement (OR: 0.324; P-value = 0.016) and oxygen necessity (OR: 0.328; P-value = 0.001). All these findings were replicated in the UK cohort. CONCLUSION: The presence of more than one virus in hospitalized children with ARI is very frequent but it does not seem to have a major clinical impact in terms of severity. However bacterial superinfection increases the severity of the disease course.

We describe the clinical features and treatment outcomes of patients with laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV at a regional referral center in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: In 2014, a retrospective chart review was performed on patients with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of MERS-CoV to determine clinical and treatment characteristics associated with death. Confounding was evaluated and a multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the independent effect of treatments administered. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients had an overall mortality of 37 %. Most patients were male (78 %) with a mean age of 54 years. Almost a quarter of the patients were healthcare workers (23.5 %) and 41 % had a known exposure to another person with MERS-CoV. Survival was associated with male gender, working as a healthcare worker, history of hypertension, vomiting on admission, elevated respiratory rate, abnormal lung exam, elevated alanine transaminase (ALT), clearance of MERS-CoV on repeat PCR polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, and mycophenolate mofetil treatment. Survival was reduced in the presence of coronary artery disease, hypotension, hypoxemia, CXR (chest X-ray) abnormalities, leukocytosis, creatinine >1 · 5 mg/dL, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and renal failure. In a multivariate analysis of treatments administered, severity of illness was the greatest predictor of reduced survival. CONCLUSIONS: Care for patients with MERS-CoV remains a challenge. In this retrospective cohort, interferon beta and mycophenolate mofetil treatment were predictors of increased survival in the univariate analysis. Severity of illness was the greatest predictor of reduced survival in the multivariate analysis. Larger randomized trials are needed to better evaluate the efficacy of these treatment regimens for MERS-CoV.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.132275969,0.248993701,-0.171507142,-0.086189741,-0.068875595,0.015743419,-0.049765785,0.350579574,0.182740765,0.016858586,0.00936863,-0.007858793,-0.038256692,0.014760647,-0.047988385,-0.004305183,0.000971483,9.16E-05,-0.020085226,0.002526355,0.022069388,-0.033982537,0.0272822,0.034689461,-0.014838977,-0.038888045,-0.013018838,-0.039145423,-0.01330291,0.027929945
Comparison of SYBR green I real-time RT-PCR with conventional agarose gel-based RT-PCR for the diagnosis of infectious bronchitis virus infection in chickens in Morocco,"BACKGROUND: A rapid, sensitive, and specific molecular method for the diagnosis of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection is important in curbing infectious bronchitis outbreaks in Morocco and other countries. METHODS: In this study, an easy-to-perform SYBR green I real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the nucleocapsid gene of IBV was developed and compared with conventional agarose gel-based RT-PCR for the detection of IBV infection. RESULTS: We found that the SYBR green I real-time RT-PCR was at least 10 times more sensitive than the agarose gel electrophoresis detection method. The assay exhibited high specificity for IBV infection. All negative controls, such as Newcastle disease virus, infectious bursal disease virus, and avian influenza virus, were not detected. CONCLUSION: The SYBR green I real-time RT-PCR test described herein can be used to rapidly distinguish IBV from other respiratory pathogens, which is important for diagnosis and control of infectious bronchitis outbreaks in Morocco. The test is a valuable and useful method as a routine assay for diagnosis of clinical IBV infection in commercial chickens.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.078653763,0.089880553,0.310979396,0.04417293,0.091238094,0.039238429,-0.175367712,-0.080458299,0.108388578,0.31748743,0.078275333,-0.04009988,-0.039891172,0.119296039,-0.137952635,0.134957908,0.057607911,0.014744615,0.013665367,-0.002313505,-0.069887553,0.001106103,0.022486526,-0.077449053,-0.001942363,0.045198084,0.021361795,-0.013324428,0.049766147,-0.003689976
Direct molecular detection of a broad range of bacterial and viral organisms and Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine serotypes in children with otitis media with effusion,"BACKGROUND: Otitis media with effusion (OME) causes significant morbidity in children, but the causes of OME and methods for prevention are unclear. To look for potential infectious etiologies, we performed a pilot study using multiple-target real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for 27 infectious agents, including nine bacterial organisms and 18 respiratory viruses in middle ear fluids (MEFs) from children with OME. QPCR was also performed for the 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes contained in the current vaccine. RESULTS: Forty-eight MEF samples were obtained and qPCR detected bacterial nucleic acid (NA) in 39/48 (81 %) and viral NA in 7/48 (15 %). Alloiococcus otitidis and S. pneumoniae were both detected in 15/48 (31 %) MEFs, followed by M. catarrhalis in 14/48 (29 %), H. influenzae in 5/48 (10 %) and M. pneumoniae in 4/48 (8 %). Rhinoviruses were most common virus type detected, found in 4/48 (8 %) MEFs. Serotypes included in the current 13-serotype vaccine were detected in only 3/15 (20 %) S. pneumoniae qPCR-positive MEFs. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria may play an important role in OME, since over 80 % of MEFs contained bacterial NA. Further research into the role of A. otitidis in OME will be helpful. Serotypes of S. pneumoniae not included in the current 13-serotype vaccine may be involved in OME. Larger studies of OME S. pneumoniae serotypes are needed to help determine which additional serotypes should be included in future vaccine formulations in order to try to prevent OME.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.059004259,-0.056614174,0.014668876,-0.059097327,-0.006039343,-0.010954951,0.03770023,0.000302548,-0.018825697,0.065335813,-0.010817603,-0.016074305,-0.023811097,-0.076616107,0.013237778,-0.006152936,-0.017633894,-0.048870461,0.005120258,-0.022985491,-0.036267588,0.093816366,0.102761129,0.024897426,0.028251462,0.037688855,-0.003542865,0.039551844,0.090580778,-0.003084843
Presentation and outcome of Middle East respiratory syndrome in Saudi intensive care unit patients,"BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection is associated with high mortality rates but limited clinical data have been reported. We describe the clinical features and outcomes of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of data from all adult (>18 years old) patients admitted to our 20-bed mixed ICU with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection between October 1, 2012 and May 31, 2014. Diagnosis was confirmed in all patients using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on respiratory samples. RESULTS: During the observation period, 31 patients were admitted with MERS-CoV infection (mean age 59 ± 20 years, 22 [71 %] males). Cough and tachypnea were reported in all patients; 22 (77.4 %) patients had bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Invasive mechanical ventilation was applied in 27 (87.1 %) and vasopressor therapy in 25 (80.6 %) patients during the intensive care unit stay. Twenty-three (74.2 %) patients died in the ICU. Nonsurvivors were older, had greater APACHE II and SOFA scores on admission, and were more likely to have received invasive mechanical ventilation and vasopressor therapy. After adjustment for the severity of illness and the degree of organ dysfunction, the need for vasopressors was an independent risk factor for death in the ICU (odds ratio = 18.33, 95 % confidence interval: 1.11–302.1, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: MERS-CoV infection requiring admission to the ICU is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The need for vasopressor therapy is the main risk factor for death in these patients.

Isolation and Characterization of a Novel Gammaherpesvirus from a Microbat Cell Line,"While employing deep sequencing and de novo assembly to characterize the mRNA transcript profile of a cell line derived from the microbat Myotis velifer incautus, we serendipitously identified mRNAs encoding proteins with a high level of identity to herpesviruses. A majority were closely related to proteins of equine herpesvirus 2 (EHV-2), a horse gammaherpesvirus. We demonstrated by electron microscopy the presence of herpesvirus-like particles in the microbat cells. Passage of supernatants from microbat cells to Vero cells resulted in syncytium formation, and expression of viral genes and amplification of viral DNA were demonstrated by quantitative PCR. Susceptibility of human cell lines to productive infection was also demonstrated. Next-generation sequencing and de novo assembly of the viral genome from supernatants from Vero cells yielded a single contig of approximately 130 kb with at least 77 open reading frames (ORFs), predicted microRNAs (miRNAs), and a gammaherpesvirus genomic organization. Phylogenic analysis of the envelope glycoprotein (gB) and DNA polymerase (POLD1) revealed similarity to multiple gammaherpesviruses, including those from as-yet-uncultured viruses of the Rhadinovirus genus that were obtained by deep sequencing of bat tissues. Moreover, the assembled genome revealed ORFs that share little or no homology to known ORFs in EHV-2 but are similar to accessory proteins of other gammaherpesviruses. Some also have striking homology to predicted Myotis bat proteins. Cumulatively, this study provides the first isolation and characterization of a replication-competent bat gammaherpesvirus. IMPORTANCE Bats are of significant interest as reservoirs for zoonotic viral pathogens; however, tools to dissect bat-virus interactions are limited in availability. This study serendipitously identified, in an established bat cell line, a fully replication-competent gammaherpesvirus; determined the complete genome sequence of the virus; and generated a viral transcript map. This virus can replicate in select human and nonhuman primate cell lines. However, analyses of viral sequences support a bat origin for this virus; we therefore refer to the virus as bat gammaherpesvirus 8 (BGHV8). The viral genome contains unique open reading frames that likely encode modulators of bat innate and adaptive immune signaling pathways and expresses viral miRNAs. The virus and its gene products should provide a unique tool to dissect both bat and gammaherpesvirus biology.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.140354838,-0.017517718,-0.030356801,-0.011001317,0.157163172,0.073587587,0.126582749,0.014173012,-0.02919001,-0.031966776,-0.162683848,-0.174653516,0.044347638,0.078373509,-0.028247886,-0.000372641,0.030739533,-0.008128849,-8.79E-05,0.037878541,-0.032969195,0.022805828,-0.00104265,-0.034017918,-0.025649556,0.00850956,0.025849624,-0.005065706,-0.076002339,0.00821096
Molecular Epidemiological Investigation of Porcine kobuvirus and Its Coinfection Rate with PEDV and SaV in Northwest China,"Porcine kobuvirus (PKV) has circulated throughout China in recent years. Although many studies have detected it throughout the world, its molecular epidemiology has not been characterized in northwest China. To understand its prevalence, 203 fecal samples were collected from different regions of Gansu Province and tested with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In this study, we tested these samples for PKV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and sapovirus and analyzed the amplified 2C gene fragments of PKV. Overall, 126 (62.1%) samples were positive for PKV. Of the 74 piglets samples among the 203 fecal samples, 65 (87.8%) were positive for PKV. PKV infection was often accompanied by PEDV, but the relationship between the two viruses must be confirmed. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that the PKV strains isolated from the same regions clustered on the same branches. This investigation shows that PKV infections are highly prevalent in pigs in northwest China, especially in piglets with symptoms of diarrhea.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.005478089,-0.001741611,0.055865383,-0.094282834,0.090070976,0.033773211,0.004662241,-0.012657781,-0.011369551,-0.027293308,0.038434523,0.072204552,-0.094253639,0.010941417,0.1614191,-0.106015247,-0.024313129,0.010481311,-0.018406372,0.050939763,-0.065532523,0.003526845,-0.006979209,-0.011739451,0.010842032,-0.014457873,-0.03259107,0.030328726,0.027179023,-0.004672269
Development of a Rapid Point-of-Use DNA Test for the Screening of Genuity® Roundup Ready 2 Yield® Soybean in Seed Samples,"Testing for the presence of genetically modified material in seed samples is of critical importance for all stakeholders in the agricultural industry, including growers, seed manufacturers, and regulatory bodies. While rapid antibody-based testing for the transgenic protein has fulfilled this need in the past, the introduction of new variants of a given transgene demands new diagnostic regimen that allows distinguishing different traits at the nucleic acid level. Although such molecular tests can be performed by PCR in the laboratory, their requirement for expensive equipment and sophisticated operation have prevented its uptake in point-of-use applications. A recently developed isothermal DNA amplification technique, recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), combines simple sample preparation and amplification work-flow procedures with the use of minimal detection equipment in real time. Here, we report the development of a highly sensitive and specific RPA-based detection system for Genuity Roundup Ready 2 Yield (RR2Y) material in soybean (Glycine max) seed samples and present the results of studies applying the method in both laboratory and field-type settings.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.004930354,0.084018431,0.269511105,0.050593284,-0.098405836,-0.009585574,0.077514771,0.035883747,-0.017070723,0.017209322,-0.105242104,0.029501387,0.04892206,-0.171748221,-0.046756966,0.075652404,-0.098766944,-0.051619557,0.046169918,0.146420074,0.007754722,-0.070327783,0.021780964,-0.122972598,-0.06276429,0.011160254,-0.020968811,0.021714952,-0.029277846,0.037021308
Frequent Respiratory Viral Infections in Children with Febrile Neutropenia - A Prospective Follow-Up Study,"OBJECTIVE: Febrile neutropenia is common in children undergoing chemotherapy for the treatment of malignancies. In the majority of cases, the cause of the fever is unknown. Although respiratory viruses are commonly associated with this condition, the etiologic significance of this finding remains unclear and is therefore the subject of this study. STUDY DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected during 87 episodes of febrile neutropenia in children age 0–18 years, being treated at a children’s oncology unit between January 2013 and June 2014. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the presence of 16 respiratory viruses. Follow-up samples were collected from children who tested positive for one or more respiratory viruses. Rhinoviruses were genotyped by VP4/VP2 sequencing. Fisher’s exact test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for group comparisons. RESULTS: At least one respiratory virus was detected in samples from 39 of 87 episodes of febrile neutropenia (45%), with rhinoviruses the most frequently detected. Follow-up samples were collected after a median of 28 days (range, 9–74 days) in 32 of the 39 virus-positive episodes. The respiratory viral infection had resolved in 25 episodes (78%). The same virus was detected at follow-up in one coronavirus and six rhinovirus episodes. Genotyping revealed a different rhinovirus species in two of the six rhinovirus infections. CONCLUSION: The frequency of respiratory viral infections in this group of patients suggests an etiologic role in febrile neutropenia. However, these findings must be confirmed in larger patient cohorts.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.213422525,-0.088498649,-0.082889591,-0.000138662,0.069802585,-0.096238347,0.049320017,-0.028603468,0.022963494,0.031645075,0.025207196,-0.051750093,-0.024082228,-0.010017561,0.067095478,-0.014825143,0.000197811,-0.064337658,0.083068143,-0.014862291,-0.026288531,-0.027322204,-0.082182406,0.029130522,0.005634828,0.059312418,-0.031078346,0.002142148,0.006418764,-0.036768918
Evidence of Aujeszky’s disease in wild boar in Serbia,"BACKGROUND: Aujeszky’s disease is a viral disease of suids caused by Suid Herpesvirus 1. The disease has worldwide distribution with significant economic impact. In Serbia, there is neither an Aujeszky’s disease eradication nor national vaccination programme of domestic pigs. Since clinical symptoms of Aujeszky’s disease are not specific, it is important to establish a link between clinical signs and presence of ADV active infection in wild boars. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of active infection within wild boar showing signs of ADV and also to examine relationship between isolates from domestic pigs and wild boar. Having in mind that virus has not been previously isolated from wild boars in Serbia, we report the first isolation of Suid Herpesvirus 1 from this species in Serbia. RESULTS: Tissue and serum samples from 40 wild boars from eastern Serbia were examined for evidence of Aujeszky’s disease (AD). Suid Herpesvirus 1 (SHV1), the cause of AD was isolated on PK15 cell line from three tissue samples, inducing cytopathic effect (CPE) with syncytia forming, and viral genome was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in eight samples. Genetic analysis of us4, us9 and ul49.5 partial sequences showed high homology between ADV isolates from wild boars and between isolates from wild boars and domestic animals. Neutralizing antibodies were not detected by virus neutralisation test (VNT) in sera from four out of eight PCR positive wild boars suggesting recent infection in those animals.

Hepatitis C Virus Core Protein Promotes miR-122 Destabilization by Inhibiting GLD-2,"The liver-specific microRNA miR-122, which has essential roles in liver development and metabolism, is a key proviral factor for hepatitis C virus (HCV). Despite its crucial role in the liver and HCV life cycle, little is known about the molecular mechanism of miR-122 expression regulation by HCV infection. Here, we show that the HCV core protein downregulates the abundance of miR-122 by promoting its destabilization via the inhibition of GLD-2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase. The decrease in miR-122 expression resulted in the dysregulation of the known functions of miR-122, including its proviral activity for HCV. By high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from human liver biopsies, we found that the 22-nucleotide (nt) prototype miR-122 is modified at its 3′ end by 3′-terminal non-templated and templated nucleotide additions. Remarkably, the proportion of miR-122 isomers bearing a single nucleotide tail of any ribonucleotide decreased in liver specimens from patients with HCV. We found that these single-nucleotide-tailed miR-122 isomers display increased miRNA activity and stability over the 22-nt prototype miR-122 and that the 3′-terminal extension is catalyzed by the unique terminal nucleotidyl transferase activity of GLD-2, which is capable of adding any single ribonucleotide without preference of adenylate to the miR-122 3′ end. The HCV core protein specifically inhibited GLD-2, and its interaction with GLD-2 in the cytoplasm was found to be responsible for miR-122 downregulation. Collectively, our results provide new insights into the regulatory role of the HCV core protein in controlling viral RNA abundance and miR-122 functions through miR-122 stability modulation.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.089804383,-0.041740972,-0.013711982,-0.056012684,-0.054528662,0.007331993,0.017309507,-0.000926125,0.023241856,-0.024777658,-0.025725307,0.054465222,0.003742752,0.008037248,-0.028098033,-0.01934768,0.027898055,0.121149686,0.137288969,-0.081418579,-0.023723544,-0.016635402,0.049339384,0.022339668,-0.023082588,-0.036712342,-0.055023548,0.037264283,-0.017497392,-0.045976897

Therefore, the rapid detection of CRA is essential for epidemiological surveillance. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been extensively used for the rapid identification of most pathogens. In this study, we have developed two multiplex real-time PCR assays to detect and differentiate A. baumannii and non-A. baumannii Acinetobacter spp, and common carbapenemase genes, including bla(NDM), bla(OXA-23-like), bla(OXA-40-like), bla(OXA-51-like), and bla(OXA-58-like). We demonstrate the potential utility of these assays for the direct detection of bla(NDM)-, bla(OXA-23-like)-, bla(OXA-40-like)-, bla(OXA-51-like)-, and bla(OXA-58-like)-positive CRA in clinical specimens. Primers were specifically designed, and two multiplex real-time PCR assays were developed: multiplex real-time PCR assay1 for the detection of Acinetobacter baumannii 16S–23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer sequence, the Acinetobacter recA gene, and class-B-metalloenzyme-encoding gene bla(NDM); and multiplex real-time PCR assay2 to detect class-D-oxacillinase-encoding genes (bla(OXA-23-like), bla(OXA-40-like), bla(OXA-51-like),and bla(OXA-58-like)). The assays were performed on an ABI Prism 7500 FAST Real-Time PCR System. CRA isolates were used to compare the assays with conventional PCR and sequencing. Known amounts of CRA cells were added to sputum and fecal specimens and used to test the multiplex real-time PCR assays. The results for target and nontarget amplification showed that the multiplex real-time PCR assays were specific, the limit of detection for each target was 10 copies per 20 μL reaction volume, the assays were linear over six log dilutions of the target genes (r(2) > 0.99), and the Ct values of the coefficients of variation for intra- and interassay reproducibility were less than 5%. The multiplex real-time PCR assays showed 100% concordance with conventional PCR when tested against 400 CRA isolates and their sensitivity for the target DNA in sputum and fecal specimens was 10(2) CFU/mL. Therefore, these novel multiplex real-time PCR assays allow the sensitive and specific characterization and differentiation of bla(NDM)-, bla(OXA-23-like)-, bla(OXA-40-like)-, bla(OXA-51-like)-, and bla(OXA-58-like)-positive CRA, making them potential tools for the direct detection of CRA in clinical specimens and the surveillance of nosocomial infections.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.017366242,0.027016259,0.107319295,-0.009612054,-0.013300322,0.002811389,0.004715775,-0.002357477,-0.000409876,-0.005934799,-0.033666959,0.006151091,0.003505648,-0.011268851,0.010826241,-0.011771047,0.014876189,-0.009318949,0.018307903,-0.08737106,0.02856469,0.011967889,0.0285,-0.059992486,-0.028630739,-0.002991764,0.008158798,-0.009354396,0.021983027,-0.018832854
"Viral etiology of severe acute respiratory infections in hospitalized children in Cameroon, 2011–2013","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) is recognized as an important cause of morbidity, mortality, and hospitalization among children in developing countries. Little is known, however, in tropical countries like Cameroon about the cause and seasonality of respiratory infections, especially in hospitalized settings. Objectives: Our study investigates the viral etiology and seasonality of SARI in hospitalized children in Yaounde, Cameroon. METHODS: Prospective clinic surveillance was conducted to identify hospitalized children aged ≤15 years presenting with respiratory symptoms ≤5‐day duration. Demographic and clinical data, and respiratory specimens were collected. Nasopharyngeal samples were tested for 17 respiratory viruses using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The viral distribution and demographic data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: From September 2011 through September 2013, 347 children aged ≤15 years were enrolled. At least one virus was identified in each of 65·4% children, of which 29·5% were coinfections; 27·3% were positive for human adenovirus (hAdV), 13·2% for human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), 11·5% for rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV), 10·6% for human bocavirus (hBoV), 9·8% for influenza virus (Inf), 6·6% for human parainfluenza virus (hPIV), 5·7% for human coronavirus (hCoV), and 2·3% for human metapneumovirus (hMPV). While hRSV showed seasonal patterns, hAdV and RV/EV were detected throughout the year and no evident temporal patterns were observed for the remaining viruses. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses were associated with a high burden of hospitalizations among children in Cameroon. Nevertheless, additional studies evaluating asymptomatic Cameroonian children will be important in understanding the relationship between viral carriage and disease.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.300906829,-0.168214086,-0.143316291,0.121203653,0.118021495,-0.102326594,0.086880637,-0.124806586,0.157810337,-0.020700671,-0.007000766,0.015980131,0.024116132,-0.02467621,0.021644989,-0.028275974,-0.055319191,-0.019831628,-0.015512296,0.018879006,-0.004386064,0.157149743,-0.010220545,0.057312216,-0.081690417,0.105154744,-0.091680117,0.120684987,-0.019890128,-0.034471832
Respiratory Virus Detection and Clinical Diagnosis in Children Attending Day Care,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory viruses often have been studied in children with respiratory tract infection (RTI), but less knowledge exists about viruses in asymptomatic children. We have studied the occurrence of a broad panel of respiratory viruses in apparently healthy children attending day care, taking into account the influence of possible confounding factors, such as age, clinical signs of respiratory tract infection (RTI), location (day-care section) and season. METHODS: We have studied 161 children in two day-care centers, each with separate sections for younger and older children, during four autumn and winter visits over a two-year period. A total of 355 clinical examinations were performed, and 343 nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) were analyzed by semi-quantitative, real-time, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for 19 respiratory pathogens. RESULT: Forty-three percent of all NPS were PCR-positive for ≥ 1 of 13 virus species, with high species variation during visits. Rhinovirus 26% (88/343 NPS), enterovirus 12% (40/343) and parechovirus 9% (30/343) were detected in every visit, and the rates varied in relation to age, day-care section and season. Ten other viruses were detected in ≤ 3% of the NPS. Generally, viruses occurred together in the NPS. In 24% (79/331) of the clinical examinations with available NPS, the children had clear signs of RTI, while in 41% (135/331) they had mild signs, and in 35% (117/331) the children had no signs of RTI. Moreover, viruses were found in 70% (55/79) of children with clear signs of RTI, in 41% (55/135) with mild signs and in 30% (35/117) without any signs of RTI (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Positive PCR tests for respiratory viruses, particularly picornaviruses, were frequently detected in apparently healthy children attending day care. Virus detection rates were related to age, presence of clinical signs of RTI, location in day care and season.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.169468614,-0.077344044,-0.033342031,0.00216646,0.057835161,-0.080596643,0.07696497,-0.035114009,0.051761921,0.000108963,0.037480685,-0.028727319,-0.004921446,-0.050031316,0.036276881,0.013129294,-0.0197457,-0.041736844,0.029465997,-0.037576818,-0.021476252,0.072316012,-0.005697576,0.004022236,-0.042256309,0.048905452,-0.042231067,-0.022050881,0.013533337,-0.041901549
Expression of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator in Ganglia of Human Gastrointestinal Tract,"CF is caused by mutations of the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) which is an anion selective transmembrane ion channel that mainly regulates chloride transport, expressed in the epithelia of various organs. Recently, we have demonstrated CFTR expression in the brain, the spinal cord and the sympathetic ganglia. This study aims to investigate the expression and distribution of CFTR in the ganglia of the human gastrointestinal tract. Fresh tissue and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded normal gastrointestinal tract samples were collected from eleven surgical patients and five autopsy cases. Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, laser-assisted microdissection and nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were performed. Expression of CFTR protein and mRNA was detected in neurons of the ganglia of all segments of the human gastrointestinal tract examined, including the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, appendix, colon and rectum. The extensive expression of CFTR in the enteric ganglia suggests that CFTR may play a role in the physiology of the innervation of the gastro-intestinal tract. The presence of dysfunctional CFTRs in enteric ganglia could, to a certain extent, explain the gastrointestinal symptoms frequently experienced by CF patients.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.001809646,-0.026670502,-0.00688244,-0.123243522,-0.011618688,0.002082366,-0.010213603,-0.025142987,0.011913813,-0.024793474,-0.041381884,-0.000200107,0.02136038,0.06906893,0.020050616,-0.043128286,0.022719429,-0.025884058,-0.022930866,-0.01692487,0.048546272,-0.02012629,-0.020576487,0.014546085,-0.014126198,-0.014269526,-0.033033704,0.008522382,0.025267281,-0.053741078
Pertussis in infants: an underestimated disease,"BACKGROUND: The clinical diagnosis of pertussis is not easy in early infancy since clinical manifestations can overlap with several different diseases. Many cases are often misclassified and underdiagnosed. We conducted a retrospective study on infants to assess how often physicians suspected pertussis and the actual frequency of Bordetella pertussis infections. METHODS: We analyzed all infants with age ≤90 days hospitalized from March 2011 until September 2013 for acute respiratory symptoms tested with a Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction able to detect Bordetella pertussis and with a Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction for a multipanel respiratory virus. Therefore, we compared patients with pertussis positive aspirate, patients with respiratory virus positive aspirate and patients with negative aspirate to identify symptoms or clinical findings predictive of pertussis. RESULTS: Out of 215 patients analyzed, 53 were positive for pertussis (24.7 %), 119 were positive for respiratory virus (55.3 %) and 43 had a negative aspirate (20 %). Pertussis was suspected in 22 patients at admission and 16 of them were confirmed by laboratory tests, while 37 infants with different admission diagnosis resulted positive for pertussis. The sensitivity of clinical diagnosis was 30.2 % and the specificity 96.3 %. Infants with pertussis had more often paroxysmal cough, absence of fever and a higher absolute lymphocyte count than infants without pertussis. CONCLUSIONS: Pertussis is a serious disease in infants and it is often unrecognized; some features should help pediatricians to suspect pertussis, but clinical suspicion has a low sensitivity. We suggest a systematic use of Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction to support the clinical suspicion of pertussis in patients with less than 3 months of age hospitalized with acute respiratory symptoms.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.147259291,-0.024426083,-0.028911663,-0.066488984,-0.032752501,-0.058741152,-0.012060889,0.033093731,-0.036338522,0.000564069,0.005195242,0.013092589,-0.021733977,-0.049051201,0.047537238,0.075415125,0.056951919,0.006964554,0.056698718,-0.007818139,-2.54E-05,-0.062601259,-0.05526671,-0.076896277,0.044727234,-0.03378349,0.009480141,0.049112308,0.008271777,-0.088411902
Sustained Viremia and High Viral Load in Respiratory Tract Secretions Are Predictors for Death in Immunocompetent Adults with Adenovirus Pneumonia,"The predictors for fatal adenovirus (AdV) pneumonia among immunocompetent adults are unclear. Laboratory-confirmed, hospitalized AdV pneumonia adults were prospectively enrolled in Beijing Chao-Yang hospital from March to June 2013. Clinical data and serial whole blood and respiratory tract secretions from such patients were collected. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify the viral load. A total of 14 AdV pneumonia cases were consecutively enrolled, and four of them were fatal. Ten cases were caused by AdV-55, three by AdV-7 and one by AdV-3. There were no differences in age, gender or underlying diseases between the patients in the fatal cases and surviving cases. At admission (on day 5–7 after illness onset), the patients in fatal cases presented higher initial viral loads in respiratory tract secretions (8.578 ± 2.115 vs 6.263 ± 1.225 Log(10) copies/ml, p = 0.023). All patients in fatal cases presented with viremia on day 12–14 (100% vs 66.7%, p = 0.017). A higher initial viral load in the respiratory tract and sustained viremia (more than 2 weeks) may be predictors for fatal clinical outcomes.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.180586765,-0.030686823,-0.087824704,-0.086758729,-0.052321623,-0.061099345,-0.025572153,0.064106546,-0.069830436,0.008608435,-0.008731758,0.007242581,-0.025536239,0.014917118,-0.031614135,-0.007317897,-0.029186844,0.044923784,-0.003759094,0.024729145,0.00281447,0.045166691,-0.057176458,-0.010597916,-0.03885051,0.017228172,0.03308353,0.037666393,-0.065261531,0.0071812
"Integrated Microfluidic Nucleic Acid Isolation, Isothermal Amplification, and Amplicon Quantification","Microfluidic components and systems for rapid (<60 min), low-cost, convenient, field-deployable sequence-specific nucleic acid-based amplification tests (NAATs) are described. A microfluidic point-of-care (POC) diagnostics test to quantify HIV viral load from blood samples serves as a representative and instructive example to discuss the technical issues and capabilities of “lab on a chip” NAAT devices. A portable, miniaturized POC NAAT with performance comparable to conventional PCR (polymerase-chain reaction)-based tests in clinical laboratories can be realized with a disposable, palm-sized, plastic microfluidic chip in which: (1) nucleic acids (NAs) are extracted from relatively large (~mL) volume sample lysates using an embedded porous silica glass fiber or cellulose binding phase (“membrane”) to capture sample NAs in a flow-through, filtration mode; (2) NAs captured on the membrane are isothermally (~65 °C) amplified; (3) amplicon production is monitored by real-time fluorescence detection, such as with a smartphone CCD camera serving as a low-cost detector; and (4) paraffin-encapsulated, lyophilized reagents for temperature-activated release are pre-stored in the chip. Limits of Detection (LOD) better than 10(3) virons/sample can be achieved. A modified chip with conduits hosting a diffusion-mode amplification process provides a simple visual indicator to readily quantify sample NA template. In addition, a companion microfluidic device for extracting plasma from whole blood without a centrifuge, generating cell-free plasma for chip-based molecular diagnostics, is described.

"Human Respiratory Coronaviruses Detected In Patients with Influenza-Like Illness in Arkansas, USA","Acute respiratory viruses often result in significant morbidity and mortality. The potential impact of human respiratory coronavirus (CoV) infections was underestimated until the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2003, which showed that new, highly pathogenic coronaviruses could be introduced to humans, highlighting the importance of monitoring the circulating coronaviruses. The use of sensitive molecular methods has contributed to the differential diagnosis of viruses circulating in humans. Our study aim was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of human CoV strains circulating in Arkansas, their genetic variability and their association with reported influenza-like symptoms. We analyzed 200 nasal swab samples, collected by the Arkansas Department of Health in 2010, for influenza diagnosis. All samples were from patients showing acute respiratory symptoms while testing negative for influenza. Samples were pre-screened, using a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) multiprobe for coronavirus, and subjected to confirmatory pancoronavirus and/or strain-specific reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR followed by sequence analysis. Seventy-nine samples (39.5%) were positive by qRT-PCR and 35 samples (17.5%) were confirmed by conventional RT-PCR. Twenty-three of the confirmed samples (59%) were sequenced. The most frequent strain detected was HCoV-OC43-like followed by NL63-like; only one sample was positive for HCoV-229E and one for HCoV-HKU1. Feline-like CoV strains were detected in three samples, representing possible evidence of interspecies transmission or a new human strain. Seventeen percent of the coronavirus positive samples were also positive for other respiratory viruses, such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Parainfluenza 2 and 3, and Rhinovirus. Thus, HCoV-OC43, NL63, HKU1 and new feline-like strains were circulating in Arkansas in 2010. HCoV was the sole respiratory virus detected in 16% of the patients who showed acute respiratory symptoms with negative diagnoses for influenza virus.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.235504838,0.125501314,-0.056615633,0.121897215,0.241904341,0.033916504,-0.04842014,-0.050200068,0.102767285,-0.039943276,0.050285541,0.224731349,0.255265141,0.163933841,0.040601447,-0.047001997,0.010258455,-0.058674974,0.014257181,0.008341317,0.031785945,-0.033834046,-0.00245201,-0.012880906,0.064569538,-0.031123467,0.024359963,0.035934826,0.011014785,-0.000796611
"Morbidity, Mortality, and Seasonality of Influenza Hospitalizations in Egypt, November 2007-November 2014","BACKGROUND: Influenza typically comprises a substantial portion of acute respiratory infections, a leading cause of mortality worldwide. However, influenza epidemiology data are lacking in Egypt. We describe seven years of Egypt’s influenza hospitalizations from a multi-site influenza surveillance system. METHODS: Syndromic case definitions identified individuals with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) admitted to eight hospitals in Egypt. Standardized demographic and clinical data were collected. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and typed as influenza A or B, and influenza A specimens subtyped. RESULTS: From November 2007–November 2014, 2,936/17,441 (17%) SARI cases were influenza-positive. Influenza-positive patients were more likely to be older, female, pregnant, and have chronic condition(s) (all p<0.05). Among them, 53 (2%) died, and death was associated with older age, five or more days from symptom onset to hospitalization, chronic condition(s), and influenza A (all p<0.05). An annual seasonal influenza pattern occurred from July–June. Each season, the proportion of the season’s influenza-positive cases peaked during November–May (19–41%). CONCLUSIONS: In Egypt, influenza causes considerable morbidity and mortality and influenza SARI hospitalization patterns mirror those of the Northern Hemisphere.

"Etiology of Influenza-Like Illnesses from Sentinel Network Practitioners in Réunion Island, 2011-2012","In Réunion Island, despite an influenza surveillance established since 1996 by the sentinel general practitioner’s network, little is known about the etiology of Influenza like-illness (ILI) that differs from influenza viruses in a tropical area. We set up a retrospective study using nasal swabs collected by sentinel GPs from ILI patients in 2011 and 2012. A total of 250 swabs were randomly selected and analyzed by multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) including research of 18 viruses and 4 bacteria. We detected respiratory viruses in 169/222 (76.1%) samples, mostly rhinovirus (23.4%), influenza A virus (21.2%), influenza B virus (12.6%), coronavirus (4.9%) and Human metapneumovirus (3.6%). Nine swabs (5.3% of positive swabs) revealed co-infections with two viruses identified, among which six concerned co-infections with influenza viruses. We observed important seasonal differences, with circulation of Human Metapneumoviruses, RSV A and B and coronavirus only during summer; whereas parainfluenza viruses were identified only during winter. In conclusion, this study highlights a substantial circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens in Réunion Island throughout the year. It shows that ILI are not only attributable to influenza and underlines the need for biological surveillance. As the use of multiplex RT-PCR showed its efficacy, it is now used routinely in the surveillance of ILI.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.220743549,-0.110847705,-0.017279268,0.252827262,0.086891346,0.209542537,-0.106867301,-0.02340385,-0.020705907,-0.072163862,0.022194533,-0.025376088,0.011891967,0.027488997,0.02344947,-0.046654886,0.048741367,-0.074406546,0.035612255,-0.046485437,0.006526481,-0.041086989,-0.011471553,0.019980448,0.057985965,-0.017446927,0.023197184,0.08404773,0.035205493,-0.088941248
Emergence of human caliciviruses among diarrhea cases in southwest China,"BACKGROUND: Acute diarrhea is one of the most serious problems in global public health that causes considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. Human caliciviruses (HuCV) including norovirus (NoV, genogroup GI and GII) and sapovirus (SaV), is a leading cause of acute sporadic diarrhea in individuals across all age groups. However, few studies had been conducted clarifying the characteristics of HuCV in diarrhea cases across all age groups in China. Our study was aimed at assessing the HuCV-related diarrhea burden and NoV genotypes distribution in southwest China. METHODS: The study was conducted in four hospitals in Kunming city, Yunnan province, from June 2014 to July 2015. Stool specimens were collected from 1,121 diarrhea cases and 319 healthy controls in outpatient departments. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect NoV (GI, GII) and SaV. Sequencing was applied to confirm the three viral infections and phylogenetic analysis was performed to determine their genotypes. A structured questionnaire was used to record the demographic information and clinical symptoms of subjects. RESULTS: HuCV was detected at an 11.0 % infection rate in 1,121 diarrhea cases and at 3.4 % rate in 319 non-diarrhea subjects (p < 0.0001, OR = 3.5, 95 % CI 1.8–6.5). The prevalence of the NoV genogroup GII and genotype GII.4 in diarrhea cases was significantly higher than that found in healthy controls (p < 0.0001, p = 0.018, respectively). NoV GII (n = 118, 10.5 %) was the most common HuCV subtype in diarrhea cases, followed by SaV (n = 3, 0.3 %) and NoV GI (n = 2, 0.2 %). Of 118 NoV GII strains isolated from diarrhea patients. GII.4 (n = 55, 46.6 %) was the predominant strain, followed by GII.3 (n = 28, 23.7 %), GII.12 (n = 25, 21.2 %), GII.17 (n = 8, 6.8 %), and GII.5 (n = 2, 1.7 %). Of the 55 GII.4 strains, the GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant had absolutely predominant prevalence (n = 52, 94.5 %), followed by the NoV GII.4-2006b variant (n = 3, 5.5 %). The GII.4 Orleans 2009 variant was not found in diarrhea cases of the study. CONCLUSIONS: NoV GII was the major genogroup and GII.4 was the most predominant strain detected in diarrhea patients. The GII.17 is an emergent variant in sporadic diarrhea and might become the predominant strain in diarrhea cases in the near future. Rapid, accurate detection kits need to be developed to help us find and treat NoV-associated diarrhea in clinical settings in a timely manner.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.036446834,-0.012588331,0.021905473,-0.101937361,0.026142438,0.018294966,0.000252748,0.003103661,-0.027248813,-0.027289138,0.028654615,0.099827181,-0.077433854,-0.046259876,0.052560977,-0.032296098,-0.035157142,0.019438232,-0.008198819,0.003649943,0.000883384,0.031376659,-0.05732894,0.04557441,0.0360009,-0.019963336,-0.003961511,0.002392995,0.006408987,0.011328185
Rescue of the 1947 Zika Virus Prototype Strain with a Cytomegalovirus Promoter-Driven cDNA Clone,"The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak has been linked to severe pathogenesis. Here, we report the construction of a plasmid carrying a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-expressed prototype 1947 Uganda MR766 ZIKV cDNA that can initiate infection following direct plasmid DNA transfection of mammalian cells. Incorporation of a synthetic intron in the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) region of the ZIKV polyprotein reduced viral cDNA-associated toxicity in bacteria. High levels of infectious virus were produced following transfection of the plasmid bearing the wild-type MR766 ZIKV genome, but not one with a disruption to the viral nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) polymerase active site. Multicycle growth curve and plaque assay experiments indicated that the MR766 virus resulting from plasmid transfection exhibited growth characteristics that were more similar to its parental isolate than previously published 2010 Cambodia and 2015 Brazil cDNA-rescued ZIKV. This ZIKV infectious clone will be useful for investigating the genetic determinants of ZIKV infection and pathogenesis and should be amenable to construction of diverse infectious clones expressing reporter proteins and representing a range of ZIKV isolates. IMPORTANCE The study of ZIKV, which has become increasingly important with the recent association of this virus with microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome, would benefit from an efficient strategy to genetically manipulate the virus. This work describes a model system to produce infectious virus in cell culture. We created a plasmid carrying the prototype 1947 Uganda MR766 ZIKV genome that both was stable in bacteria and could produce high levels of infectious virus in mammalian cells through direct delivery of this DNA. Furthermore, growth properties of this rescued virus closely resembled those of the viral isolate from which it was derived. This model system will provide a simple and effective means to study how ZIKV genetics impact viral replication and pathogenesis.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.087798989,-0.043045526,0.012671022,-0.03845943,-0.054431266,0.038499373,0.010729456,-0.024598202,0.032539496,0.045023884,-0.024556909,-0.045036059,0.020490083,0.001359574,0.021084888,0.002011762,-0.023409476,0.002331366,-0.023546411,0.047607424,-0.001121051,-0.000916245,0.012344405,0.014675035,0.014144728,0.049454587,0.023575658,-0.004733932,-0.091689482,0.040622978
Human IFIT1 Inhibits mRNA Translation of Rubulaviruses but Not Other Members of the Paramyxoviridae Family,"We have previously shown that IFIT1 is primarily responsible for the antiviral action of interferon (IFN) alpha/beta against parainfluenza virus type 5 (PIV5), selectively inhibiting the translation of PIV5 mRNAs. Here we report that while PIV2, PIV5, and mumps virus (MuV) are sensitive to IFIT1, nonrubulavirus members of the paramyxoviridae such as PIV3, Sendai virus (SeV), and canine distemper virus (CDV) are resistant. The IFIT1 sensitivity of PIV5 was not rescued by coinfection with an IFIT1-resistant virus (PIV3), demonstrating that PIV3 does not specifically inhibit the antiviral activity of IFIT1 and that the inhibition of PIV5 mRNAs is regulated by cis-acting elements. We developed an in vitro translation system using purified human IFIT1 to further investigate the mechanism of action of IFIT1. While the translations of PIV2, PIV5, and MuV mRNAs were directly inhibited by IFIT1, the translations of PIV3, SeV, and CDV mRNAs were not. Using purified human mRNA-capping enzymes, we show biochemically that efficient inhibition by IFIT1 is dependent upon a 5′ guanosine nucleoside cap (which need not be N7 methylated) and that this sensitivity is partly abrogated by 2′O methylation of the cap 1 ribose. Intriguingly, PIV5 M mRNA, in contrast to NP mRNA, remained sensitive to inhibition by IFIT1 following in vitro 2′O methylation, suggesting that other structural features of mRNAs may influence their sensitivity to IFIT1. Thus, surprisingly, the viral polymerases (which have 2′-O-methyltransferase activity) of rubulaviruses do not protect these viruses from inhibition by IFIT1. Possible biological consequences of this are discussed. IMPORTANCE Paramyxoviruses cause a wide variety of diseases, and yet most of their genes encode structural proteins and proteins involved in their replication cycle. Thus, the amount of genetic information that determines the type of disease that paramyxoviruses cause is relatively small. One factor that will influence disease outcomes is how they interact with innate host cell defenses, including the interferon (IFN) system. Here we show that different paramyxoviruses interact in distinct ways with cells in a preexisting IFN-induced antiviral state. Strikingly, all the rubulaviruses tested were sensitive to the antiviral action of ISG56/IFIT1, while all the other paramyxoviruses tested were resistant. We developed novel in vitro biochemical assays to investigate the mechanism of action of IFIT1, demonstrating that the mRNAs of rubulaviruses can be directly inhibited by IFIT1 and that this is at least partially because their mRNAs are not correctly methylated.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.079373977,-0.041145962,0.000881475,-0.028496255,-0.060484653,0.039718506,0.041348775,-0.00395914,0.02066649,-0.012439039,-0.029104268,-0.004593458,0.001263439,0.015344194,-0.009086572,0.001199872,-0.006464374,-0.000955931,0.006022726,0.018752232,0.03837269,0.040501858,0.009901827,0.028944367,0.065345474,-0.049647397,-0.021651451,0.00923006,0.065006627,-0.002019659
Ability of device to collect bacteria from cough aerosols generated by adults with cystic fibrosis,"Background: Identifying lung pathogens and acute spikes in lung counts remain a challenge in the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Bacteria from the deep lung may be sampled from aerosols produced during coughing. Methods: A new device was used to collect and measure bacteria levels from cough aerosols of patients with CF. Sputum and oral specimens were also collected and measured for comparison. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus mitis were detected in specimens using Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) molecular assays. Results: Twenty adult patients with CF and 10 healthy controls participated. CF related bacteria (CFRB) were detected in 13/20 (65%) cough specimens versus 15/15 (100%) sputum specimens. Commensal S. mitis was present in 0/17 (0%, p=0.0002) cough specimens and 13/14 (93%) sputum samples. In normal controls, no bacteria were collected in cough specimens but 4/10 (40%) oral specimens were positive for CFRB. Conclusions: Non-invasive cough aerosol collection may detect lower respiratory pathogens in CF patients, with similar specificity and sensitivity to rates detected by BAL, without contamination by oral CFRB or commensal bacteria.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.130186729,0.000899634,0.016161869,-0.086606822,-0.030923621,-0.05455493,-0.015567209,0.042776376,-0.114595059,0.02994331,-0.034727623,0.01497995,-0.017713373,0.044854752,-0.012899215,-0.026763544,-0.001517152,-0.024754909,0.022393577,-0.041633925,0.015287075,0.01095669,0.070543408,-0.008191346,0.014144141,0.01654309,-0.006060483,0.02430386,0.026886496,-0.049905855
"Epidemiology, Co-Infections, and Outcomes of Viral Pneumonia in Adults: An Observational Cohort Study","Advanced technologies using polymerase-chain reaction have allowed for increased recognition of viral respiratory infections including pneumonia. Co-infections have been described for several respiratory viruses, especially with influenza. Outcomes of viral pneumonia, including cases with co-infections, have not been well described. This was observational cohort study conducted to describe hospitalized patients with viral pneumonia including co-infections, clinical outcomes, and predictors of mortality. Patients admitted from March 2013 to November 2014 with a positive respiratory virus panel (RVP) and radiographic findings of pneumonia within 48 h of the index RVP were included. Co-respiratory infection (CRI) was defined as any organism identification from a respiratory specimen within 3 days of the index RVP. Predictors of in-hospital mortality on univariate analysis were evaluated in a multivariate model. Of 284 patients with viral pneumonia, a majority (51.8%) were immunocompromised. A total of 84 patients (29.6%) were found to have a CRI with 48 (57.6%) having a bacterial CRI. Viral CRI with HSV, CMV, or both occurred in 28 patients (33.3%). Fungal (16.7%) and other CRIs (7.1%) were less common. Many patients required mechanical ventilation (54%) and vasopressor support (36%). Overall in-hospital mortality was high (23.2%) and readmissions were common with several patients re-hospitalized within 30 (21.1%) and 90 days (36.7%) of discharge. Predictors of in-hospital mortality on multivariate regression included severity of illness factors, stem-cell transplant, and identification of multiple respiratory viruses. In conclusion, hospital mortality is high among adult patients with viral pneumonia and patients with multiple respiratory viruses identified may be at a higher risk.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.27079422,-0.080458346,-0.167771577,-0.040626695,-0.07122983,-0.071533899,-0.050966312,0.137374007,-0.151611994,0.112089989,-0.055157466,0.001856457,0.028160701,0.074596657,-0.052612081,-0.028321626,0.033050233,0.052849074,-0.026627508,0.109344326,0.031459243,-0.006168356,-0.038266338,0.032465503,-0.002331568,-0.044221876,0.007172409,-0.054780202,-0.053816017,-0.02854892
"Phylogenetic analysis of human rhinoviruses collected over four successive years in Sydney, Australia","BACKGROUND: Human rhinoviruses (HRV) cause a wide spectrum of disease, ranging from a mild influenza‐like illness (ILI) to severe respiratory infection. Molecular epidemiological data are limited for HRV circulating in the Southern Hemisphere. OBJECTIVES: To identify the species and genotypes of HRV from clinical samples collected in Sydney, Australia, from 2006 to 2009. METHODS: Combined nose and throat swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from individuals with ILI were tested for HRV using real‐time reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR). Sequencing data of 5′UTR and VP4/VP2 coding regions on RT‐PCR‐positive specimens were analysed. RESULTS: Human rhinoviruses were detected by real‐time PCR in 20.9% (116/555) of samples tested. Phylogenetic analysis of 5′UTR and VP4/VP2 on HRV‐positive samples was concordant in the grouping of HRV A and B species but not HRV C species. Eighty per cent (16/20) of sequences that grouped as HRV C in the VP4/VP2 tree clustered as HRV A, alongside some previously described C strains as subspecies C/A. Discordant branching was seen within HRV A group: two sequences clustering as A in the VP4/VP2 tree branched within the C/A subspecies in the 5′UTR tree, and one sequence showed identity to different HRV A strains in the two genes. The prevalence of HRV C and C/A species was greater in paediatric compared to adult patients (47.9% vs 25.5%, P = .032). CONCLUSION: Human rhinoviruses are a common cause of respiratory infections, and HRV C is present in the Southern Hemisphere.

Mechanisms of viral mutation,"The remarkable capacity of some viruses to adapt to new hosts and environments is highly dependent on their ability to generate de novo diversity in a short period of time. Rates of spontaneous mutation vary amply among viruses. RNA viruses mutate faster than DNA viruses, single-stranded viruses mutate faster than double-strand virus, and genome size appears to correlate negatively with mutation rate. Viral mutation rates are modulated at different levels, including polymerase fidelity, sequence context, template secondary structure, cellular microenvironment, replication mechanisms, proofreading, and access to post-replicative repair. Additionally, massive numbers of mutations can be introduced by some virus-encoded diversity-generating elements, as well as by host-encoded cytidine/adenine deaminases. Our current knowledge of viral mutation rates indicates that viral genetic diversity is determined by multiple virus- and host-dependent processes, and that viral mutation rates can evolve in response to specific selective pressures.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.121312254,-0.072526158,-0.044066401,0.102524129,0.004706622,0.019423607,0.105130507,0.018727182,-0.054700031,0.0945715,0.042375804,-0.02545923,0.007917787,0.005791236,0.029512181,0.005896403,-0.040026593,-0.080251808,-0.066353232,0.041848246,0.031372924,-0.010010616,-0.05631625,0.102443912,-0.12727118,-0.036303168,0.062012236,-0.037572811,-0.076491951,-0.080664387
Microorganisms Causing Community-Acquired Acute Bronchitis: The Role of Bacterial Infection,"BACKGROUND: Although acute bronchitis is quite common, there is relatively limited information regarding the microorganisms that are involved in this illness. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of acute bronchitis at 31 hospitals and clinics in Korea from July 2011 to June 2012. Sputum specimens were collected for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture of microorganisms. RESULTS: Of the 811 enrolled patients, 291 had acceptable sputum specimens that were included for analysis of the etiologic distribution. With multiplex PCR testing, viruses were identified in 36.1% (105/291), most commonly rhinovirus (25.8%) and coronavirus (3.8%). Typical bacteria were isolated in 126/291 (43.3%) patients. Among these patients Haemophilus influenzae (n = 39) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 30) were isolated most commonly; atypical bacteria were identified in 44 (15.1%) patients. Bacteria-only, virus-only, and mixed infections (bacteria plus virus) accounted for 36.7% (98/291), 17.2% (50/291), and 18.9% (55/291) of infections, respectively. In particular, 52.4% of patients with viral infection had a concurrent bacterial infection, and rhinovirus was the most common virus in mixed infections (40/55). Additionally, infections with typical bacteria were more common in patients with chronic lung disease (p = 0.029), and typical bacterial infections showed a trend towards a higher prevalence with older age (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria were associated with almost half of community-acquired acute bronchitis cases.

Recombinase polymerase amplification assay for rapid detection of lumpy skin disease virus,"BACKGROUND: Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) is a Capripoxvirus infecting cattle and Buffalos. Lumpy skin disease (LSD) leads to significant economic losses due to hide damage, reduction of milk production, mastitis, infertility and mortalities (10 %). Early detection of the virus is crucial to start appropriate outbreak control measures. Veterinarians rely on the presence of the characteristic clinical signs of LSD. Laboratory diagnostics including virus isolation, sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are performed at well-equipped laboratories. In this study, a portable, simple, and rapid recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay for the detection of LSDV-genome for the use on farms was developed. RESULTS: The LSDV RPA assay was performed at 42 °C and detected down to 179 DNA copies/reaction in a maximum of 15 min. Unspecific amplification was observed with neither LSDV-negative samples (n = 12) nor nucleic acid preparations from orf virus, bovine papular stomatitis virus, cowpoxvirus, Peste des petits ruminants and Blue tongue virus (serotypes 1, 6 and 8). The clinical sensitivity of the LSDV RPA assay matched 100 % (n = 22) to real-time PCR results. In addition, the LSDV RPA assay detected sheep and goat poxviruses. CONCLUSION: The LSDV RPA assay is a rapid and sensitive test that could be implemented in field or at quarantine stations for the identification of LSDV infected case.

Deep Sequencing Analysis Reveals the Mycoviral Diversity of the Virome of an Avirulent Isolate of Rhizoctonia solani AG-2-2 IV,"Rhizoctonia solani represents an important plant pathogenic Basidiomycota species complex and the host of many different mycoviruses, as indicated by frequent detection of dsRNA elements in natural populations of the fungus. To date, eight different mycoviruses have been characterized in Rhizoctonia and some of them have been reported to modulate its virulence. DsRNA extracts of the avirulent R. solani isolate DC17 (AG2-2-IV) displayed a diverse pattern, indicating multiple infections with mycoviruses. Deep sequencing analysis of the dsRNA extract, converted to cDNA, revealed that this isolate harbors at least 17 different mycovirus species. Based on the alignment of the conserved RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) domain, this viral community included putative members of the families Narnaviridae, Endornaviridae, Partitiviridae and Megabirnaviridae as well as of the order Tymovirales. Furthermore, viruses, which could not be assigned to any existing family or order, but showed similarities to so far unassigned species like Sclerotinia sclerotiorum RNA virus L, Rhizoctonia solani dsRNA virus 1, Aspergillus foetidus slow virus 2 or Rhizoctonia fumigata virus 1, were identified. This is the first report of a fungal isolate infected by 17 different viral species and a valuable study case to explore the diversity of mycoviruses infecting R. solani.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.115095394,-0.043643412,-0.031622445,0.061291609,0.081955721,0.00763983,0.102644223,0.029526391,-0.061540332,0.055833945,0.020797441,-0.021727877,-0.016044625,-0.000348686,0.013071871,-0.014680289,0.005844584,-0.029761298,-0.00986099,0.01559072,-0.001332021,0.013011689,-0.028524195,-0.000973954,-0.033802139,-0.00407142,0.034156324,0.025821372,-0.018188633,0.035956144
Viral-bacterial coinfection affects the presentation and alters the prognosis of severe community-acquired pneumonia,"BACKGROUND: Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) enables recovery of viruses from airways of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), although their clinical impact remains uncertain. METHODS: Among consecutive adult patients who had undergone a mPCR within 72 hours following their admission to one intensive care unit (ICU), we retrospectively included those with a final diagnosis of CAP. Four etiology groups were clustered: bacterial, viral, mixed (viral-bacterial) and no etiology. A composite criterion of complicated course (hospital death or mechanical ventilation > 7 days) was used. A subgroup analysis compared patients with bacterial and viral-bacterial CAP matched on the bacterial pathogens. RESULTS: Among 174 patients (132 men [76 %], age 63 [53–75] years, SAPSII 38 [27;55], median PSI score 106 [78;130]), bacterial, viral, mixed and no etiology groups gathered 46 (26 %), 53 (31 %), 45 (26 %) and 30 (17 %) patients, respectively. Virus-infected patients displayed a high creatine kinase serum level, a low platelet count, and a trend toward more frequent alveolar-interstitial infiltrates. A complicated course was more frequent in the mixed group (31/45, 69 %), as compared to bacterial (18/46, 39 %), viral (15/53, 28 %) and no etiology (12/30, 40 %) groups (p < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, the mixed (viral-bacterial) infection was independently associated with complicated course (reference: bacterial pneumonia; OR, 3.58; CI 95 %, 1.16–11; p = 0.03). The subgroup analysis of bacteria-matched patients confirmed these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Viral-bacterial coinfection during severe CAP in adults is associated with an impaired presentation and a complicated course.

Detection and phylogenetic analysis of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in central China based on the ORF3 gene and the S1 gene,"BACKGROUND: Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) has increased in severity in China since 2010. To investigate further the infectivity, genetic diversity and molecular epidemiology of its causative agent, the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), we assessed 129 clinical samples, which were the intestinal tissue of piglets with severe diarrhea, from 17 cities in central China. Both the spike (S) glycoprotein (S1, 1–789 amino acids (aa)) and the full-length ORF3 gene of 21 representative field strains from 21 farms in 11 cities were sequenced and analysed. METHODS: PEDV was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and S1 and ORF3 sequences were processed by the Clustal W method via DNAMAN 8 software, and phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method using MEGA 6 software. RESULTS: The prevalence of PEDV was 92.25% and was detected in 119 of 129 samples, with 94.03% (63 of 67) of pig farms harbouring the disease. According to the phylogenetic analysis of the S1 genes, our isolates all fell into group G2 (variants) and showed a close relationship to isolates from Chinese (HN1303, CH/ZMDZY/11 and AJ1102), Korean (AD01), American (MN, IA1, IA2 and 13–019349) sources, and these isolates differed genetically from other Chinese (LZC, CH/HNZZ/2011 and SD-M) and Korean (SM98) strains as well Japanese (83-P5 and MK) strains. In addition, our isolates differed from attenuated vaccine strains, CV777 (used in China) and DR13 (used in Korea). According to our derived amino acid sequence analysis, we detected one novel variant PEDV, viz: CH/HNLY, with 4-aa insertion/deletion (RSSS/T) at position 375 and 1-aa (D) deletion at position 430 compared to the CV777 attenuated strain. These mutations were located on the receptor binding domain. Our ORF3 gene analyses showed that the prevalent PEDV isolates were variants, and the isolated strains differed genetically from the vaccine strains. CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrated the existence of genetic diversity among geographically distinct PEDV strains, and our study has provided an impetus to conduct further research on the PEDV receptor binding protein and on the new and efficacious vaccines design.

Interferon α Induces the Apoptosis of Cervical Cancer HeLa Cells by Activating both the Intrinsic Mitochondrial Pathway and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Induced Pathway,"The interferon α (IFN-α) has been often used as a sensitizing agent for the treatment of various malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma, malignant melanoma, and renal cell cancer by promoting the apoptosis of thesetumor cell types. However, the effect of IFN-α on cervical cancer remains unknown. In this study, HeLa cells were used as a testing model for the treatment of IFN-α on cervical cancer. The results indicate that IFN-α markedly inhibits the proliferation and induces the apoptosis of HeLa cells. The activation of caspase 3, the up-regulation of both Bim and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1, the down-regulation of Bcl-xL, as well as the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria were significantly induced upon IFN-α treatment, indicating that the intrinsic apoptotic pathway could be activated by IFN-α treatment. In addition, caspase 4—which is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis—was activated in response to IFN-α treatment. Knocking down caspase 4 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) markedly reduced the IFN-α-mediated cell apoptosis. However, no significant changes in the expressions of caspases 8 and 10 were observed upon IFN-α treatment, indicating that the apoptosis caused by IFN-α might be independent of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. These findings suggest that IFN-α may possess anti-cervical cancer capacity by activating cell apoptosis via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and caspase-4-related ER stress-induced pathway.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.081237901,-0.036409536,-0.016413633,-0.139911808,-0.130800894,0.081101892,0.057591015,-0.033364166,0.07763913,-0.032033104,-0.03371573,-0.037068739,-0.024384633,0.102768724,-0.01161728,0.047184214,-0.013808654,-0.021753157,0.00955435,-0.012439034,0.035816352,-0.021037764,0.014118567,-0.011868822,0.029927269,-0.005531291,-0.026319477,0.048767263,0.006766411,-0.088700961
Viral Agents Causing Acute Respiratory Infections in Children under Five: A Study from Eastern India,"Background. Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are important cause of mortality and morbidity in children under five in developing country. Methods. This observational study was conducted over two-year period in a tertiary care teaching hospital of Eastern India. Nasal and throat swabs were collected, transported to the laboratory at 2–8°C in viral transport media, and then processed for detection of viruses using mono/multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results. A total of 300 children aged 2–60 months with ARIs were included. The most common age group affected with LRI was 2–12 mo and with URI was >12–60 mo. Viruses were detected in 248 cases. In URI, 77 were positive for single virus and 19 were positive for more than one virus; in LRI, 113 were positive for single virus and 12 were positive for more than one virus. The most common viruses isolated from URI cases were rhinovirus and adenovirus. The most common viruses isolated from LRI cases were respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus. Most cases occurred in the months of January, December, and August. Conclusion. Viruses constitute a significant cause of ARI in children under five. RSV, ADV, RV, and IFV were the most prevalent viruses isolated.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.232502718,-0.126506382,-0.070850807,0.095732439,0.074811831,-0.050835486,0.025514269,-0.039600148,0.034123635,0.01090638,0.037909645,-0.058392152,-0.032336756,-0.040738407,0.061994017,-0.014756468,0.003511007,-0.073661413,0.052875129,-0.009324158,-0.042797569,0.060821665,-0.04362786,0.032494595,-0.023449942,0.074425906,0.058480839,0.070369523,-0.045614173,-0.070553667
Assay optimization for molecular detection of Zika virus,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the diagnostic performance of real-time reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for Zika virus detection. METHODS: We compared seven published real-time RT–PCR assays and two new assays that we have developed. To determine the analytical sensitivity of each assay, we constructed a synthetic universal control ribonucleic acid (uncRNA) containing all of the assays’ target regions on one RNA strand and spiked human blood or urine with known quantities of African or Asian Zika virus strains. Viral loads in 33 samples from Zika virus-infected patients were determined by using one of the new assays. FINDINGS: Oligonucleotides of the published real-time RT–PCR assays, showed up to 10 potential mismatches with the Asian lineage causing the current outbreak, compared with 0 to 4 mismatches for the new assays. The 95% lower detection limit of the seven most sensitive assays ranged from 2.1 to 12.1 uncRNA copies/reaction. Two assays had lower sensitivities of 17.0 and 1373.3 uncRNA copies/reaction and showed a similar sensitivity when using spiked samples. The mean viral loads in samples from Zika virus-infected patients were 5 × 10(4) RNA copies/mL of blood and 2 × 10(4) RNA copies/mL of urine. CONCLUSION: We provide reagents and updated protocols for Zika virus detection suitable for the current outbreak strains. Some published assays might be unsuitable for Zika virus detection, due to the limited sensitivity and potential incompatibility with some strains. Viral concentrations in the clinical samples were close to the technical detection limit, suggesting that the use of insensitive assays will cause false-negative results.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.043963607,0.084749092,0.197083933,0.086995492,-0.026924952,-0.059583047,0.003446419,0.00965949,-0.039760131,0.012075515,-0.001713174,0.00065273,-0.005723672,0.06560061,0.011668648,-0.042185427,-0.005702252,0.000756991,0.045303625,-0.026898063,0.012748352,0.031721429,0.022496108,0.002602287,-0.051787498,-0.014768238,0.061272467,-0.046272619,-0.039264556,0.0479695
Single Fluorescence Channel-based Multiplex Detection of Avian Influenza Virus by Quantitative PCR with Intercalating Dye,"Since its invention in 1985 the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become a well-established method for amplification and detection of segments of double-stranded DNA. Incorporation of fluorogenic probe or DNA intercalating dyes (such as SYBR Green) into the PCR mixture allowed real-time reaction monitoring and extraction of quantitative information (qPCR). Probes with different excitation spectra enable multiplex qPCR of several DNA segments using multi-channel optical detection systems. Here we show multiplex qPCR using an economical EvaGreen-based system with single optical channel detection. Previously reported non quantitative multiplex real-time PCR techniques based on intercalating dyes were conducted once the PCR is completed by performing melting curve analysis (MCA). The technique presented in this paper is both qualitative and quantitative as it provides information about the presence of multiple DNA strands as well as the number of starting copies in the tested sample. Besides important internal control, multiplex qPCR also allows detecting concentrations of more than one DNA strand within the same sample. Detection of the avian influenza virus H7N9 by PCR is a well established method. Multiplex qPCR greatly enhances its specificity as it is capable of distinguishing both haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes as well as their ratio.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.032769836,0.042472157,0.232443963,0.080213226,-0.050252777,0.018578698,0.017374996,-0.000500606,-0.030918335,0.019312849,-0.041207495,-0.02841023,0.054483443,-0.028184099,0.023221511,0.01168638,-0.016628239,-0.074610472,-0.016812392,-0.120380932,-0.031701353,0.004747404,0.053475776,-0.052700185,-0.074035262,-0.066033289,-0.047864674,0.01840746,-0.000101052,0.030483583
Epidemiology and clinical characteristics of respiratory syncytial virus infections among children and adults in Mexico,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading etiological agent of acute respiratory tract infections and hospitalizations in children. However, little information is available regarding RSV infections in Latin American countries, particularly among adult patients. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of RSV infection and to analyze the factors associated with severe infections in children and adults in Mexico. METHODS: Patients ≥1 month old, who presented with an influenza‐like illness (ILI) to six hospitals in Mexico, were eligible for participation in the study. Multiplex reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction identified viral pathogens in nasal swabs from 5629 episodes of ILI. Patients in whom RSV was detected were included in this report. RESULTS: Respiratory syncytial virus was detected in 399 children and 171 adults. RSV A was detected in 413 cases and RSV B in 163, including six patients who had coinfection with both subtypes; 414 (72.6%) patients required hospital admission, including 96 (16.8%) patients that required admission to the intensive care unit. Coinfection with one or more respiratory pathogens other than RSV was detected in 159 cases. Young age (in children) and older age (in adults) as well as the presence of some underlying conditions were associated with more severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that RSV is an important respiratory pathogen in children in Mexico. In addition, a substantial number of cases in adults were also detected highlighting the relevance of this virus in all ages. It is important to identify subjects at high risk of complications who may benefit from current or future preventive interventions.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.343123121,-0.153961183,-0.170711677,0.064306969,0.017440731,-0.11594038,0.005381224,-0.077657085,0.077899834,-0.035037901,0.008474735,-0.082944676,-0.11783513,-0.050970441,-0.082163583,-0.019366774,-0.028705177,0.06980655,-0.00885253,0.035257282,0.006993676,-0.106096657,-0.002790433,-0.054084933,0.102857504,-0.118769971,0.197532217,0.134929217,-0.032446434,0.068972533
Viral factors in influenza pandemic risk assessment,"The threat of an influenza A virus pandemic stems from continual virus spillovers from reservoir species, a tiny fraction of which spark sustained transmission in humans. To date, no pandemic emergence of a new influenza strain has been preceded by detection of a closely related precursor in an animal or human. Nonetheless, influenza surveillance efforts are expanding, prompting a need for tools to assess the pandemic risk posed by a detected virus. The goal would be to use genetic sequence and/or biological assays of viral traits to identify those non-human influenza viruses with the greatest risk of evolving into pandemic threats, and/or to understand drivers of such evolution, to prioritize pandemic prevention or response measures. We describe such efforts, identify progress and ongoing challenges, and discuss three specific traits of influenza viruses (hemagglutinin receptor binding specificity, hemagglutinin pH of activation, and polymerase complex efficiency) that contribute to pandemic risk.

Mutational dynamics of the SARS coronavirus in cell culture and human populations isolated in 2003,"BACKGROUND: The SARS coronavirus is the etiologic agent for the epidemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. The recent emergence of this new pathogen, the careful tracing of its transmission patterns, and the ability to propagate in culture allows the exploration of the mutational dynamics of the SARS-CoV in human populations. METHODS: We sequenced complete SARS-CoV genomes taken from primary human tissues (SIN3408, SIN3725V, SIN3765V), cultured isolates (SIN848, SIN846, SIN842, SIN845, SIN847, SIN849, SIN850, SIN852, SIN3408L), and five consecutive Vero cell passages (SIN2774_P1, SIN2774_P2, SIN2774_P3, SIN2774_P4, SIN2774_P5) arising from SIN2774 isolate. These represented individual patient samples, serial in vitro passages in cell culture, and paired human and cell culture isolates. Employing a refined mutation filtering scheme and constant mutation rate model, the mutation rates were estimated and the possible date of emergence was calculated. Phylogenetic analysis was used to uncover molecular relationships between the isolates. RESULTS: Close examination of whole genome sequence of 54 SARS-CoV isolates identified before 14(th )October 2003, including 22 from patients in Singapore, revealed the mutations engendered during human-to-Vero and Vero-to-human transmission as well as in multiple Vero cell passages in order to refine our analysis of human-to-human transmission. Though co-infection by different quasipecies in individual tissue samples is observed, the in vitro mutation rate of the SARS-CoV in Vero cell passage is negligible. The in vivo mutation rate, however, is consistent with estimates of other RNA viruses at approximately 5.7 × 10(-6 )nucleotide substitutions per site per day (0.17 mutations per genome per day), or two mutations per human passage (adjusted R-square = 0.4014). Using the immediate Hotel M contact isolates as roots, we observed that the SARS epidemic has generated four major genetic groups that are geographically associated: two Singapore isolates, one Taiwan isolate, and one North China isolate which appears most closely related to the putative SARS-CoV isolated from a palm civet. Non-synonymous mutations are centered in non-essential ORFs especially in structural and antigenic genes such as the S and M proteins, but these mutations did not distinguish the geographical groupings. However, no non-synonymous mutations were found in the 3CLpro and the polymerase genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the SARS-CoV is well adapted to growth in culture and did not appear to undergo specific selection in human populations. We further assessed that the putative origin of the SARS epidemic was in late October 2002 which is consistent with a recent estimate using cases from China. The greater sequence divergence in the structural and antigenic proteins and consistent deletions in the 3' – most portion of the viral genome suggest that certain selection pressures are interacting with the functional nature of these validated and putative ORFs.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.049172738,0.282541568,-0.177504716,-0.01147851,0.054897791,0.049706277,-0.033694478,-0.157755424,-0.01454779,0.04059732,-0.027927323,9.83E-05,0.013590433,-0.046182275,0.042692405,-0.045762682,-0.051491626,-0.008880732,-0.043013148,0.034357939,0.057737019,0.00672202,0.029728243,0.091523955,-0.114298383,0.008317518,0.01202464,0.043523063,-0.067343486,-0.057753098
Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP): Emergence As an Alternative Technology for Herbal Medicine Identification,"Correct identification of medicinal plant ingredients is essential for their safe use and for the regulation of herbal drug supply chain. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a recently developed approach to identify herbal medicine species. This novel molecular biology technique enables timely and accurate testing, especially in settings where infrastructures to support polymerase chain reaction facilities are lacking.

In this review, we give an introduction into LAMP analysis, covers the basic principles and important aspects in the development of LAMP analysis method. Then we presented a critical review of the application of LAMP-based methods in detecting and identifying raw medicinal plant materials and their processed products. We also provide a practical standard operating procedure (SOP) for the utilization of the LAMP protocol in herbal authentication, and consider the prospects of LAMP technology in the future developments of herbal medicine identification and the challenges associated with its application.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.026324941,0.04600298,0.178155653,0.026529306,-0.076500844,-0.006718825,0.065229664,0.007838949,-0.003472322,-0.014239,-0.087735636,0.029564355,0.016805592,-0.049163836,-0.085594961,0.073956608,0.004187935,0.088898438,-0.192519345,0.013173166,-0.142203477,-0.086643838,-0.099486947,0.184984672,0.130840157,-0.004327138,-0.12705205,0.114083146,-0.068914787,-0.011857816
"Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Assay—A Simple, Fast and Cost-Effective Alternative to Real Time PCR for Specific Detection of Feline Herpesvirus-1","Feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), an enveloped dsDNA virus, is one of the major pathogens of feline upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) and ocular disease. Currently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) remains the gold standard diagnostic tool for FHV-1 infection but is relatively expensive, requires well-equipped laboratories and is not suitable for field tests. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), an isothermal gene amplification technology, has been explored for the molecular diagnosis of infectious diseases. In this study, an exo-RPA assay for FHV-1 detection was developed and validated. Primers targeting specifically the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of FHV-1 were designed. The RPA reaction was performed successfully at 39°C and the results were obtained within 20 min. Using different copy numbers of recombinant plasmid DNA that contains the TK gene as template, we showed the detection limit of exo-RPA was 10(2) copies DNA/reaction, the same as that of real time PCR. The exo-RPA assay did not cross-detect feline panleukopenia virus, feline calicivirus, bovine herpesvirus-1, pseudorabies virus or chlamydia psittaci, a panel of pathogens important in feline URTD or other viruses in Alphaherpesvirinae, demonstrating high specificity. The assay was validated by testing 120 nasal and ocular conjunctival swabs of cats, and the results were compared with those obtained with real-time PCR. Both assays provided the same testing results in the clinical samples. Compared with real time PCR, the exo-RPA assay uses less-complex equipment that is portable and the reaction is completed much faster. Additionally, commercial RPA reagents in vacuum-sealed pouches can tolerate temperatures up to room temperature for days without loss of activity, suitable for shipment and storage for field tests. Taken together, the exo-RPA assay is a simple, fast and cost-effective alternative to real time PCR, suitable for use in less advanced laboratories and for field detection of FHV-1 infection.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.045026745,0.090780324,0.299336919,0.031347989,-0.069716241,-0.055585448,0.046816129,0.029950834,-0.01114322,-0.084184081,0.020849052,-0.012779796,0.049436294,-0.080591395,-0.106476573,0.074930284,-0.056418397,-0.101118202,0.213603197,0.250577524,0.118501413,-0.01849219,0.044361897,-0.112296964,-0.125044541,0.071952122,0.04811501,0.015301094,0.080233843,-0.03787627
Pseudorabies virus infection (Aujeszky’s disease) in an Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) in Spain: a case report,"BACKGROUND: The only natural hosts of Pseudorabies virus (PRV) are members of the family Suidae (Sus scrofa scrofa). In species other than suids infection is normally fatal. In these mammals, including carnivores, PRV typically causes serious neurologic disease. The endangered Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is a wild feline endemic to south-western Europe (Iberian Peninsula). The Iberian lynx was found to be the world’s most endangered felid species in 2002. In wild felines, PRV infection has only been previously reported once in a Florida panther in 1994. No seropositive lynxes have ever been found, nor has PRV been detected in dead Iberian lynxes to date. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the first reported case of pseudorabies in an Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus). Pseudorabies was diagnosed in a young wild Iberian lynx from Extremadura (SW Spain) by histopathological examination, immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequence analysis. Gross lesions included alopecia of the ventral neck, bloody gastro-intestinal contents and congestion of the brain. Histopathological analysis showed a moderate nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis with diffuse areas of demyelination, necrotizing gastritis and enteritis of the small intestine. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) antigen was found in neuronal and non-neuronal cells of the brain, tonsils, and gastric glandular epithelial cells by immunohistochemical analysis. The presence of the virus in the brain was confirmed by nested PCR. The sequence analysis of the 146 bp fragment (from the viral glycoprotein B gene) showed that the amplified sequence matched (with 100% identity) the PRV genome. Furthermore, specific DNA from glycoprotein D and E encoding-genes was detected by conventional and real-time PCR, respectively, confirming the latter that this infection was produced by a wild-type PRV strain. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the suspicion that PRV could infect the Iberian lynx. The detection of PRV in a dead Iberian lynx suggests that the virus may have a negative impact on the survival of endangered lynxes in the wild. However, because this is the first verified instance of lynx mortality resulting from pseudorabies, its true impact on the population is unknown.

One-Pot Reverse Transcriptional Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) for Detecting MERS-CoV,"Due to the limitation of rapid development of specific antiviral drug or vaccine for novel emerging viruses, an accurate and rapid diagnosis is a key to manage the virus spread. We developed an efficient and rapid method with high specificity for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), based on one-pot reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (one-pot RT-LAMP). A set of six LAMP primers [F3, B3, FIP, BIP, LF (Loop-F), and LB (Loop-B)] were designed using the sequence of nucleocapsid (N) gene with optimized RT-LAMP enzyme conditions: 100 U M-MLV RTase and 4 U Bst polymerase, implying that the reaction was able to detect four infectious viral genome copies of MERS-CoV within a 60 min reaction time period. Significantly, EvaGreen dye has better signal read-out properties in one-pot RT-LAMP reaction and is more compatible with DNA polymerase than SYBR green I. Isothermally amplified specific N genes were further evaluated using field-deployable microchamber devices, leading to the specific identification of as few as 0.4 infectious viral genome copies, with no cross-reaction to the other acute respiratory disease viruses, including influenza type A (H1N1 and H3N2), type B, human coronavirus 229E, and human metapneumovirus. This sensitive, specific and feasible method provides a large-scale technical support in emergencies, and is also applied as a sample-to-detection module in Point of Care Testing devices.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.039687467,0.195794456,0.219145465,0.180892659,-0.030808811,-0.007394317,-0.019477886,0.111487403,0.133427723,-0.025268047,-0.036734703,0.007302095,0.053127096,0.015186938,-0.09418608,0.015820882,0.021474097,0.041507035,-0.152553916,0.07129627,-0.109045873,-0.068462323,-0.069245264,0.252768286,0.086291399,-0.015278557,-0.107814293,0.103783623,-0.071887433,-0.004756813
Single- and multiple viral respiratory infections in children: disease and management cannot be related to a specific pathogen,"BACKGROUND: The number of viral pathogens associated with pediatric acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) has grown since the introduction of reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Multiple viruses are detected during a single ARI episode in approximately a quarter of all cases. The clinical relevance of these multiple detections is unclear, as is the role of the individual virus. We therefore investigated the correlation between clinical data and RT-PCR results in children with single- and multiple viral ARI. METHODS: Data from children with ARI were prospectively collected during two winter seasons. RT-PCR testing for 15 viruses was performed in 560 ARI episodes. In the patients with a single-viral etiology, clinical data, laboratory findings, patient management- and outcome data were compared between the different viruses. With this information, we compared data from children of whom RT-PCR data were negative, with children with single- and multiple viral positive results. RESULTS: The viral detection rate was 457/560 (81.6%) of which 331/560 (59.1%) were single infections and 126/560 (22.5%) were multiple infections. In single viral infections, some statistically significant differences in demographics, clinical findings, disease severity and outcome were found between children with different viral etiologies. However, no clinically recognizable pattern was established to be virus-specific. In a multivariate analysis, the only variables that were correlated with longer hospital stay were the use of oxygen and nebulizer therapy, irrespective of the viral pathogen. Children with RT-PCR positive test results had a significant higher disease severity, fever, length of hospital stay, days of extra oxygen supply, and days of antibiotic treatment than children with a negative RT-PCR test result. For children with single- versus children with multiple positive RT-PCR test results, these differences were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Disease (severity), management and outcome in pediatric ARI are not associated with a specific virus. Single- and multiple viral ARI do not significantly differ with regard to clinical outcome and patient management. For general pediatrics, RT-PCR assays should be restricted to pathogens for which therapy is available or otherwise may have clinical consequences. Further research with an extended panel of RT-PCR assays and a larger number of inclusions is necessary to further validate our findings.

Preparation of MS2 Phage-Like Particles and Their Use As Potential Process Control Viruses for Detection and Quantification of Enteric RNA Viruses in Different Matrices,"The detection and quantification of enteric RNA viruses is based on isolation of viral RNA from the sample followed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). To control the whole process of analysis and in order to guarantee the validity and reliability of results, process control viruses (PCV) are used. The present article describes the process of preparation and use of such PCV– MS2 phage-like particles (MS2 PLP) – in RT-qPCR detection and quantification of enteric RNA viruses. The MS2 PLP were derived from bacteriophage MS2 carrying a unique and specific de novo-constructed RNA target sequence originating from the DNA of two extinct species. The amount of prepared MS2 particles was quantified using four independent methods – UV spectrophotometry, fluorimetry, transmission electron microscopy and a specifically developed duplex RT-qPCR. To evaluate the usefulness of MS2 PLP in routine diagnostics different matrices known to harbor enteric RNA viruses (swab samples, liver tissue, serum, feces, and vegetables) were artificially contaminated with specific amounts of MS2 PLP. The extraction efficiencies were calculated for each individual matrix. The prepared particles fulfill all requirements for PCV – they are very stable, non-infectious, and are genetically distinct from the target RNA viruses. Due to these properties they represent a good morphological and physiochemical model. The use of MS2 PLP as a PCV in detection and quantification of enteric RNA viruses was evaluated in different types of matrices.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.072258752,0.002067065,0.084301683,0.057751672,0.005185536,-0.031316954,0.029897748,0.02739371,-0.041754602,0.013768624,0.024303311,-0.010135094,-0.000304666,0.01166877,0.036127418,0.008584589,-0.02170671,-0.013052643,-0.00353313,-0.046777113,-0.035308024,0.014942963,-0.021708324,0.021542485,-0.035070627,-0.027984152,-0.002796968,-0.002995117,-0.014220885,-0.015585708
"Comparing Human Metapneumovirus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus: Viral Co-Detections, Genotypes and Risk Factors for Severe Disease","BACKGROUND: It is unclarified as to whether viral co-detection and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) genotypes relate to clinical manifestations in children with HMPV and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), and if the clinical course and risk factors for severe LRTI differ between HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). METHODS: We prospectively enrolled hospitalized children aged <16 years with LRTI from 2006 to 2015. Children were clinically examined, and nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed using semi-quantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction tests for HMPV, RSV and 17 other pathogens. HMPV-positive samples were genotyped. RESULTS: A total of 171 children had HMPV infection. HMPV-infected children with single virus (n = 106) and co-detections (n = 65) had similar clinical manifestations. No clinical differences were found between HMPV genotypes A (n = 67) and B (n = 80). The HMPV-infected children were older (median 17.2 months) than RSV-infected children (median 7.3 months, n = 859). Among single virus-infected children, no differences in age-adjusted LRTI diagnoses were found between HMPV and RSV. Age was an important factor for disease severity among single virus-infected children, where children <6 months old with HMPV had a milder disease than those with RSV, while in children 12–23 months old, the pattern was the opposite. In multivariable logistic regression analysis for each virus type, age ≥12 months (HMPV), and age <6 months (RSV), prematurity, ≥1 chronic disease and high viral loads of RSV, but not high HMPV viral loads, were risk factors for severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalized children with LRTI, HMPV manifests independently of viral co-detections and HMPV genotypes. Disease severity in HMPV- and RSV-infected children varies in relation to age. A history of prematurity and chronic disease increases the risk of severe LRTI among HMPV- and RSV-infected children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.228492565,-0.166764551,-0.090634202,0.066365094,0.049746394,-0.200071985,0.104776967,-0.219382467,0.273566102,-0.136553751,0.057447763,-0.115663639,-0.20939906,-0.048992734,-0.172864008,-0.021998508,-0.086789493,0.287501117,-0.203331039,0.070675191,0.118814985,0.109932866,0.04168013,-0.141404771,-0.095410854,-0.032155698,-0.10232377,-0.136309643,-0.017542247,0.057367189
A Novel Mechanism Underlying the Innate Immune Response Induction upon Viral-Dependent Replication of Host Cell mRNA: A Mistake of +sRNA Viruses' Replicases,"Viruses are lifeless particles designed for setting virus-host interactome assuring a new generation of virions for dissemination. This interactome generates a pressure on host organisms evolving mechanisms to neutralize viral infection, which places the pressure back onto virus, a process known as virus-host cell co-evolution. Positive-single stranded RNA (+sRNA) viruses are an important group of viral agents illustrating this interesting phenomenon. During replication, their genomic +sRNA is employed as template for translation of viral proteins; among them the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is responsible of viral genome replication originating double-strand RNA molecules (dsRNA) as intermediates, which accumulate representing a potent threat for cellular dsRNA receptors to initiate an antiviral response. A common feature shared by these viruses is their ability to rearrange cellular membranes to serve as platforms for genome replication and assembly of new virions, supporting replication efficiency increase by concentrating critical factors and protecting the viral genome from host anti-viral systems. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding cellular dsRNA receptors and describes prototype viruses developing replication niches inside rearranged membranes. However, for several viral agents it's been observed both, a complex rearrangement of cellular membranes and a strong innate immune antiviral response induction. So, we have included recent data explaining the mechanism by, even though viruses have evolved elegant hideouts, host cells are still able to develop dsRNA receptors-dependent antiviral response.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.187832387,-0.086121673,-0.105426786,0.144293443,-0.101235812,0.02103051,0.121176781,0.014820005,-0.003707689,0.112584242,0.040313469,-0.06779995,0.022513809,0.111350419,0.033524299,-0.009413566,-0.011740336,-0.03912419,-0.009087195,0.088207619,-0.044995712,0.094508896,-0.093784411,0.019715511,-0.041068969,-0.061808908,0.065077618,-0.0448566,-0.0475053,0.028311008
"Prevalence of avian infectious bronchitis virus in broiler chicken farms in south of Iraq, 2014 – 2015","Avian infectious bronchitis (IB), caused by a gammacoronavirus, is an OIE-listed (List B) disease and characterized by respiratory and renal involvements, causing high mortality, and economic loss in both layers and broilers. In comparison with other diagnostic methods, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and conventional RT-PCR are potent, more sensitive and faster techniques for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) detection. This research was conducted to detect IBV using specific primers of IB in three governorates (Basra, Thi-Qar and Muthana) in the south of Iraq. Tracheal specimens were collected from 46 IB suspected commercial broiler flocks. XCE2+ and XCE2- Primers, which amplify all IBV serotypes, were used. Primers MCE1+, BCE1+ and DCE1+ were used to amplify the specific nucleotide sequences of Massachusetts, 793/B and D274 genotypes, respectively. The results of real-time RT-PCR of this study showed that 34 (74.00%) out of 46 infected flocks were positive to IBV. The results of nested PCR showed that 50.00% and 5.89% of positive samples were belonged to genotypes 793/B and Massachusetts, respectively, and the remaining positive (44.11%) were unknown. The results indicate presence of Massachusetts and 793/B IBV strains in commercial broilers in southern Iraq.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.032669835,0.050624162,0.219537205,-0.055994228,0.165227195,0.033658033,-0.166402818,-0.082144727,0.09445438,0.323070745,0.107444679,0.031091701,-0.082319744,0.10480213,-0.125157274,0.135680883,0.04583449,0.020466766,0.036161763,-0.044644986,-0.051248451,0.029022049,-0.000378273,-0.065762672,0.017659278,0.026485578,-0.004896416,-0.015056725,0.065954478,-0.020127812
Clinical Features and Courses of Adenovirus Pneumonia in Healthy Young Adults during an Outbreak among Korean Military Personnel,"BACKGROUND: The number of pneumonia patients increased suddenly in Korean military hospitals in late December 2014, indicating the urgent need for an epidemic outbreak investigation. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of pneumonia etiology among immunocompetent young adults admitted to Daejeon Armed Forces hospital. Patient blood and sputum samples were subjected to conventional culture, serology, and polymerase chain reaction tests for respiratory viruses and atypical pathogens. RESULTS: From January to May 2015, we enrolled 191 (189 male) adults with pneumonia; the mean age was 20.1 ± 1.3 years. Five patients had severe pneumonia, and one died. Pathogenic human adenoviruses were most common (HAdV, 153/191 [80.1%]), indicating a HAdV pneumonia outbreak. Genotyping of 35 isolates indicated that 34 matched HAdV-55 and one matched HAdV-2. HAdV pneumonia infected recruit trainees most frequently. High and prolonged fever, nasal congestion, sore throat, and pharyngeal inflammation were significantly more common in the HAdV pneumonia group, compared to patients with other or unknown causes of pneumonia. Only 12% of HAdV pneumonia patients displayed leukocytosis, whereas febrile leukopenia (62.7%) and thrombocytopenia (41%) were commonly observed. HAdV pneumonia patient chest CT scans displayed ground glass opacity (with or without septal thickness) with consolidation in 50.0% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: An outbreak of HAdV respiratory infection occurred at the Korean military training center. HAdV pneumonia exhibited specific laboratory and clinical features, and although most patients were cured without complication, some progressed to respiratory failure and fatality.

In Vivo Persistence of Human Rhinoviruses in Immunosuppressed Patients,"Several species of the genus Enterovirus cause persistent infections in humans. Human rhinovirus (HRV) infections are generally self-limiting but occasionally persistent infections have been described. This study aimed to identify persistent HRV infections and investigate the clinical and virologic characteristics of patients with persistent infections. From January 2012 to March 2015, 3714 respiratory specimens from 2608 patients were tested for respiratory viruses by using a multiplex reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction. A retrospective study was performed. Patients with at least two specimens positive for HRV/enterovirus taken 45 days or longer apart were identified and the HRV/enteroviruses were typed. Patients with persistent infection were compared to patients with reinfection and patients with cleared infection. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral protein(VP)4/VP2 region was performed. 18 patients with persistent HRV/enterovirus infection were identified. Minimum median duration of persistence was 92 days (range 50–455 days). All but one patients with persistence were immunosuppressed. Immunosuppression and hematologic disorders were more frequent in patients with persistence (n = 18) than in patients with reinfection (n = 33) and with cleared infection (n = 25) (p = 0.003 and p = 0.001, respectively).

Rapid and sensitive real-time assay for the detection of respiratory syncytial virus using RT-SIBA®,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most common causes of respiratory tract infections among young children and the elderly. Timely and accurate diagnosis of respiratory tract infections improves patient care and minimizes unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics. We sought to develop a rapid nucleic acid tests for the detection of RSV within minutes, while retaining the high sensitivity achieved with RT-PCR. METHODS: We developed and evaluated a reverse transcription isothermal nucleic acid amplification method, reverse transcription strand invasion based amplification (RT-SIBA), for the rapid detection of RSV. RESULTS: The developed RT-SIBA assay showed good sensitivity by detecting as few as 10 copies of RSV RNA within 20 min compared with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, which took approximately 2 h. The performance of the RT-SIBA RSV assay was further investigated using nasopharyngeal swab specimens. The RT-SIBA assay had a sensitivity of 100% (25/25) and a specificity of 100% (15/15). CONCLUSION: RT-SIBA did not require highly purified RNA for the rapid detection of RSV and was therefore compatible with rapid specimen processing methods. This reduces the complexity of specimen preparation and further shortens the total amount of time needed to detect RSV in clinical specimens. The developed RT-SIBA assay for RSV could be a useful tool for prompt management of this infection",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.144204897,0.037272133,0.206961002,0.178643923,-0.03660961,-0.152963907,0.024254942,-0.065083688,0.09658197,-0.095208639,0.005326626,-0.048001006,-0.116634414,-0.013165052,-0.093522774,0.011371046,0.005984847,0.089549023,-0.036973119,0.016991435,-0.021926573,-0.135380317,0.003305907,-0.045363699,0.096812379,-0.11642141,0.199633738,0.100712908,-0.049685836,0.043941429
Polymerase cross-linking spiral reaction (PCLSR) for detection of African swine fever virus (ASFV) in pigs and wild boars,"The study reports the development of a polymerase cross-linking spiral reaction (PCLSR) for the detection of African swine fever virus (ASFV) DNA in blood collected from infected pigs and wild boars. The method uses 3 specifically designed primers. Two outer-spiral primers comprising of 3′ sequences complementary to ASFV p72 gene sequence and 5′end sequences complementary to exogenous gene of black widow alpha-latrotoxin as well as additional ASFV specific cross-linking primer. The method is specific exclusively to ASFV DNA without cross-reactions with cDNA of classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome (PRRSV) or porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The sensitivity of this technique reached 7.2 × 10(2) copies per μl(−1) of plasmid containing p72 gene. The PCLSR was conducted at 65 °C creating cross-linked complex structures. The results of PCLSR were visualized using SYBR Green I dye, gel electrophoresis while the reaction progress was traced using real-time PCR system that resulted in registration of fluorescent curves and melting peaks at 85.3 °C. The developed PCLSR was examined using blood or tissue samples collected from selected 17 ASF cases from infected wild boars and 3 outbreaks in pigs. Further tests have been also conducted using 55 tissue samples from 23 outbreaks and 22 cases. These results showed that PCLSR might be further used for preliminary and cost-effective detection and surveillance of ASFV.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.003676329,0.030045485,0.159206228,-0.021041902,0.033042876,0.001907074,-0.04059713,-0.011832991,0.002444139,-0.02857054,-0.00909704,0.002258878,-0.051055977,0.009389429,0.116797161,-0.079495314,-0.032480168,-0.027717899,0.006955198,0.047967834,-0.063327075,-0.005147412,0.055226493,-0.021202114,-0.021078079,0.007143635,-0.038705286,0.042867286,-0.028420782,0.027495629
Detection of viral respiratory pathogens in mild and severe acute respiratory infections in Singapore,"To investigate the performance of laboratory methods and clinical case definitions in detecting the viral pathogens for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) from a prospective community cohort and hospital inpatients, nasopharyngeal swabs from cohort members reporting ARIs (community-ARI) and inpatients admitted with ARIs (inpatient-ARI) were tested by Singleplex Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (SRT-PCR), multiplex RT-PCR (MRT-PCR) and pathogen-chip system (PathChip) between April 2012 and December 2013. Community-ARI and inpatient-ARI was also combined with mild and severe cases of influenza from a historical prospective study as mild-ARI and severe-ARI respectively to evaluate the performance of clinical case definitions. We analysed 130 community-ARI and 140 inpatient-ARI episodes (5 inpatient-ARI excluded because multiple pathogens were detected), involving 138 and 207 samples respectively. Detection by PCR declined with days post-onset for influenza virus; decrease was faster for community-ARI than for inpatient-ARI. No such patterns were observed for non-influenza respiratory virus infections. PathChip added substantially to viruses detected for community-ARI only. Clinical case definitions discriminated influenza from other mild-ARI but performed poorly for severe-ARI and for older participants. Rational strategies for diagnosis and surveillance of influenza and other respiratory virus must acknowledge the differences between ARIs presenting in community and hospital settings.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.141257642,-0.057918222,-0.003310577,0.06166658,-0.001236123,0.055216947,-0.030601417,-0.005166479,-0.00197178,-0.02691924,0.015246455,-0.001404636,0.016760249,-0.030833084,0.033901103,0.011603902,0.004255999,-0.066795026,0.020271166,-0.051097683,-0.047589407,0.011608128,-0.013973374,-0.007195591,0.047860111,0.029780165,0.008422666,0.006769096,0.054099837,-0.060989441
Prevalence and risk factors of chlamydia infection in Hong Kong: A population-based geospatial household survey and testing,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia causes infertility and increases risk of HIV infection, and population-based studies provide essential information for effective infection control and prevention. This study examined Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence and risk factors among a representative sample of 18-49-year-old residents in Hong Kong. METHODS: Census boundary map of 412 constituency areas was used as primary sampling units to construct the sampling frame and, residential buildings and units were randomly selected using geospatial modelling. A questionnaire on sexual practice and health was conducted, and polymerase chain reaction was used to test the urine for genital chlamydial infection. Invitation letters were sent to the selected households and a team of interviewers were sent to recruit one subject per household. Prevalence data was weighted according to the 2011 census and risk factors identified through logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 881 participants (response rate of 24.5%), the overall Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence was low at 1.4% (95%CI 0.8–2.5%) but sexually active young (18–26 years) women had relatively high prevalence (5.8%, 95%CI 1.7–18.2%) in Hong Kong. A unique U-shape disease burden was observed with peaks in younger and older (40–49 years) women. Amongst the sexually active women, the risk factors of Chlamydia trachomatis infection were: younger age (aOR = 25.4, 95% CI 2.81–230); living alone (aOR = 8.99, 95% CI 1.46–55.40); and, among all the sexually active participants, males (including the male partners of the female participants) who had travelled out of Hong Kong in the previous 12 months had higher risks of infection (aOR = 5.35; 95% CI 1.25–22.8). A core-peripheral geographical distribution of Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence was also observed. CONCLUSION: Young and older sexually active women in Hong Kong have high prevalence of chlamydia. Routine screening for sexually active women and young men should be considered. Further research on testing feasibility and linkage-to-care are urgently needed to control the infection.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.076700586,-0.049063847,-0.034200917,-0.088772796,-0.009346072,0.021172889,0.015050602,-0.004334328,-0.005765177,-0.076529739,0.024859768,0.05404603,-0.060722829,-0.079980473,-0.055731018,0.103081463,-0.069495699,-0.058610073,0.031557776,-0.03551668,-0.138069062,0.026281729,0.011861245,0.029265518,0.02456433,-0.041571437,0.008044491,-0.154436377,-0.050744201,-0.007177679
An in vivo system for directed experimental evolution of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus,"The calicivirus Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is widely used in Australia as a biocontrol agent to manage wild European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) populations. However, widespread herd immunity limits the effectiveness of the currently used strain, CAPM V-351. To overcome this, we developed an experimental platform for the selection and characterisation of novel RHDV strains. As RHDV does not replicate in cell culture, variant viruses were selected by serially passaging a highly virulent RHDV field isolate in immunologically naïve laboratory rabbits that were passively immunised 18–24 hours post-challenge with a neutralising monoclonal antibody. After seven passages, two amino acid substitutions in the P2 domain of the capsid protein became fixed within the virus population. Furthermore, a synonymous substitution within the coding sequence of the viral polymerase appeared and was also maintained in all subsequent passages. These findings demonstrate proof-of-concept that RHDV evolution can be experimentally manipulated to select for virus variants with altered phenotypes, in this case partial immune escape.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.07107973,-0.033163058,0.028336225,-0.054388717,0.024285577,0.069816777,-0.005561232,-0.019470488,0.016368883,0.034103019,-0.008715965,0.004229672,0.004174825,-0.062962177,0.034324436,-0.057096171,-0.013541245,-0.00777194,-0.036797723,0.030910383,0.044729847,-0.017247894,0.019800997,0.032927088,-0.004006612,0.033641597,0.044162414,-0.036250062,-0.082176731,0.011035298
Human metapnuemovirus infections in hospitalized children and comparison with other respiratory viruses. 2005-2014 prospective study,"BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) has an important etiological role in acute lower respiratory infections in children under five years. Our objectives were to estimate the relative contribution of HMPV to hospitalization in children with acute respiratory infection, to define the clinical and epidemiological features of HMPV single and multiple infections, and to compare HMPV infections with respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), rhinovirus (HRV), adenovirus and human bocavirus infections in the same population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective study performed on all children less than 14 years of age with a respiratory tract disease admitted to a secondary hospital between September 2005- June 2014. Clinical characteristics of patients were analyzed. Nasopharyngeal aspirate was taken at admission for viral study with polymerase chain reaction for 16 respiratory viruses. A total of 3,906 children were included. At least one respiratory virus was detected in 75.2% of them. The most common identified virus was HRSV, followed by HRV. HMPV was detected in 214 cases (5.5%); 133 (62%) were single infections and the remaining were detected in coinfection with other viruses. 90.7% cases were detected between February and May. Children’s mean age was 13.83 ± 18 months. Fever was frequent (69%), and bronchiolitis (27%), and recurrent wheezing (63%) were the main clinical diagnosis. Hypoxia was present in 65% of the patients and 47% of them had an infiltrate in X-ray. Only 6 (2.8%) children were admitted to the intensive care unit. Only the duration of the hospitalization was different, being longer in the coinfections group (p <0.05). There were many differences in seasonality and clinical characteristics between HMPV and other respiratory viruses being more similar to HRSV. CONCLUSIONS: HMPV infections accounted for 5.5% of total viral infections in hospitalized children. The clinical characteristics were similar to HRSV infections, but seasonality and clinical data were different from other viral infections.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.330619909,-0.167983764,-0.152485898,0.074873534,0.060145093,-0.20888961,0.10182548,-0.12098072,0.16769877,0.004354742,0.013447502,-0.087521465,-0.065401034,-0.019842403,-0.049778161,-0.054380883,-0.008343988,0.172113104,-0.086786852,0.089437354,0.110012493,0.05658458,-0.062913396,-0.01447224,-0.104892128,0.093779659,-0.207040572,-0.108110712,0.043159844,0.013431512
Evaluation of biosecurity measures to prevent indirect transmission of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus,"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of biosecurity methods to mitigate the transmission of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) via farm personnel or contaminated fomites is poorly understood. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of biosecurity procedures directed at minimizing transmission via personnel following different biosecurity protocols using a controlled experimental setting. RESULTS: PEDV RNA was detected from rectal swabs of experimentally infected (INF) and sentinel pigs by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Virus shedding in INF pigs peaked at 1 day post infection (dpi) and viral RNA levels remained elevated through 19 dpi. Sentinel pigs in the low biosecurity group (LB) became PEDV positive after the first movement of study personnel from the INF group. However, rectal swabs from pigs in the medium biosecurity (MB) and high biosecurity (HB) groups were negative during the 10 consecutive days of movements and remained negative through 24 days post movement (dpm) when the first trial was terminated. Viral RNA was detected at 1 dpm through 3 dpm from the personal protective equipment (PPE) of LB personnel. In addition, at 1 dpm, 2 hair/face swabs from MB personnel were positive; however, transmission of virus was not detected. All swabs of fomite from the HB study personnel were negative. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that indirect PEDV transmission through contaminated PPE occurs rapidly (within 24 h) under modeled conditions. Biosecurity procedures such as changing PPE, washing exposed skin areas, or taking a shower are recommended for pig production systems and appear to be an effective option for lowering the risk of PEDV transmission between groups of pigs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.002014049,-0.003938481,0.035057301,-0.080086478,0.02235009,0.03531945,-0.005866246,0.036491981,-0.013510639,-0.036002074,0.075741286,0.037417515,-0.143444499,0.051084222,0.220578315,-0.10495584,-0.044382319,0.008762494,-0.022287048,0.098299597,-0.179184273,-0.062353687,0.025277416,-0.078101894,-0.061461851,-0.020125371,-0.009332073,0.014156661,0.030839941,-0.029208747
The Functional Roles of the Cis-acting Elements in Bamboo mosaic virus RNA Genome,"Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV), which belongs to the genus Potexvirus in the family Alphaflexiviridae, has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome that is approximately 6400 nucleotides (nts) in length. Positive-sense RNA viruses can use genomic RNA as a template for translation and replication after entering a suitable host cell. Furthermore, such viral RNA is recognized by capsid protein for packaging and by viral movement protein(s) or the movement protein complex for cell-to-cell and systemic movement. Hence, viral RNA must contain signals for different functions to complete the viral infection cycle. In this review, we examine various cis-acting elements in the genome of BaMV. The highly structured 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the BaMV genomic RNA plays multiple roles in the BaMV infection cycle, including targeting chloroplasts for RNA replication, providing an initiation site for the synthesis of minus-strand RNA, signaling for polyadenylation, and directing viral long-distance movement. The nt at the extreme 3′ end and the structure of the 3′-terminus of minus-strand RNA are involved in the initiation of plus-strand genomic RNA synthesis. Both these regions have been mapped and reported to interact with the viral-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Moreover, the sequences upstream of open reading frames (ORFs) 2, 3, and 5 are involved in regulating subgenomic RNA synthesis. The cis-acting elements that were identified in BaMV RNA are discussed and compared with those of other potexviruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.282758962,-0.08462666,-0.105102177,0.162160464,-0.007192188,-0.164809181,-0.051758111,0.072796747,-0.059840939,0.013321769,0.050084854,-0.04472433,0.008955911,0.045630005,0.01114079,0.005151253,0.00484329,-0.007724584,0.014913377,0.014275514,-0.083548896,0.056667366,-0.104812619,-0.065298662,-0.074399561,-0.129313281,-0.031250846,0.008763393,0.042710258,0.051833529
Cross-sectional survey of selected enteric viruses in Polish turkey flocks between 2008 and 2011,"BACKGROUND: Enteric diseases are an important health problem for the intensive poultry industry, resulting in considerable economic losses. Apart from such microbiological agents associated with enteritis as bacteria and parasites, a lot of research has been recently conducted on viral origin of enteric diseases. However, enteric viruses have been identified in intestinal tract of not only diseased but also healthy poultry, so their role in enteritis is still unclear. The present study aimed at determination of the prevalence of four enteric viruses, namely astrovirus, coronavirus, parvovirus and rotavirus in meat-type turkey flocks in Poland as well as at statistical evaluation of the occurrence of the studied viruses and their relationships with the health status and the age of birds. Two hundred and seven flocks of birds aged 1-20 weeks originating from different regions of the country were investigated between 2008 and 2011. Clinical samples (10 individual faecal swabs/flock) were duly processed and examined using molecular methods targeting the conservative regions of viral genomes: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of astrovirus, non-structural 1 gene of parvovirus, non-structural protein 4 gene of rotavirus, and 5′ untranslated region fragment of turkey coronavirus. Different statistical methods (i.e. the independence chi-square test, the correspondence analysis and the logistic regression model) were used to establish any relationships between the analyzed data. RESULTS: Overall, 137 (66.2%, 95% CI: 59.3-72.6) of the 207 turkey flocks sampled were infected with one or more enteric viruses. Among the 137 flocks, 74 (54%, 95% CI: 45.3-62.6) were positive for one virus, whereas 54 (39.4%, 9 5% CI: 31.2-48.1) and 9 (6.6%, 95% CI: 3.1-12.1) were co-infected with two or three different enteric viruses, respectively. No flock was simultaneously infected with all four viruses studied. The prevalence of astrovirus infection was 44.9% (95% CI: 38.0-52.0), parvovirus 27.5% (95% CI: 21.6-34.2), rotavirus 18.8% (95% CI: 13.8-24.8), and coronavirus 9.7% (95% CI: 6.0-14.5). Young turkeys aged 1-4 weeks old had the highest (82.1%, 95% CI:71.7-89.8) prevalence of viral infection. Applied statistical methods have indicated the dependence of rotavirus infection as well as the co-infection with multiple viruses and the health status of turkeys. Furthermore, our results statistically confirm that especially young birds are susceptible to infection with rotavirus and astrovirus. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated the presence of astrovirus, coronavirus, parvovirus and rotavirus infections in Polish turkey farms. These viruses were detected in both healthy and diseased birds. However, the presented results provide valuable feedback which could help to evaluate the role of some enteric viruses in the etiology of enteritis in turkey.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.04412696,-0.056017754,-0.005459238,-0.06087582,0.091089696,0.014603817,0.004058417,-0.025589722,-0.035290891,-0.001481496,0.051028281,0.037552475,-0.048928569,-0.038695143,-0.038930972,0.055667531,-0.063806398,-0.11385451,0.070905551,-0.008227476,-0.122087423,0.120447957,-0.022986735,0.099906562,0.020649077,-0.088091167,-0.014869002,-0.234551619,-0.096607087,-0.044666091
"Stable Internal Reference Genes for Normalizing Real-Time Quantitative PCR in Baphicacanthus cusia under Hormonal Stimuli and UV Irradiation, and in Different Plant Organs","Baphicacanthus cusia (Nees) Bremek, the plant source for many kinds of drugs in traditional Chinese medicine, is widely distributed in South China, especially in Fujian. Recent studies about B. cusia mainly focus on its chemical composition and pharmacological effects, but further analysis of the plant's gene functions and expression is required to better understand the synthesis of its effective compounds. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a powerful method for gene expression analysis. It is necessary to select a suitable reference gene for expression normalization to ensure the accuracy of RT-qPCR results. Ten candidate reference genes were selected from the transcriptome datasets of B. cusia in this study, and the expression stability was assessed across 60 samples representing different tissues and organs under various conditions, including ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, hormonal stimuli (jasmonic acid methyl ester and abscisic acid), and in different plant organs. By employing different algorithms, such as geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper, which are complementary approaches based on different statistical procedures, 18S rRNA was found to be the most stable gene under UV irradiation and hormonal stimuli, whereas ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 was the best suitable gene for different plant organs. This novel study aimed to screen for suitable reference genes and corresponding primer pairs specifically designed for gene expression studies in B. cusia, in particular for RT-qPCR analyses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.075909907,0.026018213,0.122041906,-0.067578532,-0.001778081,0.034895584,-0.000580566,-0.038964592,0.037539625,-0.044092573,-0.097452171,-0.022742547,-0.010162951,0.050453095,-0.033546777,-0.033405074,-0.001056868,-0.025248679,-0.042606385,-0.066041361,0.017587318,0.004135878,-0.004836201,0.062280859,-0.070934938,-0.026684778,0.06596872,0.029453646,0.096268377,-0.018351221
Antiviral activity of phenanthrenes from the medicinal plant Bletilla striata against influenza A virus,"BACKGROUND: Influenza represents a serious public health concern. The emergence of resistance to anti-influenza drugs underlines the need to develop new drugs. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-influenza viral activity and possible mechanisms of 12 phenanthrenes from the medicinal plant Bletilla striata (Orchidaceae family). METHODS: Twelve phenanthrenes were isolated and identified from B. striata. Influenza virus A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2) propagated in embryonated chicken eggs was used. Phenanthrenes mixed with the virus were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then inoculated into 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs via the allantoic route to survey the antiviral activity in vivo. A (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H–tetrazolium) (MTS)-based assay was performed to evaluate the reduction of cytopathic effect induced by H3N2 on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The hemagglutination inhibition assay was used to study the blockage of virus receptors by the phenanthrenes, and the neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assay to evaluate the effects of the release of virus. The synthesis of influenza viral matrix protein mRNA in response to compound treatment was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: This study showed that phenanthrenes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12 significantly inhibited the viruses in vivo, with inhibition rates of 20.7, 79.3, 17.2, 34.5, 34.5, 34.5, 44.8, 75.9, and 34.5%, respectively. In MDCK models, the phenanthrenes did not show significant antiviral activity when administered as pretreatment, while phenanthrenes 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 10, and 11 exhibited inhibitory activities as simultaneous treatment with 50% inhibition concentration (IC(50)) ranging from 14.6 ± 2.4 to 43.3 ± 5.3 μM. The IC(50) ranged from 18.4 ± 3.1 to 42.3 ± 3.9 μM in the post-treatment assays. Compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, and 11 exhibited an inhibitory effect on NA; and compounds 2, 3, 4 6, 7, 10, and 11 resulted in the reduced transcription of virus matrix protein mRNA. However, no compound could inhibit hemagglutination by the influenza virus. CONCLUSION: Phenanthrenes from B. striata had strong anti-influenza viral activity in both embryonated eggs and MDCK models, and diphenanthrenes seemed to have stronger inhibition activity compared with monophenanthrenes.

Is Higher Viral Load in the Upper Respiratory Tract Associated With Severe Pneumonia? Findings From the PERCH Study,"BACKGROUND. The etiologic inference of identifying a pathogen in the upper respiratory tract (URT) of children with pneumonia is unclear. To determine if viral load could provide evidence of causality of pneumonia, we compared viral load in the URT of children with World Health Organization–defined severe and very severe pneumonia and age-matched community controls. METHODS. In the 9 developing country sites, nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs from children with and without pneumonia were tested using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for 17 viruses. The association of viral load with case status was evaluated using logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine optimal discriminatory viral load cutoffs. Viral load density distributions were plotted. RESULTS. The mean viral load was higher in cases than controls for 7 viruses. However, there was substantial overlap in viral load distribution of cases and controls for all viruses. ROC curves to determine the optimal viral load cutoff produced an area under the curve of <0.80 for all viruses, suggesting poor to fair discrimination between cases and controls. Fatal and very severe pneumonia cases did not have higher viral load than less severe cases for most viruses. CONCLUSIONS. Although we found higher viral loads among pneumonia cases than controls for some viruses, the utility in using viral load of URT specimens to define viral pneumonia was equivocal. Our analysis was limited by lack of a gold standard for viral pneumonia.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.136222472,-0.073055637,-0.087908474,-0.009799451,-0.051079975,-0.067404932,0.05095011,0.015349858,-0.063073865,0.059134559,-0.004702238,-0.051798973,-0.014880984,-0.033565638,-0.035710827,-0.014919652,-0.083929917,-0.018820808,-0.041934243,0.021493241,-0.119150033,0.212781463,-0.03195468,0.066050522,-0.073963433,0.02581274,0.085473263,-0.043954678,-0.050977467,0.031774903
Bocavirus Viremia and Hepatitis in an Immunocompetent Child,"BACKGROUND: So far, many studies have shown that Human Bocavirus ( HBoV) is the main pathogen of the respiratory tract. Until now, there is no study that proves the association between HBoV and hepatitis. HBoV viremia/DNAemia has been associated closely with acute primary infection and moderate-to-severe illness but, more detailed clinical data about HBoV dissemination are still unavailable. CASE REPORT: Here we report a 2-years-5-months-old girl suffering from respiratory distress and heptitis followed in our intensive care unit. HBoV was detected in our patients nose and throat swabs concurrent with whole blood sample by positive polymerase chain reactions. After a through investigation no causative agent other than HBoV viremia was found.

"Detection of Alphacoronavirus vRNA in the Feces of Brazilian Free-Tailed Bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) from a Colony in Florida, USA","Bats are natural reservoirs of coronaviruses and other viruses with zoonotic potential. Florida has indigenous non-migratory populations of Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) that mostly roost in colonies in artificial structures. Unlike their counterparts in Brazil and Mexico, the viruses harbored by the Florida bats have been underexplored. We report the detection of an alphacoronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene sequence in the feces of two of 19 different T. brasiliensis that were capture/release bats that had been evaluated for overall health. The RdRp sequence is similar but not identical to previously detected sequences in the feces of two different species of bats (T. brasiliensis and Molossus molossus) in Brazil. In common with the experience of others doing similar work, attempts to isolate the virus in cell cultures were unsuccessful. We surmise that this and highly related alphacoronavirus are carried by Brazilian free-tailed bats living in a wide eco-spatial region. As various coronaviruses (CoVs) that affect humans emerged from bats, our study raises the question whether CoVs such as the one detected in our work are yet-to-be-detected pathogens of humans and animals other than bats.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.099732083,0.03487687,-0.033278878,0.018784719,0.322457979,0.102782505,0.286953485,0.090756566,-0.164380452,-0.045304544,-0.089007551,-0.106464225,-0.075489634,0.038002368,-0.045541991,0.055533299,0.03245146,0.048231027,0.028126966,-0.032433165,-0.010226512,-0.037380856,0.039139913,-0.087070119,0.070465572,0.056833268,-0.013898743,0.018888344,0.032031635,0.015184591
Impact of viral multiplex real-time PCR on management of respiratory tract infection: a retrospective cohort study,"BACKGROUND: Significance and clinical utility of multiple virus detection by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) in respiratory tract infection remain unclear. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed how virus detection affected clinical management. During a 27-month period, clinical and laboratory information was collected from all children and adults in two Swiss tertiary centres whose respiratory samples were tested for respiratory viruses with a 16-plex rtPCR test. RESULTS: Pathogens were identified in 140 of 254 patients (55%); of those patients, there was ≥1 virus in 91 (65%), ≥ 1 bacterium in 53 (38%), and ≥1 virus and bacterium in 11 (8%). Of 80 patients with viral infection, 59 (74%) received antibiotics. Virus detection was associated with discontinuation of antibiotics in 2 of 20 adults (10%) and 6 of 14 children (43%). Overall 12 adults (34%) and 18 children (67%) were managed correctly without antibiotics after virus detection (p = 0.01). When taking biomarkers, radiologic presentations, and antibiotic pre-treatment into account, the impact of rtPCR and appropriateness of therapy for clinically viral infections increased to 100% in children and 62% in adults. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial reduction of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions seems possible. Appropriate application of rtPCR results in respiratory tract infections should be encouraged.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.233904437,-0.076815892,-0.038092031,0.019467814,-0.01819096,-0.095224444,0.017788305,0.000759193,-0.001306484,0.06711151,-0.013365083,-0.03214226,0.023506802,-0.007731837,0.005562429,-0.012201094,-0.006261735,-0.008099544,0.035372381,0.037972481,-0.003082258,-0.01041307,0.019052575,-0.015360419,-0.003067168,0.023781102,-0.010185238,-0.019912322,-0.007897296,0.005828019
"A cluster of adenovirus type B55 infection in a neurosurgical inpatient department of a general hospital in Guangdong, China","BACKGROUND: Human adenovirus type 55 is a re‐emerging human respiratory pathogen that is associated with several respiratory infections outbreaks in military and school populations. In this study, we describe the first HAdV55‐associated hospital outbreak documented in Guangdong, China. METHODS: Active surveillance was conducted in the involved neurosurgical inpatient department. All staff and patients in the involved neurosurgical department were surveyed for any symptoms of fever (≥38°C) and enlarged tonsils during the outbreak period. Throat swabs and demographic information were collected for all cases. For each specimen, assays for common respiratory viruses were performed using one‐step reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction. HAdV‐positive samples were inoculated onto Hep‐2 cells for isolation. Hexon genes, fiber genes, penton genes, and whole genomes were sequenced. A phylogenetic tree was constructed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Forty‐three cases, including 24 laboratory‐confirmed cases and 19 possible cases, were identified. Nurses had the highest attack rate of infection, with a rate of 36.4%. The attack rate for doctors and inpatients was 20.0% and 16.7%, respectively. HAdV55 was the sole pathogen identified during this outbreak. The hexon, fiber, and penton genes from seven isolated HAdV55 stains were sequenced. All these genes showed 100% homology and fell into the HAdV55 [P14H11F14] cluster, indicating that HAdV55 was the single viral strain for the outbreak. While not conclusive, the epidemic investigation revealed that the outbreak was introduced by nurses from sources outside the hospital. It was likely that a transmission from staff to inpatients had occurred.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.105185828,0.001380969,-0.045723715,-0.068536484,0.057977481,0.008359684,-0.020386132,0.033209154,-0.000109314,0.006332709,-0.026121169,0.02293842,-0.016327145,-0.028979672,0.046654674,-0.054452273,-0.05033107,-0.011506328,-0.020430659,-0.030097101,0.030530211,0.092414862,-0.10087472,0.018922356,-0.084173341,0.059395891,0.02721665,0.202835488,-0.07242209,-0.063071986
Infants hospitalized for Bordetella pertussis infection commonly have respiratory viral coinfections,"BACKGROUND: Whether viral coinfections cause more severe disease than Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) alone remains unclear. We compared clinical disease severity and sought clinical and demographic differences between infants with B. pertussis infection alone and those with respiratory viral coinfections. We also analyzed how respiratory infections were distributed during the 2 years study. METHODS: We enrolled 53 infants with pertussis younger than 180 days (median age 58 days, range 17–109 days, 64.1% boys), hospitalized in the Pediatric Departments at “Sapienza” University Rome and Bambino Gesù Children’s Hospital from August 2012 to November 2014. We tested in naso-pharyngeal washings B. pertussis and 14 respiratory viruses with real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Clinical data were obtained from hospital records and demographic characteristics collected using a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: 28/53 infants had B. pertussis alone and 25 viral coinfection: 10 human rhinovirus (9 alone and 1 in coinfection with parainfluenza virus), 3 human coronavirus, 2 respiratory syncytial virus. No differences were observed in clinical disease severity between infants with B. pertussis infection alone and those with coinfections. Infants with B. pertussis alone were younger than infants with coinfections, and less often breastfeed at admission. CONCLUSIONS: In this descriptive study, no associations between clinical severity and pertussis with or without co-infections were found.

Sensitivity and specificity of a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction detecting feline coronavirus mutations in effusion and serum/plasma of cats to diagnose feline infectious peritonitis,"BACKGROUND: Feline coronavirus (FCoV) exists as two pathotypes, and FCoV spike gene mutations are considered responsible for the pathotypic switch in feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) specifically designed to detect FCoV spike gene mutations at two nucleotide positions. It was hypothesized that this test would correctly discriminate feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). METHODS: The study included 63 cats with signs consistent with FIP. FIP was confirmed in 38 cats. Twenty-five control cats were definitively diagnosed with a disease other than FIP. Effusion and/or serum/plasma samples were examined by real-time RT-PCR targeting the two FCoV spike gene fusion peptide mutations M1058 L and S1060A using an allelic discrimination approach. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values including 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. RESULTS: FIPV was detected in the effusion of 25/59 cats, one of them being a control cat with chronic kidney disease. A mixed population of FIPV/FECV was detected in the effusion of 2/59 cats; all of them had FIP. RT-PCR was negative or the pathotype could not be determined in 34/59 effusion samples. In effusion, sensitivity was 68.6% (95% CI 50.7–83.2), specificity was 95.8% (95% CI 78.9–99.9). No serum/plasma samples were positive for FIPV. CONCLUSIONS: Although specificity of the test in effusions was high, one false positive result occurred. The use of serum/plasma cannot be recommended due to a low viral load in blood.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.036729996,0.0352121,0.141599933,-0.148316185,0.028229497,-0.000599929,-0.014481522,-0.010456553,-0.062689793,-0.191822634,0.391221294,-0.096161804,0.159427471,-0.02904616,-0.157511641,-0.007319966,0.024693988,-0.031153396,0.023183344,0.022617846,-0.111577929,0.034899254,0.071392847,0.080157673,-0.032652659,0.017034129,0.026206751,-0.116270446,-0.022946296,-0.037263556
Molecular characterization of a novel cryptic virus infecting pigeonpea plants,"A new member of the genus Deltapartitivirus was identified containing three dsRNAs with an estimated size of 1.71, 1.49 and 1.43 kb. The dsRNAs were extracted from symptomless pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millspaugh] plants cv. Erra Kandulu. This new virus with 4.64 kb genome was tentatively named Arhar cryptic virus-1 (ArCV-1). The genomic RNAs were amplified and characterized by sequence independent single primer amplification. The dsRNAs shared a highly conserved 16 nt 5’ non-coding region (5’-GATAATGATCCAAGGA-3’). The largest dsRNA (dsRNA-1) was identified as the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (replicase), predicted to encode a putative 55.34 kDa protein (P1). The two other smaller dsRNAs (dsRNA-2 and dsRNA-3) predicted to encode for putative capsid proteins of 38.50kDa (P2) and 38.51kDa (P3), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that ArCV-1 formed a clade together with Fragaria chiloensis cryptic virus, Rosa multiflora cryptic virus and Rose cryptic virus-1, indicating that ArCV-1 could be a new member of the genus Deltapartitivirus. ArCV-1 3D(pol) structure revealed several interesting features. The 3D(pol) in its full-length shares structural similarities with members of the family Caliciviridaeand family Picornaviridae. In addition, fourth dsRNA molecule (dsRNA-2A), not related to ArCV-1 genome, was found in the same plant tissue. The dsRNA-2A (1.6 kb) encodes a protein (P4), with a predicted size of 44.5 kDa. P4 shares similarity with coat protein genes of several cryptic viruses, in particular the bipartite cryptic viruses including Raphanus sativus cryptic virus-3. This is the first report of occurrence of a cryptic virus in pigeonpea plants.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.130258516,-0.053975876,-0.018510776,0.005512753,0.046282261,-0.020020603,-0.022363958,0.009701483,-0.013689969,-0.011947322,-0.035267399,-0.002097217,0.009271752,-0.046708537,-0.009241216,-0.040192155,0.042893356,-0.022190765,-0.001105446,0.020969203,-0.001960602,0.012587817,-0.051207947,0.01716466,-0.020559629,0.010934114,0.022206096,-0.00187466,-0.030119013,-0.019052476
Rapid and sensitive detection of canine distemper virus by real-time reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification,"BACKGROUND: Canine distemper, caused by Canine distemper virus (CDV), is a highly contagious and fatal systemic disease in free-living and captive carnivores worldwide. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), as an isothermal gene amplification technique, has been explored for the molecular detection of diverse pathogens. METHODS: A real-time reverse transcription RPA (RT-RPA) assay for the detection of canine distemper virus (CDV) using primers and exo probe targeting the CDV nucleocapsid protein gene was developed. A series of other viruses were tested by the RT-RPA.Thirty-two field samples were further tested by RT-RPA, and the resuts were compared with those obtained by the real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: The RT-RPA assay was performed successfully at 40 °C, and the results were obtained within 3 min–12 min. The assay could detect CDV, but did not show cross-detection of canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2), canine coronavirus (CCoV), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), pseudorabies virus (PRV) or Newcastle disease virus (NDV), demonstrating high specificity. The analytical sensitivity of RT-RPA was 31.8 copies in vitro transcribed CDV RNA, which is 10 times lower than the real-time RT-PCR. The assay performance was validated by testing 32 field samples and compared to real-time RT-PCR. The results indicated an excellent correlation between RT-RPA and a reference real-time RT-PCR method. Both assays provided the same results, and R(2) value of the positive results was 0.947. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that the RT-RPA assay offers an alternative tool for simple, rapid, and reliable detection of CDV both in the laboratory and point-of-care facility, especially in the resource-limited settings.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.058455137,0.15124115,0.4168586,0.118892209,-0.034275574,-0.097553109,0.001041829,0.023623786,-0.026506636,-0.124525937,-0.034719199,0.074477737,-0.100200874,0.017443406,-0.075436429,0.070226827,-0.020000539,-0.127473753,0.259986576,0.27254604,0.26538196,0.12401777,-0.09005972,-0.025410988,0.056666117,0.01108725,0.074310477,-0.016603859,0.07696384,0.007919831
Etiology of acute respiratory disease in fattening pigs in Finland,"BACKGROUND: The objective of our study was to clinically and etiologically investigate acute outbreaks of respiratory disease in Finland. Our study also aimed to evaluate the clinical use of various methods in diagnosing respiratory infections under field conditions and to describe the antimicrobial resistance profile of the main bacterial pathogen(s) found during the study. METHODS: A total of 20 case herds having finishing pigs showing acute respiratory symptoms and eight control herds showing no clinical signs suggesting of respiratory problems were enrolled in the study. Researchers visited each herd twice, examining and bleeding 20 pigs per herd. In addition, nasal swab samples were taken from 20 pigs and three pigs per case herd were necropsied during the first visit. Serology was used to detect Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP), swine influenza virus (SIV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae antibodies. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to investigate the presence of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in serum and SIV in the nasal and lung samples. Pathology and bacteriology, including antimicrobial resistance determination, were performed on lung samples obtained from the field necropsies. RESULTS: According to the pathology and bacteriology of the lung samples, APP and Ascaris suum were the main causes of respiratory outbreaks in 14 and three herds respectively, while the clinical signs in three other herds had a miscellaneous etiology. SIV, APP and PCV2 caused concurrent infections in certain herds but they were detected serologically or with PCR also in control herds, suggesting possible subclinical infections. APP was isolated from 16 (80%) case herds. Marked resistance was observed against tetracycline for APP, some resistance was detected against trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin and penicillin, and no resistance against florfenicol, enrofloxacin, tulathromycin or tiamulin was found. Serology, even from paired serum samples, gave inconclusive results for acute APP infection diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: APP was the most common cause for acute respiratory outbreaks in our study. SIV, A. suum, PCV2 and certain opportunistic bacteria were also detected during the outbreaks; however, viral pathogens appeared less important than bacteria. Necropsies supplemented with microbiology were the most efficient diagnostic methods in characterizing the studied outbreaks.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.136796027,-0.013351868,0.022766053,-0.041107719,0.009162653,0.015620506,0.009012258,-0.018886635,0.007748459,0.048821306,0.025755235,-0.007802746,-0.00355655,-0.012140531,0.145719697,-0.107636134,-0.013985058,-0.036297365,0.029036663,0.030922003,-0.022142315,-0.041200008,0.02024981,-0.044392471,0.066568211,0.017204903,-0.067353575,-0.01637041,0.040814449,-0.069386502
HIV-1 tolerates changes in A-count in a small segment of the pol gene,"BACKGROUND: The HIV-1 RNA genome has a biased nucleotide composition with a surplus of As. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this striking phenomenon, but the A-count of the HIV-1 genome has thus far not been systematically manipulated. The reason for this reservation is the likelihood that known and unknown sequence motifs will be affected by such a massive mutational approach, thus resulting in replication-impaired virus mutants. We present the first attempt to increase and decrease the A-count in a relatively small polymerase (pol) gene segment of HIV-1 RNA. RESULTS: To minimize the mutational impact, a new mutational approach was developed that is inspired by natural sequence variation as present in HIV-1 isolates. This phylogeny-instructed mutagenesis allowed us to create replication-competent HIV-1 mutants with a significantly increased or decreased local A-count. The local A-count of the wild-type (wt) virus (40.2%) was further increased to 46.9% or reduced to 31.7 and 26.3%. These HIV-1 variants replicate efficiently in vitro, despite the fact that the pol changes cause a quite profound move in HIV–SIV sequence space. CONCLUSIONS: Extrapolating these results to the complete 9 kb RNA genome, we may cautiously suggest that the A-rich signature does not have to be maintained. This survey also provided clues that silent codon changes, in particular from G-to-A, determine the subtype-specific sequence signatures.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.126231718,-0.04373699,-0.020676044,-0.021911675,-0.000824535,-0.001743503,-0.015887943,0.00927147,-0.015820155,0.001609463,0.007128616,0.02186124,-0.017815734,-0.03958576,0.009941149,0.015950849,-0.03834421,0.010201178,-0.042842462,-0.009680417,0.039242803,-0.012727105,-0.017297319,0.066719682,-0.031390275,-0.021641466,0.023789685,-0.029384794,-0.019613013,-0.032110738
Prevalence of enteropathogens and their antibiotic sensitivity pattern in puppies with hemorrhagic gastroenteritis,"AIM: Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (HGE) ranging from mild to severe forms is commonly encountered in puppies. The aim of the study was to identify the prevalence of common enteropathogens and the antibiotic sensitivity pattern in puppies reported with HGE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The canine HGE activity index, with little modification, was adopted to identify Grade III/severely affected puppies below 6 months of age. Fecal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was employed to screen and compare the enteropathogens in puppies with hemorrhagic diarrhea and healthy control. RESULTS: Canine parvovirus 2b was identified in 90.3% of the diarrheic and 10% of the non-diarrheic healthy puppies. Clostridium difficile was identified in all the diarrheic puppies and in 80% of the healthy puppies. Among the diarrheic puppies, 17.7% were positive for Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin, 9.7% were positive for C. perfringens alpha toxin, 6.4% were positive for Escherichia coli shiga toxin, 6.4% were positive for E. coli enterotoxin (LT), and 3.2% were positive for canine distemper virus. Whereas, none of the healthy puppies were positive for these bacteria and toxins. Fecal antibiotic sensitivity test pattern revealed gentamicin to be sensitive in 95% of the cases, azithromycin in 50%, enrofloxacin in 25%, cefotaxime in 20%, and tetracycline in 5% of the cases. CONCLUSION: Parvoviral enteritis is predominant among puppies. Yet, bacteria and their toxins also play an important role in HGE. Gentamicin has higher sensitivity against the enteropathogens associated with the condition.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.019338482,-0.007822167,0.044391171,-0.093517879,0.001329825,0.005483241,0.012839144,0.001762085,-0.027402871,-0.044723407,0.033337016,0.038187608,-0.051285131,-0.032426485,0.026480568,-0.011300706,-0.004492771,-0.028471597,0.036682583,-0.038026807,0.036292745,0.056371561,-0.033072001,-0.021832645,0.075419082,-0.037617939,-0.050109842,-0.012566906,-0.005752809,0.001619356
Nasopharyngeal bacterial load as a marker for rapid and easy diagnosis of invasive pneumococcal disease in children from Mozambique,"BACKGROUND: Current diagnostic methods for detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae in children with suspected invasive pneumococcal disease have limitations of accuracy, timeliness, and patient convenience. This study aimed to determine the performance of pneumococcal load quantified with a real-time polymerase-chain reaction in nasopharyngeal samples to diagnose invasive pneumococcal disease in children. METHODS: Matched case-control study of patients <5 years of age with invasive pneumococcal disease admitted to the Manhiça District Hospital (Mozambique) and asymptomatic controls recruited in different periods between 2006 and 2014. Cases were confirmed by a positive bacterial culture for S. pneumoniae in blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from cases and controls and pneumococcal density was quantified by lytA real-time polymerase-chain reaction. RESULTS: Thirty cases (median age 12.8 months) and sixty controls (median age 11.7 months) were enrolled and 70% of them were male. Nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage was high in both groups: 28/30 (93.3%) for cases vs. 53/60 (88.3%) for controls (p = 0.71). Mean nasopharyngeal pneumococcal load was identified as a marker for invasive pneumococcal disease (7.0 log(10) copies/mL in cases vs. 5.8 log(10) copies/mL in controls, p<0.001) and showed good discriminatory power (AUC-ROC: 82.1%, 95% CI 72.5%-91.8%). A colonization density of 6.5 log(10) copies/mL was determined as the optimal cut-off value to distinguish cases from controls (sensitivity 75.0%, specificity 73.6%). CONCLUSION: Use of non-invasive nasopharyngeal aspirates coupled with rapid and accurate quantification of pneumococcal load by real-time polymerase chain reaction has the potential to become a useful surrogate marker for early diagnosis of invasive pneumococcal disease in children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.134077708,-0.02752897,0.01235826,-0.086898628,-0.042407354,-0.060690264,0.012458487,0.006945404,-0.03147925,-0.02726376,-0.002612356,0.002491666,-0.07214374,-0.076974675,-0.030337693,0.038442458,-0.061568884,-0.020434328,0.022971532,-0.063461044,-0.092814681,0.105542166,0.042928911,-0.009553856,-0.054605296,0.043211875,0.019264774,-0.014492605,-0.029678135,0.007033972
A simple and rapid identification method for newly emerged porcine Deltacoronavirus with loop-mediated isothermal amplification,"BACKGROUND: Porcine Deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly emerged enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes diarrhea and mortality in neonatal piglets. PDCoV has spread to many countries around the world, leading to significant economic losses in the pork industry. Therefore, a rapid and sensitive method for detection of PDCoV in clinical samples is urgently needed. RESULTS: In this study, we developed a single-tube one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay specific for nucleocapsid gene to diagnose and monitor PDCoV infections. The detection limit of RT-LAMP assay was 1 × 10(1) copies of PDCoV, which was approximately 100-fold more sensitive than gel-based one-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This assay could specifically amplify PDCoV and had no cross amplification with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine kobuvirus (PKoV), porcine astrovirus (PAstV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), classic swine fever virus (CSFV), and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). By screening a panel of clinical specimens (N = 192), this method presented a similar sensitivity with nested RT-PCR and was 1–2 log more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR in detection of PDCoV. CONCLUSIONS: The RT-LAMP assay established in this study is a potentially valuable tool, especially in low-resource laboratories and filed settings, for a rapid diagnosis, surveillance, and molecular epidemiology investigation of PDCoV infections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work for detection of newly emerged PDCoV with LAMP technology.

HBV core protein allosteric modulators differentially alter cccDNA biosynthesis from de novo infection and intracellular amplification pathways,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) core protein assembles viral pre-genomic (pg) RNA and DNA polymerase into nucleocapsids for reverse transcriptional DNA replication to take place. Several chemotypes of small molecules, including heteroaryldihydropyrimidines (HAPs) and sulfamoylbenzamides (SBAs), have been discovered to allosterically modulate core protein structure and consequentially alter the kinetics and pathway of core protein assembly, resulting in formation of irregularly-shaped core protein aggregates or “empty” capsids devoid of pre-genomic RNA and viral DNA polymerase. Interestingly, in addition to inhibiting nucleocapsid assembly and subsequent viral genome replication, we have now demonstrated that HAPs and SBAs differentially modulate the biosynthesis of covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA from de novo infection and intracellular amplification pathways by inducing disassembly of nucleocapsids derived from virions as well as double-stranded DNA-containing progeny nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm. Specifically, the mistimed cuing of nucleocapsid uncoating prevents cccDNA formation during de novo infection of hepatocytes, while transiently accelerating cccDNA synthesis from cytoplasmic progeny nucleocapsids. Our studies indicate that elongation of positive-stranded DNA induces structural changes of nucleocapsids, which confers ability of mature nucleocapsids to bind CpAMs and triggers its disassembly. Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the dual effects of the core protein allosteric modulators on nucleocapsid assembly and disassembly will facilitate the discovery of novel core protein-targeting antiviral agents that can more efficiently suppress cccDNA synthesis and cure chronic hepatitis B.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.153105735,-0.044714963,-0.020618674,0.000192337,-0.086778928,-0.015097769,0.026147997,-0.004920177,0.031847472,0.004467095,-0.032276111,-0.018754593,0.021047885,0.008894649,-0.02359098,0.007449477,0.005213545,-0.014787406,0.008397261,0.038283003,-0.046586951,0.037388553,-0.031943462,-0.02432649,0.015482891,-0.007803944,-0.038351358,0.003749627,-0.018312403,0.052055021
"Multiplex PCR point of care testing versus routine, laboratory-based testing in the treatment of adults with respiratory tract infections: a quasi-randomised study assessing impact on length of stay and antimicrobial use","BACKGROUND: Laboratory-based respiratory pathogen (RP) results are often available too late to influence clinical decisions such as hospitalisation or antibiotic treatment due to time delay in transport of specimens and testing schedules. Ward-based i.e. point of care (POC) testing providing rapid results may alter the clinical management pathway. METHODS: FilmArray® RP polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems were placed in three in-patient and out-patient medical areas. Patients presenting with influenza-like illness /upper respiratory tract infection +/− lower RTI were recruited between January–July 2015. FilmArray® POC testing occurred on even days of the month (intervention) or routine, laboratory-based RP PCR testing +/− atypical serology on odd days (control). The primary outcome was length of hospital stay. The secondary outcomes were impact on the use of antimicrobials, readmissions, all-cause mortality, length of ward stay and turn-around time (TAT) (time to result from admission). RESULTS: Of 606 eligible patients, 545 (89.9%) were included; 211 in the control arm and 334 in the intervention arm. 20% of control arm patients and 24% of intervention arm patients had an RP detected. POC testing was not associated with the primary outcome measure, length of stay, but reduced the TAT from 39.5 h to 19.0 h, p < 0.001. Only the prescribing decision differed between study arms, p < 0.001. When antivirals were given, the intervention was associated with a reduction in the median time to the first dose of 36 h and allowed appropriate treatment of mycoplasma infection. CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between respiratory PCR POC testing and length of stay or most of the secondary outcomes except the antimicrobial prescribing decision. This was probably due to a delay in initiating FilmArray® testing. Despite this, POC testing allowed time-critical antivirals to be given significantly faster, appropriate mycoplasma treatment and results were available considerably faster than routine, laboratory-based testing. Ward-staff of all grades performed POC testing without difficulty suggesting potential use across many divergent healthcare settings. Further studies evaluating the implementation of rapid respiratory PCR POC testing and the effect on length of stay and antimicrobial use are required.

"The viral aetiology of influenza-like illnesses in Kampala and Entebbe, Uganda, 2008","BACKGROUND: As the threat of zoonoses and the emergence of pandemic-prone respiratory viruses increases, there is a need to establish baseline information on the incidence of endemic pathogens in countries worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the presence of viruses associated with influenza-like illnesses (ILI) in Uganda. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in which nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from patients diagnosed with ILI in Kampala and Entebbe between 14 August 2008 – 15 December 2008. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay for detecting 12 respiratory viruses was used. RESULTS: A total of 369 patients (52.3% females) was enrolled; the median age was 6 years (range 1–70). One or more respiratory viruses were detected in 172 (46.6%) cases and their prevalence were influenza A virus (19.2%), adenovirus (8.7%), human rhinovirus A (7.9%), coronavirus OC43 (4.3%), parainfluenza virus 1 (2.7%), parainfluenza virus 3 (2.7%), influenza B virus (2.2%), respiratory syncytial virus B (2.2%), human metapneumovirus (1.4%), respiratory syncytial virus A (1.1%), parainfluenza virus 2 (0.5%) and coronavirus 229E (0.5%). There were 24 (14.0%) mixed infections. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified some of the respiratory viruses associated with ILI in Uganda.

Molecular epidemiology of influenza B virus among hospitalized pediatric patients in Northern Italy during the 2015-16 season,"BACKGROUND: The influenza B viruses belong to two lineages distinguished by their genetic and antigenic characteristics, which are referred to as the Yamagata and Victoria lineages, designated after their original isolates, B/Yamagata/16/88 and B/Victoria/2/87. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the molecular characteristics of influenza B viruses circulating in a region of Northern Italy, Lombardia, during the influenza season of 2015–2016. METHODS: Influenza B virus was detected using a respiratory virus panel of assays and an influenza B-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction. The complete influenza B hemagglutinin (HA) gene was amplified and sequenced directly from clinical specimens. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using nucleotide sequences. RESULTS: A total of 71 hospitalized pediatric patients were influenza B positive. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the great majority of influenza B strains (66/71, 93.0%) belonged to the Victoria-lineage and were antigenically like vaccine strain (B/Brisbane/60/2008) included only in the quadrivalent vaccine. In the detected influenza B strains, a series of amino acid changes were observed in the antigenic regions: I117V, V124A, N129D, V146I, N197D, T199A, and A202T. However, only 2 amino acid changes were observed in the HA regions involved in receptor binding or in antibody recognition. CONCLUSIONS: All the influenza B strains identified in this study belonged to the influenza B Victoria lineage not included in the trivalent vaccine commonly used by the general population during the 2015–2016 influenza season in Italy. This indicates that protection against influenza B infection in the vaccinated population was in general very poor during the 2015–2016 influenza season.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.105977196,-0.110923177,-0.015256987,0.153497626,0.088927253,0.357511198,-0.20566905,-0.002475613,-0.040596179,-0.08793061,-0.005264463,0.051205943,-0.006458675,-0.037565867,-0.033013198,-0.025751836,0.010214713,-0.027600591,-0.005013926,-0.003833512,0.072504133,-0.013119263,0.049079847,0.015452078,-0.000474703,-0.023049952,-0.047792195,0.014192786,-0.021360806,0.067370578
"Molecular characterization of infectious bronchitis viruses isolated from broiler flocks in Bushehr province, Iran: 2014 - 2015","The aim of this study was to provide information on the molecular characteristic and the phylogenic relationship of infectious bronchitis viruses (IBV) strains in Bushehr province in comparison to other strains reported in the Middle East. Samples were collected from broiler flocks in Bushehr province during 2014 - 2015. These flocks had respiratory problems such as gasping, sneezing and bronchial rales. A number of 135 tracheal swabs were taken from fifteen flocks (nine swabs per flock). Each three swabs collected from each flock were pooled in one tube (finally, we had three tubes for each flock). The samples were subjected to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The PCR products of positive samples were analyzed by sequencing of a (392 bp) segment of the spike gene and the related results were compared with the other IBV sequences in GenBank database. Samples from twelve farms (80.0%) were found to be positive. The viruses from seven farms (46.6%) were identified as field viruses closely related to variant 2. The viruses from three farms (20.0%) were characterized as Mass type and were related to vaccine strains. Two different IB viruses (variant 2 and Mass) were detected in samples from two farms (13.3%). The variant 2 genotype detected in Bushehr had high similarity to variant 2 reported from the Middle East.

Characterizing the rapid spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) through an animal food manufacturing facility,"New regulatory and consumer demands highlight the importance of animal feed as a part of our national food safety system. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the first viral pathogen confirmed to be widely transmissible in animal food. Because the potential for viral contamination in animal food is not well characterized, the objectives of this study were to 1) observe the magnitude of virus contamination in an animal food manufacturing facility, and 2) investigate a proposed method, feed sequencing, to decrease virus decontamination on animal food-contact surfaces. A U.S. virulent PEDV isolate was used to inoculate 50 kg swine feed, which was mixed, conveyed, and discharged into bags using pilot-scale feed manufacturing equipment. Surfaces were swabbed and analyzed for the presence of PEDV RNA by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Environmental swabs indicated complete contamination of animal food-contact surfaces (0/40 vs. 48/48, positive baseline samples/total baseline samples, positive subsequent samples/total subsequent samples, respectively; P < 0.05) and near complete contamination of non-animal food-contact surfaces (0/24 vs. 16/18, positive baseline samples/total baseline samples, positive subsequent samples/total subsequent samples, respectively; P < 0.05). Flushing animal food-contact surfaces with low-risk feed is commonly used to reduce cross-contamination in animal feed manufacturing. Thus, four subsequent 50 kg batches of virus-free swine feed were manufactured using the same system to test its impact on decontaminating animal food-contact surfaces. Even after 4 subsequent sequences, animal food-contact surfaces retained viral RNA (28/33 positive samples/total samples), with conveying system being more contaminated than the mixer. A bioassay to test infectivity of dust from animal food-contact surfaces failed to produce infectivity. This study demonstrates the potential widespread viral contamination of surfaces in an animal food manufacturing facility and the difficulty of removing contamination using conventional feed sequencing, which underscores the importance for preventing viruses from entering and contaminating such facilities.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.0085818,-0.004787436,0.058019647,-0.060319389,0.014058904,0.025620223,0.021724462,0.014673262,-0.016451194,-0.004913824,0.032300839,0.027970012,-0.069491643,0.001420278,0.130347243,-0.059955253,-0.019103775,-0.001335285,-0.015749346,0.032255683,-0.077842999,-0.012687659,0.000815282,-0.042453638,-0.034258299,-0.009336484,-0.025687726,-0.007435398,0.012548914,-0.015637587
Construction and characterization of an improved DNA-launched infectious clone of duck hepatitis a virus type 1,"BACKGROUND: DNA-launched infectious system is a useful tool with high rescue efficiency that allows the introduction of mutations in specific positions to investigate the function of an individual viral element. Rescued virus particles could be harvested by directly transfecting the DNA-launched recombinant plasmid to the host cells, which will reduce labor and experimental cost by skipping the in vitro transcription assay. METHODS: A total of four overlapping fragments covering the entire viral genome were amplified and then were assembled into a transformation vector based on pIRES2-EGFP to establish the DNA-launched infectious system of duck hepatitis A virus type 1 (DHAV-1), named pIR-DHAV-1. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blotting assay and indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) were conducted for rescued virus identification. A total of 4.0 μg of recombinant plasmid of pIR-DHAV-1 and in vitro transcribed product of 4.0 μg of RNA-launched infectious clone named pR-DHAV-1 were transfected into BHK-21 cells to analyze the rescue efficiency. Following that, tissue tropism of rescued virus (rDHAV-1) and parental virus (pDHAV-1) were assayed for virulence testing in 1-day-old ducklings. RESULTS: Rescued virus particles carry the designed genetic marker which could be harvested by directly transfecting pIR-DHAV-1 to BHK-21 cells. The qRT-PCR and western blotting results indicated that rDHAV-1 shared similar growth characteristics with pDHAV-1. Furthermore, DNA-launched infectious system possessed much higher rescue efficiency assay compared to RNA-launched infectious system. The mutation at position 3042 from T to C has no impact on viral replication and tissue tropism. From 1 h post infection (hpi) to 48 hpi, the viral RNA copies of rDHAV-1 in liver were the highest among the six tested tissues (with an exception of thymus at 6 hpi), while the viral RNA copy numbers in heart and kidney were alternately the lowest. CONCLUSION: We have constructed a genetically stable and highly pathogenic DNA-launched infectious clone, from which the rescued virus could be harvested by direct transfection with recombinant plasmids. rDHAV-1 shared similar growth characteristics and tissue tropism with pDHAV-1. The DNA-launched infectious system of DHAV-1 possessed higher rescue efficiency compared to the traditional RNA-launched infectious system.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.077499914,-0.01448204,0.077218161,0.012355013,-0.038232496,-0.008912163,-0.011200822,-0.019178286,0.008359255,0.042250408,0.015149083,-0.057334436,0.008940713,0.050430328,0.023782422,0.029520732,-0.024128289,-0.016988951,-0.004007983,-0.006819332,-0.001459846,0.00731486,0.036375456,-0.009773329,-0.05562366,0.01385271,0.015298079,0.006245961,-0.08595347,0.040586436
Development of real-time recombinase polymerase amplification assay for rapid and sensitive detection of canine parvovirus 2,"BACKGROUND: Canine parvovirus 2, a linear single-stranded DNA virus belonging to the genus Parvovirus within the family Parvoviridae, is a highly contagious pathogen of domestic dogs and several wild canidae species. Early detection of canine parvovirus (CPV-2) is crucial to initiating appropriate outbreak control strategies. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), a novel isothermal gene amplification technique, has been developed for the molecular detection of diverse pathogens. In this study, a real-time RPA assay was developed for the detection of CPV-2 using primers and an exo probe targeting the CPV-2 nucleocapsid protein gene. RESULTS: The real-time RPA assay was performed successfully at 38 °C, and the results were obtained within 4–12 min for 10(5)–10(1) molecules of template DNA. The assay only detected CPV-2, and did not show cross-detection of other viral pathogens, demonstrating a high level of specificity. The analytical sensitivity of the real-time RPA was 10(1) copies/reaction of a standard DNA template, which was 10 times more sensitive than the common RPA method. The clinical sensitivity of the real-time RPA assay matched 100% (n = 91) to the real-time PCR results. CONCLUSION: The real-time RPA assay is a simple, rapid, reliable and affordable method that can potentially be applied for the detection of CPV-2 in the research laboratory and point-of-care diagnosis.

No evidence of enteric viral involvement in the new neonatal porcine diarrhoea syndrome in Danish pigs,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the syndrome New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome (NNPDS) is associated with a viral aetiology. Four well-managed herds experiencing neonatal diarrhoea and suspected to be affected by NNPDS were included in a case-control set up. A total of 989 piglets were clinically examined on a daily basis. Samples from diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic piglets at the age of three to seven days were selected for extensive virological examination using specific real time polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs) and general virus detection methods. RESULTS: A total of 91.7% of the animals tested positive by reverse transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR) for porcine kobuvirus 1 (PKV-1) while 9% and 3% were found to be positive for rotavirus A and porcine teschovirus (PTV), respectively. The overall prevalence of porcine astrovirus (PAstV) was 75% with 69.8% of the PAstV positive pigs infected with PAstV type 3. No animals tested positive for rotavirus C, coronavirus (TGEV, PEDV and PRCV), sapovirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, saffoldvirus, cosavirus, klassevirus or porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). Microarray analyses performed on a total of 18 animals were all negative, as were eight animals examined by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Using Next Generation de novo sequencing (de novo NGS) on pools of samples from case animals within all herds, PKV-1 was detected in four herds and rotavirus A, rotavirus C and PTV were detected in one herd each. CONCLUSIONS: Our detailed analyses of piglets from NNPDS-affected herds demonstrated that viruses did not pose a significant contribution to NNPDS. However, further investigations are needed to investigate if a systemic virus infection plays a role in the pathogenesis of NNPDS.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.028876458,0.00803743,0.079428693,-0.087215291,0.06062651,0.024653125,0.01514456,0.005386707,-0.02223524,-0.031368055,0.055860381,0.032603731,-0.092673636,0.03989879,0.183511931,-0.120946807,-0.008654094,-0.039048777,-0.005127342,0.046880034,-0.058669505,0.017840045,-0.033083004,-0.014163691,0.03414686,-0.029817293,-0.043613226,-0.031160025,-0.004237361,-0.0332231
Polyprotein Processing as a Determinant for In Vitro Activity of Semliki Forest Virus Replicase,"Semliki Forest virus (SFV) is an arthropod-borne alphavirus that induces membrane invaginations (spherules) in host cells. These harbor the viral replication complexes (RC) that synthesize viral RNA. Alphaviruses have four replicase or nonstructural proteins (nsPs), nsP1–4, expressed as polyprotein P1234. An early RC, which synthesizes minus-strand RNA, is formed by the polyprotein P123 and the polymerase nsP4. Further proteolytic cleavage results in a late RC consisting of nsP1–4 and synthesizing plus strands. Here, we show that only the late RCs are highly active in RNA synthesis in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that active RCs can be isolated from both virus-infected cells and cells transfected with the wild-type replicase in combination with a plasmid expressing a template RNA. When an uncleavable polyprotein P123 and polymerase nsP4 were expressed together with a template, high levels of minus-strand RNA were produced in cells, but RCs isolated from these cells were hardly active in vitro. Furthermore, we observed that the uncleavable polyprotein P123 and polymerase nsP4, which have previously been shown to form spherules even in the absence of the template, did not replicate an exogenous template. Consequently, we hypothesize that the replicase proteins were sequestered in spherules and were no longer able to recruit a template.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.205113389,-0.064915604,-0.064608219,0.055611502,-0.078750424,-0.064987943,-0.010240749,0.006286118,-0.003232012,-0.018079135,0.030268954,-0.012710392,-0.029106501,0.096515988,0.016579844,0.03965025,0.022348606,-0.049875581,0.034598299,0.028221724,-0.045515975,0.045887781,-0.028710705,-0.094125704,0.037592187,0.007107859,-0.075701263,0.040687737,-0.09308714,0.012434411
Peripheral immune tolerance alleviates the intracranial lipopolysaccharide injection-induced neuroinflammation and protects the dopaminergic neurons from neuroinflammation-related neurotoxicity,"BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the onset and development of neurodegeneration disorders such as Parkinson’s disease. The immune activities of the central nervous system are profoundly affected by peripheral immune activities. Immune tolerance refers to the unresponsiveness of the immune system to continuous or repeated stimulation to avoid excessive inflammation and unnecessary by-stander injury in the face of continuous antigen threat. It has been proved that the immune tolerance could suppress the development of various peripheral inflammation-related diseases. However, the role of immune tolerance in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases was not clear. METHODS: Rats were injected with repeated low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.3 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 4 days to induce peripheral immune tolerance. Neuroinflammation was produced using intracranial LPS (15 μg) injection. Inflammation cytokines were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Microglial activation were measured using immunostaining of Iba-1 and ED-1. Dopaminergic neuronal damage was evaluated using immunochemistry staining and stereological counting of TH-positive neurons. Behavioral impairment was evaluated using amphetamine-induced rotational behavioral assessment. RESULTS: Compared with the non-immune tolerated animals, pre-treatment of peripheral immune tolerance significantly decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines, suppressed the microglial activation, and increased the number of dopaminergic neuronal survival in the substantia nigra. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that peripheral immune tolerance attenuated neuroinflammation and inhibited neuroinflammation-induced dopaminergic neuronal death.

Effectiveness of composting as a biosecure disposal method for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)-infected pig carcasses,"BACKGROUND: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enteric disease of swine that has emerged as a worldwide threat to swine herd health and production. Substantial research has been conducted to assess viability of the virus on surfaces of vehicles and equipment, in feed and water, and on production building surfaces, but little is known about the persistence in PEDV-infected carcasses and effective disposal methods thereof. This study was conducted to quantify the persistence of PEDV RNA via quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) at various time-temperature combinations and in infected piglet carcasses subjected to composting. Although this method does not distinguish between infectious and noninfectious virus, it is a rapid and sensitive test to evaluate materials for evidence of virus genome. RESULTS: In the first study, PEDV was suspended in cell culture media at 1 × 10(5) TCID50 per sample (1 mL sample size) and subjected to various time and temperature combinations in triplicate including temperatures of 37, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70 °C and exposure times of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 14 days. At all temperatures, viral RNA copies declined over time, with the decline most marked and rapid at 65 and 70 °C. Detectable RNA did persist throughout the trial in all but the most extreme condition, where two of three samples incubated at 70 °C yielded undetectable viral RNA after 14 days. In the second study, PEDV-infected piglet carcasses were subjected to two cycles of composting lasting 36 and 37 days, respectively, for a total compost time of 73 days. Composting was performed in triplicate windrow sections housed inside biosecure, climate-controlled rooms using insulated bins designed to represent a continuous windrow compost pile. Temperatures reached 35–57 °C for 26 days of cycle 1 and 35–45 °C for 3 days of cycle 2. Samples consisting of carbon material with or without decomposed tissue as available per sample site collected at ten locations throughout the cross-section of each windrow section following the primary and secondary compost cycles yielded no detectable viral RNA. CONCLUSIONS: Composting appears to be an effective disposal method for PEDV-infected piglet carcasses under the conditions examined. The combination of time and high temperature of the compost cycle effectively degraded viral RNA in cell culture media that should provide optimum stability. Complex compost material matrices collected from windrow sections yielded undetectable PEDV RNA by qRT-PCR after one 36-day compost cycle despite incomplete decomposition of soft tissue.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.024839611,0.005804842,0.088905645,-0.017128367,-0.010124351,-0.005771392,-0.021267895,0.003539875,-0.026084291,0.000478348,0.069857661,0.021749445,-0.133249981,0.085750978,0.224249941,-0.118813817,-0.063630215,0.021904249,-0.008227876,0.115418593,-0.185703531,-0.050908967,0.05820505,-0.09093863,-0.107041267,-0.024910472,-0.002154847,0.022280465,0.025092894,0.007411877
Evaluation of an accelerated hydrogen peroxide disinfectant to inactivate porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in swine feces on aluminum surfaces under freezing conditions,"BACKGROUND: Since its emergence in 2013, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) spread rapidly throughout the country due, in part, to contaminated livestock trailers. The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of an accelerated hydrogen peroxide (AHP) disinfectant for inactivating PEDV in swine feces on metal surfaces under freezing conditions. One 15.24 X 15.24 X 2.54 cm aluminum coupon, contaminated with swine feces, and randomly matched to one pig was the experimental unit. Eight treatment groups representing two AHP concentrations (1:16 and 1:32) in a 10% propylene glycol solution, two contact times in a -10 °C freezer (40 min and 60 min), and two levels of fecal contamination (5 mL and 10 mL) in addition to negative and positive control groups were evaluated. Forty 3-week-old pigs, intragastrically inoculated with the contents of the coupons after treatment, were used as a bioassay to determine the infectivity of PEDV after treatment. Infectivity was determined by detection of virus with a nucleocapsid (N) gene-based quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) on rectal swabs collected from the inoculated pigs on days three and seven post-inoculation. RESULTS: All post-treatment swabs from the negative control coupons were negative for PEDV via RT-qPCR. All post-treatment swabs collected from coupons in the AHP disinfectant treatment groups and the positive control group were positive for PEDV via RT-qPCR. For the bioassay, no rectal swabs from pigs in the negative control (0 of 4) or the AHP disinfectant treatment groups (0 of 32) were positive for PEDV. Rectal swabs from all pigs within the positive control group (4 of 4) were positive for PEDV by RT-qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, 1:16 and 1:32 dilutions of the AHP disinfectant successfully inactivated PEDV in swine feces on metal surfaces when applied at -10 °C with 40 or 60 min of contact time. This study also suggests that a positive RT-qPCR result for PEDV on an environmental sample should be expected when the AHP disinfectant is applied under freezing conditions, but does not necessarily indicate that an infectious dose of PEDV remains after disinfection.

"Etiology of respiratory tract infections in the community and clinic in Ilorin, Nigeria","OBJECTIVE: Recognizing increasing interest in community disease surveillance globally, the goal of this study was to investigate whether respiratory viruses circulating in the community may be represented through clinical (hospital) surveillance in Nigeria. RESULTS: Children were selected via convenience sampling from communities and a tertiary care center (n = 91) during spring 2017 in Ilorin, Nigeria. Nasal swabs were collected and tested using polymerase chain reaction. The majority (79.1%) of subjects were under 6 years old, of whom 46 were infected (63.9%). A total of 33 of the 91 subjects had one or more respiratory tract virus; there were 10 cases of triple infection and 5 of quadruple. Parainfluenza virus 4, respiratory syncytial virus B and enterovirus were the most common viruses in the clinical sample; present in 93.8% (15/16) of clinical subjects, and 6.7% (5/75) of community subjects (significant difference, p < 0.001). Coronavirus OC43 was the most common virus detected in community members (13.3%, 10/75). A different strain, Coronavirus OC 229 E/NL63 was detected among subjects from the clinic (2/16) and not detected in the community. This pilot study provides evidence that data from the community can potentially represent different information than that sourced clinically, suggesting the need for community surveillance to enhance public health efforts and scientific understanding of respiratory infections.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.166736475,-0.071216035,-0.054521854,0.008444999,0.067031674,-0.023015369,0.01648597,-0.007993445,0.027407599,0.028099387,0.005802474,0.01511421,0.044096862,-0.031061414,0.043668283,0.000456116,-0.017381073,-0.054762747,0.046622814,0.021341932,-0.022409173,-0.026815736,0.008588506,0.016561842,0.054602751,0.022960473,-0.012072449,0.063124434,0.019644523,-0.037845061
The impact of virus infections on pneumonia mortality is complex in adults: a prospective multicentre observational study,"BACKGROUND: Various viruses are known to be associated with pneumonia. However, the impact of viral infections on adult pneumonia mortality remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify the effect of virus infection on pneumonia mortality among adults stratified by virus type and patient comorbidities. METHODS: This multicentre prospective study enrolled pneumonia patients aged ≥15 years from September 2011 to August 2014. Sputum samples were tested by in-house multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays to identify 13 respiratory viruses. Viral infection status and its effect on in-hospital mortality were examined by age group and comorbidity status. RESULTS: A total of 2617 patients were enrolled in the study and 77.8% was aged ≥65 years. 574 (21.9%) did not have comorbidities, 790 (30.2%) had chronic respiratory disease, and 1253 (47.9%) had other comorbidities. Viruses were detected in 605 (23.1%) patients. Human rhinovirus (9.8%) was the most frequently identified virus, followed by influenza A (3.9%) and respiratory syncytial virus (3.9%). Respiratory syncytial virus was more frequently identified in patients with chronic respiratory disease (4.7%) than those with other comorbidities (4.2%) and without comorbidities (2.1%) (p = 0.037). The frequencies of other viruses were almost identical between the three groups. Virus detection overall was not associated with increased mortality (adjusted risk ratio (ARR) 0.76, 95% CI 0.53–1.09). However, influenza virus A and B were associated with three-fold higher mortality in patients with chronic respiratory disease but not with other comorbidities (ARR 3.38, 95% CI 1.54–7.42). Intriguingly, paramyxoviruses were associated with dramatically lower mortality in patients with other comorbidities (ARR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01–0.70) but not with chronic respiratory disease. These effects were not affected by age group. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of virus infections on pneumonia mortality varies by virus type and comorbidity status in adults.

Rapid detection of infectious bovine Rhinotracheitis virus using recombinase polymerase amplification assays,"BACKGROUND: Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV) is a major pathogen in cattle and has led to significant economic losses to the dairy industry worldwide, and therefore a more optimal method for the rapid diagnosis of IBRV infection is highly needed. In this study, we described the development of a lateral flow dipstrip (LFD) of isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) method for rapid detection of IBRV. METHODS: Distinct regions were selected as a candidate target for designing the LFD-RPA primers and probes. The analytical sensitivity of the RPA assay was determined using ten-fold serially diluted IBRV DNA. The specificity of the assay was assessed with other viral pathogens of cattle with similar clinic and other herpesviruses. The clinical performance was evaluated by testing 106 acute-phase high fever clinical specimens. RESULTS: RPA primers and probe were designed to target the specific conserved UL52 region fragment of IBRV. The detection could be completed at a constant temperature of 38 °C for 25 min, and the amplification products were easily visualized on a simple LFD. The detection limit of this assay was 5 copies per reaction of IBRV DNA and there was no cross-reactivity with other viruses causing bovine gastrointestinal and respiratory infections or other herpesviruses. The assay performance on acute-phase high fever clinical samples collected from cattle with no vaccine against IBRV, which were suspected to be infected with IBRV, was validated by detecting 24 fecal, 36 blood, 38 nasal swab and 8 tissue specimens, and compared with SYBR Green I based real-time PCR. The coincidence between IBRV LFD-RPA and real-time PCR was 100%. CONCLUSION: IBRV LFD-RPA was fast and much easier to serve as an alternative to the common measures used for IBRV diagnosis, as there is reduction in the use of instruments for identification of the infected animals. In addition, this assay may be the potential candidate to be used as point-of-care diagnostics in the field.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.032001496,0.059460233,0.214644927,0.026414695,-0.061580289,-0.039328076,0.04224886,0.008635943,-0.004462756,-0.038257614,-0.060399409,0.036609826,-0.019833021,-0.073982524,-0.049171332,0.071973979,-0.05839495,-0.066053068,0.143411452,0.174099708,0.081826385,-0.024732603,-0.002436198,-0.054496757,-0.059528502,0.045521192,0.020493586,0.004296455,0.061019888,-0.038039074
"Clinical, pathological, and molecular investigation of Mycoplasma pulmonis-induced murine respiratory mycoplasmosis in a rat (Rattus norvegicus) colony","AIM: Mycoplasma pulmonis (MP) remains potentially important rodent pathogen causing murine respiratory mycoplasmosis (MRM) which may go undiagnosed due to its asymptomatic nature. In the present study, we carried out clinical, pathological, and molecular investigations of MP-induced MRM in a rat colony. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two female Wistar rats were observed to be diseased in animal facility of NISER, Bhubaneswar, and were kept in isolation for further investigation. Both the animals were found to be positive for MP after serological and molecular tests. Thereafter, whole rat colony comprising of 36 animals was segregated based on clinical symptoms and further sampled for histopathological, serological, and molecular investigations. Tracheal washing and infected lung tissue were collected during necropsy examination for DNA extraction. Molecular diagnosis was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using species-specific primers. RESULT:: Classical symptoms of MP-associated respiratory tract infection were observed in only 2 of 36 infected animals, and most of the animals were found asymptomatic to the disease; however, all the animals were found to be carrier after necropsy and PCR assay. Gross and histopathological finding suggested severe congestion of the lungs along with suppurative and necrotizing pneumonia. The disease is confirmed by molecular diagnosis using species-specific primers in PCR assay. CONCLUSION: MRM may go undiagnosed due to asymptomatic nature. Detailed study of clinical symptoms, pathology, serology, and PCR-based molecular approach may aid in health monitoring and detection of MRM in a rodent colony reared for experimental purpose.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.061476076,0.04043977,0.095235042,-0.050732368,3.31E-05,0.005099915,0.05105354,0.006219861,-0.002740096,0.033288749,0.013327393,-0.020937131,0.029994083,-0.013313099,0.03219744,-0.007684291,-0.015593271,0.007134267,-0.007571245,-0.048759269,0.025743677,-0.009836045,-0.008421434,-0.067667218,0.036055913,0.006759635,-0.021630846,-0.007835825,0.003827312,-0.024501557
Coronavirus and paramyxovirus in bats from Northwest Italy,"BACKGROUND: Bat-borne virus surveillance is necessary for determining inter-species transmission risks and is important due to the wide-range of bat species which may harbour potential pathogens. This study aimed to monitor coronaviruses (CoVs) and paramyxoviruses (PMVs) in bats roosting in northwest Italian regions. Our investigation was focused on CoVs and PMVs due to their proven ability to switch host and their zoonotic potential. Here we provide the phylogenetic characterization of the highly conserved polymerase gene fragments. RESULTS: Family-wide PCR screenings were used to test 302 bats belonging to 19 different bat species. Thirty-eight animals from 12 locations were confirmed as PCR positive, with an overall detection rate of 12.6% [95% CI: 9.3–16.8]. CoV RNA was found in 36 bats belonging to eight species, while PMV RNA in three Pipistrellus spp. Phylogenetic characterization have been obtained for 15 alpha- CoVs, 5 beta-CoVs and three PMVs; moreover one P. pipistrellus resulted co-infected with both CoV and PMV. A divergent alpha-CoV clade from Myotis nattereri SpA is also described. The compact cluster of beta-CoVs from R. ferrumequinum roosts expands the current viral sequence database, specifically for this species in Europe. To our knowledge this is the first report of CoVs in Plecotus auritus and M. oxygnathus, and of PMVs in P. kuhlii. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified alpha and beta-CoVs in new bat species and in previously unsurveyed Italian regions. To our knowledge this represents the first and unique report of PMVs in Italy. The 23 new bat genetic sequences presented will expand the current molecular bat-borne virus databases. Considering the amount of novel bat-borne PMVs associated with the emergence of zoonotic infections in animals and humans in the last years, the definition of viral diversity within European bat species is needed. Performing surveillance studies within a specific geographic area can provide awareness of viral burden where bats roost in close proximity to spillover hosts, and form the basis for the appropriate control measures against potential threats for public health and optimal management of bats and their habitats.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.059734864,0.140234607,-0.065950221,0.018162938,0.378385946,0.168907775,0.35163815,0.127257475,-0.151083836,-0.069123399,-0.140173808,-0.171301538,-0.062091015,0.052616776,-0.066622905,0.102033907,0.000953601,0.073776405,0.019191447,-0.014913122,-0.075732883,-0.007406485,0.05583046,-0.084891464,0.060236288,0.039394873,-0.006592532,-0.044150331,0.018557861,0.047316478
"Epidemiology and clinical characteristics of human coronaviruses OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1: a study of hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection in Guangzhou, China","Human coronaviruses (HCoV) OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1 are common respiratory viruses which cause various respiratory diseases, including pneumonia. There is a paucity of evidence on the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of these four HCoV strains worldwide. We collected 11,399 throat swabs from hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection from July 2009 to June 2016 in Guangzhou, China. These were tested for four strains of HCoV infection using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HCoV-positive patients were then tested for 11 other respiratory pathogens. 4.3% (489/11399) of patients were positive for HCoV, of which 3.0% were positive for OC43 (346/11399), 0.6% for 229E (65/11399), 0.5% for NL63 (60/11399), and 0.3% for HKU1 (38/11399). Patients aged 7–12 months had the highest prevalence of HCoV and OC43 when compared with other age groups (p < 0.001). The peak seasons of infection varied depending on the HCoV strain. Patients infected with a single strain of HCoV infection were less likely to present fever (≥ 38 °C) (p = 0.014) and more likely to present pulmonary rales (p = 0.043) than those co-infected with more than one HCoV strain or other respiratory pathogens. There were also significant differences in the prevalence of certain symptoms, including coughing (p = 0.032), pneumonia (p = 0.026), and abnormal pulmonary rales (p = 0.002) according to the strain of HCoV detected. This retrospective study of the prevalence of four HCoV strains and clinical signs among a large population of pediatric patients in a subtropical region of China provides further insight into the epidemiology and clinical features of HCoV.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.192391156,-0.056870748,-0.102713191,-0.068841036,0.200165211,-0.095634515,0.036947003,-0.023421055,0.094965018,-0.063992256,-0.047744572,0.498325439,0.380781313,0.251020278,-0.003147817,0.062598039,-0.0745248,-0.013508091,-0.065568762,0.078886161,0.016019312,-0.015549336,0.044433228,-0.093800249,0.03597194,-0.025898935,0.071194166,0.040495628,-0.005029149,0.087642367
A Low-Cost Palmtop High-Speed Capillary Electrophoresis Bioanalyzer with Laser Induced Fluorescence Detection,"In this work, we developed a miniaturized palmtop high-speed capillary electrophoresis (CE) system integrating whole modules, including picoliter-scale sample injection, short capillary-based fast CE, high-voltage power supply, orthogonal laser induced fluorescence (LIF) detection, battery, system control, on-line data acquisition, processing, storage, and display modules. A strategy of minimalist miniaturization combining minimal system design and low-cost system construction was adopted to achieve the instrument miniaturization with extremely low cost, which is differing from the current microfabrication strategy used in most reported miniaturized CE systems. With such a strategy, the total size of the bioanalyzer was minimized to 90 × 75 × 77 mm (length × width × height) and the instrument cost was reduced to ca. $500, which demonstrated the smallest and lowest-cost CE instrument with LIF detection in so far reported systems. The present bioanalyzer also exhibited comparable analytical performances to previously-reported high-speed CE systems. A limit of detection of 1.02 nM sodium fluorescein was obtained. Fast separations were achieved for multiple types of samples as amino acids, amino acid enantiomers, DNA fragments, and proteins with high efficiency.

Human metapneumovirus - what we know now,"Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a leading cause of acute respiratory infection, particularly in children, immunocompromised patients, and the elderly. HMPV, which is closely related to avian metapneumovirus subtype C, has circulated for at least 65 years, and nearly every child will be infected with HMPV by the age of 5. However, immunity is incomplete, and re-infections occur throughout adult life. Symptoms are similar to those of other respiratory viral infections, ranging from mild (cough, rhinorrhea, and fever) to more severe (bronchiolitis and pneumonia). The preferred method for diagnosis is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction as HMPV is difficult to culture. Although there have been many advances made in the past 16 years since its discovery, there are still no US Food and Drug Administration-approved antivirals or vaccines available to treat HMPV. Both small animal and non-human primate models have been established for the study of HMPV. This review will focus on the epidemiology, transmission, and clinical manifestations in humans as well as the animal models of HMPV pathogenesis and host immune response.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.14126737,-0.077822145,-0.06271602,0.036332097,0.001715816,-0.065367716,0.094302028,-0.09980877,0.1738423,-0.032153689,0.000670978,-0.052857192,-0.072209847,0.011645747,-0.1149723,-0.063102983,-0.051782062,0.312103539,-0.213762644,0.126039067,0.174321089,0.072393618,-0.029106163,-0.112422044,-0.096988458,0.016500737,-0.252925808,-0.16871627,0.044916276,-0.063420021
Molecular analysis of carnivore Protoparvovirus detected in white blood cells of naturally infected cats,"BACKGROUND: Cats are susceptible to feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) and canine parvovirus (CPV) variants 2a, 2b and 2c. Detection of FPV and CPV variants in apparently healthy cats and their persistence in white blood cells (WBC) and other tissues when neutralising antibodies are simultaneously present, suggest that parvovirus may persist long-term in the tissues of cats post-infection without causing clinical signs. The aim of this study was to screen a population of 54 cats from Sardinia (Italy) for the presence of both FPV and CPV DNA within buffy coat samples using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The DNA viral load, genetic diversity, phylogeny and antibody titres against parvoviruses were investigated in the positive cats. RESULTS: Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 DNA was detected in nine cats (16.7%). Viral DNA was reassembled to FPV in four cats and to CPV (CPV-2b and 2c) in four cats; one subject showed an unusually high genetic complexity with mixed infection involving FPV and CPV-2c. Antibodies against parvovirus were detected in all subjects which tested positive to DNA parvoviruses. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of FPV and CPV DNA in the WBC of asymptomatic cats, despite the presence of specific antibodies against parvoviruses, and the high genetic heterogeneity detected in one sample, confirmed the relevant epidemiological role of cats in parvovirus infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.01355269,-0.012183801,0.093277874,-0.159520965,0.000130384,0.023344432,0.074432017,0.001163409,-0.040432016,-0.114831295,0.304176102,-0.099707714,0.152420671,-0.063133138,-0.070411595,-0.012045665,-0.014659574,-0.070435538,0.075514612,0.083350349,0.068645801,0.037084631,-0.001922819,-0.009670618,0.011075322,-0.050731426,-0.078806096,0.054653321,-0.048079534,0.059487675
Real-time fluorescence loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for direct detection of egg drop syndrome virus,"BACKGROUND: Egg drop syndrome (EDS), caused by the adenovirus “egg drop syndrome virus” (EDSV) causes severe economic losses through reduced egg production in breeder and layer flocks. The diagnosis of EDSV has been done by molecular tools since its complete genome sequence was identified. In order to enhance the capabilities of the real-time fluorescence loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RealAmp) assay, we aimed to apply the method for direct detection of the EDSV without viral DNA extraction. In order to detect the presence of the EDSV DNA, three pairs of primers were designed, from the conserved region of fiber gene of the EDSV. RESULTS: For our assay, test and control samples were directly used in the reaction mixture in 10-fold serial dilution. The target DNA was amplified at 65 °C, which yield positive results in a relatively short period of 40–45 min. The method reported in this study is highly sensitive as compared to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and showed no sign of cross-reactivity or false positive results. The RealAmp accomplished specific identification of EDSV among a variety of poultry disease viruses. CONCLUSIONS: The direct RealAmp can be used to detect the presence of EDSV.

A case series on common cold to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children following human metapneumovirus infection in Sri Lanka,"OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of hMPV infections in Sri Lanka has not been reported and here we report a case series of hMPV infection in children less than 5 years. Patients with ARTI were included from Teaching Hospital, Anuradhapura from March 2013 to August 2014. Indirect fluorescence assay was performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates for the identification of respiratory viruses [respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus 1, 2 and 3, influenza A and B and hMPV]. Moreover, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was done to further confirm the hMPV infection. RESULTS: In this case series, hMPV infection showed a range of respiratory symptoms from common cold to life threatening lower respiratory tract infections with varying severity. In some cases, the clinical presentation of hMPV infection was similar to the ARTI caused by RSV. hMPV co-infections with of RSV have also been seen in some cases of ARTI. A child delivered through cesarean section and birth order > 3 has an Odds ratio of 3.5 and 4.3 (95% CI) for developing co-infection with RSV compared to hMPV mono-infections. Lack of diagnostic facilities to identify the viral aetiology has contributed to the use of antibiotics indicating the need for establishing viral diagnostic facilities in the country.

Comparison of viral infection in healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP),"BACKGROUND: Although viruses are known to be the second most common etiological factor in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), the respiratory viral profile of the patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) has not yet been elucidated. We investigated the prevalence and the clinical impact of respiratory virus infection in adult patients with HCAP. METHODS: Patients admitted with HCAP or CAP, between January and December 2016, to a tertiary referral hospital in Korea, were prospectively enrolled, and virus identification was performed using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Among 452 enrolled patients (224 with HCAP, 228 with CAP), samples for respiratory viruses were collected from sputum or endotracheal aspirate in 430 (95.1%) patients and from nasopharyngeal specimens in 22 (4.9%) patients. Eighty-seven (19.2%) patients had a viral infection, and the proportion of those with viral infection was significantly lower in the HCAP than in the CAP group (13.8% vs 24.6%, p = 0.004). In both the HCAP and CAP groups, influenza A was the most common respiratory virus, followed by entero-rhinovirus. The seasonal distributions of respiratory viruses were also similar in both groups. In the HCAP group, the viral infection resulted in a similar length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality as viral–bacterial coinfection and bacterial infection, and the CAP group showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of viral infection in patients with HCAP was lower than that in patients with CAP, and resulted in a similar prognosis as viral–bacterial coinfection or bacterial infection.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.276807873,-0.088139478,-0.15921978,-0.047090979,-0.054631061,-0.097914171,-0.071466581,0.142873856,-0.249601776,0.135524704,-0.084189949,-0.037562948,0.021797448,0.139536794,-0.114678113,-0.084356777,0.051106066,0.010447117,-0.050327709,0.186997272,0.015585453,0.059779155,0.142439958,0.114480825,0.094075299,-0.112299602,0.016008366,0.005764928,0.070290162,0.05276616
Clinical implications of rapid ePlex® Respiratory Pathogen Panel testing compared to laboratory-developed real-time PCR,"Rapid diagnosis of respiratory infections is of great importance for adequate isolation and treatment. Due to the batch-wise testing, laboratory-developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays (LDT) often result in a time to result of one day. Here, LDT was compared with rapid ePlex® Respiratory Pathogen (RP) Panel testing of GenMark Diagnostics (Carlsbad, CA, USA) with regard to time to result, installed isolation precautions, and antibacterial/antiviral treatment. Between January and March 2017, 68 specimens of 64 patients suspected of an acute respiratory infection were tested with LDT and the ePlex® RP panel. The time to result was calculated as the time between sample reception and result reporting. Information regarding isolation and antibacterial/antiviral treatment was obtained from the patient records. Thirty specimens tested LDT positive (47%) and 29 ePlex® RP panel positive (45%). The median time to result was 27.1 h (range 6.5–96.6) for LDT versus 3.4 h (range 1.5–23.6) for the RP panel, p-value < 0.001. In 14 out of 30 patients, isolation was discontinued based on the ePlex® RP panel results, saving 21 isolation days. ePlex® RP panel test results were available approximately one day ahead of the LDT results in the 19 patients receiving antiviral/antibacterial treatment. In addition, two bacterial pathogens, not requested by the physician, were detected using the RP panel. Analysis of respiratory infections with the ePlex® RP panel resulted in a significant decrease in time to result, enabling a reduction in isolation days in half of the patients. Furthermore, syndromic RP panel testing increased the identification of causative pathogens.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.092254413,0.008215186,0.019051973,-0.051574686,-0.065830695,-0.010785776,0.001043622,0.058573637,-0.037495406,0.043627902,-0.013696244,0.013060066,0.017712665,0.001883087,0.020061779,-0.007791903,0.004459221,0.038305041,0.041444932,-0.045837204,0.042034799,-0.062707057,-0.005351275,-0.097421195,0.005169121,0.013814807,-0.011319509,-0.036635219,0.018045136,-0.027928753
Longitudinal study of age-specific pattern of coronavirus infection in Lyle’s flying fox (Pteropus lylei) in Thailand,"BACKGROUND: Bats are natural reservoirs for several highly pathogenic and novel viruses including coronaviruses (CoVs) (mainly Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus). Lyle’s flying fox (Pteropus lylei)‘s roosts and foraging sites are usually in the proximity to humans and animals. Knowledge about age-specific pattern of CoV infection in P. lylei, prevalence, and viral shedding at roosts and foraging sites may have an impact on infection-age-structure model to control CoV outbreak. METHODS: P. lylei bats were captured monthly during January–December 2012 for detection of CoV at three areas in Chonburi province; two human dwellings, S1 and S2, where few fruit trees were located with an open pig farm, 0.6 km and 5.5 km away from the bat roost, S3. Nested RT-PCR of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene from rectal swabs was used for CoV detection. The strain of CoV was confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: CoV infection was found in both juveniles and adult bats between May and October (January, in adults only and April, in juveniles only). Of total rectal swab positives (68/367, 18.5%), ratio was higher in bats captured at S1 (11/44, 25.0%) and S2 (35/99, 35.4%) foraging sites than at roost (S3) (22/224, 9.8%). Juveniles (forearm length ≤ 136 mm) were found with more CoV infection than adults at all three sites; S1 (9/24, 37.5% vs 2/20, 10%), S2 (22/49, 44.9% vs 13/50, 26.0%), and S3 (10/30, 33.3% vs 12/194, 6.2%). The average BCI of CoV infected bats was significantly lower than uninfected bats. No gender difference related to infection was found at the sites. Phylogenetic analysis of conserved RdRp gene revealed that the detected CoVs belonged to group D betacoronavirus (n = 64) and alphacoronavirus (n = 4). CONCLUSIONS: The fact that CoV infection and shedding was found in more juvenile than adult bats may suggest transmission from mother during peripartum period. Whether viral reactivation during parturition period or stress is responsible in maintaining transmission in the bat colony needs to be explored.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.012618216,0.220996074,-0.124355706,-0.009219533,0.276018745,0.081037361,0.18342397,0.132890519,-0.032206398,-0.067239475,-0.041214279,-0.084868888,-0.105900935,0.054784795,-0.069636197,0.047097494,0.023143982,0.020350919,0.017396465,-0.01109823,-0.040617314,-0.024430931,0.065784975,-0.035098472,0.044370858,0.030915579,0.016852746,0.015494112,0.004971754,0.074703739
Identification of a novel compound targeting the nuclear export of influenza A virus nucleoprotein,"Although antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of influenza infection, it is an urgent requirement to develop new antiviral drugs regarding the emergence of drug‐resistant viruses. The nucleoprotein (NP) is conserved among all influenza A viruses (IAVs) and has no cellular equivalent. Therefore, NP is an ideal target for the development of new IAV inhibitors. In this study, we identified a novel anti‐influenza compound, ZBMD‐1, from a library of 20,000 compounds using cell‐based influenza A infection assays. We found that ZBMD‐1 inhibited the replication of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A virus strains in vitro, with an IC (50) ranging from 0.41–1.14 μM. Furthermore, ZBMD‐1 inhibited the polymerase activity and specifically impaired the nuclear export of NP. Further investigation indicated that ZBMD‐1 binds to the nuclear export signal 3 (NES3) domain and the dimer interface of the NP pocket. ZBMD‐1 also protected mice that were challenged with lethal doses of A/PR/8/1934 (H1N1) virus, effectively relieving lung histopathology changes, as well as strongly inhibiting the expression of pro‐inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, without inducing toxicity effects in mice. These results suggest that ZBMD‐1 is a promising anti‐influenza compound which can be further investigated as a useful strategy against IAVs in the future.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.016234979,-0.082889609,-0.03650096,0.105851501,-0.126167649,0.324045089,-0.040632662,-0.02672535,0.029722148,-0.058928957,-0.011879269,0.035065776,0.005463429,0.0302828,-0.015213589,-0.009350509,-0.015200616,0.06265287,0.045789446,-0.010637483,0.02044572,0.01412892,0.014498099,0.039499918,0.024203405,0.021154633,0.010861445,-0.010385996,0.073273362,0.045016434
Coronavirus Susceptibility to the Antiviral Remdesivir (GS-5734) Is Mediated by the Viral Polymerase and the Proofreading Exoribonuclease,"Emerging coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe disease in humans, but no approved therapeutics are available. The CoV nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity. We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs in vitro and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model. However, studies with GS-5734 have not reported resistance associated with GS-5734, nor do we understand the action of GS-5734 in wild-type (WT) proofreading CoVs. Here, we show that GS-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with similar 50% effective concentration values (EC(50)) as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Passage of WT MHV in the presence of the GS-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all CoVs that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734, as determined by EC(50). The resistant viruses were unable to compete with WT in direct coinfection passage in the absence of GS-5734. Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same in vitro resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model. Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging CoVs.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.05808731,0.15171342,-0.104662184,-0.008450584,-0.008196394,0.055150684,0.06241213,-0.002151345,0.039799071,-0.021977323,0.015971421,0.003871267,-0.015356927,-0.035226406,0.015379076,0.046309189,-0.0395494,0.065333356,0.031063885,-0.010953699,0.031941391,-0.05073755,0.096494675,0.086034325,0.072187004,0.059087154,-0.038274917,-0.036154336,0.017242028,-0.061101216
Structural and Functional Basis of the Fidelity of Nucleotide Selection by Flavivirus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases,"Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) play a central role not only in viral replication, but also in the genetic evolution of viral RNAs. After binding to an RNA template and selecting 5′-triphosphate ribonucleosides, viral RdRps synthesize an RNA copy according to Watson-Crick base-pairing rules. The copy process sometimes deviates from both the base-pairing rules specified by the template and the natural ribose selectivity and, thus, the process is error-prone due to the intrinsic (in)fidelity of viral RdRps. These enzymes share a number of conserved amino-acid sequence strings, called motifs A–G, which can be defined from a structural and functional point-of-view. A co-relation is gradually emerging between mutations in these motifs and viral genome evolution or observed mutation rates. Here, we review our current knowledge on these motifs and their role on the structural and mechanistic basis of the fidelity of nucleotide selection and RNA synthesis by Flavivirus RdRps.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.207350506,-0.06123874,-0.079857888,0.11564031,-0.030304069,-0.069562404,0.057866444,0.041079482,-0.071960483,0.069164305,0.092626672,0.064047574,-0.032236088,-0.0612199,-0.009097718,0.003225641,-0.020467251,-0.030118863,-0.089625989,-0.009012124,0.021518989,-0.019300755,-0.021722025,0.029290962,-0.066214571,-0.020512633,0.033567432,-0.019676285,-0.015485681,-0.016043596
Near-Patient Sampling to Assist Infection Control—A Case Report and Discussion,"Air sampling as an aid to infection control is still in an experimental stage, as there is no consensus about which air samplers and pathogen detection methods should be used, and what thresholds of specific pathogens in specific exposed populations (staff, patients, or visitors) constitutes a true clinical risk. This case report used a button sampler, worn or held by staff or left free-standing in a fixed location, for environmental sampling around a child who was chronically infected by a respiratory adenovirus, to determine whether there was any risk of secondary adenovirus infection to the staff managing the patient. Despite multiple air samples taken on difference days, coinciding with high levels of adenovirus detectable in the child’s nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs), none of the air samples contained any detectable adenovirus DNA using a clinically validated diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Although highly sensitive, in-house PCR assays have been developed to detect airborne pathogen RNA/DNA, it is still unclear what level of specific pathogen RNA/DNA constitutes a true clinical risk. In this case, the absence of detectable airborne adenovirus DNA using a conventional diagnostic assay removed the requirement for staff to wear surgical masks and face visors when they entered the child’s room. No subsequent staff infections or outbreaks of adenovirus have so far been identified.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.05167352,0.007286684,0.081265056,-0.016806278,-0.024484054,-0.031796694,0.029396514,0.021743529,-0.019713793,0.032175866,-0.001337049,-0.034985023,0.015965343,-0.025471678,0.034825771,0.006284481,-0.040396237,-0.033792254,0.011690779,-0.065490439,-0.000677165,0.051030055,0.018211094,-0.028521023,-0.028897023,-0.018286621,-0.045984654,0.050098535,-0.055157597,-0.019344562
Epidemiological study of hemotropic mycoplasmas (hemoplasmas) in cats from central Spain,"BACKGROUND: Hemotropic mycoplasmas (hemoplasmas) have been found infecting cats worldwide. However, studies about feline hemoplasma infections in Spain are scarce. Therefore, the purpose of the research was to evaluate the prevalence of feline hemotropic mycoplasmas and to characterize risk factors and clinical findings associated with these infections in a cat population from the Madrid area, Spain. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to detect Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf), “Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum” (CMhm) and “Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis” (CMt) in blood samples from 456 client-owned and 138 stray cats from Madrid. In order to assess associations between these hemoplasma infections and epidemiological parameters, data regarding signalment, environment, prophylaxis measures, retrovirus status, clinical signs and laboratory findings were compiled, whenever possible. RESULTS: DNA of feline hemoplasmas was detected from the blood of 63 out of 594 cats (10.6%), with a prevalence of 3.7% (22/594) for Mhf, 8.1% (48/594) for CMhm and 0.5% (3/594) for CMt. Stray cats had statistically higher prevalences of feline hemoplasmas (15.9%) and, specifically, of Mhf (8.7%) than client-owned cats (9 and 2.2%, respectively). A total of seven cats (1.17%) were co-infected with “Candidatus M. haemominutum” and M. haemofelis, two (0.33%) with “Candidatus M. haemominutum” and “Candidatus M. turicensis” and another one (0.17%) with M. haemofelis and Candidatus “M. turicensis”. Male gender, collection of blood during warm months and FeLV/FIV positivity status were associated with hemotropic mycoplasma infection in cats from Madrid. Additionally, within the group of client-owned cats, hemoplasma infection was associated with adult age, outdoor access, and the existence of low haematocrit, erythrocyte count and haemoglobin concentration values. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first epidemiological survey of feline hemoplasmas performed in central Spain (Madrid). Our study confirms that “Ca. Mycoplasma haemominutum”, Mycoplasma haemofelis and “Ca. Mycoplasma turicensis” are infecting client-owned and stray cats in this region of Spain, “Ca. Mycoplasma haemominutum” being the most prevalent species. More studies are necessary to help understand the role of the natural infection by these species of hemoplasma in cats.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.035796549,-0.02830806,0.043347633,-0.196406764,0.015758483,0.021839804,0.072628714,0.003867627,-0.066979313,-0.140489467,0.384693545,-0.143687801,0.207803988,-0.070482404,-0.109303318,-0.025684366,0.032821542,-0.008941443,0.021520914,0.077072885,-0.024936245,-0.006497519,0.069498179,0.012957114,-0.014740768,0.021447667,-0.0203111,0.050875082,0.032337029,-0.012799644
"Avian viral surveillance in Victoria, Australia, and detection of two novel avian herpesviruses","Viruses in avian hosts can pose threats to avian health and some have zoonotic potential. Hospitals that provide veterinary care for avian patients may serve as a site of exposure of other birds and human staff in the facility to these viruses. They can also provide a useful location to collect samples from avian patients in order to examine the viruses present in wild birds. This study aimed to investigate viruses of biosecurity and/or zoonotic significance in Australian birds by screening samples collected from 409 birds presented to the Australian Wildlife Health Centre at Zoos Victoria’s Healesville Sanctuary for veterinary care between December 2014 and December 2015. Samples were tested for avian influenza viruses, herpesviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses, using genus- or family-wide polymerase chain reaction methods coupled with sequencing and phylogenetic analyses for detection and identification of both known and novel viruses. A very low prevalence of viruses was detected. Columbid alphaherpesvirus 1 was detected from a powerful owl (Ninox strenua) with inclusion body hepatitis, and an avian paramyxovirus most similar to Avian avulavirus 5 was detected from a musk lorikeet (Glossopsitta concinna). Two distinct novel avian alphaherpesviruses were detected in samples from a sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita) and a tawny frogmouth (Podargus strigoides). Avian influenza viruses and avian coronaviruses were not detected. The clinical significance of the newly detected viruses remains undetermined. Further studies are needed to assess the host specificity, epidemiology, pathogenicity and host-pathogen relationships of these novel viruses. Further genome characterization is also indicated, and would be required before these viruses can be formally classified taxonomically. The detection of these viruses contributes to our knowledge on avian virodiversity. The low level of avian virus detection, and the absence of any viruses with zoonotic potential, suggests low risk to biosecurity and human health.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.048300059,-0.042586196,0.020240386,0.088839051,0.121178037,0.141348557,0.054024563,0.029508333,-0.064141099,0.091108811,-0.008115575,-0.018444981,0.03420067,0.024620446,0.020758179,-0.010616955,-0.013888446,-0.046904176,0.012011149,0.022489231,0.036690466,0.024566887,-0.064581454,0.087535456,-0.060904707,-0.02193946,-0.028790142,-0.001103162,-0.023067171,-0.116116229
Rapid detection of potyviruses from crude plant extracts,"Potyviruses (genus Potyvirus; family Potyviridae) are widely distributed and represent one of the most economically important genera of plant viruses. Therefore, their accurate detection is a key factor in developing efficient control strategies. However, this can sometimes be problematic particularly in plant species containing high amounts of polysaccharides and polyphenols such as yam (Dioscorea spp.). Here, we report the development of a reliable, rapid and cost-effective detection method for the two most important potyviruses infecting yam based on reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA). The developed method, named ‘Direct RT-RPA’, detects each target virus directly from plant leaf extracts prepared with a simple and inexpensive extraction method avoiding laborious extraction of high-quality RNA. Direct RT-RPA enables the detection of virus-positive samples in under 30 min at a single low operation temperature (37 °C) without the need for any expensive instrumentation. The Direct RT-RPA tests constitute robust, accurate, sensitive and quick methods for detection of potyviruses from recalcitrant plant species. The minimal sample preparation requirements and the possibility of storing RPA reagents without cold chain storage, allow Direct RT-RPA to be adopted in minimally equipped laboratories and with potential use in plant clinic laboratories and seed certification facilities worldwide.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.007377672,0.085556336,0.279062487,0.11060411,-0.06377264,-0.057854819,0.08137724,0.046472438,-0.028865035,-0.057762151,-0.074421094,0.042258358,-0.030946752,-0.061010089,-0.081446995,0.119101337,-0.06019261,-0.067365732,0.12331441,0.242775139,0.053400123,-0.00656918,-0.048507012,-0.034832924,-0.085627192,0.044531627,0.06084607,0.013158503,0.090862078,-0.043825281
Comparison of Respiratory Pathogen Detection in Upper versus Lower Respiratory Tract Samples Using the BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel in the Immunocompromised Host,"BACKGROUND: The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (FARP) (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc.) is a multiplex, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique that can detect 17 respiratory viruses and 3 bacterial targets in a single reaction. Immunocompromised hosts (ICH) with respiratory illnesses often undergo bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). This prospective study aimed to evaluate the yield and concordance of NP and BAL FARP testing when performed on the same patient concurrently. METHODS: From February to December 2016, 125 patients (100 ICH and 25 non-ICH) were enrolled. NP swabs and BAL samples were sent for FARP testing. RESULTS: The yield of the BAL FARP among ICH and non-ICH was 24% (24/100) and 8% (2/25), respectively. The yield of positive NP swabs in ICH was 27% (27/100) versus 4% (1/25) in non-ICH. The majority of patients (89%; 111/125) had concordant results between NP and BAL specimens. Of the 24 ICH patients who had a positive BAL FARP, the majority (79%) had the same pathogen detected from the NP swab. CONCLUSION: The FARP may be useful in the ICH. Given the high concordance, in patients whom a pathogen is identified on the NP FARP, a FARP performed on BAL will likely yield the same result. However, if the NP FARP is negative, performing the test on a BAL sample may have an incremental yield.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.051183775,-0.016442379,0.003383345,-0.071226941,-0.030044872,-0.009191423,-0.005270656,0.037295953,-0.04313735,0.005277325,-0.013918482,0.026547953,-0.011266929,0.001187016,-1.92E-05,0.005778622,0.012743184,0.00093043,0.001037276,-0.034679069,0.019772429,-0.030829063,0.004833132,-0.039229614,0.017827535,0.0040146,-0.023543419,-0.014748505,-0.014784195,-0.033212631
"Ebolavirus diagnosis made simple, comparable and faster than molecular detection methods: preparing for the future","BACKGROUND: The 2014/2015 Ebolavirus outbreak resulted in more than 28,000 cases and 11,323 reported deaths, as of March 2016. Domestic transmission of the Guinea strain associated with the outbreak occurred mainly in six African countries, and international transmission was reported in four countries. Outbreak management was limited by the inability to rapidly diagnose infected cases. A further fifteen countries in Africa are predicted to be at risk of Ebolavirus outbreaks in the future as a consequence of climate change and urbanization. Early detection of cases and reduction of transmission rates is critical to prevent and manage future severe outbreaks. We designed a rapid assay for detection of Ebolavirus using recombinase polymerase amplification, a rapid isothermal amplification technology that can be combined with portable lateral flow detection technology. The developed rapid assay operates in 30 min and was comparable with real-time TaqMan™ PCR. METHODS: Designed, screened, selected and optimized oligonucleotides using the NP coding region from Ebola Zaire virus (Guinea strain). We determined the analytical sensitivity of our Ebola rapid molecular test by testing selected primers and probe with tenfold serial dilutions (1.34 × 10(10−) 1.34 × 10(1) copies/μL) of cloned NP gene from Mayinga strain of Zaire ebolavirus in pCAGGS vector, and serially diluted cultured Ebolavirus as established by real-time TaqMan™ PCR that was performed using ABI7500 in Fast Mode. We tested extracted and reverse transcribed RNA from cultured Zaire ebolavirus strains – Mayinga, Gueckedou C05, Gueckedou C07, Makona, Kissidougou and Kiwit. We determined the analytical specificity of our assay with related viruses: Marburg, Ebola Reston and Ebola Sudan. We further tested for Dengue virus 1–4, Plasmodium falciparum and West Nile Virus (Kunjin strain). RESULTS: The assay had a detection limit of 134 copies per μL of plasmid containing the NP gene of Ebolavirus Mayinga, and cultured Ebolavirus and was highly specific for the Zaire ebolavirus species, including the Guinea strain responsible for the 2014/2015 outbreak. The assay did not detect related viruses like Marburg, Reston, or Sudan viruses, and other pathogens likely to be isolated from clinical samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our assay could be suitable for implementation in district and primary health laboratories, as only a heating block and centrifuge is required for operation. The technique could provide a pathway for rapid screening of patients and animals for improved management of outbreaks.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.030891781,0.059059834,0.158770083,0.029828349,-0.006341177,0.009064054,-0.000265164,0.031265342,-0.006024671,-0.012197221,-0.040528324,0.016627592,-0.013417814,-0.04189763,-0.000686812,-0.005261677,-0.042691813,-0.005874019,0.030963546,0.030230874,0.032912783,0.0033459,-0.006781707,0.006652461,-0.033260632,0.027344027,0.032473471,0.047404455,-0.061262603,0.029061975
Respiratory virus of severe pneumonia in South Korea: Prevalence and clinical implications,"BACKGROUND: Severe viral pneumonia is associated with a high mortality rate. However, due to the vulnerability of critically ill patients, invasive diagnostic methods should be performed with caution in the intensive care unit (ICU). It would be helpful if the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical impact of virus detection are elucidated. METHODS: We evaluated patients with severe pneumonia between January 1(st) 2008 and December 31(st) 2015. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was performed for 8 respiratory viruses when viral pathogen could not be excluded as the origin of severe pneumonia. The baseline characteristics, laboratory results, microbiological findings, and clinical outcomes of the patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 2,347 patients admitted to the medical ICU, 515 underwent RT-PCR for respiratory viruses, 69 of whom had positive results. The detection rate was higher during the winter, with a community onset, in patients with history of recent chemotherapy, and low platelet count. Additional bronchoscopic sampling along with upper respiratory specimen increased the yield of viral detection. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most common pathogen detected, while influenza A was the most common virus with bacterial coinfection. Respiratory virus detection led to changes in clinical management in one-third of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of viral pathogens in patients with severe pneumonia is not rare, and can be more common in certain group of patients. Invasive sampling for RT-PCR can be helpful, and such detection can lead to positive changes in clinical management.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.295008098,0.002940456,-0.023067028,0.025855907,-0.068191968,-0.090670917,-0.062834669,0.120155158,-0.205570367,0.123685483,-0.047767167,-0.017088863,0.044248306,0.105908374,-0.052133705,-0.043254685,0.04598464,0.041077813,-0.041067421,0.080552927,0.035281267,-0.004909458,0.000591205,0.028503872,0.015773933,-0.021397044,0.044452494,-0.031283163,-0.052555676,-0.02572652
Enteric Virus Diversity Examined by Molecular Methods in Brazilian Poultry Flocks,"Enteric viruses play an important role in the Brazilian poultry industry due to the economic impact of resulting low yields of broilers, layers, and breeders. The most common enteric viruses affecting commercial flocks in Brazil include Fowl Adenovirus of group I (FAdV-I), Chicken Parvovirus (ChPV), Chicken Astrovirus (CAstV), Avian Nephritis Virus (ANV), Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), Avian Reovirus (AReo), and Avian Rotavirus (ARtV). The aim of this study was to identify single and multiple infections using data obtained from 270 samples from eleven Brazilian states, corresponding to the period between 2010 and 2017. This was accompanied by an analysis of the relationship between the age of birds, clinical signs, and geographical distribution, using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) techniques. Twenty-five profiles of virus combinations were detected. Single infections were encountered in 86.3% of samples, and multiple infections were present in the remaining 13.7%. Both single and multiple infections affected all kinds of commercial chickens with digestive problems, stunting syndrome, decreases in egg and meat production, increased mortality, and respiratory signs. FAdV-I, ChPV, CAstV, ANV, and ARtV were mostly detected in young broilers, in contrast with IBV, which was detected in hens from one to greater than 51 weeks of age. These results exhibit the complexity of enteric diseases and the still poorly understood role of each pathogen as a unique etiological agent.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.066530448,-0.03677268,0.088084753,-0.021791209,0.131233159,0.037146353,-0.02575927,-0.070611346,0.064343791,0.240310036,0.084825908,-0.037825198,-0.018448909,0.045610198,-0.017436494,0.043366103,0.023770917,-0.035542379,0.020401892,-0.006444731,-0.014177746,0.026099609,-0.052884217,0.015952885,0.013346576,-0.029457644,-0.018379664,-0.026360546,0.025057021,-0.065585734
Differential Shape of Geminivirus Mutant Spectra Across Cultivated and Wild Hosts With Invariant Viral Consensus Sequences,"Geminiviruses (family Geminiviridae) possess single-stranded circular DNA genomes that are replicated by cellular polymerases in plant host cell nuclei. In their hosts, geminivirus populations behave as ensembles of mutant and recombinant genomes, known as viral quasispecies. This favors the emergence of new geminiviruses with altered host range, facilitating new or more severe diseases or overcoming resistance traits. In warm and temperate areas several whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses of the genus Begomovirus cause the tomato yellow leaf curl disease (TYLCD) with significant economic consequences. TYLCD is frequently controlled in commercial tomatoes by using the dominant Ty-1 resistance gene. Over a 45 day period we have studied the diversification of three begomoviruses causing TYLCD: tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV) and tomato yellow leaf curl Malaga virus (TYLCMaV, a natural recombinant between TYLCV and TYLCSV). Viral quasispecies resulting from inoculation of geminivirus infectious clones were examined in plants of susceptible tomato (ty-1/ty-1), heterozygous resistant tomato (Ty-1/ty-1), common bean, and the wild reservoir Solanum nigrum. Differences in virus fitness across hosts were observed while viral consensus sequences remained invariant. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of the quasispecies were high, especially in common bean and the wild host. Interestingly, the presence or absence of the Ty-1 allele in tomato did not lead to differences in begomovirus mutant spectra. However, the fitness decrease of TYLCSV and TYLCV in tomato at 45 dpi might be related to an increase in CP (Coat protein) mutation frequency. In Solanum nigrum the recombinant TYLCMaV, which showed lower fitness than TYLCSV, at 45 dpi actively explored Rep (Replication associated protein) ORF but not the overlapping C4. Our results underline the importance of begomovirus mutant spectra during infections. This is especially relevant in the wild reservoir of the viruses, which has the potential to maintain highly diverse mutant spectra without modifying their consensus sequences.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.077034629,-0.043437559,-0.004720552,-0.025942736,0.003611362,0.040855164,0.052535885,-0.004369213,0.006201757,0.032659668,-0.018007229,-0.019604279,0.00452619,-0.011613761,0.002834797,0.007918876,-0.018439202,-0.01539077,-0.034841603,0.033878908,0.022148654,-0.00649132,-0.029023887,0.062907122,-0.037488044,0.002236105,0.031956854,-0.034669282,-0.03371356,-0.012487881
Expression Profiles of mRNA and lncRNA in HCT-8 Cells Infected With Cryptosporidium parvum IId Subtype,"Cryptosporidium parvum is one of the most important enteric protozoan pathogens, responsible for severe diarrhea in immunocompromised human and livestock. However, few effective agents were available for controlling this parasite. Accumulating evidences suggest that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) played key roles in many diseases through regulating the gene expression. Here, the expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs were analyzed in HCT-8 cells infected with C. parvum IId subtype using microarray assay. A total of 821 lncRNAs and 1,349 mRNAs were differentially expressed in infected cells at 24 h post infection (pi). Of them, all five types of lncRNAs were identified, including 22 sense, 280 antisense, 312 intergenic, 44 divergent, 33 intronic lncRNAs, and 130 lncRNAs that were not found the relationship with mRNAs’ location. Additionally, real-time polymerase chain reactions of 10 lncRNAs and 10 mRNAs randomly selected were successfully confirmed the microarray results. The co-expression and target prediction analysis indicated that 27 mRNAs were cis-regulated by 29 lncRNAs and 109 were trans-regulated by 114 lncRNAs. These predicted targets were enriched in several pathways involved in the interaction between host and C. parvum, e.g., hedgehog signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, and tight junction, suggesting that these differentially expressed lncRNAs would play important regulating roles during the infection of C. parvum IId subtype.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.065693153,-0.030534087,0.013131921,-0.089620928,-0.039618297,0.022095899,0.012563961,-0.015456308,0.03009915,-0.044536898,-0.051435133,-0.019427975,-0.009456252,0.037544939,0.008756758,0.004329618,-0.012469169,-0.02428026,-0.006672499,-0.018835615,0.020233045,0.010654278,-0.007653615,-0.017465891,-0.01515491,-0.047742612,-0.003656017,0.009856875,0.045880358,-0.020427581
Transmission of rhinovirus in the Utah BIG-LoVE families: Consequences of age and household structure,"BACKGROUND: Common cold viruses create significant health and financial burdens, and understanding key loci of transmission would help focus control strategies. This study (1) examines factors that influence when individuals transition from a negative to positive test (acquisition) or a positive to negative test (loss) of rhinovirus (HRV) and other respiratory tract viruses in 26 households followed weekly for one year, (2) investigates evidence for intrahousehold and interhousehold transmission and the characteristics of individuals implicated in transmission, and (3) builds data-based simulation models to identify factors that most strongly affect patterns of prevalence. METHODS: We detected HRV, coronavirus, paramyxovirus, influenza and bocavirus with the FilmArray polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform (BioFire Diagnostics, LLC). We used logistic regression to find covariates affecting acquisition or loss of HRV including demographic characteristics of individuals, their household, their current infection status, and prevalence within their household and across the population. We apply generalized linear mixed models to test robustness of results. RESULTS: Acquisition of HRV was less probable in older individuals and those infected with a coronavirus, and higher with a higher proportion of other household members infected. Loss of HRV is reduced with a higher proportion of other household members infected. Within households, only children and symptomatic individuals show evidence for transmission, while between households only a higher number of infected older children (ages 5-19) increases the probability of acquisition. Coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses and bocavirus also show evidence of intrahousehold transmission. Simulations show that age-dependent susceptibility and transmission have the largest effects on mean HRV prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Children are most likely to acquire and most likely to transmit HRV both within and between households, with infectiousness concentrated in symptomatic children. Simulations predict that the spread of HRV and other respiratory tract viruses can be reduced but not eliminated by practices within the home.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.10530578,-0.063301826,-0.056812026,-0.021334272,0.036937439,-0.018394389,0.067840352,-0.017392182,0.05334227,-0.030062409,0.025202096,-0.019290261,-0.025873887,-0.022883707,0.034721236,0.047296804,-0.033706104,-0.055577177,0.036687438,-0.062230865,-0.048821192,-0.052005164,-0.108262127,0.069921813,-0.099099609,0.139017171,-0.091376124,-0.02506524,0.098960768,0.191673093
The conserved stem-loop II structure at the 3' untranslated region of Japanese encephalitis virus genome is required for the formation of subgenomic flaviviral RNA,"Flaviviruses accumulate abundant subgenomic RNA (sfRNA) in infected cells. It has been reported that sfRNA results from stalling of host 5’-to-3’ exoribonuclease XRN1 at the highly structured RNA of the 3’ untranslated region (UTR). Although XRN1 digestion of a 3’-terminal 800-nt RNA could stall at a position to generate the sfRNA in vitro, we found that knocking out XRN1 had no effect on the accumulation of sfRNA in Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infected cells. Mutagenesis studies revealed that the stemloop II (SLII) at the 3’ UTR is required for the accumulation of sfRNA. According to the results of an in vitro RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) assay, the (-)10431-10566 RNA fragment, containing the putative promoter on the antigenome for the sfRNA transcription, binds to RdRp protein and exhibits a strong promoter activity. Taken together, our results indicate that the JEV sfRNA could be transcribed initially and then be trimmed by XRN1 or other unidentified exoribonucleases.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.208209589,-0.043534447,-0.052565038,0.064714924,-0.028608868,-0.068863393,-0.018003807,0.018381591,-0.026562368,-0.026298499,0.057164639,0.024364603,-0.067902523,0.057759099,-0.01260834,0.016722118,0.021070773,-0.035804042,0.005105191,-0.027778898,0.017188506,0.001273793,0.021887933,-0.053961582,-0.008530796,-0.007976645,-0.01329776,0.043429031,0.039066867,0.043695085
Inhibition of enterovirus 71 replication and viral 3C protease by quercetin,"BACKGROUND: Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of the major causative agents of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), which is sometimes associated with severe central nervous system disease in children. There is currently no specific medication for EV71 infection. Quercetin, one of the most widely distributed flavonoids in plants, has been demonstrated to inhibit various viral infections. However, investigation of the anti-EV71 mechanism has not been reported to date. METHODS: The anti-EV71 activity of quercetin was evaluated by phenotype screening, determining the cytopathic effect (CPE) and EV71-induced cells apoptosis. The effects on EV71 replication were evaluated further by determining virus yield, viral RNA synthesis and protein expression, respectively. The mechanism of action against EV71 was determined from the effective stage and time-of-addition assays. The possible inhibitory functions of quercetin via viral 2Apro, 3C(pro) or 3D(pol) were tested. The interaction between EV71 3C(pro) and quercetin was predicted and calculated by molecular docking. RESULTS: Quercetin inhibited EV71-mediated cytopathogenic effects, reduced EV71 progeny yields, and prevented EV71-induced apoptosis with low cytotoxicity. Investigation of the underlying mechanism of action revealed that quercetin exhibited a preventive effect against EV71 infection and inhibited viral adsorption. Moreover, quercetin mediated its powerful therapeutic effects primarily by blocking the early post-attachment stage of viral infection. Further experiments demonstrated that quercetin potently inhibited the activity of the EV71 protease, 3C(pro), blocking viral replication, but not the activity of the protease, 2A(pro), or the RNA polymerase, 3D(pol). Modeling of the molecular binding of the 3C(pro)-quercetin complex revealed that quercetin was predicted to insert into the substrate-binding pocket of EV71 3C(pro), blocking substrate recognition and thereby inhibiting EV71 3C(pro) activity. CONCLUSIONS: Quercetin can effectively prevent EV71-induced cell injury with low toxicity to host cells. Quercetin may act in more than one way to deter viral infection, exhibiting some preventive and a powerful therapeutic effect against EV71. Further, quercetin potently inhibits EV71 3C(pro) activity, thereby blocking EV71 replication.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.076011567,-0.036386872,-0.015202872,-0.051765151,-0.087711665,0.031149182,0.048894055,-0.020197665,0.039609218,-0.011067827,-0.011855943,0.014404768,-0.015621201,0.023560876,-0.014841222,0.013959891,0.012164465,0.021537733,0.009796651,-0.022251165,-0.008632096,0.004041436,-0.020174092,0.014137214,0.041748931,0.018701376,-0.020366072,0.016997234,0.009702231,-0.029074991
Expanding severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance beyond influenza: The process and data from 1 year of implementation in Vietnam,"BACKGROUND: In 2016, as a component of the Global Health Security Agenda, the Vietnam Ministry of Health expanded its existing influenza sentinel surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) to include testing for 7 additional viral respiratory pathogens. This article describes the steps taken to implement expanded SARI surveillance in Vietnam and reports data from 1 year of expanded surveillance. METHODS: The process of expanding the suite of pathogens for routine testing by real‐time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (rRT‐PCR) included laboratory trainings, procurement/distribution of reagents, and strengthening and aligning SARI surveillance epidemiology practices at sentinel sites and regional institutes (RI). RESULTS: Surveillance data showed that of 4003 specimens tested by the RI laboratories, 20.2% (n = 810) were positive for influenza virus. Of the 3193 influenza‐negative specimens, 41.8% (n = 1337) were positive for at least 1 non‐influenza respiratory virus, of which 16.2% (n = 518), 13.4% (n = 428), and 9.6% (n = 308) tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus, respectively.

Enhanced pathogenicity of low-pathogenic H9N2 avian influenza virus after vaccination with infectious bronchitis live attenuated vaccine,"AIM: In the present study, two experiments were carried out for studying the pathogenicity of H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) in broiler chickens after vaccination with different live respiratory viral vaccines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicks were divided into four groups in each experiment. In experiment 1, Groups 1 and 2 were inoculated with H9N2 AIV through nasal route in 1 day old, Groups 1 and 3 were vaccinated with live infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) vaccine in 5 days old, and Group 4 was left as a negative control. In experiment 2, Groups 5 and 6 were inoculated with AIV subtype H9N2 through nasal route in 1 day old, Group 5 was vaccinated with live IBV vaccine and live Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine in 5 and 18 days old, respectively, Groups 6 and 7 were vaccinated with live NDV vaccine in 18 days old, and Group 8 was left as a negative control. Chicks were kept in isolators for 18 days in the first experiment and 35 days in the second experiment. Tracheal and cloacal swabs were collected from 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, and 15 day’s old chicks from all groups in experiment 1 and 21, 23, 25, and 28 days old from all groups in experiment 2. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was applied on the collected tracheal swabs for detecting RNA copies of H9N2 AIV. Cloacal swabs and the positive rRT-PCR tracheal swabs were inoculated in 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) to confirm rRT-PCR results. Internal organs (kidney, trachea, and spleen) from all chicken groups were collected weekly for histopathological examination to determine severity of the lesions. Serum samples were collected on a weekly basis for the detection of humoral immune response against H9N2, NDV, and IBV from all chicken groups. RESULTS: rRT-PCR results with virus titration in ECEs revealed a significant increase in H9N2 AIV titer with extension in the period of viral shedding in Groups 1 and 5. Severe lesion score was observed for Groups 1 and 5. The humoral immune response against H9N2 AIV, NDV, and IBV revealed a significant increase in H9N2 AIV titer in Groups 1 and 5, NDV titer showed a significant increase in Group 7, and IBV titer increased in Groups 1, 3, and 5. CONCLUSION: Results demonstrated the increase in pathogenicity of H9N2 AIV, especially when H9N2-infected chicks vaccinated with live IBV vaccine.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.021268788,-0.0166668,0.048011369,-0.101420202,0.074427263,0.08540191,-0.093449687,-0.038634094,0.048111617,0.154976093,0.085877185,-0.004208129,-0.097644705,0.053536423,-0.049911607,0.096350694,-0.003318342,-0.0190053,0.027101458,-0.003992007,-0.058438619,-0.043717927,-0.004421967,-0.059002007,-0.008821686,0.008028862,-0.022180996,-0.014051671,0.024082579,-0.034951271
Coxsackievirus A6 Induces Cell Cycle Arrest in G0/G1 Phase for Viral Production,"Recent epidemiological data indicate that outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), which can be categorized according to its clinical symptoms as typical or atypical, have markedly increased worldwide. A primary causative agent for typical HFMD outbreaks, enterovirus 71 (EV71), has been shown to manipulate the cell cycle in S phase for own replication; however, it is not clear whether coxsackievirus (CVA6), the main agent for atypical HFMD, also regulates the host cell cycle. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that CVA6 infection arrests the host cell cycle in G0/G1-phase. Furthermore, synchronization in G0/G1 phase, but not S phase or G2/M phase, promotes viral production. To investigate the mechanism of cell cycle arrest induced by CVA6 infection, we analyzed cell cycle progression after cell cycle synchronization at G0/G1 or G2/M. Our results demonstrate that CVA6 infection promotes G0/G1 phase entry from G2/M phase, and inhibits G0/G1 exit into S phase. In line with its role to arrest cells in G0/G1 phase, the expression of cyclinD1, CDK4, cyclinE1, CDK2, cyclinB1, CDK1, P53, P21, and P16 is regulated by CVA6. Finally, the non-structural proteins of CVA6, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D and protease 3C , are demonstrated to be responsible for the G0/G1-phase arrest. These findings suggest that CVA6 infection arrested cell cycle in G0/G1-phase via non-structural proteins 3D and 3C, which may provide favorable environments for virus production.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.078525535,-0.032827003,-0.019393883,-0.076658191,-0.085316274,0.040302886,0.045883006,-0.026012707,0.031481964,0.003822585,-0.024323332,-0.008124258,-0.015152004,0.045998405,0.007663767,0.019070437,0.006755318,-0.016813353,-0.009088836,0.008850773,0.011152201,-0.002586351,-0.024308263,-0.031366042,0.017487304,0.028335721,-0.013067075,0.037826667,-0.024912699,-0.043297304
Overview of Trends in the Application of Metagenomic Techniques in the Analysis of Human Enteric Viral Diversity in Africa’s Environmental Regimes,"There has been an increase in the quest for metagenomics as an approach for the identification and study of the diversity of human viruses found in aquatic systems, both for their role as waterborne pathogens and as water quality indicators. In the last few years, environmental viral metagenomics has grown significantly and has enabled the identification, diversity and entire genome sequencing of viruses in environmental and clinical samples extensively. Prior to the arrival of metagenomics, traditional molecular procedures such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing, were mostly used to identify and classify enteric viral species in different environmental milieu. After the advent of metagenomics, more detailed reports have emerged about the important waterborne viruses identified in wastewater treatment plant effluents and surface water. This paper provides a review of methods that have been used for the concentration, detection and identification of viral species from different environmental matrices. The review also takes into consideration where metagenomics has been explored in different African countries, as well as the limitations and challenges facing the approach. Procedures including sample processing, experimental design, sequencing technology, and bioinformatics analysis are discussed. The review concludes by summarising the current thinking and practices in the field and lays bare key issues that those venturing into this field need to consider and address.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.011561807,-0.014688391,0.057263762,0.002089799,0.007751713,0.045257994,0.107713955,0.017976237,-0.027304282,0.079815803,-0.0295369,-0.022410659,0.055913741,-0.05532443,0.041900878,-0.018687047,-0.043847248,-0.007111374,-0.052875933,-0.017917471,-0.013977845,0.018499503,-0.036170228,0.005482513,-0.038738867,-0.025862065,0.019218097,-0.013370166,-0.013229567,0.000218296
Potential Therapeutic Agents for Feline Calicivirus Infection,"Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a major cause of upper respiratory tract disease in cats, with widespread distribution in the feline population. Recently, virulent systemic diseases caused by FCV infection has been associated with mortality rates up to 50%. Currently, there are no direct-acting antivirals approved for the treatment of FCV infection. Here, we tested 15 compounds from different antiviral classes against FCV using in vitro protein and cell culture assays. After the expression of FCV protease-polymerase protein, we established two in vitro assays to assess the inhibitory activity of compounds directly against the FCV protease or polymerase. Using this recombinant enzyme, we identified quercetagetin and PPNDS as inhibitors of FCV polymerase activity (IC(50) values of 2.8 μM and 2.7 μM, respectively). We also demonstrate the inhibition of FCV protease activity by GC376 (IC(50) of 18 µM). Using cell culture assays, PPNDS, quercetagetin and GC376 did not display antivirals effects, however, we identified nitazoxanide and 2′-C-methylcytidine (2CMC) as potent inhibitors of FCV replication, with EC(50) values in the low micromolar range (0.6 μM and 2.5 μM, respectively). In conclusion, we established two in vitro assays that will accelerate the research for FCV antivirals and can be used for the high-throughput screening of direct-acting antivirals.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.048691547,-0.022770058,0.005279582,-0.071346603,-0.077918532,0.057222313,0.059916679,-0.019100565,0.036174605,-0.031556049,0.06739813,0.008464196,0.045172509,-0.010873697,-0.034993362,-0.026057536,0.014715106,0.07571971,0.086888695,-0.01898595,-0.00050693,-0.01396416,0.033352963,0.020045598,0.019717257,0.034830164,-0.00961859,-0.024905566,0.032710694,-0.015122225
Association between semi-quantitative microbial load and respiratory symptoms among Thai military recruits: a prospective cohort study,"BACKGROUND: Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assays have improved diagnostic sensitivity for a wide range of pathogens. However, co-detection of multiple agents and bacterial colonization make it difficult to distinguish between asymptomatic infection or illness aetiology. We assessed whether semi-quantitative microbial load data can differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic states for common respiratory pathogens. METHODS: We obtained throat and nasal swab samples from military trainees at two Thai Army barracks. Specimens were collected at the start and end of 10-week training periods (non-acute samples), and from individuals who developed upper respiratory tract infection during training (acute samples). We analysed the samples using a commercial multiplex respiratory panel comprising 33 bacterial, viral and fungal targets. We used random effects tobit models to compare cycle threshold (Ct) value distributions from non-acute and acute samples. RESULTS: We analysed 341 non-acute and 145 acute swab samples from 274 participants. Haemophilus influenzae type B was the most commonly detected microbe (77.4% of non-acute and 64.8% of acute samples). In acute samples, nine specific microbe pairs were detected more frequently than expected by chance. Regression models indicated significantly lower microbial load in non-acute relative to acute samples for H. influenzae non-type B, Streptococcus pneumoniae and rhinovirus, although it was not possible to identify a Ct-value threshold indicating causal etiology for any of these organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Semi-quantitative measures of microbial concentration did not reliably differentiate between illness and asymptomatic colonization, suggesting that clinical symptoms may not always be directly related to microbial load for common respiratory infections.

Host Shutoff in Influenza A Virus: Many Means to an End,"Influenza A virus carries few of its own proteins, but uses them effectively to take control of the infected cells and avoid immune responses. Over the years, host shutoff, the widespread down-regulation of host gene expression, has emerged as a key process that contributes to cellular takeover in infected cells. Interestingly, multiple mechanisms of host shutoff have been described in influenza A virus, involving changes in translation, RNA synthesis and stability. Several viral proteins, notably the non-structural protein NS1, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the endoribonuclease PA-X have been implicated in host shutoff. This multitude of host shutoff mechanisms indicates that host shutoff is an important component of the influenza A virus replication cycle. Here we review the various mechanisms of host shutoff in influenza A virus and the evidence that they contribute to immune evasion and/or viral replication. We also discuss what the purpose of having multiple mechanisms may be.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.120643566,-0.097275452,-0.068982487,0.092038185,-0.08311378,0.163563255,0.004383733,-0.018015593,0.01726949,-0.015309971,-0.014537697,-0.068216668,0.007706923,0.112126084,-0.011116806,0.023954207,0.010807839,-0.063729522,-0.034534268,0.059634002,-0.02147058,0.059806999,-0.041928917,-0.01254036,-0.021880905,-0.032901623,0.025570878,-0.020619975,-0.014972677,0.033584937
"Epidemiology of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness and Risk Factors for Influenza Infection and Clinical Severity among Adults in Malawi, 2011–2013","Data on the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in adults from low-income, high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence African settings are scarce. We conducted adult SARI surveillance in Blantyre, Malawi. From January 2011 to December 2013, individuals aged ≥ 15 years with SARI (both inpatients and outpatients) were enrolled at a large teaching hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction. We estimated hospital-attended influenza-positive SARI incidence rates and assessed factors associated with influenza positivity and clinical severity (Modified Early Warning Score > 4). We enrolled 1,126 SARI cases; 163 (14.5%) were positive for influenza. Human immunodeficiency virus prevalence was 50.3%. Annual incidence of hospital-attended influenza-associated SARI was 9.7–16.8 cases per 100,000 population. Human immunodeficiency virus was associated with a 5-fold greater incidence (incidence rate ratio 4.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.83–6.32). On multivariable analysis, female gender, as well as recruitment in hot, rainy season (December to March; adjusted odds ratios (aOR): 2.82, 95% CI: 1.57–5.06) and cool, dry season (April to August; aOR: 2.47, 95% CI: 1.35–4.15), was associated with influenza positivity, whereas influenza-positive patients were less likely to be HIV-infected (aOR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.43–0.80) or have viral coinfection (aOR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.36–0.73). Human immunodeficiency virus infection (aOR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.35–2.56) and recruitment in hot, rainy season (aOR: 4.98, 95% CI: 3.17–7.81) were independently associated with clinical severity. In this high HIV prevalence population, influenza was associated with nearly 15% of hospital-attended SARI. Human immunodeficiency virus infection is an important risk factor for clinical severity in all-cause and influenza-associated SARI. Expanded access to HIV testing and antiretroviral treatment, as well as targeted influenza vaccination, may reduce the burden of SARI in Malawi and other high HIV prevalence settings.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.177610334,-0.118416717,-0.091684063,0.058625219,0.002033365,0.16564401,-0.088607461,-0.018677642,-0.032033443,-0.156670717,0.021752957,0.097582745,-0.045805171,-0.058993244,-0.076821326,0.107515456,-0.092158778,-0.069902525,0.022349847,-0.00658898,-0.145735912,0.085513485,0.031451373,0.07029748,-0.00746715,-0.03799779,-0.048366071,-0.13561163,-0.066731232,-0.009341908
Seasonality and clinical impact of human parainfluenza viruses,"BACKGROUND: Widespread availability of rapid diagnostic testing for respiratory viruses allows more in‐depth studies of human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV). OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess seasonality of HPIV types 1‐4, clinical outcomes by HPIV type, and risk factors for illness severity. PATIENTS/METHODS: This retrospective study was performed from January 2013 to December 2015 in children and adults with HPIV, detected by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, participating in a community surveillance study of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in New York City and patients admitted to a tertiary care center in the same neighborhood. Seasonality trends by HPIV type were compared between the community and hospital groups. The associations between HPIV type, demographics, clinical characteristics, and illness severity were assessed. RESULTS: HPIV was detected in 69 (4%) of 1753 community surveillance participants (median age 9.2 years) and 680 hospitalized patients (median age 6.8 years). Seasonality for HPIV types 1‐3 agreed with previously described patterns; HPIV‐4 occurred annually in late summer and fall. In the community cohort, 22 (32%) participants sought medical care, 9 (13%) reported antibiotic use, and 20 (29%) reported ≥1 day of missed work or school. Among hospitalized patients, 24% had ≥4 chronic conditions. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression demonstrated that increased severity of illness was significantly associated with HPIV‐4 and chronic cardiovascular and respiratory conditions in children and with age ≥65 years and chronic respiratory conditions in adults. CONCLUSIONS: HPIV‐4 presented late summer and early fall annually and was associated with increased severity of illness in hospitalized children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.171705103,-0.078216663,-0.084275019,-0.035165406,-0.009544657,-0.054045163,0.012835966,0.004988322,0.00294197,-0.01134698,-0.017118298,0.02069402,-0.025421864,-0.032328857,-0.009856626,0.02504409,-0.030908666,-0.002633867,-0.006683085,0.018453582,-0.000632196,-0.022243179,-0.022682092,0.00580879,0.00150599,0.019196813,-0.04656627,0.018822743,-0.002471109,-0.015406671
"Changes in mRNA abundance drive shuttling of RNA binding proteins, linking cytoplasmic RNA degradation to transcription","Alterations in global mRNA decay broadly impact multiple stages of gene expression, although signals that connect these processes are incompletely defined. Here, we used tandem mass tag labeling coupled with mass spectrometry to reveal that changing the mRNA decay landscape, as frequently occurs during viral infection, results in subcellular redistribution of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in human cells. Accelerating Xrn1-dependent mRNA decay through expression of a gammaherpesviral endonuclease drove nuclear translocation of many RBPs, including poly(A) tail-associated proteins. Conversely, cells lacking Xrn1 exhibited changes in the localization or abundance of numerous factors linked to mRNA turnover. Using these data, we uncovered a new role for relocalized cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein in repressing recruitment of TATA binding protein and RNA polymerase II to promoters. Collectively, our results show that changes in cytoplasmic mRNA decay can directly impact protein localization, providing a mechanism to connect seemingly distal stages of gene expression.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.149893957,-0.060020812,-0.041584999,-0.071051698,-0.0847348,0.004465871,-0.013844774,-0.041125107,0.055970376,-0.059598662,-0.092537547,-0.059672867,0.011991888,0.08696087,-0.054555724,-0.005372351,0.039365099,-0.116499655,-0.072475008,-0.027289643,0.009646099,0.04508565,-0.006980156,-0.02176382,0.013302745,-0.094351106,-0.028555564,0.03311961,0.106524074,0.003568846
Burden and Risk Factors for Coronavirus Infections in Infants in Rural Nepal,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge of risk factors for symptomatic human coronavirus (HCoV) infections in children in community settings is limited. We estimated the disease burden and impact of birth-related, maternal, household, and seasonal factors on HCoV infections among children from birth to 6 months old in rural Nepal. METHODS: Prospective, active, weekly surveillance for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) was conducted in infants over a period of 3 years during 2 consecutive, population-based randomized trials of maternal influenza immunization. Midnasal swabs were collected for acute respiratory symptoms and tested for HCoV and other viruses by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Association between HCoV incidence and potential risk factors was modeled using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Overall, 282 of 3505 (8%) infants experienced an HCoV ARI within the first 6 months of life. HCoV incidence overall was 255.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 227.3–286.5) per 1000 person-years, and was more than twice as high among nonneonates than among neonates (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.53; 95% CI, 1.52–4.21). HCoV ARI incidence was also positively associated with the number of children <5 years of age per room in a household (IRR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01–1.28). Of the 296 HCoV infections detected, 46% were coinfections with other respiratory viruses. While HCoVs were detected throughout the study period, seasonal variation was also observed, with incidence peaking in 2 winters (December–February) and 1 autumn (September–November). CONCLUSIONS: HCoV is associated with a substantial proportion of illnesses among young infants in rural Nepal. There is an increased risk of HCoV infection beyond the first month of life.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.193719107,-0.116325772,-0.115124944,-0.009068883,0.130500593,-0.062427173,0.088851078,-0.082993365,0.155213888,-0.146646978,-0.004428325,0.355722275,0.200735166,0.063219452,-0.016116087,0.16988994,-0.108588927,-0.121047936,-0.022316051,-0.000629522,-0.168220122,0.006236831,0.009557529,-0.013048574,0.063124928,-0.066341264,0.087356948,-0.089382954,0.018442592,0.017207476
Temperature Sensitive Mutations in Influenza A Viral Ribonucleoprotein Complex Responsible for the Attenuation of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine,"Live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) have prevented morbidity and mortality associated with influenza viral infections for many years and represent the best therapeutic option to protect against influenza viral infections in humans. However, the development of LAIV has traditionally relied on empirical methods, such as the adaptation of viruses to replicate at low temperatures. These approaches require an extensive investment of time and resources before identifying potential vaccine candidates that can be safely implemented as LAIV to protect humans. In addition, the mechanism of attenuation of these vaccines is poorly understood in some cases. Importantly, LAIV are more efficacious than inactivated vaccines because their ability to mount efficient innate and adaptive humoral and cellular immune responses. Therefore, the design of potential LAIV based on known properties of viral proteins appears to be a highly appropriate option for the treatment of influenza viral infections. For that, the viral RNA synthesis machinery has been a research focus to identify key amino acid substitutions that can lead to viral attenuation and their use in safe, immunogenic, and protective LAIV. In this review, we discuss the potential to manipulate the influenza viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex to generate attenuated forms of the virus that can be used as LAIV for the treatment of influenza viral infections, one of the current and most effective prophylactic options for the control of influenza in humans.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.018168541,-0.086053852,-0.058263606,0.138728902,-0.071894199,0.180663915,-0.003292405,0.009912272,-0.005994214,0.018904093,0.025258031,-0.00343764,0.011455418,-0.03165061,-0.001771831,-0.010613185,-0.024875391,-0.014213434,-0.046094336,0.029823198,-0.017050841,0.002780568,-0.020668878,0.015303212,0.002216978,-0.017006302,0.006626772,-0.048414175,0.045495797,0.038274008
"Human bocavirus, coronavirus, and polyomavirus detected among patients hospitalised with severe acute respiratory illness in South Africa, 2012 to 2013","AIM: To investigate the prevalence of human bocavirus (hBoV), human coronaviruses (hCoV), and human polyomaviruses (hPyV) among patients with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), in South Africa.

All respiratory specimens from patients enrolled through SARI surveillance were also routinely tested by multiplex reverse transcription real‐time polymerase chain reaction for adenovirus; enterovirus; human metapneumovirus; parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3; respiratory syncytial virus; rhinovirus; influenza A, and influenza B. RESULTS: Human bocavirus, hCoV‐229E, and hPyV‐WU were detected in 3.7% (25/680), 4.1% (28/680), and 4.1% (28/680) of respiratory specimens, respectively. All other viruses were detected in <2% of specimens. Rhinovirus was the most common coinfecting virus (21.4%‐60.7%), followed by adenovirus (21.4%‐39.3%), and respiratory syncytial virus (10.7%‐24.0%). Testing for the additional viruses (hBoV, hCoV, and hPyV) decreased the number of specimens that initially tested negative by 2.9% (20/680). CONCLUSION: Inclusion of laboratory tests for hBoV, hCoV‐229E, and hPyV‐WU in differential testing algorithms for surveillance and diagnostics for suspected cases of respiratory illness of unknown cause may improve our understanding of the etiology of SARI, especially in a country like South Africa with a high number of immune compromised persons.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.248345793,-0.072902836,-0.088078715,0.066061015,0.134886326,-0.055712441,0.01287124,-0.031976656,0.078360783,-0.061792514,-0.070404223,0.309266203,0.293011042,0.189439957,0.009209958,0.019942156,-0.038179183,-0.070573331,-0.012569694,0.020859984,0.027401632,-0.018102936,0.049225484,-0.051314786,-0.022158504,0.004618903,-0.003485197,0.10264058,-0.018380566,-0.021255018
RNA Virus Fidelity Mutants: A Useful Tool for Evolutionary Biology or a Complex Challenge?,"RNA viruses replicate with low fidelity due to the error-prone nature of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which generates approximately one mutation per round of genome replication. Due to the large population sizes produced by RNA viruses during replication, this results in a cloud of closely related virus variants during host infection, of which small increases or decreases in replication fidelity have been shown to result in virus attenuation in vivo, but not typically in vitro. Since the discovery of the first RNA virus fidelity mutants during the mid-aughts, the field has exploded with the identification of over 50 virus fidelity mutants distributed amongst 7 RNA virus families. This review summarizes the current RNA virus fidelity mutant literature, with a focus upon the definition of a fidelity mutant as well as methods to confirm any mutational changes associated with the fidelity mutant. Due to the complexity of such a definition, in addition to reports of unstable virus fidelity phenotypes, the future translational utility of these mutants and applications for basic science are examined.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.175067001,-0.066420115,-0.065776924,0.13779134,-0.027787363,-0.022597048,0.075441119,0.038996093,-0.059001907,0.084465564,0.141031064,0.058875476,-0.079537317,-0.008013764,0.042512642,0.048173139,-0.055171952,-0.049771847,-0.095236649,0.013242062,0.11996177,-0.093678868,0.07193854,0.10786767,-0.073841641,0.053168996,0.052848567,-0.071741693,-0.137414218,-0.138498066
CHAC1 Is Differentially Expressed in Normal and Cystic Fibrosis Bronchial Epithelial Cells and Regulates the Inflammatory Response Induced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"In cystic fibrosis (CF), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) colonizes the lungs, leading to chronic inflammation of the bronchial epithelium. ChaC glutathione-specific γ-glutamylcyclotransferase 1 (CHAC1) mRNA is differentially expressed in primary human airway epithelial cells from bronchi (hAECBs) from patients with CF and healthy patients at baseline and upon infection with Pa. CHAC1 degrades glutathione and is associated with ER stress and apoptosis pathways. In this study, we examined the roles of CHAC1 in the inflammatory response and apoptosis in lung epithelial cells. First, we confirmed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction that CHAC1 mRNA was overexpressed in hAECBs from patients without CF compared with the expression in hAECBs from patients with CF upon Pa (PAK strain) infection. Moreover, the Pa virulence factors LPS and flagellin were shown to induce CHAC1 expression in cells from patients without CF. Using NCI-H292 lung epithelial cells, we found that LPS-induced CHAC1 mRNA expression was PERK-independent and involved ATF4. Additionally, using CHAC1 small interfering RNA, we showed that reduced CHAC1 expression in the context of LPS and flagellin stimulation was associated with modulation of inflammatory markers and alteration of NF-κB signaling. Finally, we showed that Pa was not able to induce apoptosis in NCI-H292 cells. Our results suggest that CHAC1 is involved in the regulation of inflammation in bronchial cells during Pa infection and may explain the excessive inflammation present in the respiratory tracts of patients with CF.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.030699816,-0.036173218,-0.034655538,-0.139902569,-0.09224209,0.034747577,-0.014328072,-0.006943325,0.003366543,-0.035380502,-0.064125166,-0.029362199,-0.01322947,0.144923047,-0.019333955,0.026831722,0.005041142,-0.049170843,-0.025568191,-0.015890147,0.076051493,-0.03182003,0.018133896,5.43E-06,-0.016037411,-0.022660018,-0.027448345,0.053741651,0.011481732,-0.035464181
Development and evaluation of a broadly reactive reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay for rapid detection of murine norovirus,"BACKGROUND: Murine norovirus (MNV) is recognized as the most prevalent viral pathogen in captive mouse colonies. The rapid detection assay for MNV would be a useful tool for monitoring and preventing MNV infection. A recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay was established in this study to provide a solution for rapid and sensitive detection of MNV. RESULTS: The detection limit of the RT-RPA assay for the detection of MNV was 1 × 10(2) copies of RNA molecules per reaction. The assay was specific since there was no cross-reaction with other common murine viruses. In addition, the broad reactivity of the RT-RPA assay was validated using the synthesized template carrying seven point mutations among several MNV strains. The MNV RT-RPA assay could detect as few as 1 × 10(2) copies of the mutant per reaction, suggesting the assay could be broadly reactive against a large diversity of MNV strains. Forty eight clinical samples including 16 gastric tissue specimens, 16 cecal tissue specimens and 16 fecal specimens were tested for the validation of the new developed RT-RPA assay. The detection results of RT-RPA and RT-qPCR for clinical samples were very similar, except that a gastric tissue sample which was positive by RT-qPCR, with a RNA titer of 27 copies, was negative by RT-RPA. CONCLUSIONS: A broadly reactive RT-RPA assay was successfully established for MNV detection.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.019727042,0.098813752,0.285548544,0.092282919,-0.042461813,-0.087843756,0.029413483,0.024686556,-0.03000734,-0.102441999,-0.031812842,0.070630574,-0.093389188,0.023027313,-0.072120634,0.075681073,-0.028304218,-0.061499623,0.146789942,0.230687144,0.099143062,0.02056488,-0.023169855,0.006308467,-0.064749253,0.074569375,0.081161812,0.025303536,0.100964312,-0.053438561
Rotavirus A in wild and domestic animals from areas with environmental degradation in the Brazilian Amazon,"Acute gastroenteritis is one of the main causes of mortality in humans and young animals. Domestic and mainly wild animals such as bats, small rodents and birds are highly diversified animals in relation to their habitats and ecological niches and are widely distributed geographically in environments of forest fragmentation in some areas of the Amazon, being considered important sources for viruses that affect humans and other animals. Due to the anthropical activities, these animals changed their natural habitat and adapted to urbanized environments, thus representing risks to human and animal health. Although the knowledge of the global diversity of enteric viruses is scarce, there are reports demonstrating the detection of rotavirus in domestic animals and animals of productive systems, such as bovines and pigs. The present study investigated the prevalence of Rotavirus A in 648 fecal samples of different animal species from the northeastern mesoregion of the state of Pará, Brazil, which is characterized as an urbanized area with forest fragments. The fecal specimens were collected from October 2014 to April 2016 and subjected to a Qualitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR), using the NSP3 gene as a target. It was observed that 27.5% (178/648) of the samples presented positive results for RVA, with 178 samples distributed in birds (23.6%), canines (21.35%), chiropterans (17.98%), bovines (14.6%), horses (8.43%), small rodents (6.74%), pigs (3.93%) and felines (3.37%), demonstrating the circulation of RVA in domestic animals and suggesting that such proximity could cause transmissions between different species and the occurrence of rearrangements in the genome of RVA as already described in the literature, associated to the traces of environmental degradation in the studied areas.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.003534088,0.013778064,0.060672698,-0.060963031,0.105340117,0.054254221,0.104522588,0.007385249,-0.043635388,-0.022494167,0.017312302,0.003270685,-0.037900611,0.00512467,0.072173733,-0.031221176,-0.022867194,-0.021460653,0.010278719,-0.005747622,0.0199464,0.029124887,-0.06818204,0.001948783,0.028750932,-0.034728371,-0.029140064,-0.021698444,0.003094482,-0.031844835
The first evidence of a new genotype of nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus circulating in vaccinated and unvaccinated broiler flocks in Algeria,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) frequently infects broilers and is responsible for severe economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. It has also been associated with kidney damage in the broiler flocks. The aim of the present study is to determine the presence of IBV and its possible involvement in kidney damage of broiler chicks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 14 clinically diseased broiler flocks from Western and Central Algeria were sampled and analyzed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by phylogenic analysis. RESULTS: The QX (100%) and 4/91 (60%) IBV serotypes were the most prevalent in the kidney damaged broilers regardless of vaccination status. The molecular detection of avian IBV by RT-PCR identified six samples as positive, of which only two isolates were typable by sequencing. We identified a novel IBDZ13a genotype which showed 93% sequence homology to the partial-S1 gene sequence of the IB 4/91 commercial vaccine strain. Sequencing analysis characterized this virus as a novel and divergent IB 4/91 field virus with eight amino acid substitutions that might have resulted in altered immunogenicity. CONCLUSION: The isolation of a new IBV strain (IBDZ13a) from vaccinated broiler flocks may explain the failure of the vaccination programs against IBV field strains. Combination of the HI test and RT-PCR indicated that the nephropathogenic IB outbreaks in broilers are related to this novel strain.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.01956505,0.015596752,0.162043058,-0.109675274,0.214010395,0.102855023,-0.193952493,-0.099289268,0.115021903,0.34993074,0.094726105,0.047000528,-0.097992008,0.045937475,-0.148691707,0.130291498,0.023659508,0.025339028,0.022289717,0.026075015,-0.039792941,0.018380135,-0.011747392,-0.019555039,0.024343943,0.026589041,0.012022153,0.00531557,0.049640001,-0.019110924
"The impact of influenza infection on young children, their family and the health care system","BACKGROUND: Influenza is a major cause of respiratory illness in young children. Assessing the impact of infection on children and the community is required to guide immunisation policies. OBJECTIVES: To describe the impact of laboratory‐proven influenza in young children and to compare its impact with that of other respiratory viruses on the child, their family and the health care system. METHODS: Preschool children presenting for care or admission to a tertiary paediatric hospital during the 2008‐2014 influenza seasons were tested for respiratory virus by polymerase chain reaction and culture. Parental surveys were used to determine the impact of infection on illness duration, medication use, absenteeism and health service utilisation. Multivariate regression analyses were used to assess the impact of influenza and to evaluate the association between influenza status and outcomes. RESULTS: Among 1191 children assessed, 238 had influenza. Among children with influenza, 87.8% were administered antipyretics and 40.9% antibiotics. 28.6% had secondary complications. 65.4% of children missed school/day care, and 53.4% of parents missed work. When influenza and other viruses were compared, significant differences were noted including duration of illness (influenza: 9.54 days, other viruses: 8.50 days; P = 0.005) and duration of absenteeism for both the child (23.1 vs 17.3 hours; P = 0.015) and their parents (28.5 vs 22.7 hours; P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Influenza infection in young children has a significant impact on medication use, absenteeism and the use of health care service. Significant differences are identified when compared with other ILI. These data demonstrate that influenza prevention strategies including immunisation are likely to have wide and significant impacts.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.231853409,-0.156589462,-0.100541149,0.154519112,0.00105342,0.187757624,-0.082145694,-0.031565892,0.026907972,-0.107689146,0.00078017,-0.011563178,-0.029984069,-0.084544401,-0.016799958,0.048764972,-0.034967337,-0.040548823,-0.004658615,-0.029645633,-0.05502644,0.038374144,0.007561558,-0.017307412,-0.049797546,0.024161562,-0.048838659,-0.025661985,0.030135313,0.018746776
Polymerase chain reaction combined with fluorescent lateral flow immunoassay based on magnetic purification for rapid detection of canine parvovirus 2,"BACKGROUND: Canine parvovirus 2 (CPV-2) is one of the most common etiological agents that cause severe gastroenteritis in puppies. Early accurate diagnosis is important for infected dogs. In recent years, magnetic separation has become an efficient and useful tool for bioassays. In this study, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with fluorescent lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) based on magnetic purification assay was developed for the quantitative detection of CPV-2. RESULTS: The optimum working reaction volume and reaction time for LFIA was 100 μL and 2 min, respectively. The PCR-LFIA assay only detected CPV-2, and did not show cross-detection of non-CPV strains. Experiments showed analytical sensitivity of 3 × 10(1) copies/μL and demonstrated the PCR-LFIA has a diagnostic agreement of 100% with conventional PCR on detection of clinical samples (22.6% positive, 14/62). Cutoff value is 146. The results were further verified by sequencing and BLAST software. The entire process from PCR step only takes ~ 80 min. CONCLUSIONS: This approach provides an attractive platform for rapid and quantitative detection of CPV-2, indicating great promise as a convenient molecular detection tool to facilitate disease outbreak investigations and response timely.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.063987206,0.079467236,0.250177438,0.008317076,-0.034314349,-0.036862277,0.035398471,-0.004388396,-0.029518548,-0.012496391,0.004727728,0.016926174,-0.022523146,-0.040109425,0.024839366,-0.01774263,-0.037696601,-0.070744456,0.097168316,-0.021880652,0.130878916,0.082134761,-0.012835352,-0.077288539,0.070087235,-0.093043491,-0.048088155,0.016627757,-0.048081366,0.097900138
Molecular epidemiology of chicken anaemia virus in sick chickens in China from 2014 to 2015,"Chicken anaemia virus (CAV), a member of the genus Gyrovirus, is the etiological agent of chicken infectious anaemia. CAV infects bone marrow-derived cells, resulting in severe anaemia and immunosuppression in young chickens and a compromised immune response in older birds. We investigated the molecular epidemiology of CAV in sick chickens in China from 2014 to 2015 and showed that the CAV-positive rate was 13.30%, in which mixed infection (55.56%) was the main type of infection. We isolated and identified 15 new CAV strains using different methods including indirect immunofluorescence assay and Western Blotting. We used overlapping polymerase chain reaction to map the whole genome of the strains. Phylogenetic analyses of the obtained sequences and related sequences available in GenBank generated four distinct groups (A–D). We built phylogenetic trees using predicted viral protein (VP) sequences. Unlike CAV VP2s and VP3s that were well conserved, the diversity of VP1s indicated that the new strains were virulent.

Identfication of viral and bacterial etiologic agents of the pertussis-like syndrome in children under 5 years old hospitalized,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) represent an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children, remaining a major public health concern, especially affecting children under 5 years old from low-income countries. Unfortunately, information regarding their epidemiology is still limited in Peru. METHODS: A secondary data analysis was performed from a previous cross-sectional study conducted in children with a probable diagnosis of Pertussis from January 2010 to July 2012. All samples were analyzed via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for the following etiologies: Influenza-A, Influenza-B, RSV-A, RSV-B, Adenovirus, Parainfluenza 1 virus, Parainfluenza 2 virus, Parainfluenza 3 virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. RESULTS: A total of 288 patients were included. The most common pathogen isolated was Adenovirus (49%), followed by Bordetella pertussis (41%) from our previous investigation, the most prevelant microorganisms were Mycoplasma pneumonia (26%) and Influenza-B (19.8%). Coinfections were reported in 58% of samples and the most common association was found between B. pertussis and Adenovirus (12.2%). CONCLUSIONS: There was a high prevalence of Adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and other etiologies in patients with a probable diagnosis of pertussis. Despite the presence of persistent cough lasting at least two weeks and other clinical characteristics highly suspicious of pertussis, secondary etiologies should be considered in children under 5 years-old in order to give a proper treatment.

Involvement of PRRSV NSP3 and NSP5 in the autophagy process,"BACKGROUND: Autophagy is an essential process in eukaryotic cells in which autophagosomes form to deliver cellular organelles and long-lived proteins to lysosomes for degradation. Many studies have recently identified the regulatory mechanisms involved in the interaction between viral infection and autophagy. METHODS: LC3 turnover and the proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway were investigated using western blot analysis. The formation and degradation of autophagosomes were detected using immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: Autophagy was activated by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) NSP3, NSP5 and NSP9, which are two transmembrane proteins and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, respectively. The formation of autophagosomes was induced by NSP3 and NSP5 and developed from the ER; the fusion of these autophagosomes with lysosomes was limited. Although NSP3 and NSP5 are ER transmembrane proteins, these proteins did not activate the ER stress signaling pathways. In addition, the cytoplasmic domain of NSP3 plays a pivotal role in activating autophagy. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented in this study reveal an important relationship between PRRSV NSPs and autophagy and provide new insights that improve our understanding of the involvement of PRRSV NSPs in the autophagy process.

Rapid molecular detection of macrolide resistance,"BACKGROUND: Emerging antimicrobial resistance is a significant threat to human health. However, methods for rapidly diagnosing antimicrobial resistance generally require multi-day culture-based assays. Macrolide efflux gene A, mef(A), provides resistance against erythromycin and azithromycin and is known to be laterally transferred among a wide range of bacterial species. METHODS: We use Recombinase Polymerase Assay (RPA) to detect the antimicrobial resistance gene mef(A) from raw lysates without nucleic acid purification. To validate these results we performed broth dilution assays to assess antimicrobial resistance to erythromycin and ampicillin (a negative control). RESULTS: We validate the detection of mef(A) in raw lysates of Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. salivarius, and Enterococcus faecium bacterial lysates within 7–10 min of assay time. We show that detection of mef(A) accurately predicts real antimicrobial resistance assessed by traditional culture methods, and that the assay is robust to high levels of spiked-in non-specific nucleic acid contaminant. The assay was unaffected by single-nucleotide polymorphisms within divergent mef(A) gene sequences, strengthening its utility as a robust diagnostic tool. CONCLUSIONS: This finding opens the door to implementation of rapid genomic diagnostics in a clinical setting, while providing researchers a rapid, cost-effective tool to track antibiotic resistance in both pathogens and commensal strains.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.008506752,0.025389555,0.133254064,-0.010765793,-0.055472984,0.017457048,0.049754158,0.022043285,-0.024088392,0.024404303,-0.077745536,0.005371368,0.019610627,-0.097021356,-0.020618447,-0.002394482,-0.055082972,0.000791707,0.022562077,0.008512584,0.029916538,0.005492821,0.092754513,-0.028060585,-0.051364927,0.021657411,0.041441743,-0.025413532,0.053589093,0.006868702
Viral infection detection using metagenomics technology in six poultry farms of eastern China,"With rapidly increasing animal pathogen surveillance requirements, new technologies are needed for a comprehensive understanding of the roles of pathogens in the occurrence and development of animal diseases. We applied metagenomic technology to avian virus surveillance to study the main viruses infecting six poultry farms in two provinces in eastern China. Cloacal/throat double swabs were collected from 60 birds at each farm according to a random sampling method. The results showed that the method could simultaneously detect major viruses infecting farms, including avian influenza virus, infectious bronchitis virus, Newcastle disease virus, rotavirus G, duck hepatitis B virus, and avian leukemia virus subgroup J in several farms. The test results were consistent with the results from traditional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription-PCR analyses. Five H9N2 and one H3N8 avian influenza viruses were detected at the farms and were identified as low pathogenic avian influenza viruses according to HA cleavage sites analysis. One detected Newcastle disease virus was classified as Class II genotype I and avirulent type according to F0 cleavage sites analysis. Three avian infectious bronchitis viruses were identified as 4/91, CK/CH/LSC/99I and TC07-2 genotypes by phylogenetic analysis of S1 genes. The viral infection surveillance method using metagenomics technology enables the monitoring of multiple viral infections, which allows the detection of main infectious viruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.039743798,-0.051339684,0.076257825,0.09161931,0.093068114,0.173454681,-0.031318744,-0.02922738,-0.004880483,0.14634042,0.016740705,-0.041053636,0.03709561,0.010664756,0.027408117,-0.00600618,-0.016210199,-0.043761884,-0.011052446,0.013662211,-0.014905961,0.018715221,-0.020656986,0.044640956,-0.03214897,-0.021020848,-0.003413111,0.01094968,-0.014449567,-0.062606055
"Prevalence of Wēnzhōu virus in small mammals in Yunnan Province, China","BACKGROUND: Mammarenaviruses are associated with human hemorrhagic fever diseases in Africa and America. Recently, a rodent mammarenavirus, Wēnzhōu virus (WENV) and related viruses, have been reported in China, Cambodia, and Thailand. Moreover, in Cambodia, these viruses were suspected to be associated with human disease. In China, Yunnan Province is famous for its abundant animal and plant diversity and is adjacent to several South-eastern Asia countries. Therefore, it is necessary to know whether WENV-related viruses, or other mammarenaviruses, are prevalent in this province. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Small mammals were trapped, euthanized, and sampled. Mammarenavirus RNA was detected using a nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantified by real-time RT-PCR. A total of 1040 small mammals belonging to 13 genera and 26 species were trapped in Yunnan Province. WENV-related mammarenaviruses were detected in 41 rodent liver samples, mainly in brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) and oriental house rats (R. tanezumi).Viral nucleocapsid protein was detected in liver sections by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Full-length-genomes were amplified by RT-PCR and used for phylogenetic analysis with the MEGA package. Recombination analysis was performed using the SimPlot and Recombination Detection Program. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: WENV related viruses circulated in small mammals in Yunnan Province. Whole genome sequence analysis of five selected viral strains showed that these viruses are closely related to WENVs discovered in Asia and form an independent branch in the phylogenetic tree in the WENV clade. Paying attention to investigate the influence of these viruses to public health is essential in the epidemic regions.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.004300278,0.023381023,0.081554162,0.04058525,0.138210646,0.003100179,0.051770601,0.003262657,-0.035542802,0.018224317,-0.001855768,0.001618606,-0.000645469,0.045278451,0.029291428,-0.049912711,-0.010651061,0.008524539,-0.031727988,-0.004074668,0.039275927,0.06675633,-0.063068657,0.085198091,-0.05670704,0.016899833,0.061488797,0.014287041,0.013618294,-0.040947381
Multiplex PCR methods for detection of several viruses associated with canine respiratory and enteric diseases,"Viral respiratory and intestinal infections are the most common causes of canine viral illness. Infection with multiple pathogens occurs in many cases. Rapid diagnosis of these multiple infections is important for providing timely and effective treatment. To improve diagnosis, in this study, two new multiplex polymerase chain reactions (mPCRs) were developed for simultaneous detection of canine respiratory viruses (CRV) and canine enteric viruses (CEV) using two separate primer mixes. The viruses included canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine influenza virus (CIV), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine circovirus (CanineCV), canine coronavirus (CCoV) and canine parvovirus (CPV). The sensitivity of the mPCR results showed that the detection limit of both mPCR methods was 1×10(4) viral copies. Twenty nasal swabs (NS) and 20 anal swabs (AS) collected from dogs with symptoms of respiratory disease or enteric disease were evaluated using the novel mPCR methods as a clinical test. The mPCR protocols, when applied to these respiratory specimens and intestinal samples, could detect 7 viruses simultaneously, allowing rapid investigation of CRV (CAV-2, CDV, CIV and CPIV) and CEV (CAV-2, CanineCV, CCoV and CPV) status and prompt evaluation of coinfection.

Selection of reference genes for the quantitative real-time PCR normalization of gene expression in Isatis indigotica fortune,"BACKGROUND: Isatis indigotica, a traditional Chinese medicine, produces a variety of active ingredients. However, little is known about the key genes and corresponding expression profiling involved in the biosynthesis pathways of these ingredients. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a powerful, commonly-used method for gene expression analysis, but the accuracy of the quantitative data produced depends on the appropriate selection of reference genes. RESULTS: In this study, the systematic analysis of the reference genes was performed for quantitative real-Time PCR normalization in I. indigotica. We selected nine candidate reference genes, including six traditional housekeeping genes (ACT, α-TUB, β-TUB, UBC, CYP, and EF1-α), and three newly stable internal control genes (MUB, TIP41, and RPL) from a transcriptome dataset of I. indigotica, and evaluated their expression stabilities in different tissues (root, stem, leaf, and petiole) and leaves exposed to three abiotic treatments (low-nitrogen, ABA, and MeJA) using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and comprehensive RefFind algorithms. The results demonstrated that MUB and EF1-α were the two most stable reference genes for all samples. TIP41 as the optimal reference gene for low-nitrogen stress and MeJA treatment, while ACT had the highest ranking for ABA treatment and CYP was the most suitable for different tissues. CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that the selection and validation of appropriate reference genes for normalizing data is mandatory to acquire accurate quantification results. The necessity of specific internal control for specific conditions was also emphasized. Furthermore, this work will provide valuable information to enhance further research in gene function and molecular biology on I. indigotica and other related species.

Leishmania infantum-specific IFN-γ production in stimulated blood from cats living in areas where canine leishmaniosis is endemic,"BACKGROUND: Feline leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum is considered a rare disease in endemic areas, whereas subclinical infections are common. Immune response plays a key role in driving the course of L. infantum infection in other host species; however, the feline cell-mediated immune response to L. infantum infection has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the cell-mediated immune response specific to L. infantum by means of interferon (IFN)-γ release in whole blood assay from cats living in endemic areas (66 in Sicily and 113 in Catalonia) and to compare with antibody levels to L. infantum [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT)], blood parasite load and retroviral infections. RESULTS: Most cats (n = 140) were L. infantum antibody negative and only 22% (n = 39) were positive. Only 9 and 2% of tested cats had a feline immunodeficency virus (FIV) infection or a feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection, respectively. Thirty-two cats out of 179 (18%) produced IFN-γ after stimulation with L. infantum soluble antigen (LSA) while the majority of cats (93%) produced IFN-γ after stimulation with concanavalin A (ConA). Six LSA-IFN-γ-producer cats were seropositive (three to ELISA and five to IFAT) but they were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative, while only one cat was antibody- and PCR-positive. Significant positive correlations were found between IFN-γ concentrations after stimulation with LSA and ConA, and between serology and PCR testing. No association was found between FIV status and LSA or ConA-IFN-γ production. Combining PCR, serology and specific IFN-γ concentration results, we found that 36% of cats studied were exposed to L. infantum. CONCLUSIONS: As expected, cats from endemic areas produce IFN-γ after ex vivo blood stimulation with LSA and therefore are able to activate a cell-mediated adaptive immune response against the parasite that is variably associated with antibody or blood PCR positivity. The association of this assay to serological and molecular tests provides a better estimate of cat exposure to L. infantum.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.000983165,-0.001184999,0.076229366,-0.170248847,-0.055344484,0.046373806,0.060244197,-0.007009128,0.001749964,-0.121229109,0.278403272,-0.139370728,0.159670393,0.022518087,-0.086129845,-0.027865941,0.040892488,-0.020137595,-0.005262643,0.02933975,-0.001524954,-0.036535073,0.065481039,-0.010317388,-0.027124235,0.024632842,0.016178316,0.010908762,-0.001421624,-0.012922958
Molecular characterization of pathogenic 4/91-like and QX-like infectious bronchitis virus infecting commercial poultry farms in Indonesia,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Existing data on the characteristics of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) gathered throughout Indonesia have been recognized to indicate variants similar to globally distributed vaccine strains. Despite past and current intensive vaccination programs, IBV infections in the country’s poultry industry have not been effectively controlled. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the genotype of several isolates based on partial S1 gene sequences. In particular, the investigation is directed to focus on layer chickens in actively vaccinated farms indicating IBV symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples were isolated from ten different layer chicken flocks experiencing respiratory problem, drops in egg production, and a “penguin-like” stance, which were collected from commercial poultry farms in Central Java and Yogyakarta regions, Indonesia, within the periods of 2012-2018. Fragment of the S1 gene of IBV sampled from actively vaccinated commercial poultry farms was amplified using primer 5’-aca tgg taa ttt ttc aga tgg-3’ (forward) and 5’-cag att gct tac aac cac c-3’ (reverse) with the length of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product at 383 bp. The sequence of samples was then compared with the sequence of reference S1 gene nucleotides of IBV from NCBI GenBank database. The amino acid analysis and multiple alignment sequence were conducted using Mega X. RESULTS: During necropsy, enlargement of the oviduct and swollen kidney were observed. Reverse transcription-PCR diagnosis of their 383 bp S1 gene showed that all samples were IBV positive. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene discovered seven samples to be clustered as 4/91-like strains. Meanwhile, the remaining three samples were grouped in QX-like strain cluster. CONCLUSION: This study is a pioneering report providing molecular evidence of pathogenic QX-like and 4/91-like strains circulating in Indonesia. Findings discovered, in this study, strongly suggested the importance of improving protections by available IBV vaccines through updated circulating strain clusters. It is critical to ensure the delivery of an effective control measurement of and vaccination protocols against IBV infections in the country’s commercial poultry industry in particular and worldwide in general.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.036728567,-0.011517767,0.118900123,-0.129198418,0.264104116,0.106747333,-0.201289245,-0.097464487,0.128371693,0.344769942,0.063649802,0.046888298,-0.081469677,0.003728129,-0.131273059,0.094639924,-0.000344053,0.006176322,0.038221371,0.01208666,-0.02438199,-0.004253877,-0.008619663,-0.031550483,0.011715026,-0.016011646,-0.018454736,0.016878094,0.064450575,0.005718973
Coinfection of diarrheagenic bacterial and viral pathogens in piglets of Northeast region of India,"AIM: This study aimed to study the prevalence of the coinfection of enteric bacterial and viral pathogens, namely Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Rotavirus, and Picobirnavirus from fecal samples of pre-weaned piglets in Northeast region of India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 457 fresh fecal samples were collected from piglets under 9 weeks old during 2013-2015 from organized (n=225) and unorganized (n=232) farms of Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland. Samples were collected from diarrheic (n =339) and non-diarrheic (n=118) piglets including local indigenous (n=130) and crossbreed (n=327) piglets in different seasons during the study period. The samples were processed for the isolation of E. coli and Salmonella and detection of their putative virulence genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Samples were also processed for the detection of Rotavirus and Picobirnavirus by RNA-polyacrylamide agarose gel electrophoresis and reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). RESULTS: A total of 11 (2.40%) samples were found positive for two or more coinfecting enteric bacterial and viral pathogens. All the 11 positive fecal samples were recovered from diarrheic piglets. Salmonella Typhimurium (enterotoxin, stn gene) and Picobirnavirus genogroup 1 were found to be more frequent as coinfecting agents. Coinfection was recorded higher in unorganized (3.87%) compared to organized farm (0.88%). Again, higher detection was recorded in crossbreed (2.75%) than local indigenous piglets (1.53%). The occurrence of coinfection was found to be more common during summer (4.68%) followed by winter (2.27%) season. CONCLUSION: The present study highlighted the significance of E. coli, Salmonella, Rotavirus, and Picobirnavirus as important diarrheagenic pathogens causing coinfection in piglets in Northeast region of India. Probably, this is the first systematic study of the coinfection of four important diarrheagenic bacterial and viral agents associated with piglet diarrhea in India.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.041796931,-0.011200735,0.083761149,-0.070820208,0.051215652,-0.025006987,0.01297536,-0.008191087,-0.04814183,0.017506117,0.032922879,0.013473462,-0.063313079,0.005807207,0.080286723,-0.069041418,0.020170698,-0.035423088,0.02106881,-0.036931239,-0.028906333,0.06372488,-0.015320408,0.011484229,0.057681961,-0.043733232,-0.010232586,-0.039910908,0.046197936,-0.007333137
"Genetic characterization of S1 gene of infectious bronchitis virus isolated from commercial poultry flocks in West Java, Indonesia","BACKGROUND AND AIM: Infectious bronchitis (IB) is still a major problem among poultry industry in Indonesia, IB outbreaks continue to happen even in vaccinated flocks. The emergence of new IB virus (IBV) variants might lead to mismatching between vaccine virus strain and circulating virus strain, this may be a reason of vaccination failure. Information about circulating IBV in a region is important to decide which IB vaccine should be used. However, information about recent IBV strains which circulated in Indonesia and their genetic characters were limited; therefore, the aim of our research was to determine the genetic characterization of S1 gene of IBV isolated from commercial poultry flocks in West Java, Indonesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 47 viral isolate samples collected from chickens with clinical sign and reduced in egg production. Six IB live vaccines were used as control, the reference vaccines represent IBV strains including H120, H52, 4/91, CR88, 233A, and 1-96. Primers XCe2+ and XCe2- were used to amplify S1 gene partially. RESULTS: Twenty-six of 47 samples showed positive result to S1 gene of IBV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Three IBV isolates, Indonesia/K233A31/18, Indonesia/K4A9/17, and Indonesia/P3/17, were selected for nucleotide sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of 352 nucleotides of the partial S1 gene shows that isolates Indonesia/K4A9/17 and Indonesia/K233A31/18 have 100% homology with IBV vaccine strain 4/91, while isolate Indonesia/P3/17 has 100% homology with IBV vaccine strain 233A. CONCLUSION: Our result indicates that at least two IBV strains were circulating among poultry in West Java, Indonesia, which is IBV close to vaccine strain 4/91 and 233A. The present study provides updates on the circulating IBV in commercial poultry flocks in West Java, Indonesia, and might use as guidance on selecting a proper IB vaccine strain to improve IB vaccination efficacy in certain region.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.048963336,-0.022338351,0.094663136,-0.133670795,0.195704117,0.118129217,-0.180569434,-0.093473223,0.125968931,0.343405083,0.083829104,0.055904681,-0.103209335,0.003820901,-0.141397616,0.136040415,-0.017522571,0.012516405,0.028566718,0.038977169,-0.017718772,-0.003103979,0.014976761,-0.02006336,0.025079819,0.001342816,-0.012162394,0.024052443,0.039178319,0.012414221
"Respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and influenza virus infection in Bangkok, 2016-2017","Children and adults residing in densely populated urban centers around the world are at risk of seasonal influenza-like illness caused by respiratory viruses such as influenza virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In a large metropolitan of Thailand’s capital city Bangkok, most respiratory infections are rarely confirmed by molecular diagnostics. We therefore examined the frequency of RSV, hMPV, and influenza virus in 8,842 patients who presented influenza-like illness and sought medical care at a large hospital in Bangkok between 2016 and 2017. Using a multiplex real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 30.5% (2,699/8,842) of nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples tested positive for one or more of these viruses. Influenza virus comprised 17.3% (1,528/8,842), of which the majority were influenza A/H3N2. Such infection was most prevalent among adults and the elderly. RSV was identified in 11.4% (1,011/8,842) and were mostly ON1 and BA9 genotypes. Of the hMPV-positive samples (3.6%, 318/8,842), genotypes A2, B1, and B2 were detected. A small number of individuals experienced co-infections (1.8%, 155/8,842), most commonly between RSV and influenza A/H3N2. RSV and hMPV co-infections were also found, but mainly in young children. Viral respiratory tract infection peaked locally in the rainy season (June to September). These findings support the utility of rapid nucleic acid testing of RSV, hMPV, and influenza virus in patients with ILI.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.330060387,-0.17893952,-0.079066656,0.291979941,0.053959898,0.091790302,-0.083741895,-0.125047709,0.157783722,-0.153843493,0.040699642,-0.098766873,-0.124702534,-0.007644962,-0.129923627,-0.067722006,-0.003769966,0.198129821,-0.121223765,0.045740928,0.133100668,-0.071381148,0.016884832,-0.142880545,0.01042776,-0.105013523,-0.010697986,-0.012533051,-0.027328138,0.033251984
Visual detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus using a novel reverse transcription polymerase spiral reaction method,"BACKGROUND: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a major etiological agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea around the world. Point-of-care testing in the field is lacking owing to the requirement for a simple, robust field applicable test that does not require professional laboratory equipment. The aim of this study was to establish a novel reverse transcription polymerase spiral reaction (RT-PSR) assay for the rapid detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). For the assay, a specific RT-PSR primer pair was designed against a conserved region in PEDV ORF3. RESULTS: The RT-PSR was optimized, and PEDV could be detected after a 50 min incubation at 62 °C, in addition to the 15 min required for reverse transcription. No cross-reaction with other porcine infectious viruses was observed. This new method for PEDV detection was 10 times more sensitive than the conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The positive rates for 65 clinical samples using the new RT-PSR assay and the conventional RT-PCR assay were 58.46% (38/65) and 53.84% (35/65), respectively. In the RT-PSR assay, the addition of a mixture of dyes allowed a positive reaction to be directly observed by the naked eye. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that this RT-PSR assay is capable of accurately detecting PEDV, and has the advantages of high specificity and sensitivity for the detection of PEDV.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.05214665,0.118232014,0.328306345,0.036273191,0.025346938,-0.038806412,-0.04344959,-0.0279343,-0.024855493,-0.085412781,0.046112568,0.121556368,-0.225507152,0.135453558,0.238181377,-0.215266548,0.011568513,0.068629305,-0.069110495,0.225550377,-0.206706121,-0.073281225,0.081107624,0.033429762,-0.038511266,0.00393286,0.040422939,0.032590452,0.096352446,-0.036035815
Performance and workflow assessment of six nucleic acid extraction technologies for use in resource limited settings,"Infectious disease nucleic acid amplification technologies (NAAT) have superior sensitivity, specificity, and rapid time to result compared to traditional microbiological methods. Recovery of concentrated, high quality pathogen nucleic acid (NA) from complex specimen matrices is required for optimal performance of several NA amplification/detection technologies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fully integrated NAAT platforms that enable rapid sample-to-result workflows with minimal user input are generally restricted to larger reference lab settings, and their complexity and cost are prohibitive to widespread implementation in resource limited settings (RLS). Identification of component technologies for incorporation of reliable and affordable sample preparation with pathogen NA amplification/detection into an integrated platform suitable for RLS, is a necessary first step toward achieving the overarching goal of reducing infectious disease-associated morbidity and mortality globally. In the current study, we evaluate the performance of six novel NA extraction technologies from different developers using blinded panels of stool, sputum and blood spiked with variable amounts of quality-controlled DNA- and/or RNA-based microbes. The extraction efficiencies were semi-quantitatively assessed using validated real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays specific for each microbe and comparing target-specific RT-PCR results to those obtained with reference NA extraction methods. The technologies were ranked based on overall diagnostic accuracy (analytical sensitivity and specificity). Sample input and output volumes, total processing time, user-required manual steps and cost estimates were also examined for suitability in RLS. Together with the performance analysis, these metrics were used to select the more suitable candidate technologies for further optimization of integrated NA amplification and detection technologies for RLS.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.012622761,0.061426359,0.220865723,0.044010851,-0.077637427,-0.012868329,0.050710389,0.024049865,-0.026970511,0.038026831,-0.053443847,-0.000355883,0.064870481,-0.098838966,-0.023774017,0.045775963,-0.052197527,-0.012054182,-0.058098208,-0.067840684,-0.043135315,-0.038820613,0.040737958,-0.086384215,-0.025554933,-0.033041364,-0.014318115,-0.005232572,-0.035213443,0.042906809
Cloning and characterization of a tyrosine decarboxylase involved in the biosynthesis of galanthamine in Lycoris aurea,"BACKGROUND: Galanthamine, one kind of Amaryllidaceae alkaloid extracted from the Lycoris species, is used in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. In regards to medical and economic importance, the biosynthesis and regulatory mechanism of the secondary metabolites in Lycoris remain uninvestigated. METHODS: BLAST was used to identify the sequence of tyrosine decarboxylase in the transcriptome of Lycoris aurea (L’Hér) Herb. The enzyme activity of this TYDC was determined by using heterologous expressed protein in the Escherichia coli cells. The related productive contents of tyramine were detected using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). According to the available micro RNA sequencing profiles and degradome database of L. aurea, microRNA396 were isolated, which targets to LaTYDC1 and RNA Ligase-Mediated-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RLM-RACE) were used to confirm the cleavage. The expression levels of miR396 and LaTYDC1 were measured using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: LaTYDC1 was mainly expressed in root, bulb, leaf and flower fitting the models for galanthamine accumulation. This decarboxylase efficiently catalyzes tyrosine to tyramine conversion. Under methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment, the expression of LaTYDC1 and the content of tyramine sharply increase. The use of RLM-RACE confirms that miR396 promotes the degradation of LaTYDC1 mRNA. Under MeJA treatment, the expression of miR396 was suppressed while the expression level of LaTYDC1 sharply increased. Following the increase of the miR396 transcriptional level, LaTYDC1 was significantly repressed. CONCLUSION: LaTYDC1 participates in the biosynthesis of galanthamine, and is regulated by miR396. This finding also provides genetic strategy for improving the yield of galanthamine in the future.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.094550368,-0.016593131,0.046931278,-0.055172581,-0.076482465,0.01439352,0.013764374,-0.021317696,0.032170124,-0.013588662,-0.075835642,-0.053980153,0.020832213,0.053824911,-0.034192951,-0.011388439,-0.020878089,-0.039042064,-0.020096974,-0.075815957,0.018418054,-0.016851217,0.034790016,-0.033494965,-0.068521971,-0.022153151,0.040357652,0.019011689,0.048370735,0.012140671
Development and evaluation of a one-step multiplex real-time TaqMan(®) RT-qPCR assay for the detection and genotyping of equine G3 and G14 rotaviruses in fecal samples,"BACKGROUND: Equine rotavirus A (ERVA) is the leading cause of diarrhea in neonatal foals and has a negative impact on equine breeding enterprises worldwide. Among ERVA strains infecting foals, the genotypes G3P[12] and G14P[12] are the most prevalent, while infections by strains with other genomic arrangements are infrequent. The identification of circulating strains of ERVA is critical for diagnostic and surveillance purposes, as well as to understand their molecular epidemiology. Current genotyping methods available for ERVA and rotaviruses affecting other animal species rely on Sanger sequencing and are significantly time-consuming, costly and labor intensive. Here, we developed the first one-step multiplex TaqMan(®) real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay targeting the NSP3 and VP7 genes of ERVA G3 and G14 genotypes for the rapid detection and G-typing directly from fecal specimens. METHODS: A one-step multiplex TaqMan(®) RT-qPCR assay targeting the NSP3 and VP7 genes of ERVA G3 and G14 genotypes was designed. The analytical sensitivity was assessed using serial dilutions of in vitro transcribed RNA containing the target sequences while the analytical specificity was determined using RNA and DNA derived from a panel of group A rotaviruses along with other equine viruses and bacteria. The clinical performance of this multiplex assay was evaluated using a panel of 177 fecal samples and compared to a VP7-specific standard RT-PCR assay and Sanger sequencing. Limits of detection (LOD), sensitivity, specificity, and agreement were determined. RESULTS: The multiplex G3 and G14 VP7 assays demonstrated high specificity and efficiency, with perfect linearity. A 100-fold difference in their analytical sensitivity was observed when compared to the singleplex assays; however, this difference did not have an impact on the clinical performance. Clinical performance of the multiplex RT-qPCR assay demonstrated that this assay had a high sensitivity/specificity for every target (100% for NSP3, > 90% for G3 VP7 and > 99% for G14 VP7, respectively) and high overall agreement (> 98%) compared to conventional RT-PCR and sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: This new multiplex RT-qPCR assay constitutes a useful, very reliable tool that could significantly aid in the rapid detection and G-typing of ERVA strains circulating in the field.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.049927958,0.097643918,0.293382099,0.09195187,0.009921797,-0.054998136,0.008483874,-0.011061921,-0.026492086,-0.021655411,-0.013458518,0.0416114,-0.044757462,0.060926196,0.003290749,-0.047466681,0.020426095,-0.000690659,0.022987182,-0.044024954,0.021936341,0.005104754,0.028967212,0.048453968,-0.001841535,-0.025437593,0.053789797,-0.031910414,0.014862253,0.001083189
"Infectious bronchitis virus from chickens in Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia 2015-2016","AIM: This study aimed to isolate some of the currently circulating infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains from some broiler chicken farms in Al-Hasa and to do some molecular characteristics of these strains. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected 300 tissue specimens, including the trachea, bronchi, lungs, and kidneys from some four commercial chicken farms showing respiratory manifestations. We tested these tissue specimens by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and gel-based PCR. We selected some PCR positive samples for isolation in the embryonated chicken eggs (ECE). We sequenced some PCR-positive samples and conducted phylogenetic analysis based on the obtained sequences. RESULTS: Our molecular surveillance revealed that 31.6% of the tested specimens were IBV positive by PCR. We selected some positive specimens showing low Ct values by the qRT-PCR for virus isolation by the ECE. The infected eggs showed hemorrhage, dwarfing, and death in some cases after three passages in the ECE. We sequenced some of the positive PCR specimens and used the obtained sequences to draw the phylogenetic tree based on the partial IBV-ORF-1a, N, and S1 gene sequences. The phylogenetic trees based on the IBV-N and S1 gene sequences showed that the circulating IBV strains in Al-Hasa during 2016 was showing a high degree of identity to some strains from Taiwan and Italy. Meanwhile, the grouping of these strains based on the IBV-S1 sequences revealed that the currently circulating IBV strains in Al-Hasa belonged to Gr.I.7 along with strains from Taiwan. CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed the continuous circulation of the IBV among the chicken population in Al-Hasa despite the intensive application of vaccines against this virus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.005410853,0.02738871,0.160429241,-0.103764209,0.260618772,0.086916761,-0.199273932,-0.076600591,0.096361441,0.313773065,0.099545952,0.046998988,-0.069439582,0.066791192,-0.105190441,0.083961776,0.021703185,0.02460421,0.031250574,-0.043821709,-0.015714768,0.040690421,-0.001846369,-0.078352361,0.010043209,0.010746814,0.020657962,0.004703063,0.045449827,0.026689475
"Analysis of the spike, ORF3, and nucleocapsid genes of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus circulating on Thai swine farms, 2011–2016","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) outbreaks on pig farms have caused significant economic loss in the swine industry since it was first reported in Thailand a decade ago. Anecdotal evidence suggests that PEDV is now endemic in this region, therefore genome information of circulating PEDV is important for molecular surveillance and evaluation of potential benefits of field vaccination. Here, we characterized PEDV infection on commercial Thai swine farms by screening 769 samples of feces and small intestinal contents from pigs with diarrhea between 2011 and 2016. Using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction targeting the spike (S) gene, 153 PEDV-positive samples were further subjected to analysis of the open reading frame 3 and nucleocapsid (N) genes. Comparison of 95 samples in which nucleotide sequencing was successfully obtained for all three genes revealed evolutionary diversity among the Thai PEDV strains. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that although some Thai strains changed little from years past, others resembled more closely to the recent strains reported in China. Interestingly, eight Thai PEDV strains possessed amino acid deletions in the N protein. The PEDV sequence divergence may be responsible for driving periodic outbreaks and continued persistence of PEDV on commercial swine farms. Our findings provide important insight into regional PEDV strains in circulation, which may assist future inclusions of suitable strains for future PEDV vaccines.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.050938475,0.007259956,0.105702897,-0.137345612,0.153532104,0.095581946,-0.045979954,-0.026136574,0.018129267,-0.018369849,0.04468914,0.149784451,-0.195693362,0.003577638,0.318546831,-0.283861791,-0.07684591,0.069070904,-0.079231295,0.244307283,-0.217394993,-0.088081559,0.10512925,-0.030998294,-0.075561964,-0.066245059,-0.014145526,0.034248753,0.085883946,0.003930976
Mechanism of Inhibition of Ebola Virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase by Remdesivir,"Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a 1′-cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide analogue prodrug that shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses. This compound is currently under clinical development for the treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD). While antiviral effects have been demonstrated in cell culture and in non-human primates, the mechanism of action of Ebola virus (EBOV) inhibition for remdesivir remains to be fully elucidated. The EBOV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex was recently expressed and purified, enabling biochemical studies with the relevant triphosphate (TP) form of remdesivir and its presumptive target. In this study, we confirmed that remdesivir-TP is able to compete for incorporation with adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Enzyme kinetics revealed that EBOV RdRp and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RdRp incorporate ATP and remdesivir-TP with similar efficiencies. The selectivity of ATP against remdesivir-TP is ~4 for EBOV RdRp and ~3 for RSV RdRp. In contrast, purified human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (h-mtRNAP) effectively discriminates against remdesivir-TP with a selectivity value of ~500-fold. For EBOV RdRp, the incorporated inhibitor at position i does not affect the ensuing nucleotide incorporation event at position i+1. For RSV RdRp, we measured a ~6-fold inhibition at position i+1 although RNA synthesis was not terminated. Chain termination was in both cases delayed and was seen predominantly at position i+5. This pattern is specific to remdesivir-TP and its 1′-cyano modification. Compounds with modifications at the 2′-position show different patterns of inhibition. While 2′-C-methyl-ATP is not incorporated, ara-ATP acts as a non-obligate chain terminator and prevents nucleotide incorporation at position i+1. Taken together, our biochemical data indicate that the major contribution to EBOV RNA synthesis inhibition by remdesivir can be ascribed to delayed chain termination. The long distance of five residues between the incorporated nucleotide analogue and its inhibitory effect warrant further investigation.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.109473604,-0.037338944,-0.057100706,0.048779458,-0.062692752,-0.006129767,0.073985821,-0.00166587,0.007662383,0.01106492,0.084174003,0.085409986,-0.086907186,-0.042748838,-0.038962809,-0.014679263,0.011879678,0.037671305,-0.006443293,-0.062016339,0.040080506,-0.054403386,0.041663353,-0.008997357,0.049730948,0.007586384,0.0629136,0.043919679,0.031977346,0.033584287
Rapid and Sensitive Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Combined With Lateral Flow Strip for Detecting African Swine Fever Virus,"African swine fever virus (ASFV), the etiological agent of African swine fever (ASF), a hemorrhagic fever of domestic pigs, has devastating consequences for the pig farming industry. More than 1,000,000 pigs have been slaughtered since 3 August 2018 in China. However, vaccines or drugs for ASF have yet to be developed. As such, a rapid test that can accurately detect ASFV on-site is important to the timely implementation of control measures. In this study, we developed a rapid test that combines recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) of the ASFV p72 gene with lateral flow detection (LFD). Results showed that the sensitivity of recombinase polymerase amplification with lateral flow dipstick (RPA-LFD) for ASFV was 150 copies per reaction within 10 min at 38°C. The assay was highly specific to ASFV and had no cross-reactions with other porcine viruses, including classical swine fever virus (CSFV). A total of 145 field samples were examined using our method, and the agreement of the positive rate between RPA-LFD (10/145) and real-time PCR (10/145) was 100%. Overall, RPA-LFD provides a novel alternative for the simple, sensitive, and specific identification of ASFV and showed potential for on-site ASFV detection.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.005863454,0.045602112,0.199027402,0.009554144,-0.043581367,-0.000630443,0.02646531,0.0211532,-0.009476489,-0.060358293,-0.055883767,0.051980367,-0.064000199,-0.073465373,-0.000245814,0.04717002,-0.071144553,-0.058987521,0.123764157,0.217091181,0.036676518,-0.015981618,0.015534503,-0.077166231,-0.093200278,0.067107294,0.02524438,0.038188973,0.048999248,-0.025890142
Transcriptome analysis of responses to bluetongue virus infection in Aedes albopictus cells,"BACKGROUND: Bluetongue virus (BTV) causes a disease among wild and domesticated ruminants which is not contagious, but which is transmitted by biting midges of the Culicoides species. BTV can induce an intense cytopathic effect (CPE) in mammalian cells after infection, although Culicoides- or mosquito-derived cell cultures cause non-lytic infection with BTV without CPE. However, little is known about the transcriptome changes in Aedes albopictus cells infected with BTV. METHODS: Transcriptome sequencing was used to identify the expression pattern of mRNA transcripts in A. albopictus cells infected with BTV, given the absence of the Culicoides genome sequence. Bioinformatics analyses were performed to examine the biological functions of the differentially expressed genes. Subsequently, quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction was utilized to validate the sequencing data. RESULTS: In total, 51,850,205 raw reads were generated from the BTV infection group and 51,852,293 from the control group. A total of 5769 unigenes were common to both groups; only 779 unigenes existed exclusively in the infection group and 607 in the control group. In total, 380 differentially expressed genes were identified, 362 of which were up-regulated and 18 of which were down-regulated. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that the differentially expressed genes mainly participated in endocytosis, FoxO, MAPK, dorso-ventral axis formation, insulin resistance, Hippo, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: This study represents the first attempt to investigate transcriptome-wide dysregulation in A. albopictus cells infected with BTV. The understanding of BTV pathogenesis and virus–vector interaction will be improved by global transcriptome profiling.

"Human adenovirus among hospitalized children with respiratory tract infections in Beijing, China, 2017–2018","BACKGROUND: Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) cause a wide range of diseases. However, the genotype diversity and epidemiological information relating to HAdVs among hospitalized children with respiratory tract infections (RTIs) is limited. Here, we describe the epidemiology and genotype distribution of HAdVs associated with RTIs in Beijing, China. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected from hospitalized children with RTIs from April 2017 to March 2018. HAdVs were detected by a TaqMan-based quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay, and the hexon gene was used for phylogenetic analysis. Epidemiological data were analyzed using statistical product and service solutions (SPSS) 21.0 software. RESULTS: HAdV was detected in 72 (5.64%) of the 1276 NPA specimens, with most (86.11%, 62/72) HAdV-positives cases detected among children < 6 years of age. HAdV-B3 (56.06%, 37/66) and HAdV-C2 (19.70%, 13/66) were the most frequent. Of the 72 HAdV-infected cases, 27 (37.50%) were co-infected with other respiratory viruses, most commonly parainfluenza virus (12.50%, 9/72) and rhinovirus (9.72%, 7/72). The log number of viral load ranged from 3.30 to 9.14 copies per mL of NPA, with no significant difference between the HAdV mono- and co-infection groups. The main clinical symptoms in the HAdV-infected patients were fever and cough, and 62 (86.11%, 62/72) were diagnosed with pneumonia. Additionally, HAdVs were detected throughout the year with a higher prevalence in summer. CONCLUSIONS: HAdV prevalence is related to age and season. HAdV-B and HAdV-C circulated simultaneously among the hospitalized children with RTIs in Beijing, and HAdV-B type 3 and HAdV-C type 2 were the most frequent.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.115725527,-0.063707366,-0.0269786,-0.077300164,0.051100061,-0.060493461,0.04328638,-0.039555961,0.025208697,-0.024767237,-0.019551382,0.04452523,-0.06043374,-0.051057459,0.021160269,-0.014300972,-0.094693366,0.026257788,-0.009086373,-0.066558648,0.017393913,0.258158457,-0.018565029,0.066029018,-0.145320034,0.147782316,-0.033889182,0.308452506,-0.151731994,0.040414434
Respiratory virus associated with surgery in children patients,"BACKGROUND: Viral respiratory infection (VRI) is a common contraindication to elective surgery. Asymptomatic shedding among pediatric surgery patients (PSPs) could potentially lead to progression of symptomatic diseases and cause outbreaks of respiratory diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of infection among mild symptomatic PSP group and asymptomatic PSP group after surgical procedure. METHODS: We collected the induced sputum from enrolled 1629 children (under 18 years of age) with no respiratory symptom prior to pediatric surgery between March 2017 and February 2019. We tested 16 different respiratory virus infections in post-surgery mild symptomatic PSP group and asymptomatic PSP group using a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay panel. We analyzed symptom data and quantitative viral load to investigate the association between viruses, symptoms and viral quantity in qRT-PCR-positive PSPs. RESULTS: Out of 1629 children enrolled, a total of 204 respiratory viruses were present in 171 (10.50%) PSPs including 47 patients with mild symptoms and 124 with no symptoms after surgery. Commonly detected viruses were human rhino/enterovirus (HRV/EV, 42.19%), parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3, 24.48%), coronavirus (CoV NL63, OC43, HKU1, 11.46%), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 9.9%). PIV3 infection with a higher viral load was frequently found in PSPs presenting with mild symptoms, progressing to pneumonia with radiographic evidence after surgery. HRV/EV were the most commonly detected pathogens in both asymptomatic and mild symptomatic PSPs. CoV (OC43, HKU1) infections with a higher viral load were mostly observed in asymptomatic PSPs progressing to alveolar or interstitial infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that PIV3 is a new risk factor for VRI in PSPs. Employing a more comprehensive, sensitive and quantitative method should be considered for preoperative testing of respiratory viruses in order to guide optimal surgical timing.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.200763669,-0.025438644,-0.083800659,0.00372878,0.029222062,-0.082796124,0.059787667,0.00148006,0.049207167,0.0309172,0.014052953,-0.028490415,0.025036389,0.044272119,0.023298975,-0.025859289,-0.012752293,-0.039738245,0.04732426,-0.012013525,-0.038640656,-0.032743648,-0.066629653,0.033241006,-0.022744547,0.03520309,0.03039884,-0.000596188,0.027607186,0.030751436
Comparing the yield of oropharyngeal swabs and sputum for detection of 11 common pathogens in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infection,"BACKGROUND: Advances in molecular laboratory techniques are changing the prospects for the diagnosis of viral infectious diseases. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay (multiplex-PCR) can detect dozens of pathogens simultaneously, greatly reducing turnaround time (TAT) and improving detection sensitivity. But as a double-edged sword, due to the high sensitivity of PCR, the type of respiratory specimens is critical to diagnosis. In this work, we performed a head-to-head comparison to evaluate the multiplex-PCR yields between two samples, sputum and flocked oropharyngeal swabs (OPS). METHODS: Eleven common respiratory pathogens were tested in hospitalized children< 13 years of age who met the criteria for lower respiratory tract infection by GeXP-based multiplex-PCR of paired OPS and sputum. RESULTS: From January to June 2018, 440 children with paired OPS and sputum were tested. The positive rate was 84% (369/440) for OPS and 88% (386/440) for sputum (p = .007). The frequency of detection of HRV, RSV, Influenza A virus, HMPV, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, M. pneumoniae, coronavirus, bocavirus and C. pneumoniae in sputa was higher than that of OPSs (all p < .001). Both types of specimens had similarly very good kappa values for most of pathogens, except for Mycoplasma pneumonia (κ = 0.61) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (κ = 0.24). Additionally, 79.3% (349/440) of cases showed consistent results between the two types of samples, and they were significantly younger than patients with inconsistent results (p = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Flocked oropharyngeal swabs and sputum performed similarly for the detection of common respiratory pathogens in hospitalized children by multiplex-PCR, except for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Young patients are likely to have consistent results between the two specimens.

Relationship of α2‐Macroglobulin with Steroid‐Induced Femoral Head Necrosis: A Chinese Population‐Based Association Study in Southeast China,"OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to identify the relationship of α‐2‐macroglobulin and microvascular vessel pathology with steroid‐induced femoral head necrosis in the Southeast Chinese population. METHODS: This study enrolled 40 patients diagnosed with steroid‐induced necrosis of the femoral head. Patients had various stages of femoral head necrosis. The differential expression of serum proteins and mRNA from patients with steroid‐induced necrosis of the femoral head (SINFH) and healthy volunteers was analyzed by western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QT‐PCR). The pathological change in osteocyte necrosis was indicated by hematoxylin and eosin stain and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Hematoxylin and eosin stain showed histopathology changes in the necrotic area of patients with steroid‐induced INFH: bone trabeculae were fewer and thinner, became broken, fragmented and structurally disordered; intraosseous adipose cells became enlarged; the arrangement of the osteoblasts became irregular; and vacant bone lacunae increased. QT‐PCR showed significantly lower levels of α‐2‐macroglobulin in the serum of patients with SINFH than in controls (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemical staining and western blotting demonstrated that the expression of α‐2‐macroglobulin was significantly decreased in the necrotic area of SINFH patients (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The α‐2‐macroglobulin may be associated with the pathology of SINFH. The multiple pathological reactions occur in SINFH and α‐2‐macroglobulin may serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of SINFH or a promising therapeutic target.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.03059284,-0.016416286,-0.021414084,-0.159544998,-0.090018199,-0.000560077,-0.026465507,0.016466756,-0.064180669,-0.011149561,-0.05250396,-0.004926418,-0.01633523,0.108343365,-0.046258756,0.003065503,0.025955452,-0.013337867,-0.02535121,-0.038863051,0.061413486,-0.057965082,0.019763244,-0.005175123,-0.008576277,-0.021285662,0.005122983,-0.004621415,0.00602309,-0.003213753
Global analysis of polysome-associated mRNA in vesicular stomatitis virus infected cells,"Infection of mammalian cells with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) results in the inhibition of cellular translation while viral translation proceeds efficiently. VSV RNA synthesis occurs entirely within the cytoplasm, where during transcription the viral polymerase produces 5 mRNAs that are structurally indistinct to cellular mRNAs with respect to their 5′ cap-structure and 3′-polyadenylate tail. Using the global approach of massively parallel sequencing of total cytoplasmic, monosome- and polysome-associated mRNA, we interrogate the impact of VSV infection of HeLa cells on translation. Analysis of sequence reads in the different fractions shows >60% of total cytoplasmic and polysome-associated reads map to the 5 viral genes by 6 hours post-infection, a time point at which robust host cell translational shut-off is observed. Consistent with an overwhelming abundance of viral mRNA in the polysome fraction, the reads mapping to cellular genes were reduced. The cellular mRNAs that remain most polysome-associated following infection had longer half-lives, were typically larger, and were more AU rich, features that are shared with the viral mRNAs. Several of those mRNAs encode proteins known to positively affect viral replication, and using chemical inhibition and siRNA depletion we confirm that the host chaperone heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3A (eIF3A)—encoded by 2 such mRNAs—support viral replication. Correspondingly, regulated in development and DNA damage 1 (Redd1) encoded by a host mRNA with reduced polysome association inhibits viral infection. These data underscore the importance of viral mRNA abundance in the shut-off of host translation in VSV infected cells and link the differential translatability of some cellular mRNAs with pro- or antiviral function.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.144973547,-0.085440175,-0.067862096,-0.021416384,-0.105141362,-0.002255655,0.012468412,-0.009233486,0.042766755,-0.001406813,-0.075546679,-0.115246758,0.041922835,0.117454891,-0.01899107,0.000759865,0.007584999,-0.071474126,-0.044576925,0.081676481,-0.044631245,0.105523452,-0.060731659,0.015902089,0.006314376,-0.119741722,0.00833548,-0.001114703,0.072706054,0.067059217
"Assessing the value of PCR assays in oral fluid samples for detecting African swine fever, classical swine fever, and foot-and-mouth disease in U.S. swine","INTRODUCTION: Oral fluid sampling and testing offers a convenient, unobtrusive mechanism for evaluating the health status of swine, especially grower and finisher swine. This assessment evaluates the potential testing of oral fluid samples with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to detect African swine fever, classical swine fever, or foot-and-mouth disease for surveillance during a disease outbreak and early detection in a disease-free setting. METHODS: We used a series of logical arguments, informed assumptions, and a range of parameter values from literature and industry practices to examine the cost and value of information provided by oral fluid sampling and rRT-PCR testing for the swine foreign animal disease surveillance objectives outlined above. RESULTS: Based on the evaluation, oral fluid testing demonstrated value for both settings evaluated. The greatest value was in an outbreak scenario, where using oral fluids would minimize disruption of animal and farm activities, reduce sample sizes by 23%-40%, and decrease resource requirements relative to current individual animal sampling plans. For an early detection system, sampling every 3 days met the designed prevalence detection threshold with 0.95 probability, but was quite costly. LIMITATIONS: Implementation of oral fluid testing for African swine fever, classical swine fever, or foot-and-mouth disease surveillance is not yet possible due to several limitations and information gaps. The gaps include validation of PCR diagnostic protocols and kits for African swine fever, classical swine fever, or foot-and-mouth disease on swine oral fluid samples; minimal information on test performance in a field setting; detection windows with low virulence strains of some foreign animal disease viruses; and the need for confirmatory testing protocol development.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.034797415,0.031247173,0.09851834,-0.032591047,-0.036111646,0.05035394,0.017212886,0.022681999,-0.011447532,0.023410463,0.007108963,0.019435397,-0.000500896,-0.060801221,0.060225267,-0.012271954,-0.048589626,0.002766139,-0.034093379,-0.044836623,-0.023359336,-0.007296635,0.00406443,-0.074235041,-0.021219577,0.013914793,-0.008451974,-0.013691797,-0.001688482,-0.011262424
Development of oligonucleotide microarray for accurate and simultaneous detection of avian respiratory viral diseases,"BACKGROUND: Avian influenza virus (AIV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are important avian pathogens that can cause enormous economic loss on the poultry industry. Different respiratory etiological agents may induce similar clinical signs that make differential diagnosis difficult. Importantly, AIV brings about severe threat to human public health. Therefore, a novel method that can distinguish these viruses quickly and simultaneously is urgently needed. RESULTS: In this study, an oligonucleotide microarray system was developed. AIV, including H5, H7, and H9 subtypes; NDV; and IBV were simultaneously detected and differentiated on a microarray. Three probes specific for AIV, NDV, and IBV, as well as three other probes for differentiating H5, H7, and H9 of AIV, were first designed and jet-printed to predetermined locations of initiator-integrated poly(dimethylsiloxane) for the synchronous detection of the six pathogens. The marked multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were hybridized with the specific probes, and the results of hybridization were read directly with the naked eyes. No cross-reaction was observed with 10 other subtypes of AIV and infectious bursal disease virus, indicating that the oligonucleotide microarray assay was highly specific. The sensitivity of the method was at least 100 times higher than that of the conventional PCR, and the detection limit of NDV, AIV, H5, H7, and H9 can reach 0.1 EID(50) (50% egg infective dose), except that of IBV, which was 1 EID(50) per reaction. In the validation of 93 field samples, AIV, IBV, and NDV were detected in 53 (56.99%) samples by oligonucleotide microarray and virus isolation and in 50 (53.76%) samples by conventional PCR. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully developed an approach to differentiate AIV, NDV, IBV, H5, H7, and H9 subtypes of AIV using oligonucleotide microarray. The microarray is an accurate, high-throughput, and relatively simple method for the rapid detection of avian respiratory viral diseases. It can be used for the epidemiological surveillance and diagnosis of AIV, IBV, and NDV.

Acute phase response in bovine coronavirus positive post-weaned calves with diarrhea,"Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is associated with severe diarrhea in calves, winter dysentery in adult cattle, and respiratory diseases in cattle of all ages. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between white blood cell counts and haptoglobin (Hp) and serum amyloid A (SAA) levels in post-weaned calves with diarrhea caused by BCoV and those that recovered from diarrhea. Blood and fecal samples were collected twice from the same animals; 17 post-weaned calves with diarrhea (first) and 15 post-weaned calves that recovered from diarrhea (second). Real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that all 17 fecal samples from post-weaned calves with diarrhea and one out of 15 from diarrhea-recovered calves were positive for BCoV and negative for Cryptosporidium spp., Escherichia coli K99, Salmonella spp., bovine rotavirus, and bovine viral diarrhea virus. No Eimeria oocysts were detected using the flotation method. In comparison with post-weaned calves with diarrhea, in diarrhea-recovered calves, the lymphocyte count was significantly higher (P = 0.018), and the monocyte count was significantly lower (P = 0.001); however, the number of monocytes was still high. Post-weaned calves with diarrhea had a significantly higher Hp concentration (P < 0.001) compared with diarrhea-recovered calves. The results indicated that increased Hp concentration and monocytosis but not SAA may be associated with diarrhea caused by BCoV. The present study suggests that the monitoring of Hp concentration and monocyte count is useful in the diagnosis of post-weaned calves with diarrhea caused by BCoV in this field.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.002949145,-0.00422638,0.056641148,-0.138298711,0.008687367,0.013764335,0.011550611,-0.014893864,-0.025738367,-0.044901332,0.03737915,0.058320887,-0.080929614,-0.005120617,0.116511306,-0.058311284,-0.012366586,-0.00338634,0.016488544,-0.012770483,-0.012524909,-0.005839986,-0.052509372,-0.002124981,0.048216707,-0.036559576,-0.025425348,-0.122434466,0.053373665,-0.037938166
"Molecular detection and genetic characterization of Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplama synoviae, and infectious bronchitis virus in poultry in Myanmar","BACKGROUND: In Southeast Asian countries, including Myanmar, poultry farming is a major industry. In order to manage and maintain stable productivity, it is important to establish policies for biosecurity. Infectious respiratory diseases are a major threat to poultry farming. Avian influenza and Newcastle disease have been reported in Myanmar, but no scientific information is available for other respiratory pathogens, such as mycoplasmas and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Identifying the genotypes and serotypes of IBVs is especially important to inform vaccination programs. In this study, we detected Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), M. synoviae (MS), and IBV in several poultry farms in Myanmar. RESULTS: Samples were collected from 20 farms in three major poultry farming areas in Myanmar, and MG, MS, and IBV were detected on two, four, and eight farms, respectively, by polymerase chain reaction. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the observed MG and MS isolates were not identical to vaccine strains. Three different genotypes of IBV were detected, but none was an unknown variant. CONCLUSIONS: Mycoplasmas and IBV were detected on poultry farms in Myanmar.

Prevalence and molecular characterization of infectious bronchitis virus isolated from chicken in Bangladesh,"AIM: The present study was aimed to determine the prevalence of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) as well as virus isolation, identification, and molecular characterization of various strains circulating in Bangladesh. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 371 swabs and organ samples were collected from four types of chicken including layer, Sonali (local), broiler, and broiler breeder under eight districts (Rangpur, Bogura, Tangail, Dhaka, Gazipur, Mymensingh, Jamalpur, and Cumilla) during 2014-2016 in Bangladesh. RESULTS: Out of 371 samples, 65 samples were positive in reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for molecular identification of IBV. The overall prevalence was 17.52% recorded and among the selected types of chicken, the highest prevalence of IBV was found in layer that was 42.22% followed by 17.24% in Sonali, 14.93% in broiler breeder, and lowest prevalence was 11.94% in broiler chicken, respectively. Moreover, the prevalence of IBV was recorded highest in aged chicken at 41-60 weeks, which was 54.55% in layer, 27.27% in Sonali, and, afterward, 14.68% was found in broiler breeder, respectively. Frequency of IBV more frequently in winter (22.67%) followed by rainy (15.87%) and summer season (11.58%). The highest prevalence of IBV was found Tangail district (41.67%) followed by Mymensingh (24.42%), Gazipur (19.32%), Dhaka (15.38%), Jamalpur (16.67%), Bogura (13.68%), Cumilla (5.88%), and Rangpur (9.26%), respectively. Samples that were found high positive in IBV RT-PCR (Ct value below 30) were subjected to inoculation into chicken egg embryo to observe characteristic changes in chicken embryo. Swabs and organ samples were processed and passaged in 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs through allantoic cavity route. IBV virus suspected samples inoculated into chicken egg embryos after 3-5 passages showed dwarfing and curling of the embryos which are characteristic lesions of IBV. Allantoic fluid was collected from all inoculated eggs and performed partial sequencing of S1 gene for three isolates. After sequencing, the phylogenetic tree was constructed from the nucleotide sequences of IBV isolates. Two of the isolates are 4/91 IBV and another one matched with QX-like IBV. CONCLUSION: The results revealed that the three isolates from different places in Bangladesh were identified for the 1(st) time as which will help for IBV control strategy.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.019465703,-0.014439152,0.111369496,-0.138144279,0.220130326,0.078358931,-0.190655399,-0.096242089,0.098157259,0.346890097,0.124918894,0.040936365,-0.132855807,0.06742617,-0.148092388,0.164965633,0.018455277,0.000731833,0.064048673,0.004025377,-0.073461985,0.021416968,0.001295704,-0.063745935,0.008329342,0.037040895,-0.005126327,0.040213646,0.049127212,-0.031864248
"Naturally occurring mutations in PB1 affect influenza A virus replication fidelity, virulence, and adaptability","BACKGROUND: Mutations in the PB1 subunit of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of influenza A virus can affect replication fidelity. Before the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in 2009, most human influenza A/H1N1 viruses contained the avian-associated residue, serine, at position 216 in PB1. However, near the onset of the 2009 pandemic, human viruses began to acquire the mammalian-associated residue, glycine, at PB1–216, and PB1–216G became predominant in human viruses thereafter. METHODS: Using entropy-based analysis algorithm, we have previously identified several host-specific amino-acid signatures that separated avian and swine viruses from human influenza viruses. The presence of these host-specific signatures in human influenza A/H1N1 viruses suggested that these mutations were the result of adaptive genetic evolution that enabled these influenza viruses to circumvent host barriers, which resulted in cross-species transmission. We investigated the biological impact of this natural avian-to-mammalian signature substitution at PB1–216 in human influenza A/H1N1 viruses. RESULTS: We found that PB1–216G viruses had greater mutation potential, and were more sensitive to ribavirin than PB1–216S viruses. In oseltamivir-treated HEK293 cells, PB1–216G viruses generated mutations in viral neuraminidase at a higher rate than PB1–216S viruses. By contrast, PB1–216S viruses were more virulent in mice than PB1–216G viruses. These results suggest that the PB1-S216G substitution enhances viral epidemiological fitness by increasing the frequency of adaptive mutations in human influenza A/H1N1 viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results thus suggest that the increased adaptability and epidemiological fitness of naturally arising human PB1–216G viruses, which have a canonical low-fidelity replicase, were the biological mechanisms underlying the replacement of PB1–216S viruses with a high-fidelity replicase following the emergence of pdmH1N1. We think that continued surveillance of such naturally occurring PB1–216 variants among others is warranted to assess the potential impact of changes in RdRp fidelity on the adaptability and epidemiological fitness of human A/H1N1 influenza viruses.

The Curious Case of the Nidovirus Exoribonuclease: Its Role in RNA Synthesis and Replication Fidelity,"Among RNA viruses, the order Nidovirales stands out for including viruses with the largest RNA genomes currently known. Nidoviruses employ a complex RNA-synthesizing machinery comprising a variety of non-structural proteins (nsps). One of the postulated drivers of the expansion of nidovirus genomes is the presence of a proofreading 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease (ExoN) belonging to the DEDDh family. ExoN may enhance the fidelity of RNA synthesis by correcting nucleotide incorporation errors made by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Here, we review our current understanding of ExoN evolution, structure, and function. Most experimental data are derived from studies of the ExoN domain of coronaviruses (CoVs), which were triggered by the bioinformatics-based identification of ExoN in the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and its relatives in 2003. Although convincing data supporting the proofreading hypothesis have been obtained, from biochemical assays and studies with CoV mutants lacking ExoN functionality, the features of ExoN from most other nidovirus families remain to be characterized. Remarkably, viable ExoN knockout mutants were obtained only for two CoVs, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV, whose RNA synthesis and replication kinetics were mildly affected by the lack of ExoN function. In several other CoV species, ExoN inactivation was not tolerated, and knockout mutants could not be rescued when launched using a reverse genetics system. This suggests that ExoN is also critical for primary viral RNA synthesis, a property that poorly matches the profile of an enzyme that would merely boost long-term replication fidelity. In CoVs, ExoN resides in a bifunctional replicase subunit (nsp14) whose C-terminal part has (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase activity. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV nsp14 has shed light on the interplay between these two domains, and on nsp14’s interactions with nsp10, a co-factor that strongly enhances ExoN activity in vitro assays. Further elucidation of the structure-function relationships of ExoN and its interactions with other (viral and/or host) members of the CoV replication machinery will be key to understanding the enzyme’s role in viral RNA synthesis and pathogenesis, and may contribute to the design of new approaches to combat emerging nidoviruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.164860495,0.131825086,-0.159794127,0.113333053,-0.002836747,-0.031762206,0.07578949,0.009810179,-0.025101212,0.02031491,0.066793804,0.018648252,-0.051950639,-0.019391713,0.000615471,0.049173077,-0.00973885,-0.04073358,-0.051040593,0.004524109,0.027322365,-0.052424017,0.089028288,0.049871828,0.043754394,0.064081524,-0.048840765,-0.059590748,-0.035503713,-0.097196028
"Enhanced surveillance for severe pneumonia, Thailand 2010–2015","BACKGROUND: The etiology of severe pneumonia is frequently not identified by routine disease surveillance in Thailand. Since 2010, the Thailand Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) and US CDC have conducted surveillance to detect known and new etiologies of severe pneumonia. METHODS: Surveillance for severe community-acquired pneumonia was initiated in December 2010 among 30 hospitals in 17 provinces covering all regions of Thailand. Interlinked clinical, laboratory, pathological and epidemiological components of the network were created with specialized guidelines for each to aid case investigation and notification. Severe pneumonia was defined as chest-radiograph confirmed pneumonia of unknown etiology in a patient hospitalized ≤48 h and requiring intubation with ventilator support or who died within 48 h after hospitalization; patients with underlying chronic pulmonary or neurological disease were excluded. Respiratory and pathological specimens were tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for nine viruses, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 14 bacteria. Cases were reported via a secure web-based system. RESULTS: Of specimens from 972 cases available for testing during December 2010 through December 2015, 589 (60.6%) had a potential etiology identified; 399 (67.8%) were from children aged < 5 years. At least one viral agent was detected in 394 (40.5%) cases, with the most common of single vial pathogen detected being respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (110/589, 18.7%) especially in children under 5 years. Bacterial pathogens were detected in 341 cases of which 67 cases had apparent mixed infections. The system added MERS-CoV testing in September 2012 as part of Thailand’s outbreak preparedness; no cases were identified from the 767 samples tested. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced surveillance improved the understanding of the etiology of severe pneumonia cases and improved the MOPH’s preparedness and response capacity for emerging respiratory pathogens in Thailand thereby enhanced global health security. Guidelines for investigation of severe pneumonia from this project were incorporated into surveillance and research activities within Thailand and shared for adaption by other countries.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.211639116,0.040995793,-0.128542647,-0.010219587,0.004042184,-0.020003822,-0.012993011,0.125113269,0.033538274,0.034873159,-0.004970358,-0.0115624,-0.017901768,-0.086210047,-0.017924045,-0.028213506,-0.049617481,0.019081623,-0.052855813,0.023109559,-0.022953584,0.143333121,0.02811744,-0.010439126,0.057270979,0.036430616,0.029667456,0.120278702,0.000724934,-0.045687694
"Comparison of viral and epidemiological profiles of hospitalized children with severe acute respiratory infection in Beijing and Shanghai, China","BACKGROUND: No comparison data have been reported on viral and epidemiological profiles of hospitalized children with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in Beijing or Shanghai, China. METHODS: We collected 700 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from hospitalized children with SARI in Beijing (northern China) and Shanghai (southern China). Multiple respiratory viruses (including 15 common viruses) were screened by validated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays and confirmed by sequencing. Demographic data and the distribution of viral infections were also examined. RESULTS: Of 700 samples, 547 (78.1%) tested positive for viral infections. The picornaviruses (PIC), which included rhinovirus (RV) and enterovirus (EV), were the most common (34.0%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (28.3%), human bocavirus (HBoV) (19.1%), adenovirus (ADV) (13.7%), human coronaviruses (HCoV) (10.7%), influenza A and B (8.9%), parainfluenza virus (PIV 1–3) (7.9%), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (5.0%). PIC (RV/EV) and RSV were the most prevalent etiological agents of SARI in both cities. The total and age-matched prevalence of RSV, HCoV, and hMPV among SARI children under 5 years old were significantly higher in Beijing than in Shanghai. Different age and seasonal distribution patterns of the viral infections were found between Beijing and Shanghai. CONCLUSIONS: Viral infection was tested and shown to be the most prevalent etiological agent among children with SARI in either the Beijing or the Shanghai area, while showing different patterns of viral and epidemiological profiles. Our findings provide a better understanding of the roles of geographic location and climate in respiratory viral infections in hospitalized children with SARI.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.213399024,-0.12091786,-0.088565174,0.083846659,0.09242929,-0.081834091,0.081308357,-0.122825531,0.137647073,-0.05501274,0.010699702,0.027759481,0.011847757,0.024413659,-0.016444022,-0.025519303,-0.048680936,0.03479719,-0.053956806,0.009575539,0.008253998,0.097386643,-0.022027702,-0.008687397,-0.04699257,0.00644037,0.040691053,0.095945543,0.002110217,0.053862306
A Structure-Function Diversity Survey of the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases From the Positive-Strand RNA Viruses,"The RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) encoded by the RNA viruses are a unique class of nucleic acid polymerases. Each viral RdRP contains a 500–600 residue catalytic module with palm, fingers, and thumb domains forming an encircled human right hand architecture. Seven polymerase catalytic motifs are located in the RdRP palm and fingers domains, comprising the most conserved parts of the RdRP and are responsible for the RNA-only specificity in catalysis. Functional regions are often found fused to the RdRP catalytic module, resulting in a high level of diversity in RdRP global structure and regulatory mechanism. In this review, we surveyed all 46 RdRP-sequence available virus families of the positive-strand RNA viruses listed in the 2018b collection of the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy (ICTV) and chose a total of 49 RdRPs as representatives. By locating hallmark residues in RdRP catalytic motifs and by referencing structural and functional information in the literature, we were able to estimate the N- and C-terminal boundaries of the catalytic module in these RdRPs, which in turn serve as reference points to predict additional functional regions beyond the catalytic module. Interestingly, a large number of virus families may have additional regions fused to the RdRP N-terminus, while only a few of them have such regions on the C-terminal side of the RdRP. The current knowledge on these additional regions, either in three-dimensional (3D) structure or in function, is quite limited. In the five RdRP-structure available virus families in the positive-strand RNA viruses, only the Flaviviridae family has the 3D structural information resolved for such regions. Hence, future efforts to solve full-length RdRP structures containing these regions and to dissect the functional contribution of them are necessary to improve the overall understanding of the RdRP proteins as an evolutionarily integrated group, and our analyses here may serve as a guideline for selecting representative RdRP systems in these studies.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.201513791,-0.036722313,-0.09119832,0.144480564,0.005978038,-0.057783753,0.091233712,0.040784122,-0.099442637,0.057320269,0.118021309,0.183324984,-0.104457435,-0.128366479,-0.067302032,-0.06491884,0.07754788,-0.06751046,-0.062731862,-0.087225005,0.058457413,-0.060525734,0.050225025,-0.06244323,-0.004649403,0.061204247,0.024810982,0.042920255,0.072807789,0.028235861
Evaluation of Diagnostic Performance of Three Indirect Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays for the Detection of IgG Antibodies to Ebola Virus in Human Sera,"Filovirus serological diagnosis and epidemiological investigations are hampered due to the unavailability of validated immunoassays. Diagnostic performance of three indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (I-ELISA) was evaluated for the detection of IgG antibody to Ebola virus (EBOV) in human sera. One I-ELISA was based on a whole EBOV antigen (WAg) and two utilized recombinant nucleocapsid (NP) and glycoproteins (GP), respectively. Validation data sets derived from individual sera collected in South Africa (SA), representing an EBOV non-endemic country, and from sera collected during an Ebola disease (EBOD) outbreak in Sierra Leone (SL), were categorized according to the compounded results of the three I-ELISAs and real time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At the cut-off values selected at 95% accuracy level by the two-graph receiver operating characteristic analysis, specificity in the SA EBOV negative serum panel (n = 273) ranged from 98.17% (GP ELISA) to 99.27% (WAg ELISA). Diagnostic specificity in the SL EBOV negative panel (n = 676) was 100% by the three ELISAs. The diagnostic sensitivity in 423 RT-PCR confirmed EBOD patients was dependent on the time when the serum was collected after onset of disease. It significantly increased 2 weeks post-onset, reaching 100% sensitivity by WAg and NP and 98.1% by GP I-ELISA.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.034483199,0.053808066,0.128166673,-0.044778157,-0.052851428,-0.001084402,-0.009204988,0.002913603,-0.018845078,-0.030327469,-0.005847197,0.021046589,-0.017553962,0.00965219,-0.01706895,-0.005325721,0.006370995,0.005415693,-0.031360582,-0.091099621,-0.021615335,-0.025748356,0.01621783,-0.014543573,0.026334285,0.021165394,0.040377256,-0.048670685,-0.032486656,0.003236633
Hepatitis E Virus Replication,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a small quasi-enveloped, (+)-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Hepeviridae family. There are at least 20 million HEV infections annually and 60,000 HEV-related deaths worldwide. HEV can cause up to 30% mortality in pregnant women and progress to liver cirrhosis in immunocompromised individuals and is, therefore, a greatly underestimated public health concern. Although a prophylactic vaccine for HEV has been developed, it is only licensed in China, and there is currently no effective, non-teratogenic treatment. HEV encodes three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 is the largest viral gene product, encoding the replicative machinery of the virus including a methyltransferase, RNA helicase, and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. ORF1 additionally contains a number of poorly understood domains including a hypervariable region, a putative protease, and the so-called ‘X’ and ‘Y’ domains. ORF2 is the viral capsid essential for formation of infectious particles and ORF3 is a small protein essential for viral release. In this review, we focus on the domains encoded by ORF1, which collectively mediate the virus’ asymmetric genome replication strategy. We summarize what is known, unknown, and hotly debated regarding the coding and non-coding regions of HEV ORF1, and present a model of how HEV replicates its genome.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.133982726,-0.049635524,-0.042054251,0.02008852,-0.001160917,-0.011893614,-0.007165753,0.017120549,0.013773671,0.015522297,-0.014441587,0.009343232,0.012908942,-0.066167667,-0.007338283,-0.069377072,0.028502022,0.048427158,0.042138607,0.037410835,-0.014116469,0.014981293,-0.078485231,-0.027552335,-0.022696378,0.031807655,0.024417316,-0.027230181,0.021603184,-0.027816696
Molecular detection of respiratory pathogens and typing of human rhinovirus of adults hospitalized for exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"BACKGROUND: Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) and asthma are associated with a variety of precipitating factors including infection. This study assessed the infective viral etiologies by real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction of patients hospitalized with AECOPD and asthma exacerbations. In addition, infective etiologies were assessed for association with the clinical outcome of the patients. METHODS: Adults admitted with AECOPD and asthma exacerbations between August 2016 and July 2017 were recruited. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were obtained from the patients within 1–2 days of admission and subjected to pathogen detection and human rhinovirus (HRV) typing. RESULTS: Altogether 402 patients with AECOPD, 80 stable COPD, 100 asthma exacerbation and 21 stable asthma subjects were recruited. Among those admitted for AECOPD and asthma exacerbations, 141(35.1%) and 45(45.0%) respectively had pathogens identified in the NPA specimens. The commonest virus identified was influenza A followed by HRV. HRV typing identified HRV-A and HRV-C as the more common HRV with a wide variety of genotypes. Identification of pathogens in NPA or HRV typing otherwise did not affect clinical outcomes including the hospital length of stay, readmission rates and mortality except that identification of pathogens in asthma exacerbation was associated with a lower rate of readmissions at 30 and 60 days. CONCLUSIONS: Many respiratory viruses were associated with AECOPD and asthma exacerbation. HRV-A and HRV-C were the more common HRV associated with exacerbations. Identification of pathogens in NPA was associated with less readmissions for asthma patients at 30 and 60 days. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02866357.

Acute human bocavirus 1 infection in child with life-threatening bilateral bronchiolitis and right-sided pneumonia: a case report,"BACKGROUND: Human bocavirus 1 is a commonly detected human parvovirus. Many studies have shown human bocavirus 1 as a pathogen in association with acute respiratory tract infections in children. However, because human bocavirus 1 persists in the upper airways for extensive time periods after acute infection, the definition and diagnostics of acute human bocavirus 1 infection is challenging. Until now, detection of human bocavirus 1 exclusively, high viral load in respiratory samples, and viremia have been associated with a clinical picture of acute respiratory illness. There are no studies showing detection of human bocavirus 1 messenger ribonucleic acid in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells as a diagnostic marker for acute lower respiratory tract infection. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 17-month-old Latvian boy who presented in intensive care unit with acute bilateral bronchiolitis, with a history of rhinorrhea and cough for 6 days and fever for the last 2 days prior to admission, followed by severe respiratory distress and tracheal intubation. Human bocavirus 1 was the only respiratory virus detected by a qualitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction panel. For the diagnosis of acute human bocavirus 1 infection, both molecular and serological approaches were used. Human bocavirus 1 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was detected simultaneously in nasopharyngeal aspirate, stool, and blood, as well as in the corresponding cell-free blood plasma by qualitative and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, revealing high DNA-copy numbers in nasopharyngeal aspirate and stool. Despite a low-load viremia, human bocavirus 1 messenger ribonucleic acid was found in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells. For detection of human bocavirus 1-specific antibodies, non-competitive immunoglobulin M and competitive immunoglobulin G enzyme immunoassays were used. The plasma was positive for both human bocavirus 1-specific immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of human bocavirus 1 genomic DNA in blood plasma and human bocavirus 1 messenger ribonucleic acid in peripheral blood mononuclear cells together with human bocavirus 1-specific immunoglobulin M are markers of acute human bocavirus 1 infection that may cause life-threatening acute bronchiolitis.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.104279456,-0.024691783,-0.016117812,-0.025508995,-0.010503409,-0.043814335,0.069811451,-0.047793993,0.060291177,0.01594764,-0.011114491,-0.029681759,0.089313549,0.000345118,0.026723415,-0.013607605,-0.028360482,-0.023433574,0.007954907,0.00049944,0.029398274,-0.003859202,-0.008929296,0.010901182,-0.012203203,0.015027897,-0.09745069,0.048786466,-0.04558177,-0.049026187
Advances in Diagnostic Approaches for Viral Etiologies of Diarrhea: From the Lab to the Field,"The applications of correct diagnostic approaches play a decisive role in timely containment of infectious diseases spread and mitigation of public health risks. Nevertheless, there is a need to update the diagnostics regularly to capture the new, emergent, and highly divergent viruses. Acute gastroenteritis of viral origin has been identified as a significant cause of mortality across the globe, with the more serious consequences seen at the extremes of age groups (young and elderly) and immune-compromised individuals. Therefore, significant advancements and efforts have been put in the development of enteric virus diagnostics to meet the WHO ASSURED criteria as a benchmark over the years. The Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent (ELISA) and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) are the basic assays that provided the platform for development of several efficient diagnostics such as real-time RT-PCR, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), polymerase spiral reaction (PSR), biosensors, microarrays and next generation sequencing.

Effects of Xinjiaxiangruyin on the TLR7 pathway in influenza virus-infected lungs of mice housed in a hygrothermal environment,"BACKGROUND: To investigate the effects and immunological mechanisms of the traditional Chinese medicine Xinjiaxiangruyin on controlling influenza virus (FM1 strain) infection in mice housed in a hygrothermal environment. METHODS: Mice were housed in normal and hygrothermal environments, and intranasally infected with influenza virus (FM1). A high-performance liquid chromatography fingerprint of Xinjiaxiangruyin was used to provide an analytical method for quality control. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to measure messenger RNA expression of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65 in the TLR7 signaling pathway and virus replication in the lungs. Western blotting was used to measure the expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 proteins. Flow cytometry was used to detect the proportion of Th17/T-regulatory cells. RESULTS: Xinjiaxiangruyin effectively alleviated lung inflammation in C57BL/6 mice in hot and humid environments. Guizhimahuanggebantang significantly reduced lung inflammation in C57BL/6 mice. The expression of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 mRNA in lung tissue of WT mice in the normal environment, GZMHGBT group was significantly lower than that in the model group (P < 0.05). In WT mice exposed to the hot and humid environment, the expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 mRNA in the XJXRY group were significantly different from those in the virus group. The expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 protein in lung tissue of WT mice exposed to the normal environment, GZMHGBT group was significantly lower than those in the model group. In WT mice exposed to hot and humid environments, the expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 protein in XJXRY group were significantly different from those in the virus group. CONCLUSION: Guizhimahuanggebantang demonstrated a satisfactory therapeutic effect on mice infected with the influenza A virus (FM1 strain) in a normal environment, and Xinjiaxiangruyin demonstrated a clear therapeutic effect in damp and hot environments and may play a protective role against influenza through downregulation of the TLR7 signal pathway.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.04354787,-0.04656131,0.00329488,-0.088246517,-0.066743842,0.102392738,-0.015755349,-0.04586293,0.028736397,-0.077431325,-0.054304937,-0.040691965,-0.031799006,0.099995575,-0.018755629,0.016697279,-0.002403135,-0.067174135,-0.028668016,-0.034277687,0.037645625,-0.059909577,0.033791349,0.006284694,-0.033551797,-0.012921564,0.005841984,-0.00554313,0.002819382,-0.044933982
Impact of RNA Virus Evolution on Quasispecies Formation and Virulence,"RNA viruses are known to replicate by low fidelity polymerases and have high mutation rates whereby the resulting virus population tends to exist as a distribution of mutants. In this review, we aim to explore how genetic events such as spontaneous mutations could alter the genomic organization of RNA viruses in such a way that they impact virus replications and plaque morphology. The phenomenon of quasispecies within a viral population is also discussed to reflect virulence and its implications for RNA viruses. An understanding of how such events occur will provide further evidence about whether there are molecular determinants for plaque morphology of RNA viruses or whether different plaque phenotypes arise due to the presence of quasispecies within a population. Ultimately this review gives an insight into whether the intrinsically high error rates due to the low fidelity of RNA polymerases is responsible for the variation in plaque morphology and diversity in virulence. This can be a useful tool in characterizing mechanisms that facilitate virus adaptation and evolution.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.120145953,-0.058749218,-0.039110299,0.098968931,0.015855539,0.008157212,0.090702185,0.033590006,-0.059881756,0.085023353,0.085698191,0.022334064,-0.008196693,-0.022060686,0.04566138,0.03127484,-0.063565114,-0.045102755,-0.077294873,0.008225957,0.064352612,-0.0529363,0.001130814,0.099551798,-0.096219422,-0.008232611,0.063168545,-0.050148193,-0.099741895,-0.08829036
Evolutionary Analysis of the VP1 and RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Regions of Human Norovirus GII.P17-GII.17 in 2013–2017,"Human norovirus (HuNoV) GII.P17-GII.17 (Kawasaki2014 variant) reportedly emerged in 2014 and caused gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. To clarify the evolution of both VP1 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) regions of GII.P17-GII.17, we analyzed both global and novel Japanese strains detected during 2013–2017. Time-scaled phylogenetic trees revealed that the ancestral GII.17 VP1 region diverged around 1949, while the ancestral GII.P17 RdRp region diverged around 2010. The evolutionary rates of the VP1 and RdRp regions were estimated at ~2.7 × 10(−3) and ~2.3 × 10(−3) substitutions/site/year, respectively. The phylogenetic distances of the VP1 region exhibited no overlaps between intra-cluster and inter-cluster peaks in the GII.17 strains, whereas those of the RdRp region exhibited a unimodal distribution in the GII.P17 strains. Conformational epitope positions in the VP1 protein of the GII.P17-GII.17 strains were similar, although some substitutions, insertions and deletions had occurred. Strains belonging to the same cluster also harbored substitutions around the binding sites for the histo-blood group antigens of the VP1 protein. Moreover, some amino acid substitutions were estimated to be near the interface between monomers and the active site of the RdRp protein. These results suggest that the GII.P17-GII.17 virus has produced variants with the potential to alter viral antigenicity, host-binding capability, and replication property over the past 10 years.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.095527089,-0.032270475,-0.012199849,-0.041087344,0.045279779,0.018945882,0.025423063,0.003629179,-0.023859672,-0.003862145,0.038934506,0.116949983,-0.07244191,-0.065253261,-0.027095868,-0.051668431,0.014203994,-0.00419274,-0.014658444,-0.00859126,0.061800448,0.000366457,0.006686445,0.022266963,0.02553002,0.034516254,0.025042196,0.026567989,0.002847352,0.052009781
Clinical outcomes of patients treated with intravenous zanamivir for severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection: a case report series,"BACKGROUND: Intravenous (IV) zanamivir could be a suitable alternative for the treatment of severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in patients who are unable to take oral or inhaled medication, for example, those on mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). However, data on the clinical outcomes of such patients is limited. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the clinical outcomes of four patients who were admitted at the intensive care unit during the 2017–2018 influenza season with severe sepsis (SOFA score > 11) and acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring ECMO and mechanical ventilation. Two patients were immune-compromised. The A(H1N1)pdm09 genome was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on nasopharyngeal specimen swabs prior to administration of IV zanamivir at a dose of 600 mg twice daily. Weekly qualitative PCR analysis was done to monitor viral clearance, with zanamivir treatment being discontinued upon receipt of negative results. In addition, the patients were managed for concomitant multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, with infection resolution confirmed with blood cultures. The median time for zanamivir treatment was 10 days (IQR 10–17). The clinical outcome was favourable with all four patients surviving and improving clinically. All four patients achieved viral clearance of A(H1N1)pdm09 genome, and resolution of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. CONCLUSIONS: IV zanamivir could be a good therapeutic option in patients with severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection who are unable to take oral or aerosolised antiviral medication. We recommend prospective randomized control trials to support this hypothesis.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.151417456,-0.023548872,-0.079124946,-0.02950368,-0.103827114,0.097760347,-0.107457422,0.096392689,-0.127150027,-0.001264532,-0.010805045,0.022626423,0.020135196,0.058987403,-0.035001215,0.002579607,0.01496513,0.073741563,-0.011902025,0.014134564,0.034892546,-0.042788073,-0.051167352,-0.039172578,-0.04873181,-0.006886782,-0.004377165,-0.005013343,0.004344901,0.062736193
"Outbreak of macrolide-resistant mycoplasma pneumoniae in a primary school in Beijing, China in 2018","BACKGROUND: On 7th June, 2018, a primary school in Beijing, China notified Shunyi CDC of an outbreak of acute respiratory disease characterized by fever and cough among students and resulting in nine hospitalization cases during the preceding 2 weeks. We started an investigation to identify the etiologic agent, find additional cases, develop and implement control measures. METHODS: We defined probable cases as students, teachers and other staffs in the school developed fever (T ≥ 37.5 °C) with cough or sore throat; or a diagnosis of pneumonia during May 1–June 31, 2018. Confirmed cases were probable cases with Mycoplasma pneumoniae detected in oropharyngeal (OP) swabs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We searched case by reviewing school absenteeism records and interviewing students, teachers and staff in this school. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from symptomatic students. Two qPCR) assay, a duplex qPCR assay, and sequencing were performed to determine the pathogen, genotype and macrolide resistance at the gene level, respectively. RESULTS: From May 1st to June 31st, 2018, we identified 55 cases (36 probable and 19 confirmed), of whom 25 (45%) were hospitalized for complications. All cases were students, none of the teachers and other staffs in the school were with similar symptoms. The attack rate (AR) was 3.9% (55/1398) for all students. The cases were mainly male (58%), with an age range of 7–8 years (median: 7 years). 72% (18/25) of inpatients had radiograph findings consistent with pneumonia, and some cases were hospitalized for up to 4 weeks. Pathogen detection results indicated that Mycoplasma pneumonia (M. pneumoniae) P1 type 1 was the causative agent in this outbreak, and the strain harbored one point mutation of A to G at position 2063. CONCLUSIONS: The infections by macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae are not always mild and pneumonia was common and M. pneumoniae could causes serious complications which require long-term hospitalization. In the future infectious disease prevention and control practice, M. pneumoniae should be paid more attention. It is necessary to establish and improve the pathogen and drug resistance surveillance system in order to prevent and control such mutated strains of M. pneumoniae from causing future outbreaks or epidemics in China.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.121967304,-0.012564198,-0.014852416,-0.080128824,-0.026462675,0.009732054,-0.017708202,0.050955088,-0.059279219,0.025551647,-0.011924572,0.030044161,-0.038207844,-0.098327228,0.010321895,-0.00196332,-0.055360561,0.02347276,-0.019954951,-0.006408199,-0.027379944,0.14570212,0.025105048,-0.005419873,0.017154951,0.090215216,0.053708142,0.135221505,0.033418975,-0.054679575
Clinical outcomes among hospital patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection,"BACKGROUND: Mortality is high among patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. We aimed to determine hospital mortality and the factors associated with it in a cohort of MERS-CoV patients. METHODS: We reviewed hospital records of confirmed cases (detection of virus by polymerase chain reaction from respiratory tract samples) of MERS-CoV patients (n = 63) admitted to Buraidah Central Hospital in Al-Qassim, Saudi Arabia between 2014 and 2017. We abstracted data on demography, vital signs, associated conditions presented on admission, pre-existing chronic diseases, treatment, and vital status. Bi-variate comparisons and multiple logistic regressions were the choice of data analyses. RESULTS: The mean age was 60 years (SD = 18.2); most patients were male (74.6%) and Saudi citizens (81%). All but two patients were treated with Ribavirin plus Interferon. Hospital mortality was 25.4%. Patients who were admitted with septic shock and/or organ failure were significantly more likely to die than patients who were admitted with pneumonia and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR = 47.9, 95% CI = 3.9, 585.5, p-value 0.002). Age, sex, and presence of chronic conditions were not significantly associated with mortality.

Risk factors and patterns of household clusters of respiratory viruses in rural Nepal,"Viral pneumonia is an important cause of death and morbidity among infants worldwide. Transmission of non-influenza respiratory viruses in households can inform preventative interventions and has not been well-characterised in South Asia. From April 2011 to April 2012, household members of pregnant women enrolled in a randomised trial of influenza vaccine in rural Nepal were surveyed weekly for respiratory illness until 180 days after birth. Nasal swabs were tested by polymerase chain reaction for respiratory viruses in symptomatic individuals. A transmission event was defined as a secondary case of the same virus within 14 days of initial infection within a household. From 555 households, 825 initial viral illness episodes occurred, resulting in 79 transmission events. The overall incidence of transmission was 1.14 events per 100 person-weeks. Risk of transmission incidence was associated with an index case age 1–4 years (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 2.35; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40–3.96), coinfection as initial infection (IRR 1.94; 95% CI 1.05–3.61) and no electricity in household (IRR 2.70; 95% CI 1.41–5.00). Preventive interventions targeting preschool-age children in households in resource-limited settings may decrease the risk of transmission to vulnerable household members, such as young infants.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.152895324,-0.079433972,-0.089000476,-0.015252301,0.011067107,0.060418022,-0.00654416,0.013584554,0.029228716,-0.095403394,0.041259859,0.032871159,-0.082567391,-0.097622348,-0.017813575,0.114845455,-0.077234772,-0.082636623,0.044311489,-0.014764686,-0.154218676,0.008566175,-0.060385272,0.045934363,0.039143242,-0.044042643,0.03208524,-0.116563568,-0.044613655,-0.041619867
Dudleya brittonii extract promotes survival rate and M2-like metabolic change in porcine 3D4/31 alveolar macrophages,"OBJECTIVE: Although alveolar macrophages play a key role in the respiratory immunity of livestock, studies on the mechanism of differentiation and survival of alveolar macrophages are lacking. Therefore, we undertook to investigate changes in the lipid metabolism and survival rate, using 3D4/31 macrophages and Dudleya brittonii which has been used as a traditional asthma treatment. METHODS: 3D4/31 macrophages were used as the in vitro porcine alveolar macrophages model. The cells were activated by exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Dudleya brittonii extraction was performed with distilled water. For evaluating the cell survival rate, we performed the water-soluble tetrazolium salt cell viability assay and growth curve analysis. To confirm cell death, cell cycle and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured using flow cytometric analysis by applying fluorescence dye dichlorofluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide. Furthermore, we also evaluated cellular lipid accumulation with oil red O staining, and fatty acid synthesis related genes expression levels using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with SYBR green dye. Glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle related gene expression levels were measured using qPCR after exposure to Dudleya brittonii extract (DB) for 12 h. RESULTS: The ROS production and cell death were induced by PMA treatment, and exposure to DB reduced the PMA induced downregulation of cell survival. The PMA and DB treatments upregulated the lipid accumulation, with corresponding increase in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha, fatty acid synthase mRNA expressions. DB-PMA co-treatment reduced the glycolysis genes expression, but increased the expressions of fatty acid oxidation and TCA cycle genes. CONCLUSION: This study provides new insights and directions for further research relating to the immunity of porcine respiratory system, by employing a model based on alveolar macrophages and natural materials.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.057283028,-0.016872268,0.028530729,-0.11297251,-0.083825373,0.047113954,0.040741149,-0.035385438,0.052223557,-0.024262423,-0.073762206,-0.038072254,-0.015658815,0.07595137,0.014771027,-0.020714692,-0.01088709,-0.059786687,-0.022020622,-0.035761069,0.001700072,-0.056722543,0.036512761,-0.018049229,-0.042853971,-0.004794873,-0.014386558,0.030570852,0.022328695,-0.035553794
"Nipah virus: epidemiology, pathology, immunobiology and advances in diagnosis, vaccine designing and control strategies – a comprehensive review","Nipah (Nee-pa) viral disease is a zoonotic infection caused by Nipah virus (NiV), a paramyxovirus belonging to the genus Henipavirus of the family Paramyxoviridae. It is a biosafety level-4 pathogen, which is transmitted by specific types of fruit bats, mainly Pteropus spp. which are natural reservoir host. The disease was reported for the first time from the Kampung Sungai Nipah village of Malaysia in 1998. Human-to-human transmission also occurs. Outbreaks have been reported also from other countries in South and Southeast Asia. Phylogenetic analysis affirmed the circulation of two major clades of NiV as based on currently available complete N and G gene sequences. NiV isolates from Malaysia and Cambodia clustered together in NiV-MY clade, whereas isolates from Bangladesh and India clusterered within NiV-BD clade. NiV isolates from Thailand harboured mixed population of sequences. In humans, the virus is responsible for causing rapidly progressing severe illness which might be characterized by severe respiratory illness and/or deadly encephalitis. In pigs below six months of age, respiratory illness along with nervous symptoms may develop. Different types of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays along with molecular methods based on polymerase chain reaction have been developed for diagnostic purposes. Due to the expensive nature of the antibody drugs, identification of broad-spectrum antivirals is essential along with focusing on small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). High pathogenicity of NiV in humans, and lack of vaccines or therapeutics to counter this disease have attracted attention of researchers worldwide for developing effective NiV vaccine and treatment regimens.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.015826482,0.011372687,0.006441361,-0.01886271,0.075249281,0.100608677,0.095662735,0.002451717,0.042031716,0.057958025,-0.02455802,-0.026039393,0.026351443,-0.043743537,0.033546318,-0.019860758,-0.083067055,0.071873339,-0.030678632,0.024987043,0.041064485,-0.005341299,-0.037601328,0.000960096,-0.004223184,-0.00379763,0.02524555,0.006505668,0.047025045,0.005425121
Recombinant adenoviral vaccine encoding the spike 1 subunit of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus elicits strong humoral and cellular immune responses in mice,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has rapidly spread throughout the Middle East since its discovery in 2012. The virus poses a significant global public health threat with potentially devastating effects. In this study, a recombinant adenoviral-based vaccine encoding the spike 1 (S1) subunit of the MERS-CoV genome was constructed, and its humoral, and cellular immune responses were evaluated in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were immunized initially by intramuscular injection and boosted 3 weeks later by intranasal application. Expression of the S1 protein in the lungs and kidneys was detected using conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) targeting specific regions within the S1 subunit at weeks 3, 4, 5, and 6 after the first vaccination. Antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated in serum and in cell culture following in vitro stimulation with a specific 9-mer epitope within the S1 protein (CYSSLILDY). RESULTS: S1 protein expression was only detected by IHC in the kidneys of the Ad-MERS-S1 group at week 6 from first immunization, and in both lungs and kidneys of Ad-MERS-S1 group by conventional PCR at weeks 3 and 5 post-prime. The vaccine elicited a specific S1-immunoglobulin G antibody response, which was detected in the sera of the vaccinated mice at weeks 4 and 6 from the onset of the first immunization. There was a significant increase in the amount of Th1-related cytokines (interferon-γ and interleukin [IL] 12), and a significant decrease in the Th2-related cytokine IL-4 in splenocyte cell culture of the vaccinated group compared with the control groups. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that this recombinant adenovirus vaccine encoding the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV elicits potentially protective antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. This study demonstrates a promising vaccine for the control and/or prevention of MERS-CoV infection in humans.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.012318788,0.135155478,-0.042615102,-0.107311575,-0.004147427,0.071645151,-0.026109343,0.141434523,0.229204697,0.020596809,-0.003733381,-0.053986837,-0.056201391,0.031653901,-0.033328036,-0.022593954,0.005026921,-0.090677603,-0.02068769,-0.036247416,0.005410599,-0.024567402,0.092020978,0.035494964,-0.005551893,-0.01542828,0.028014723,-0.015683412,-0.004260807,0.017252289
Portable sequencer in the fight against infectious disease,"Infectious disease is still a major threat in the world today. Five decades ago, it was considered soon to be eradicated, but the adaptation of pathogens to environmental pressure, such as antimicrobials, encouraged the emergence and reemergence of infectious disease. The fight with infectious disease starts with prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Diagnosis can be upheld by observing the cause of disease under the microscope or detecting the presence of nucleic acid and proteins of the pathogens.

Development of an Immunochromatographic Strip for Rapid Detection of Canine Adenovirus,"Although canine adenovirus (CAdV) is highly prevalent in dogs, there is currently a lack of a quick diagnostic method. In this study, we developed a rapid immunochromatographic strip (ICS) assay using colloidal gold coupled to CAdV-2-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). BALB/c mice were immunized with a purified CAdV-2 suspension, and four mAbs (belonging to two different epitopes) were generated and designated as 2C1, 7D7, 10D1, and 4G1. Western blot and protein spectral analysis indicated that the hexon protein of CAdV-2 recognized all four mAbs. The colloidal gold-coupled 7D7 and 2C1 mAbs were chosen for inclusion in the rapid ICS assay. The optimal concentrations of the coating antibody (2C1), the capture antibody (7D7), and the goat anti-mouse antibody were 1.0 mg/ml, 10 μg/ml, and 2.0 mg/ml, respectively. The limit of detection was approximately 2.0 × 10(2) tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50))/ml. Other common canine viruses were tested to evaluate the specificity of the ICS, and positive results were observed for only CAdV-1 and CAdV-2.

RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Speed and Fidelity are not the Only Determinants of the Mechanism or Efficiency of Recombination,"Using the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from poliovirus (PV) as our model system, we have shown that Lys-359 in motif-D functions as a general acid in the mechanism of nucleotidyl transfer. A K359H (KH) RdRp derivative is slow and faithful relative to wild-type enzyme. In the context of the KH virus, RdRp-coding sequence evolves, selecting for the following substitutions: I331F (IF, motif-C) and P356S (PS, motif-D). We have evaluated IF-KH, PS-KH, and IF-PS-KH viruses and enzymes. The speed and fidelity of each double mutant are equivalent. Each exhibits a unique recombination phenotype, with IF-KH being competent for copy-choice recombination and PS-KH being competent for forced-copy-choice recombination. Although the IF-PS-KH RdRp exhibits biochemical properties within twofold of wild type, the virus is impaired substantially for recombination in cells. We conclude that there are biochemical properties of the RdRp in addition to speed and fidelity that determine the mechanism and efficiency of recombination. The interwoven nature of speed, fidelity, the undefined property suggested here, and recombination makes it impossible to attribute a single property of the RdRp to fitness. However, the derivatives described here may permit elucidation of the importance of recombination on the fitness of the viral population in a background of constant polymerase speed and fidelity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.129478885,-0.039795109,-0.03435897,0.029734947,-0.009666312,-0.011486886,0.066173641,0.017403344,-0.053500903,0.042121251,0.107996517,0.135372085,-0.093679552,-0.079523972,-0.006713295,0.031594835,-0.024349412,-0.057524732,-0.104172481,-0.072901239,0.15502021,-0.113793569,0.095459823,0.060614892,-0.026055827,0.072251725,0.058566364,-0.007153047,-0.061365808,-0.046410963
"Preclinical evaluation of AT-527, a novel guanosine nucleotide prodrug with potent, pan-genotypic activity against hepatitis C virus","Despite the availability of highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, sustained viral response (SVR) rates remain suboptimal for difficult-to-treat patient populations such as those with HCV genotype 3, cirrhosis or prior treatment experience, warranting development of more potent HCV replication antivirals. AT-527 is the hemi-sulfate salt of AT-511, a novel phosphoramidate prodrug of 2’-fluoro-2’-C-methylguanosine-5'-monophosphate that has potent in vitro activity against HCV. The EC(50) of AT-511, determined using HCV laboratory strains and clinical isolates with genotypes 1–5, ranged from 5–28 nM. The active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, AT-9010, specifically inhibited the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. AT-511 did not inhibit the replication of other selected RNA or DNA viruses in vitro. AT-511 was approximately 10-fold more active than sofosbuvir (SOF) against a panel of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HCV genotypes 1–5 and remained fully active against S282T resistance-associated variants, with up to 58-fold more potency than SOF. In vitro, AT-511 did not inhibit human DNA polymerases or elicit cytotoxicity or mitochondrial toxicity at concentrations up to 100 μM. Unlike the other potent guanosine analogs PSI-938 and PSI-661, no mutagenic O(6)-alkylguanine bases were formed when incubated with cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, and AT-511 had IC(50) values ≥25 μM against a panel of CYP enzymes. In hepatocytes from multiple species, the active triphosphate was the predominant metabolite produced from the prodrug, with a half-life of 10 h in human hepatocytes. When given orally to rats and monkeys, AT-527 preferentially delivered high levels of AT-9010 in the liver in vivo. These favorable preclinical attributes support the ongoing clinical development of AT-527 and suggest that, when used in combination with an HCV DAA from a different class, AT-527 may increase SVR rates, especially for difficult-to-treat patient populations, and could potentially shorten treatment duration for all patients.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.093736639,-0.039157048,-0.029552523,-0.000590064,-0.106756318,0.041101233,0.085814533,0.015193135,0.030620439,0.052777305,0.019540535,0.110636737,0.024631015,0.055108305,-0.03183721,-0.036323568,-0.024602197,0.322869788,0.340017917,-0.123838258,-0.04847778,-0.012315516,0.096363802,0.106039703,-0.080388955,-0.085220439,-0.050107205,0.052795856,-0.077512158,-0.03101545
Tilapia Lake Virus Does Not Hemagglutinate Avian and Piscine Erythrocytes and NH(4)Cl Does Not Inhibit Viral Replication In Vitro,"Tilapia lake virus (TiLV) is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA (-ssRNA) icosahedral virus classified to be the only member in the family Amnoonviridae. Although TiLV segment-1 shares homology with the influenza C virus PB1 and has four conserved motifs similar to influenza A, B, and C polymerases, it is unknown whether there are other properties shared between TiLV and orthomyxovirus. In the present study, we wanted to determine whether TiLV agglutinated avian and piscine erythrocytes, and whether its replication was inhibited by lysosomotropic agents, such as ammonium chloride (NH(4)Cl), as seen for orthomyxoviruses. Our findings showed that influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8 (PR8) was able to hemagglutinate turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L), and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) red blood cells (RBCs), while infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) only agglutinated Atlantic salmon, but not turkey or tilapia, RBCs. In contrast to PR8 and ISAV, TiLV did not agglutinate turkey, Atlantic salmon, or tilapia RBCs. qRT-PCR analysis showed that 30 mM NH(4)Cl, a basic lysosomotropic agent, neither inhibited nor enhanced TiLV replication in E-11 cells. There was no difference in viral quantities in the infected cells with or without NH(4)Cl treatment during virus adsorption or at 1, 2, and 3 h post-infection. Given that hemagglutinin proteins that bind RBCs also serve as ligands that bind host cells during virus entry leading to endocytosis in orthomyxoviruses, the data presented here suggest that TiLV may use mechanisms that are different from orthomyxoviruses for entry and replication in host cells. Therefore, future studies should seek to elucidate the mechanisms used by TiLV for entry into host cells and to determine its mode of replication in infected cells.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.101184915,-0.092287305,-0.038252834,0.068285562,-0.065195342,0.155754437,-0.031395308,-0.036733037,0.026212243,0.009170368,0.022294374,-0.070814016,0.006784819,0.140780863,0.038076428,0.019199928,-0.003942501,-0.03013873,0.018069649,0.055917964,0.020691254,0.05651585,-0.003469633,0.006431997,-0.007955443,0.032627228,0.021147085,0.004280536,-0.097908593,0.030302906
Infection Prevention Measures for Surgical Procedures during a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Outbreak in a Tertiary Care Hospital in South Korea,"In 2015, we experienced the largest in-hospital Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak outside the Arabian Peninsula. We share the infection prevention measures for surgical procedures during the unexpected outbreak at our hospital. We reviewed all forms of related documents and collected information through interviews with healthcare workers of our hospital. After the onset of outbreak, a multidisciplinary team devised institutional MERS-control guidelines. Two standard operating rooms were converted to temporary negative-pressure rooms by physically decreasing the inflow air volume (−4.7 Pa in the main room and −1.2 Pa in the anteroom). Healthcare workers were equipped with standard or enhanced personal protective equipment according to the MERS-related patient’s profile and symptoms. Six MERS-related patients underwent emergency surgery, including four MERS-exposed and two MERS-confirmed patients. Negative conversion of MERS-CoV polymerase chain reaction tests was noticed for MERS-confirmed patients before surgery. MERS-exposed patients were also tested twice preoperatively, all of which were negative. All operative procedures in MERS-related patients were performed without specific adverse events or perioperative MERS transmission. Our experience with setting up a temporary negative-pressure operation room and our conservative approach for managing MERS-related patients can be referred in cases of future unexpected MERS outbreaks in non-endemic countries.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.08706898,0.194721016,-0.113470541,-0.091623413,-0.047379597,0.033954128,-0.064546984,0.476373898,0.234924806,0.001828926,0.015612487,0.00433308,-0.058244316,0.000883164,-0.022116856,-0.007328933,0.003159564,-0.052455137,-0.029775427,-0.001352488,0.017348422,-0.006095897,0.008200462,0.029545788,-0.042569215,-0.033133623,-0.022066392,0.012380524,-0.048377806,0.031920835
Molecular survey and interaction of common respiratory pathogens in chicken flocks (field perspective),"AIM: The present study was designed for the detection of the most prevalent respiratory infections in chicken flocks and clarifying their interaction and impact on flock health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 359 serum samples were collected from 55 backyard chickens and tested using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits to determine the seroprevalence of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), influenza type A, Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), and Mycoplasma synoviae (MS). Molecular prevalence of NDV, IBV, low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) H9N2, MG, and MS was carried out on swab, and tissue samples collected from 55 backyard flocks and 11 commercial broiler flocks suffered from respiratory infections using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription-PCR. RESULTS: Seroprevalence of NDV, IBV, Influenza type A virus, MG, and MS in chicken backyard flocks was 56.4%, 50.9%, 12.7%, 14.5%, and 3.6%, respectively. Specific antibodies against one or more respiratory viruses and mycoplasma were detected in 36.4% of backyard flocks, indicating concurrent viral infections. The molecular survey showed that 90.9% of chicken backyard flocks were infected with common respiratory viruses (NDV, IBV, and LPAIV H9N2) while 81.8% of commercial broiler flocks were infected. The molecular prevalence rate of NDV, IBV, and LPAIV H9N2 was 46.97%, 56.1%, and 19.7% in backyard flocks, respectively. Combined viral and bacterial infection represented 40% and 63.6% of the respiratory infections, resulting in enhanced pathogenicity and increased mortalities of up to 87.5% and 27.8% in backyard and commercial flocks, respectively. Mixed infection of IBV, LPAIV H9N2, and/or Escherichia coli is the most prevalent mixed infection in broiler flocks, inducing severe clinical outcomes. Avian pathogenic E. coli was, respectively, isolated from 40% of backyard flocks and 81.82% of broiler flocks. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from three backyard chicken flocks mixed with other respiratory pathogens with elevated mortality. Mixed infection of E. coli and MG reported in 9.1% of broiler flock. MG was detected in 14.5% of backyard flocks and 9.1% of broiler flocks while MS was detected only in 3.6% of backyard chickens mixed with E. coli, and other viruses. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that mixed infections are more commonly prevalent and associated with dramatic exacerbation in clinical outcomes than a single infection. Bidirectional synergistic interaction between these concurrently interacted respiratory pathogens explains the severe clinical impact and high mortality rate. The high prevalence of IBV (either as a single or combined infection) with LPAIV H9N2 and/or E. coli, in spite of intensive use of commercial vaccines, increases the need for revising vaccination programs and the application of standard biosecurity measures. Backyard chickens impose a great risk and threaten commercial flocks due to the high prevalence of viral respiratory pathogens.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.059946762,-0.041856878,0.044647799,-0.05696559,0.084431566,0.067888071,-0.077933774,-0.051563257,0.065209369,0.230457709,0.069496255,0.001051215,-0.045741993,0.031197754,-0.069344868,0.093696154,0.014832854,-0.023725359,0.0454266,0.011118447,-0.032849318,-0.013895136,-0.006369367,-0.03151551,0.042780405,0.011014007,-0.047359168,0.00368887,0.036802515,-0.051169722
"Viral etiology of pneumonia among severely malnourished under-five children in an urban hospital, Bangladesh","BACKGROUND: In Bangladesh, pneumonia has a higher mortality among malnourished children aged <5 years. Evaluating pneumonia etiology among malnourished children may help improve empiric treatment guidelines. METHODS: During April 2015—December 2017, we conducted a case-control study among severe acute malnourished (SAM) children aged <5 years admitted to the Dhaka hospital of International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b). We enrolled hospital admitted SAM children with clinical or radiological pneumonia as cases (during April 2015 to March 2017) and hospital admitted SAM children without any respiratory symptom in the past 10 days before admission as controls (during February 2016 to December 2017). We tested nasopharyngeal wash from both case and control for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza viruses, human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV), rhinovirus and adenovirus by singleplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. To identify the independent association of pneumonia with viral pathogens during February 2016 to March 2017, we used multivariable logistic regression for calculating adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS: We enrolled 360 cases and 334 controls. For case and control the median age was 8 months (IQR: 5–13) and 11 months (IQR: 6–18) (p = 0.001) respectively. Weight/age Z-score was -4.3 (SD ±0.7) for cases and -4.1 (SD ±1.1) for controls (p = 0.01). Among cases 68% had both clinical and radiological pneumonia, 1% had clinical pneumonia and 31% had only radiological pneumonia. Respiratory virus detection was high in cases compared to controls [69.9% (251) vs. 44.8% (148), p = 0.0001]. The most frequently detected viruses among cases were rhinoviruses (79, 22.0%) followed by RSV (32, 8.9%), adenovirus (23, 6.4%), HPIV (22, 6.1%), influenza virus (16, 4.5%), and HMPV (16, 4.5%). Among the controls, rhinoviruses (82, 24.8%) were most commonly detected one followed by adenovirus (26,7.9%), HMPV (5, 1.5%), HPIV (4, 1.2%), RSV (3, 0.9%), and influenza virus (2, 0.6%). RSV (OR 13.1; 95% CI: 1.6, 106.1), influenza virus (OR 8.7; 95% CI: 1.0, 78.9), HPIV (3.8; 95% CI: 1.0, 14.8), and HMPV (2.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 5.5) were independently associated with pneumonia while compared between 178 cases and 174 controls. CONCLUSION: Viral etiology of pneumonia in SAM children were mainly attributable to RSV, influenza, HPIV and HMPV. Our study findings may help in planning further studies targeting vaccines or drugs against common respiratory viruses responsible for pneumonia among SAM children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.302412991,-0.160056434,-0.138554135,0.06221167,0.010021365,-0.03571015,-0.027433234,-0.050548199,0.035606405,-0.097394995,0.011542488,-0.024075979,-0.147313118,-0.09240888,-0.139723613,0.02933088,-0.097445482,0.090061965,-0.064069128,0.044462846,-0.070831674,0.190926109,0.074270558,0.005371591,-0.028354779,0.009559709,-0.005434268,-0.081525978,-0.055883714,-0.033789973
Antiviral activity of iridoid glycosides extracted from Fructus Gardeniae against influenza A virus by PACT-dependent suppression of viral RNA replication,"Epidemic and pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) poses a significant threat to human populations worldwide. Iridoid glycosides are principal bioactive components from the Gardenia jasminoides J. Ellis fruit that exhibit antiviral activity against several strains of IAV. In the present study, we evaluated the protective effect of Fructus Gardeniae iridoid glycoside extracts (IGEs) against IAV by cytopathogenic effect(CPE), MTT and a plaque formation assay in vitro and examined the reduction in the pulmonary index (PI), restoration of body weight, reduction in mortality and increases in survival time in vivo. As a host factor, PACT provides protection against the pathogenic influenza A virus by interacting with IAV polymerase and activating the IFN-I response. To verify the whether IGEs suppress IAV replication in a PACT-dependent manner, IAV RNA replication, expression of PACT and the phosphorylation of eIF2α in A549 cells were detected; the levels of IFNβ, PACT and PKR in mouse lung tissues were determined; and the activity of IAV polymerase was evaluated in PACT-compromised cells. The results indicated that IGEs sufficiently alleviated cell damage and suppressed IAV replication in vitro, protecting mice from IAV-induced injury and lethal IAV infection. These anti-IAV effects might be related to disrupted interplay between IVA polymerase and PACT and/or prevention of a PACT-dependent overactivated IFN-I antiviral response. Taken together, our findings reveal a new facet of the mechanisms by which IGEs fight the influenza A virus in a PACT-dependent manner.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.077365746,-0.060478924,-0.028212401,0.00591098,-0.097166217,0.140299163,0.015854441,-0.019910745,0.038630155,-0.040374515,0.004713523,-0.005108601,-0.032366087,0.100637193,0.015866401,0.023861933,-0.02151271,-0.008593946,0.017439565,0.012477779,0.032470503,0.011142815,0.029380676,-0.008676124,0.001369718,-0.001350511,0.00994917,0.018415414,0.014495812,0.003515371
Post-pandemic influenza A/H1N1pdm09 is associated with more severe outcomes than A/H3N2 and other respiratory viruses in adult hospitalisations,"This study compares the frequency and severity of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 (A/H1), influenza A/H3N2 (A/H3) and other respiratory virus infections in hospitalised patients. Data from 17 332 adult hospitalised patients admitted to Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Western Australia, with a respiratory illness between 2012 and 2015 were linked with data containing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results for respiratory viruses including A/H1, A/H3, influenza B, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza. Of these, 1753 (10.1%) had test results. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted to compare the viruses for clinical outcomes including ICU admission, ventilation, pneumonia, length of stay and death. Patients with A/H1 were more likely to experience severe outcomes such as ICU admission (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2–5.5, P = 0.016), pneumonia (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.6–5.7, P < 0.001) and lower risk of discharge from hospital (indicating longer lengths of hospitalisation; HR 0.64 95% CI 0.47–0.88, P = 0.005), than patients with A/H3. Patients with a non-influenza respiratory virus were less likely to experience severe clinical outcomes than patients with A/H1, however, had similar likelihood when compared to patients with A/H3. Patients hospitalised with A/H1 had higher odds of severe outcomes than patients with A/H3 or other respiratory viruses.

A case for a negative-strand coding sequence in a group of positive-sense RNA viruses,"Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses form the largest and most diverse group of eukaryote-infecting viruses. Their genomes comprise one or more segments of coding-sense RNA that function directly as messenger RNAs upon release into the cytoplasm of infected cells. Positive-sense RNA viruses are generally accepted to encode proteins solely on the positive strand. However, we previously identified a surprisingly long (∼1,000-codon) open reading frame (ORF) on the negative strand of some members of the family Narnaviridae which, together with RNA bacteriophages of the family Leviviridae, form a sister group to all other positive-sense RNA viruses. Here, we completed the genomes of three mosquito-associated narnaviruses, all of which have the long reverse-frame ORF. We systematically identified narnaviral sequences in public data sets from a wide range of sources, including arthropod, fungal, and plant transcriptomic data sets. Long reverse-frame ORFs are widespread in one clade of narnaviruses, where they frequently occupy >95 per cent of the genome. The reverse-frame ORFs correspond to a specific avoidance of CUA, UUA, and UCA codons (i.e. stop codon reverse complements) in the forward-frame RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ORF. However, absence of these codons cannot be explained by other factors such as inability to decode these codons or GC3 bias.

Development of a Multiplex RT-qPCR for the Detection of Different Clades of Avian Influenza in Poultry,"Since the initial detection of H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, in 1996 in China, numerous HPAI H5 lineages have been classified, and they continue to pose a threat to animal and human health. In this study, we developed a novel primer/probe set that can be employed to simultaneously detect pan-H5 HPAI and two clades, 2.3.2.1 and 2.3.4.4, of H5Nx viruses using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The sensitivity and specificity of these primer sets and probes were confirmed with a number of different subtypes of influenza virus and the H5-HA gene plasmid DNA. In particular, the multiplex RT-qPCR assay was successfully applied to the simultaneous detection of H5 HPAI and different virus clades in clinical field samples from a poultry farm. Therefore, this multiplex assay and a novel detection primer set and probes will be useful for the laboratory diagnosis and epidemiological field studies of different circulating H5 HPAI virus clades in poultry and migratory wild birds.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.024849933,0.02782444,0.165490016,0.091434873,0.021235042,0.098478347,-0.021920946,-0.018830304,-0.013242224,-0.002572125,-0.012569879,0.007035262,-0.009691137,0.014813571,0.014292421,0.000577769,0.009186123,-0.02033705,-0.012628556,0.000182441,0.00621388,0.007360905,-0.005415442,0.054888003,-0.004408551,-0.008519591,-0.012159442,0.028122732,-0.000626579,-0.013100211
Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) for the Diagnosis of Zika Virus: A Review,"The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas and its devastating developmental and neurological manifestations has prompted the development of field-based diagnostics that are rapid, reliable, handheld, specific, sensitive, and inexpensive. The gold standard molecular method for lab-based diagnosis of ZIKV, from either patient samples or insect vectors, is reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The method, however, is costly and requires lab-based equipment and expertise, which severely limits its use as a point-of-care (POC) tool in resource-poor settings. Moreover, given the lack of antivirals or approved vaccines for ZIKV infection, a POC diagnostic test is urgently needed for the early detection of new outbreaks and to adequately manage patients. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a compelling alternative to RT-qPCR for ZIKV and other arboviruses. This low-cost molecular system can be freeze-dried for distribution and exhibits high specificity, sensitivity, and efficiency. A growing body of evidence suggests that LAMP assays can provide greater accessibility to much-needed diagnostics for ZIKV infections, especially in developing countries where the ZIKV is now endemic. This review summarizes the different LAMP methods that have been developed for the virus and summarizes their features, advantages, and limitations.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.016781389,0.068109151,0.19574761,0.033599283,-0.095937953,0.000509995,0.053471853,0.022127228,0.00395181,0.018238708,-0.056033804,0.02391194,0.033567872,-0.05171982,-0.032576289,0.044703968,-0.023989313,0.082055642,-0.122819783,0.032471798,-0.08506858,-0.083220828,-0.05797089,0.083985185,0.07854645,0.005829878,-0.047653214,0.049074189,-0.073376292,0.022417637
A nucleobase-binding pocket in a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase contributes to elongation complex stability,"The enterovirus 71 (EV71) 3D(pol) is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that plays the central role in the viral genome replication, and is an important target in antiviral studies. Here, we report a crystal structure of EV71 3D(pol) elongation complex (EC) at 1.8 Å resolution. The structure reveals that the 5′-end guanosine of the downstream RNA template interacts with a fingers domain pocket, with the base sandwiched by H44 and R277 side chains through hydrophobic stacking interactions, and these interactions are still maintained after one in-crystal translocation event induced by nucleotide incorporation, implying that the pocket could regulate the functional properties of the polymerase by interacting with RNA. When mutated, residue R277 showed an impact on virus proliferation in virological studies with residue H44 having a synergistic effect. In vitro biochemical data further suggest that mutations at these two sites affect RNA binding, EC stability, but not polymerase catalytic rate (k(cat)) and apparent NTP affinity (K(M,NTP)). We propose that, although rarely captured by crystallography, similar surface pocket interaction with nucleobase may commonly exist in nucleic acid motor enzymes to facilitate their processivity.

Development and characterization of a continuous cell line (EL) from the liver of European eel Anguilla anguilla,"In the present study, a new hepatic tissue‐origin cell line from European eel Anguilla anguilla has been developed and characterized. This cell line designated EL has been maintained in Leibovitz L‐15 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum over 72 months, and subcultured more than 90 times. The EL cell line consisted predominantly of fibroblast‐like cells, which could survive over 100 days in vitro, and could grow at 15–32°C. The optimum temperature for growth was 27°C. The chromosome analysis revealed a modal diploid karyotype of 2n = 38. The origin of this cell line was confirmed by the 18S recombinant (r)RNA sequencing. The susceptibility test indicated significant cytopathic effects in the EL cells with regard to the Rana grylio virus and the Herpesvirus anguillae. The viral replication was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and polymerase chain reaction analysis. Following poly (I:C) exposure, the expression levels of the immune‐related molecules interferon regulatory factor‐7 (irf7) and transforming growth factor‐β (TGF‐β) were downregulated in EL cells, whereas the expression levels of the rf3 and the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) were upregulated. All four genes were significantly upregulated following inflammation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

RNA decay during gammaherpesvirus infection reduces RNA polymerase II occupancy of host promoters but spares viral promoters,"In mammalian cells, widespread acceleration of cytoplasmic mRNA degradation is linked to impaired RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription. This mRNA decay-induced transcriptional repression occurs during infection with gammaherpesviruses including Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), which encode an mRNA endonuclease that initiates widespread RNA decay. Here, we show that MHV68-induced mRNA decay leads to a genome-wide reduction of Pol II occupancy at mammalian promoters. This reduced Pol II occupancy is accompanied by down-regulation of multiple Pol II subunits and TFIIB in the nucleus of infected cells, as revealed by mass spectrometry-based global measurements of protein abundance. Viral genes, despite the fact that they require Pol II for transcription, escape transcriptional repression. Protection is not governed by viral promoter sequences; instead, location on the viral genome is both necessary and sufficient to escape the transcriptional repression effects of mRNA decay. We propose a model in which the ability to escape from transcriptional repression is linked to the localization of viral DNA within replication compartments, providing a means for these viruses to counteract decay-induced transcript loss.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.135375774,-0.05969942,-0.024680615,-0.058305533,-0.080894334,0.002106663,0.01632121,-0.018371441,0.037115632,-0.041217136,-0.050393882,-0.072664945,0.010484279,0.0965695,-0.015567422,0.040803754,-0.005988386,-0.115731221,-0.114137185,-0.021889739,0.015993907,0.042235992,-0.058686531,0.03182012,-0.012177056,-0.152901138,-0.03291146,0.04371008,0.100706516,-0.044570797
Characteristics of fever and response to antipyretic therapy in military personnel with adenovirus-positive community-acquired pneumonia,"BACKGROUND: In 2014, an outbreak of adenoviral pneumonia occurred in the Korean military training center. However, there are limited data on the characteristics of the fever and its response to antipyretic therapy in immunocompetent adults with adenovirus-positive community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). METHODS: The medical records of the patients who were admitted to the Armed Forces Chuncheon Hospital for the treatment of CAP between January 2014 and December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into three groups, namely, the adenovirus-positive (Adv) group, the adenovirus-negative (Non-Adv) group and the unknown pathogen group, according to the results of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and sputum culture used to measure adenovirus and other bacteria or viruses in respiratory specimens. We evaluated and compared the demographics, clinicolaboratory findings and radiological findings upon admission between the two groups. RESULTS: Out of the 251 military personnel with CAP during the study periods, 67 were classified into the Adv group, while 134 were classified into the Non-Adv group and 50 were classified into the unknown pathogen group. The patients in the Adv group had a longer duration of fever after admission (3.2 ± 1.6 vs. 1.9 ± 1.2 vs. 2.2 ± 1.5 days, P = 0.018) and symptom onset (5.8 ± 2.2 vs. 3.9 ± 2.5 vs. 3.7 ± 2.0 days, P = 0.006) than patients in the Non-Adv and unknown pathogen groups, respectively. The patients in the Adv group had a higher mean temperature at admission (37.8 ± 0.3 vs. 37.3 ± 0.3 vs. 37.3 ± 0.3, P = 0.005), and more patients were observed over 40 and 39 to 40(14.9% vs. 2.2% vs. 4.0%, 35.8% vs. 3.7% vs. 6.0%, P < 0.001) than those in the Non-Adv and unknown pathogen groups, respectively. The Adv group more commonly had no response or exhibited adverse events after antipyretic treatment compared to the Non-Adv group (17.9% vs. 1.5%, 35.0% vs. 4.3%, P < 0.001, P = 0.05, respectively). In addition, the time from admission to overall clinical stabilization was significantly longer in the patients in the Adv group than in those in the Non-Adv group (4.3 ± 2.8 vs. 2.9 ± 1.8 days, P = 0.034, respectively). Furthermore, no significant difference in the length of hospital stay was observed between the two groups, and no patient died in either group. CONCLUSION: In this study, Adv-positive CAP in immunocompetent military personnel patients had distinct fever characteristics and responses to antipyretic treatment.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.132042668,-0.04357202,-0.072615331,-0.143119948,-0.021148188,-0.042922487,-0.025401489,0.085053291,-0.162313645,0.020324502,-0.035909352,0.009429879,-0.070526806,0.044783842,-0.064096482,-0.02192098,-0.006616636,0.042827159,-0.00127198,0.028149991,-0.010862218,-0.029548968,0.003786092,-0.002437482,-0.030421686,-0.024828653,0.024970645,0.000704153,-0.038295339,0.002089806
"Overnutrition in Infants Is Associated With High Level of Leptin, Viral Coinfection and Increased Severity of Respiratory Infections: A Cross-Sectional Study","Objective: To investigate the relationship of overnutrition (obese and overweight) with severity of illness in children hospitalized with acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs), frequency of viral coinfections and leptin levels. Methods: We studied 124 children <2 years old that were hospitalized for ALRI. Nutritional status was calculated by z-scores according to weight-for-age z-scores, length or height-for-age z-scores, and weight-for-height z-scores. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were obtained and viral respiratory pathogens were identified using reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) load was assessed using quantitative RT-PCR. NPA and plasma leptin level were measured. Clinical data and nutritional status were recorded, and patients were followed up until hospital discharge. Viral coinfection was defined as the presence of two or more viruses detected in the same respiratory sample. Severity of illness was determined by length of hospitalization and duration of oxygen therapy. Results: Children with overnutrition showed a greater frequency of viral coinfection than those with normal weight (71% obese vs. 37% normal weight p = 0.013; 68% overweight vs. 37% normal weight p = 0.004). A lower RSV load was found in obese (5.91 log(10) copies/mL) and overweight children (6.49 log(10) copies/mL) compared to normal weight children (8.06 log(10) copies/mL; p = 0.021 in both cases). In multivariate analysis, obese, and overweight infants <6 months old were associated with longer hospital stays (RR = 1.68; CI: 1.30–2.15 and obese: RR = 1.68; CI: 1.01–2.71, respectively) as well as a greater duration of oxygen therapy (RR = 1.80; IC: 1.41–2.29 and obese: RR = 1.91; CI: 1.15–3.15, respectively). Obese children <6 months showed higher plasma leptin level than normal weight children (7.58 vs. 5.12 ng/μl; p <0.046). Conclusions: In infants younger than 6 months, overnutrition condition was related to increased severity of infections and high plasma leptin level. Also, children with overnutrition showed a greater frequency of viral coinfection and low RSV viral load compared to normal weights children. These findings further contribute to the already existent evidence supporting the importance of overnutrition prevention in pediatric populations.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.194169706,-0.108590285,-0.057933358,-0.021638109,0.013144236,-0.137400737,0.050792124,-0.095377323,0.070495224,-0.061867633,0.025949604,-0.042351089,-0.118950525,-0.042003727,-0.048354049,0.036202949,-0.042289023,-0.017552537,0.028994947,-0.035241848,-0.116772689,0.057621111,0.00652982,0.049696853,-0.050147326,-0.021565643,0.088334813,-0.061639023,-0.021930516,0.057059121
Molecular Diagnosis of Pneumonia Using Multiplex Real-Time PCR Assay RespiFinder® SMART 22 FAST in a Group of Moroccan Infants,"BACKGROUND: In Morocco, pediatric pneumonia remains a serious public health problem, as it constitutes the first cause of mortality due to infectious diseases. The etiological diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections is difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to use Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay tests in a routine setting for exact and fast identification. OBJECTIVES: In this paper, we present the clinical results of pediatric pneumonia and describe their etiology by using molecular diagnosis. Study design: Tracheal secretion was collected from infants presenting respiratory distress isolated or associated with systemic signs, attending the unit of Neonatology between December 1, 2016, and Mai 31, 2018. Samples were tested with the multiplex RespiFinder® SMART 22 FAST which potentially detects 18 viruses and 4 bacteria. RESULTS: Of the 86 infants considered in this study (mean age 31 ± 19 days) suspected of acute respiratory tract infections, 71 (83%) were positive for one or multiple viruses or/and bacteria. The majority of acute respiratory tract infections had a viral origin (95%): respiratory syncytial viruses (A and B) (49%), rhinovirus (21%), coronaviruses 229E (11%), humain metapneumovirus (5%), influenza A (3%), influenza H1N1 (1%), adenovirus (2%), and parainfluenza virus type 4 (2%). Among our patients, 6% had Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Coinfections were not associated with severe respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION: The clinical spectrum of respiratory infections is complex and often nonspecific. Thus, the early and fast detection of related causative agents is crucial. The use of multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction may help choose an accurate treatment, reduce the overall use of unnecessary antibiotics, preserve intestinal flora, and decrease nosocomial infection by reducing the length of hospitalization.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.302134889,-0.066976942,-0.050835908,0.098932011,-0.000651819,-0.028535693,0.010272662,0.010014081,-0.01798131,0.091415201,-0.015628508,-0.025241703,0.093444514,-0.02508438,0.050894394,-0.031042232,0.020104738,-0.043633236,0.07638114,0.027256586,0.009724399,-0.03845944,-0.003334115,-0.030658022,0.064175008,-0.003497292,-0.043731847,0.005199271,0.024788312,-0.121407855
Hairpin structure within the 3′UTR of DNA polymerase β mRNA acts as a post-transcriptional regulatory element and interacts with Hax-1,"Aberrant expression of DNA polymerase β, a key enzyme involved in base excision repair, leads to genetic instability and carcinogenesis. Pol β expression has been previously shown to be regulated at the level of transcription, but there is also evidence of post-transcriptional regulation, since rat transcripts undergo alternative polyadenylation, and the resulting 3′UTR contain at least one regulatory element. Data presented here indicate that RNA of the short 3′UTR folds to form a strong secondary structure (hairpin). Its regulatory role was established utilizing a luciferase-based reporter system. Further studies led to the identification of a protein factor, which binds to this element—the anti-apoptotic, cytoskeleton-related protein Hax-1. The results of in vitro binding analysis indicate that the formation of the RNA–protein complex is significantly impaired by disruption of the hairpin motif. We demonstrate that Hax-1 binds to Pol β mRNA exclusively in the form of a dimer. Biochemical analysis revealed the presence of Hax-1 in mitochondria, but also in the nuclear matrix, which, along with its transcript-binding properties, suggests that Hax-1 plays a role in post-transcriptional regulation of expression of Pol β.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.173778678,-0.051837522,-0.029794776,-0.056636527,-0.071305328,0.00115703,0.01006466,-0.02420532,0.025617451,-0.057343955,-0.066550945,-0.018682785,-0.009520809,0.033712192,-0.063926129,-0.015491752,0.038874206,-0.093460517,-0.094111802,-0.052095448,0.016929307,0.004540206,-0.021311445,0.003077932,-0.01748017,-0.070487104,-0.019173506,0.036521701,0.093483694,-0.054731479
Insertion/Deletion Polymorphism of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Gene in Kawasaki Disease,"Polymorphism of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene is reported to be associated with ischemic heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. In this study, we investigated the relationship between Kawasaki disease and insertion/deletion polymorphism of ACE gene. Fifty five Kawasaki disease patients and 43 healthy children were enrolled. ACE genotype was evaluated from each of the subjects' DNA fragments through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Frequencies of ACE genotypes (DD, ID, II) were 12.7%, 60.0%, 27.3% in Kawasaki group, and 41.9%, 30.2%, 27.9% in control group respectively, indicating low rate of DD and high rate of ID genotype among Kawasaki patients (p<0.01). Comparing allelic (I, D) frequencies, I allele was more prevalent in Kawasaki group than in control group (57.3% vs. 43.0%, p<0.05). In Kawasaki group, both genotype and allelic frequencies were not statistically different between those with coronary dilatations and those without.

The RNA polymerase activity of SARS-coronavirus nsp12 is primer dependent,"An RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is the central catalytic subunit of the RNA-synthesizing machinery of all positive-strand RNA viruses. Usually, RdRp domains are readily identifiable by comparative sequence analysis, but biochemical confirmation and characterization can be hampered by intrinsic protein properties and technical complications. It is presumed that replication and transcription of the ∼30-kb severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RNA genome are catalyzed by an RdRp domain in the C-terminal part of nonstructural protein 12 (nsp12), one of 16 replicase subunits. However, thus far full-length nsp12 has proven refractory to expression in bacterial systems, which has hindered both the biochemical characterization of coronavirus RNA synthesis and RdRp-targeted antiviral drug design. Here, we describe a combined strategy involving bacterial expression of an nsp12 fusion protein and its in vivo cleavage to generate and purify stable SARS-CoV nsp12 (106 kDa) with a natural N-terminus and C-terminal hexahistidine tag. This recombinant protein possesses robust in vitro RdRp activity, as well as a significant DNA-dependent activity that may facilitate future inhibitor studies. The SARS-CoV nsp12 is primer dependent on both homo- and heteropolymeric templates, supporting the likeliness of a close enzymatic collaboration with the intriguing RNA primase activity that was recently proposed for coronavirus nsp8.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.239253856,0.201549878,-0.244352527,0.162789948,-0.053230255,-0.095187104,-0.008901626,-0.089196555,-0.059988775,0.017039039,0.083345785,0.111246997,-0.053598456,-0.052622852,-0.066522475,-0.055096723,0.092378387,-0.07537799,0.015759183,-0.028238,0.007541105,-0.007120481,0.09936087,-0.067594976,0.047956112,0.070134426,-0.033387317,0.044596481,0.038957018,0.063440141
Attenuated Salmonella choleraesuis-mediated RNAi targeted to conserved regions against foot-and-mouth disease virus in guinea pigs and swine,"In this study, specific sequences within three genes (3D, VP4 and 2B) of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) genome were determined to be effective RNAi targets. These sequences are highly conserved among different serotype viruses based on sequence analysis. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-expressing plasmids (p3D-NT19, p3D-NT56, pVP4-NT19, pVP4-NT65 and p2B-NT25) were constructed to express siRNA targeting 3D, VP4 and 2B, respectively. The antiviral potential of these siRNA for various FMDV isolates was investigated in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells and suckling mice. The results show that these siRNA inhibited virus yield 10- to 300-fold for different FMDV isolates of serotype O and serotype Asia I at 48 h post infection in BHK-21 cells compared to control cells. In suckling mice, p3D-NT56 and p2B-NT25 delayed the death of mice. Twenty percent to 40% of the animals that received a single siRNA dose survived 5 days post infection with serotype O or serotype Asia I. We used an attenuated Salmonella choleraesuis (C500) vaccine strain, to carry the plasmid that expresses siRNA directed against the polymerase gene 3D (p3D-NT56) of FMDV. We used guinea pigs to evaluate the inhibitory effects of recombinant S. cho (p3D-NT56/S. cho) on FMDV infection. The results show that 80% of guinea pigs inoculated with 10(9) CFU of p3D-NT56/S. cho and challenged 36 h later with 50 ID(50) of homologous FMDV were protected. We also measured the antiviral activity of p3D-NT56/S. cho in swine. The results indicate that 100% of the animals treated with 5 × 10(9) CFU of p3D-NT56/S. cho were protected in 9 days.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.070896862,-0.028723673,0.020513148,-0.081914721,-0.024172202,0.062240581,-0.004781213,-0.023197029,0.030146925,-0.000583031,-0.001708511,0.000785992,-0.048555942,0.032399385,0.043317197,-0.01795025,-0.043170522,0.020995541,0.02034488,0.002098929,0.03647724,-0.024906812,0.029379041,0.057796075,-0.033921772,0.015986289,0.02210291,0.018711324,-0.023342042,0.004123028
"Identification of Adenovirus, Influenza Virus, Parainfluenza Virus, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus by Two Kinds of Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and a Shell Vial Culture in Pediatric Patients with Viral Pneumonia","PURPOSE: Early identification of causative agents in lower respiratory infection of pediatric patients can reduce morbidity and prevent an overuse of antimicrobials. Two kinds of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a commercial shell vial viral culture were performed to identify causative agents in pediatric patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates of 220 children diagnosed with viral pneumonia were obtained. Two kinds of multiplex PCR (Seeplex™ RV detection kit, and Labopass™ RV detection kit), and a shell vial culture by R-Mix were performed. RESULTS: Positive samples from 220 total samples by two multiplex PCRs were 52.7% and 46.4%, respectively. We also cultured 103 samples that showed positive results of the adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by two multiplex PCR. The RSV was most frequently detected in 53.0% (Seeplex) and 51.7% (Labopass) of patients. The detection rate of adenovirus (AdV) was 10.3% and 12.1%, influenza virus (IFV) A and B was 12.5% and 3.4%, and parainfluenza virus (PIFV) 1, 2, and 3 were 2.9% and 2.6%. Shell vial cultures showed concordant results with each multiplex PCR by 96.1% and 77.7%, respectively. Sequencing results were 90% consistent with multiplex PCR. CONCLUSION: Multiplex PCR showed more positivity than the shell vial culture and it can be an effective primary test. Other complementary efforts such as viral cultures and sequencing analysis could be considered, according to clinical and laboratory conditions.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.207324928,-0.049397994,0.050416583,0.068064692,0.002663581,-0.040440726,-0.034054535,-0.014775244,-0.039366294,0.044207428,0.008883551,-0.073816031,-0.00569244,0.051443077,0.016921786,-0.065267334,0.061291557,0.003874801,0.014362361,-0.075047473,0.043947347,0.017014326,0.078587307,-0.041853485,0.013258585,-0.018000592,0.068834226,0.005763583,-0.061369487,0.017609976
Detection and Identification of Common Food-Borne Viruses with a Tiling Microarray,"Microarray hybridization based identification of viral genotypes is increasingly assuming importance due to outbreaks of multiple pathogenic viruses affecting humans causing wide-spread morbidity and mortality. Surprisingly, microarray based identification of food-borne viruses, one of the largest groups of pathogenic viruses, causing more than 1.5 billion infections world-wide every year, has lagged behind. Cell-culture techniques are either unavailable or time consuming for routine application. Consequently, current detection methods for these pathogens largely depend on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based techniques, generally requiring an investigator to preselect the target virus of interest. Here we describe the first attempt to use the microarray as an identification tool for these viruses. We have developed methodology to synthesize targets for virus identification without using PCR, making the process genuinely sequence independent. We show here that a tiling microarray can simultaneously detect and identify the genotype and strain of common food-borne viruses in a single experiment.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.020615182,-0.013755645,0.092203798,0.051459978,0.001066054,0.031306525,0.078255174,0.001895161,-0.005947346,0.117140807,-0.044231503,-0.036968264,0.085387361,-0.055269939,0.061752546,-0.032906463,-0.018243395,-0.02206411,-0.046876728,-0.03987876,0.010091636,0.007857947,0.012007413,0.023547125,-0.036258279,-0.032063559,0.010794323,-0.0452954,-0.001982901,-0.011900329
Gene Expression Profile during Chondrogenesis in Human Bone Marrow derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells using a cDNA Microarray,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the capacity to proliferate and differentiate into multiple connective tissue lineages, which include cartilage, bone, and fat. Cartilage differentiation and chondrocyte maturation are required for normal skeletal development, but the intracellular pathways regulating this process remain largely unclear. This study was designed to identify novel genes that might help clarify the molecular mechanisms of chondrogenesis. Chondrogenesis was induced by culturing human bone marrow (BM) derived MSCs in micromass pellets in the presence of defined medium for 3, 7, 14 or 21 days. Several genes regulated during chondrogenesis were then identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using an ABI microarray system, we determined the differential gene expression profiles of differentiated chondrocytes and BM-MSCs. Normalization of this data resulted in the identification of 1,486 differentially expressed genes. To verify gene expression profiles determined by microarray analysis, the expression levels of 10 genes with high fold changes were confirmed by RT-PCR. Gene expression patterns of 9 genes (Hrad6B, annexinA2, BMP-7, contactin-1, peroxiredoxin-1, heat shock transcription factor-2, synaptotagmin IV, serotonin receptor-7, Axl) in RT-PCR were similar to the microarray gene expression patterns.

Human Bocavirus in Patients with Respiratory Tract Infection,"BACKGROUND: Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a newly identified viral pathogen, and its clinical epidemiology and significance in respiratory infections have not yet been completely elucidated. We investigated the prevalence of HBoV infection and the association between viral (HBoV) load and clinical features of the infection in patients of all age-groups. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients with symptoms of respiratory infection were tested for presence of HBoV by using real-time polymerase chain reaction. HBoV-positive patients were categorized into low- and high-viral-load groups using 1.0×10(6) copies/mL as the threshold value of viral load. RESULTS: Detection rate of HBoV was 4.8% (N=93) in a total of 1,926 samples with peak incidence of infection being observed in patients aged 6-12 months. HBoV infection was more frequently observed in young children, especially, in children aged less than 5 yr, and the HBoV load decreased with increase in age. HBoV was codetected with other respiratory viruses in 17 (18.3%) of the 93 HBoV-positive patients and 15 patients (88.2%) belonged to the low-viral-load group. Patients infected with HBoV alone showed a higher viral load than those patients in whom HBoV was codetected with other respiratory viruses (median load, 3.78×10(5) copies/mL vs. 1.94×10(4) copies/mL, P=0.014). Higher pulse rate (P=0.007) and respiratory rate (P=0.021) were observed in patients with a high-viral-load. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that HBoV may be the causative agent of respiratory infection in the high-viral-load group.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.179274858,-0.066032818,-0.07912702,-0.0677025,-0.025141845,-0.123919608,0.038450348,0.014387202,-0.050839032,0.037229414,-0.014616768,-0.01428931,-0.014399415,0.071914868,-0.032867376,-0.034279027,-0.037939269,-0.010224849,0.025348642,0.044887037,0.003459156,0.02002216,-0.040722874,0.047110501,-0.11802455,-0.01378493,-0.045720474,-0.016093286,-0.068715834,0.101024892
Human metapneumovirus and human coronavirus infection and pathogenicity in Saudi children hospitalized with acute respiratory illness,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and the Netherlands human coronavirus (HCoV-NL63) have been isolated from children with respiratory tract infection. The prevalence of these viruses has not been reported from Saudi Arabia. We sought to determine whether hMPV and HCoV-NL63 are responsible for acute respiratory illness and also to determine clinical features and severity of illness in the hospitalized pediatric patient population. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective hospital-based study from July 2007 to November 2008. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nasopharyngeal specimens from children less than 16 years old who were suffering from acute respiratory diseases were tested for hMPV and HCoV-NL63 by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction. Samples were collected from July 2007 to November 2008. RESULTS: Both viruses were found among Saudi children with upper and lower respiratory tract diseases during the autumn and winter of 2007 and 2008, contributing to 11.1% of all viral diagnoses, with individual incidences of 8.3% (hMPV) and 2.8% (HCoV-NL63) among 489 specimens. Initial symptoms included fever, cough, and nasal congestion. Lower respiratory tract disease occurs in immunocompromised individuals and those with underlying conditions. Clinical findings of respiratory failure and culture-negative shock were established in 7 children infected with hMPV and having hematologic malignancies, myelofibrosis, Gaucher disease, and congenital immunodeficiency; 2 of the 7 patients died with acute respiratory failure. All children infected with HCoV-NL63 had underlying conditions; 1 of the 4 patients developed respiratory failure. CONCLUSION: hMPV and HCoV-NL63 are important causes of acute respiratory illness among hospitalized Saudi children. hMPV infection in the lower respiratory tract is associated with morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised children. HCoV-NL63 may cause severe lower respiratory disease with underlying conditions.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.291249455,-0.091546282,-0.15106896,0.035225361,0.121019661,-0.180288382,0.081350525,-0.099691494,0.238082866,-0.080126121,-0.010325422,0.225397223,0.153413476,0.137491044,-0.053945488,0.020507143,-0.063785655,0.118215102,-0.160014451,0.089082219,0.099928932,0.02062391,4.35E-05,-0.14133052,-0.068149908,0.033522001,-0.164861452,-0.095842366,0.031372347,-0.024912385
Uterine adenocarcinoma with feline leukemia virus infection,"Feline endometrial adenocarcinomas are uncommon malignant neoplasms that have been poorly characterized to date. In this study, we describe a uterine adenocarcinoma in a Persian cat with feline leukemia virus infection. At the time of presentation, the cat, a female Persian chinchilla, was 2 years old. The cat underwent surgical ovariohystectomy. A cross-section of the uterine wall revealed a thickened uterine horn. The cat tested positive for feline leukemia virus as detected by polymerase chain reaction. Histopathological examination revealed uterine adenocarcinoma that had metastasized to the omentum, resulting in thickening and the formation of inflammatory lesions. Based on the histopathological findings, this case was diagnosed as a uterine adenocarcinoma with abdominal metastasis.

Genomic Characterization of a Newly Discovered Coronavirus Associated with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Humans,"A novel human coronavirus (HCoV-EMC/2012) was isolated from a man with acute pneumonia and renal failure in June 2012. This report describes the complete genome sequence, genome organization, and expression strategy of HCoV-EMC/2012 and its relation with known coronaviruses. The genome contains 30,119 nucleotides and contains at least 10 predicted open reading frames, 9 of which are predicted to be expressed from a nested set of seven subgenomic mRNAs. Phylogenetic analysis of the replicase gene of coronaviruses with completely sequenced genomes showed that HCoV-EMC/2012 is most closely related to Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 (BtCoV-HKU4) and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5 (BtCoV-HKU5), which prototype two species in lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus. In accordance with the guidelines of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, and in view of the 75% and 77% amino acid sequence identity in 7 conserved replicase domains with BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5, respectively, we propose that HCoV-EMC/2012 prototypes a novel species in the genus Betacoronavirus. HCoV-EMC/2012 may be most closely related to a coronavirus detected in Pipistrellus pipistrellus in The Netherlands, but because only a short sequence from the most conserved part of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-encoding region of the genome was reported for this bat virus, its genetic distance from HCoV-EMC remains uncertain.

Application of Molecular Diagnostic Techniques for Viral Testing,"Nucleic acid amplification techniques are commonly used currently to diagnose viral diseases and manage patients with this kind of illnesses. These techniques have had a rapid but unconventional route of development during the last 30 years, with the discovery and introduction of several assays in clinical diagnosis. The increase in the number of commercially available methods has facilitated the use of this technology in the majority of laboratories worldwide. This technology has reduced the use of some other techniques such as viral culture based methods and serological assays in the clinical virology laboratory. Moreover, nucleic acid amplification techniques are now the methods of reference and also the most useful assays for the diagnosis in several diseases. The introduction of these techniques and their automation provides new opportunities for the clinical laboratory to affect patient care. The main objectives in performing nucleic acid tests in this field are to provide timely results useful for high-quality patient care at a reasonable cost, because rapid results are associated with improvements in patients care. The use of amplification techniques such as polymerase chain reaction, real-time polymerase chain reaction or nucleic acid sequence-based amplification for virus detection, genotyping and quantification have some advantages like high sensitivity and reproducibility, as well as a broad dynamic range.

Detection rate and clinical impact of respiratory viruses in children with Kawasaki disease,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this prospective case-control study was to survey the detection rate of respiratory viruses in children with Kawasaki disease (KD) by using multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and to investigate the clinical implications of the prevalence of respiratory viruses during the acute phase of KD. METHODS: RT-PCR assays were carried out to screen for the presence of respiratory syncytial virus A and B, adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 4, influenza virus A and B, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus OC43/229E and NL63, and enterovirus in nasopharyngeal secretions of 55 KD patients and 78 control subjects. RESULTS: Virus detection rates in KD patients and control subjects were 32.7% and 30.8%, respectively (P=0.811). However, there was no significant association between the presence of any of the 15 viruses and the incidence of KD. Comparisons between the 18 patients with positive RT-PCR results and the other 37 KD patients revealed no significant differences in terms of clinical findings (including the prevalence of incomplete presentation of the disease) and coronary artery diameter. CONCLUSION: A positive RT-PCR for currently epidemic respiratory viruses should not be used as an evidence against the diagnosis of KD.

Respiratory Viral Infections after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Children,"This study was performed to characterize respiratory viral infections in pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Study samples included 402 respiratory specimens obtained from 358 clinical episodes that occurred in the 116 children of the 175 consecutive HSCT cohort at Seoul National University Children's Hospital, Korea from 2007 to 2010. Multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions were performed for rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), adenovirus, human coronavirus (hCoV), influenza viruses and human metapneumovirus. Viruses were identified in 89 clinical episodes that occurred in 58 patients. Among the 89 clinical episodes, frequently detected viruses were rhinovirus in 25 (28.1%), RSV in 23 (25.8%), PIV-3 in 16 (18.0%), adenovirus in 12 (13.5%), and hCoV in 10 (11.2%). Lower respiratory tract infections were diagnosed in 34 (38.2%). Neutropenia was present in 24 (27.0%) episodes and lymphopenia was in 31 (34.8%) episodes. Sixty-three percent of the clinical episodes were hospital-acquired. Three patients died of respiratory failure caused by respiratory viral infections. Respiratory viral infections in pediatric patients who have undergone HSCT are common and are frequently acquired during hospitalization. Continuous monitoring is required to determine the role of respiratory viruses in immunocompromised children and the importance of preventive strategies.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.297831257,-0.132466525,-0.146232494,0.068039268,0.062045784,-0.13475392,0.043460713,-0.035411496,0.064772929,0.034239224,-0.020905895,0.022118291,0.071556527,0.059452769,0.022486089,-0.036705688,0.017735536,-0.033212918,0.045139907,0.042628547,0.023620726,-0.082734242,-0.026811942,0.041986193,0.035337412,-0.038475209,0.039964261,0.050498126,-0.003133062,-0.037302496
Tools to Detect Influenza Virus,"In 2009, pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus (H1N1 09) started to spread quickly in many countries. It causes respiratory infection with signs and symptoms of common infectious agents. Thus, clinicians sometimes may miss the H1N1 patient. Clinical laboratory tests are important for the diagnosis of the H1N1 infection. There are several tests available, however, the rapid test and direct fluorescence antigen test are unable to rule out the influenza virus infection and viral culture test is time consuming. Therefore, nucleic acid amplification techniques based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays are regarded as a specific diagnosis to confirm the influenza virus infection. Although the nucleic acid-based techniques are highly sensitive and specific, the high mutation rate of the influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase could limit the utility of the techniques. In addition, their use depends on the availability, cost and throughput of the diagnostic techniques. To overcome these drawbacks, evaluation and development of the techniques should be continued. This review provides an overview of various techniques for specific diagnosis of influenza infection.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.086196047,-0.027508689,0.08657365,0.189512164,-0.112467273,0.223877821,-0.073585866,0.037203903,-0.027008417,0.027196941,-0.001198552,-0.017356918,0.13498584,-0.117981621,0.027444748,0.034059073,-0.019553975,0.053045862,-0.104673193,-0.044919294,-0.028629054,-0.073231722,0.018629708,-0.162571242,-0.034756995,0.005121791,-0.067602376,-0.020403977,-0.079893291,0.122778028
Characteristics of human infection with avian influenza viruses and development of new antiviral agents,"Since 1997, several epizootic avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have been transmitted to humans, causing diseases and even deaths. The recent emergence of severe human infections with AIV (H7N9) in China has raised concerns about efficient interpersonal viral transmission, polygenic traits in viral pathogenicity and the management of newly emerging strains. The symptoms associated with viral infection are different in various AI strains: H5N1 and newly emerged H7N9 induce severe pneumonia and related complications in patients, while some H7 and H9 subtypes cause only conjunctivitis or mild respiratory symptoms. The virulence and tissue tropism of viruses as well as the host responses contribute to the pathogenesis of human AIV infection. Several preventive and therapeutic approaches have been proposed to combat AIV infection, including antiviral drugs such as M2 inhibitors, neuraminidase inhibitors, RNA polymerase inhibitors, attachment inhibitors and signal-transduction inhibitors etc. In this article, we summarize the recent progress in researches on the epidemiology, clinical features, pathogenicity determinants, and available or potential antivirals of AIV.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.01383078,-0.034495832,-0.051365324,0.020091717,-0.030164575,0.157908419,0.052719925,0.002042293,0.027220327,0.107226591,0.008771247,0.02256041,0.044791022,0.011652495,-0.000410439,-0.012278743,-0.043003715,0.117909542,0.013788483,0.07985116,0.024703422,0.032451897,-0.085664765,0.077455239,0.009234893,-0.023761736,0.010218116,-0.026847985,0.089644214,-0.002696129
"Outbreak of febrile respiratory illness associated with human adenovirus type 14p1 in Gansu Province, China","OBJECTIVES: Human adenovirus (HAdV) type 14 had been infrequently associated with outbreaks of febrile respiratory illness (FRI) until the HAdV‐14p1 emerged in 2006 and rapidly spread in the United States. Here, we report an outbreak of FRI caused by HadV‐14p1 that occurred in 2011 at a primary and middle school in China. DESIGN: The basic information of the outbreak was recored; throat swabs were collected from 17 patients, polymerase chain reaction, A549 cell culture, and sequencing were used to identify the pathogen of the outbreak.. RESULTS: Total of 43 students were infected in this outbreak. Boys were more than girls. We identified 11 HAdV‐positive specimens and 6 HAdV isolates. Genetic analysis showed that the complete hexon, fiber, and E1A sequences of isolates were nearly 100% identical with other HAdV‐14p1 sequences deposited in GenBank. CONCLUSIONS: HadV‐14p1 has caused outbreaks of pneumonia and mortality among adults in the United States and Europe. It may cause similar conditions among Chinese adults due to poor hygiene and sanitation. It seems prudent for China to develop a national surveillance system to determine the etiology of severe respiratory diseases and deaths among adults and school‐aged children.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.08568226,-0.02147147,-0.035323734,-0.090707705,0.055213701,0.002838771,0.001587321,0.001246143,0.00998518,0.00957291,-0.028248426,0.052550778,-0.046570001,-0.078992897,0.034898277,-0.045097387,-0.117387672,0.053043701,-0.054084002,-0.051401331,0.04799286,0.230376504,-0.02896463,0.046483508,-0.124636614,0.128753107,-0.035415971,0.362189242,-0.157834128,0.012514174
Development and clinical evaluation of a rapid diagnostic kit for feline leukemia virus infection,"Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) causes a range of neoplastic and degenerative diseases in cats. To obtain a more sensitive and convenient diagnosis of the disease, we prepared monoclonal antibodies specific for the FeLV p27 to develop a rapid diagnostic test with enhanced sensitivity and specificity. Among these antibodies, we identified two clones (hybridomas 8F8B5 and 8G7D1) that specifically bound to FeLV and were very suitable for a diagnostic kit. The affinity constants for 8F8B5 and 8G7D1 were 0.35 × 10(9) and 0.86 × 10(9), respectively. To investigate the diagnostic abilities of the rapid kit using these antibodies, we performed several clinical studies. Assessment of analytical sensitivity revealed that the detection threshold of the rapid diagnostic test was 2 ng/mL for recombinant p27 and 12.5 × 10(4) IU/mL for FeLV. When evaluating 252 cat sera samples, the kit was found to have a kappa value of 0.88 compared to polymerase chain reaction (PCR), indicating a significant correlation between data from the rapid diagnostic test and PCR. Sensitivity and specificity of the kit were 95.2% (20/21) and 98.5% (257/261), respectively. Our results demonstrated that the rapid diagnostic test would be a suitable diagnostic tool for the rapid detection of FeLV infection in cats.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.042624157,0.044886957,0.179505974,-0.037219514,-0.056668022,-0.011743493,0.02414696,0.001790744,-0.019926579,-0.042903389,0.097376548,-0.055438954,0.096919327,-0.060997788,-0.040599233,-0.0130747,0.005055442,0.001336636,0.002233899,-0.036014789,-0.035575734,-0.050116738,0.096631623,-0.066949997,-0.007592101,0.004702144,-0.015963155,-0.038914373,-0.070706807,0.030407008
Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Other Respiratory Viral Infections in Older Adults With Moderate to Severe Influenza-like Illness,"Background. Few studies have prospectively assessed viral etiologies of acute respiratory infections in community-based elderly individuals. We assessed viral respiratory pathogens in individuals ≥65 years with influenza-like illness (ILI). Methods. Multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction identified viral pathogens in nasal/throat swabs from 556 episodes of moderate-to-severe ILI, defined as ILI with pneumonia, hospitalization, or maximum daily influenza symptom severity score (ISS) >2. Cases were selected from a randomized trial of an adjuvanted vs nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine conducted in elderly adults from 15 countries. Results. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in 7.4% (41/556) moderate-to-severe ILI episodes in elderly adults. Most (39/41) were single infections. There was a significant association between country and RSV detection (P = .004). RSV prevalence was 7.1% (2/28) in ILI with pneumonia, 12.5% (8/64) in ILI with hospitalization, and 6.7% (32/480) in ILI with maximum ISS > 2. Any virus was detected in 320/556 (57.6%) ILI episodes: influenza A (104/556, 18.7%), rhinovirus/enterovirus (82/556, 14.7%), coronavirus and human metapneumovirus (each 32/556, 5.6%). Conclusions. This first global study providing data on RSV disease in ≥65 year-olds confirms that RSV is an important respiratory pathogen in the elderly. Preventative measures such as vaccination could decrease severe respiratory illnesses and complications in the elderly.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.214393766,-0.128415987,-0.094332166,0.120074663,0.021773465,0.06520933,-0.037767798,-0.075368883,0.059944713,-0.065977099,0.016497155,-0.060370398,-0.070817941,-0.072231618,-0.0341559,-0.013977342,-0.025963141,-0.010905417,0.017684037,-0.011209106,-0.017034378,-0.120897755,-0.006243757,-0.039628226,0.126346476,-0.076372384,0.102083575,0.121402211,0.021547393,0.007506828
Evaluation of the Temporal Association between Kawasaki Disease and Viral Infections in South Korea,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study is aimed at elucidating potential temporal associations between the occurrence of Kawasaki disease (KD) and various viral infections. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We obtained monthly patterns of KD from the seventh nationwide survey and viral detection data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2009 to 2011 and evaluated temporal correlations between them for each month. The respiratory viruses detected using a multiplex real-time-polymerase chain reaction kit were influenza virus (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, A/H5N1, and B), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus (type 1, 2, 3), respiratory syncytial virus (type A, B), human rhinovirus, human coronavirus (OC43/229E, NL63), human bocavirus, and enterovirus. RESULTS: We obtained data from a total of 13031 patients who were treated for acute KD from 87 hospitals with pediatric residence programs. During this survey, KD showed highest overall incidence in summer and winter seasons and lowest incidence in February and October. We received viral detection data for a total of 14267 patients. Viral detection was highest during winter and spring seasons. The most commonly detected virus was human rhinovirus (32.6%), followed by influenza virus (26.8%). The monthly incidence of KD showed significant correlation with the monthly overall viral detection (p=0.022, r=0.382). In particular, human bocavirus and enterovirus have significant correlations with monthly patterns of KD occurrence (p=0.032 and p=0.007, respectively) and influenza virus correlated with KD occurrence with borderline significance (p=0.063). CONCLUSION: The temporal association between monthly occurrence of KD and viral detection suggests the etiologic importance of precedent infection in the development of KD.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.11547021,-0.07231039,-0.016175878,0.046684219,0.014099754,0.040460987,0.00436577,-0.009630234,0.001569385,-0.000922192,-0.019345854,0.023431081,0.064506607,0.034966651,0.019941335,-0.010024028,0.003882677,-0.047333759,0.010274234,-0.004858105,0.003389641,-0.028984232,-0.027963807,0.046255487,-0.011563781,0.007874928,0.002874985,0.015828768,-0.023768111,-0.026730263
Relationship between the GOLD combined COPD assessment staging system and bacterial isolation,"BACKGROUND: Acute exacerbations, which are a significant cause of mortality and morbidity, adversely affect chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) prognosis by accelerating loss of lung function. It is important to know the microorganisms that commonly cause exacerbations in the patient groups classified according to clinical and functional characteristics for fast and accurate treatment of acute exacerbations. OBJECTIVES: The last Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) publication recommended a new staging system containing obstruction degree, frequency of exacerbations, and quality of life questionnaires. This study is designed to analyze the relationship between the bacteria isolated in acute exacerbations and new GOLD stages. METHODS: Potentially pathogenic bacteria (PPB) isolation with culture and polymerase chain reaction methods were obtained from 114 acute exacerbation COPD patients, classified into A, B, C, and D groups by analyzing the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) value, COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score, and exacerbation frequency according to the new GOLD staging system. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between exacerbation frequency and PPB isolation (P=0.002). There was no relationship between GOLD stage, FEV(1), and CAT score with PPB isolation. The isolated bacteria diversity and mixed infection frequency were higher in the GOLD stage D group. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated only from D group patients. CONCLUSION: Bacterial infection may cause an acute exacerbation equally in each stage for COPD. The difference in bacterial etiology is more related to exacerbation frequency than FEV(1) and CAT scores for an acute exacerbation. Determining exacerbation frequency is significant for treatment success in empirical antibiotic selection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.059043368,-0.029547824,-0.028220996,-0.129390536,-0.050253958,-0.010836514,0.0287765,0.019781809,-0.078567577,0.056877901,-0.02683065,-0.027017378,0.007625253,-0.015207935,0.006146791,0.012953641,0.006417512,-0.011987911,-0.006405405,-0.018249028,0.008975325,-0.134326597,-0.012466723,0.045504848,-0.012762327,0.048403414,-0.036679458,-0.010470865,0.061725673,0.100841823

Detection of respiratory viruses by real-time polymerase chain reaction in outpatients with acute respiratory infection,"Viruses are the major contributors to the morbidity and mortality of upper and lower acute respiratory infections (ARIs) for all age groups. The aim of this study was to determine the frequencies for a large range of respiratory viruses using a sensitive molecular detection technique in specimens from outpatients of all ages with ARIs. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from 162 individuals between August 2007-August 2009. Twenty-three pathogenic respiratory agents, 18 respiratory viruses and five bacteria were investigated using multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIF). Through IIF, 33 (20.4%) specimens with respiratory virus were recognised, with influenza virus representing over half of the positive samples. Through a multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay, 88 (54.3%) positive samples were detected; the most prevalent respiratory viral pathogens were influenza, human rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Six cases of viral co-detection were observed, mainly involving RSV. The use of multiplex real-time RT-PCR increased the viral detection by 33.9% and revealed a larger number of respiratory viruses implicated in ARI cases, including the most recently described respiratory viruses [human bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus, human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 and HCoV HKU1].",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.332493064,-0.055458385,0.051428747,0.30208548,0.111041374,-0.035525251,0.00075275,-0.06831411,0.091354565,-0.013218433,0.002408782,0.055499649,0.136312997,0.141422069,0.049088582,-0.069412708,0.054504868,-0.079270136,0.034816264,-0.004482811,0.034946832,-0.025213305,-0.00627086,-0.001620872,0.021781613,0.009847394,0.074595799,0.025186672,0.025787158,-0.087457363
Identification of highly conserved regions in L-segment of Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and immunoinformatic prediction about potential novel vaccine,"Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne zoonotic viral disease with a disease fatality rate between 15% and 70%. Despite the wide range of distribution, the virus (CCHFV) is basically endemic in Africa, Asia, eastern Europe, and the Middle East. Acute febrile illness associated with petechiae, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiple-organ failure are the main symptoms of the disease. With all these fatal effects, CCHFV is considered a huge threat as no successful therapeutic approach is currently available for the treatment of this disease. In the present study, we have used the immunoinformatics approach to design a potential epitope-based vaccine against the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-L of CCHFV. Both the T-cell and B-cell epitopes were assessed, and the epitope “DCSSTPPDR” was found to be the most potential one, with 100% conservancy among all the strains of CCHFV. The epitope was also found to interact with both type I and II major histocompatibility complex molecules and is considered nonallergenic as well. In vivo study of our proposed peptide is advised for novel universal vaccine production, which might be an effective path to prevent CCHF disease.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.045465017,-0.009021347,-0.017282598,-0.041393414,-0.036275757,0.061066711,0.048855105,0.015211491,0.043401028,0.043701168,0.022815192,0.00701361,-0.011201277,-0.026032353,0.011661216,0.005881332,-0.05313333,0.021493003,-0.024062424,0.016645771,0.025890088,0.004293252,-0.047654765,-0.002177554,0.032591338,-0.008378301,0.012568104,0.00533378,0.009812709,0.002214099
Utilization of the respiratory virus multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test for adult patients at a Korean tertiary care center,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Respiratory viruses (RVs) are considered to be important respiratory pathogens in adult patients, and the multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is used frequently in adult patients with respiratory infections. However, clinical data regarding utilization of the multiplex RT-PCR test for RVs are lacking. METHODS: We investigated the utilization of the multiplex RT-PCR test for RVs at Chung-Ang University Hospital in Seoul, Korea, between January 2012 and April 2013. RESULTS: During the study period, the multiplex RT-PCR test was performed for 291 adult patients. The test frequency was 4.9% of rapid influenza antigen detection tests and 0.8% of respiratory bacterial culture studies. A turnaround time of < 48 hours was observed in 25.9% of positive tests. Most of the tests were performed for admitted patients (97.9%) with a community-acquired infection (84.2%) during the flu season (82.5%). RVs were detected in 81 of 291 cases (27.8%). The RV positivity rates for community- and hospital-acquired infections did not differ (28.6% vs. 23.9%, p = 0.52). Of 166 patients with pneumonia, 44 (26.5%) had a viral infection. Among the patients with RV-associated pneumonia, an RV other than influenza was detected in 20 patients (45.4%). CONCLUSIONS: The multiplex RT-PCR test for RVs was infrequently performed at a tertiary care center, and the test results were often reported late. The test was most often performed for admitted adult patients with community-acquired infections during the flu season. The utilization of multiplex RT-PCR testing for RVs in current clinical practice should be improved.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.254220429,0.005807788,0.032771215,0.020850711,-0.054584251,-0.054869431,-0.100077272,0.099527645,-0.156558656,0.040951685,-0.02551369,0.012242965,0.015140053,0.113334312,-0.045108593,-0.033653702,0.095150824,0.044729573,-0.045497667,-0.01120082,0.041448137,-0.010745915,0.030766839,-0.000373809,0.049034951,0.006054974,0.047548495,-0.039691184,0.016723668,-0.000181323
Viral etiology of respiratory infections in children in southwestern Saudi Arabia using multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate 15 respiratory viruses in children with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) using multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and to analyze the clinical and epidemiological features of these viruses. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 135 children, ≤5 years of age who presented with ARTIs in Najran Maternity and Children Hospital, Najran, Saudi Arabia between October 2012 and July 2013 were included. The clinical and sociodemographic data, and the laboratory results were recorded using a standardized questionnaire. Two nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from each child: one for bacteriological examination, and the second for viral detection using multiplex RT-PCR. RESULTS: A single viral pathogen was detected in 76 patients, viral coinfections in 9, and mixed viral and bacterial pathogens in 15. Respiratory syncytial virus was isolated in 33 patients, human rhinovirus (hRV) in 22, adenovirus (AdV) in 19, human metapneumovirus in 13, influenza virus in 10, parainfluenza virus in 7, human corona virus (hCoV) in 4, and human bocavirus in one. CONCLUSION: Respiratory syncytial virus, hRV, and AdV were the most frequent viruses, accounting for more than two-thirds of the cases. Other viruses, such as MPV, hCoV NL63, and hCoV OC43, may play a role in pediatric ARTIs. Of significance is the potential use of multiplex RT-PCR to provide epidemiological and virological data for early detection of the emergence of novel respiratory viruses in the era of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.315891624,-0.072118783,-0.050122519,0.164918461,0.115221804,-0.127785769,0.057374563,-0.032285394,0.09068438,0.03575672,-0.021196721,0.094081299,0.179586838,0.152644423,0.053178109,-0.042083954,0.033805389,-0.063851269,0.006192292,0.02144906,-0.002109508,0.026971713,-0.024160259,0.077757823,-0.04718411,0.091869319,0.029403809,0.021195386,0.034067586,0.023837124
Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein cannot differentiate bacterial or viral infection in COPD exacerbation requiring emergency department visits,"BACKGROUND: Viral and bacterial infections are the most common causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. Whether serum inflammatory markers can differentiate bacterial from virus infection in patients with COPD exacerbation requiring emergency department (ED) visits remains controversial. METHODS: Viral culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to identify the viruses in the oropharynx of patients with COPD exacerbations. The bacteria were identified by the semiquantitative culture of the expectorated sputum. The peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC) counts, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and clinical symptoms were compared among patients with different types of infections. RESULTS: Viruses were isolated from 16 (22.2%) of the 72 patients enrolled. The most commonly identified viruses were parainfluenza type 3, influenza A, and rhinovirus. A total of 30 (41.7%) patients had positive bacterial cultures, with the most commonly found bacteria being Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Five patients (6.9%) had both positive sputum cultures and virus identification. The WBC, CRP, and PCT levels of the bacteria-positive and bacteria-negative groups were not statistically different. Multivariate analysis showed that patients with increased sputum volumes during the COPD exacerbations had higher risks of recurrent exacerbations in the 1-year period following the first exacerbation. CONCLUSION: WBC, CRP, or PCT could not differentiate between bacterial and viral infections in patients with COPD exacerbation requiring ED visits. Those with increased sputum during a COPD exacerbation had higher risks for recurrent exacerbations.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.136993301,-0.067422464,-0.067728725,-0.1209808,-0.075143352,-0.038615595,-0.020079365,0.076591703,-0.173644316,0.093662513,-0.055211642,-0.041951741,0.012514673,0.067604032,-0.027261949,-0.03934404,0.051772103,-0.033267206,0.000767308,-0.00048301,0.039900639,-0.091805452,0.031641824,0.077241534,-0.017797636,0.052217802,0.00153582,-0.007938865,0.049591079,0.128051767
Prevalence and Incidence of Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Other Respiratory Viral Infections in Children Aged 6 Months to 10 Years With Influenza-like Illness Enrolled in a Randomized Trial,"Background. The high burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated morbidity and mortality makes vaccine development a priority. Methods. As part of an efficacy trial of pandemic influenza vaccines (NCT01051661), RSV epidemiology in healthy children aged 6 months to <10 years at first vaccination with influenza-like illness (ILI) was evaluated in Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand between February 2010 and August 2011. Active surveillance for ILI was conducted for approximately 1 year, with nasal and throat swabs analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. The prevalence and incidence of RSV among ILI episodes were calculated. Results. A total of 6266 children were included, of whom 2421 experienced 3717 ILI episodes with a respiratory sample available. RSV was detected for 359 ILI episodes, a prevalence of 9.7% (95% confidence interval: 8.7–10.7). The highest prevalence was in children aged 12–23 or 24–35 months in all countries except the Philippines, where it was in children aged 6–11 months. The incidence of RSV-associated ILI was 7.0 (6.3–7.7) per 100 person-years (PY). Eighty-eight ILI episodes resulted in hospitalization, of which 8 were associated with RSV (prevalence 9.1% [4.0–17.1]; incidence 0.2 [0.1–0.3] per 100 PY). The incidence of RSV-associated ILI resulting in medical attendance was 6.0 (5.4–6.7) per 100 PY. RSV B subtypes were observed more frequently than A subtypes. Conclusions. Active surveillance demonstrated the considerable burden of RSV-associated illness that would not be identified through hospital-based surveillance, with a substantial part of the burden occurring in older infants and children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.21121148,-0.154756076,-0.088607933,0.081303231,0.053268109,0.002538716,0.007155946,-0.12848316,0.145305397,-0.154929368,0.051884477,-0.048713765,-0.176693949,-0.134132149,-0.077681637,0.045241796,-0.06213976,0.008250408,0.020208344,-0.045147539,-0.051794394,-0.095377859,0.027200509,-0.040129878,0.11098033,-0.135836556,0.197282953,0.138119678,-0.029613831,0.05383736
A Case of Statin-Induced Interstitial Pneumonitis due to Rosuvastatin,"Statins lower the hyperlipidemia and reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events and related mortality. A 60-year-old man who was diagnosed with a transient ischemic attack was started on acetyl-L-carnitine, cilostazol, and rosuvastatin. After rosuvastatin treatment for 4 weeks, the patient presented with sudden onset fever, cough, and dyspnea. His symptoms were aggravated despite empirical antibiotic treatment. All infectious pathogens were excluded based on results of culture and polymerase chain reaction of the bronchoscopic wash specimens. Chest radiography showed diffuse ground-glass opacities in both lungs, along with several subpleural ground-glass opacity nodules; and a foamy alveolar macrophage appearance was confirmed on bronchoalveolar lavage. We suspected rosuvastatin-induced lung injury, discontinued rosuvastatin and initiated prednisolone 1 mg/kg tapered over 2weeks. After initiating steroid therapy, his symptoms and radiologic findings significantly improved. We suggest that clinicians should be aware of the potential for rosuvastatin-induced lung injury.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.034067085,-0.000866135,-0.020559949,-0.132414151,-0.069636071,0.03808651,0.007078559,0.031568457,-0.005438491,0.005487212,-0.003015907,0.011115044,-0.017153895,-0.004063269,0.011745409,0.021058128,-0.022138646,0.037764657,-0.037483336,-0.035057936,0.009598661,-0.022775994,-0.053739286,-0.065602268,0.015952396,0.037974888,-0.004966616,0.021047662,0.032503103,-0.053223771
Cardiac Function in Kawasaki Disease Patients with Respiratory Symptoms,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Respiratory symptoms are often observed in children with Kawasaki disease (KD) during the acute phase. The association of respiratory viruses in children with KD was investigated using multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and tissue Doppler echocardiography. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 138 KD patients were included from January 2010 to June 2013. We compared 3 groups (group 1: n=94, KD without respiratory symptoms; group 2: n=44, KD with respiratory symptoms; and group 3: n=50, febrile patients with respiratory symptoms). Laboratory data were obtained from each patient including N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Echocardiographic measurements were compared between group 1 and group 2. RT-PCR was performed using nasopharyngeal secretion to screen for the presence of 14 viruses in groups 2 and 3. RESULTS: The incidence of KD with respiratory symptoms was 31.8%. The duration of fever was significantly longer, and coronary artery diameter was larger in group 2 than in group 1. Tei index was significantly higher and coronary artery diameter larger in group 2 than group 1. Coronary artery diameter, C-reactive protein levels, platelet count, alanine aminotransferase levels, and NT-pro BNP levels were significantly higher and albumin levels lower in group 2 compared with group 3. CONCLUSION: NT-pro BNP was a valuable diagnostic tool in differentiating KD from other febrile viral respiratory infections. Some viruses were more frequently observed in KD patients than in febrile controls. Tei index using tissue Doppler imaging was increased in KD patients with respiratory symptoms.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.136003367,-0.040356496,-0.04958792,-0.069514578,0.023517757,-0.0699882,-0.011724921,0.007640639,-0.051429344,-0.011744188,-0.019808801,0.004911744,-0.022047947,0.070801749,-0.01771301,-0.018774563,0.034965469,-0.018129736,0.024829273,-0.021131587,-0.015566101,-0.102400698,-0.082763758,0.02142514,-0.047197248,0.012052853,-0.012983109,-0.070333062,-0.01788319,-0.081305282
Changes in Clinical Presentation and Epidemiology of Respiratory Pathogens Associated With Acute Respiratory Illness in Military Trainees After Reintroduction of Adenovirus Vaccine,"Background. Adenovirus (Ad) has long been the predominant cause of acute respiratory illness (ARI) in military trainees. In 2011, live oral Ad vaccines for serotypes 4 and 7 were reintroduced into US basic military training populations. This study evaluated the impact on clinical presentations and other respiratory pathogens. Methods. The Center for Advanced Molecular Detection at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland prospectively collects demographic, clinical, and polymerase chain reaction data from respiratory specimens (throat swab and nasal wash) among Air Force trainees presenting for care of ARI. Results. From June 2008 to August 2013, 2660 trainees enrolled and were tested for selected respiratory pathogens. Post-vaccine introduction (VI), reported systemic symptoms were less frequent, including fever (38% vs 94%) and myalgia (37% vs 67%; P < .01). Median temperature and heart rate decreased (98.4 vs 101.3°F, 81 vs 96 beats per minute; P < .01). Ad detection decreased for all Ad (3% vs 68%), Ad4 (1% vs 70%), 7 (0% vs 8%), 14 (0% vs 5%), and 3 (0.1% vs 2%); P < .01). Rhinovirus and cases with no pathogen identified increased in frequency (35% vs 18%, 51% vs 14%; P < .01). Conclusions. Acute respiratory illness in military trainees post-VI is associated with decreased severity of systemic symptoms and reduced fever and heart rate. Marked reductions in frequency of Ad serotypes are seen, including those in the vaccine, with no serotype shift. However, detection of several other respiratory pathogens, most notably rhinovirus, is observed in increasing proportions, and a majority are now undiagnosed clinical syndromes.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.125876512,-0.052794072,-0.031141879,-0.057261143,-0.007499549,-0.026479574,0.01284349,0.008395818,-0.007693878,0.013308873,-0.004492883,0.009388132,-0.034961311,-0.05349789,0.009987853,0.01161703,-0.031050496,-0.044610802,0.032866003,-0.037180916,-0.018166536,-0.056302108,-0.032050217,-0.013427395,0.037781208,0.024249269,-0.020263388,0.0209711,-0.001292073,-0.084637318
A multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction panel for detecting neurologic pathogens in dogs with meningoencephalitis,"Meningoencephalitis (ME) is a common inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system in dogs. Clinically, ME has both infectious and non-infectious causes. In the present study, a multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (mqPCR) panel was optimized for the detection of eight canine neurologic pathogens (Blastomyces dermatitidis, Cryptococcus spp., Neospora caninum, Borrelia burgdorferi, Bartonella spp., Toxoplasma gondii, Ehrlichia canis, and canine distemper virus [CDV]). The mqPCR panel was subsequently applied to 53 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected from dogs with ME. The analytic sensitivity (i.e., limit of detection, expressed as molecules per 1 µL of recombinant vector) was 3.8 for CDV, 3.7 for Ehrlichia canis, 3.7 for Bartonella spp., 3.8 for Borrelia burgdorferi, 3.7 for Blastomyces dermatitidis, 3.7 for Cryptococcus spp., 38 for Neospora caninum, and 3.7 for Toxoplasma gondii. Among the tested CSF samples, seven (15%) were positive for the following pathogens in decreasing order of frequency: Cryptococcus spp. (3/7), Blastomyces dermatitidis (2/7), and Borrelia burgdorferi (2/7). In summary, use of an mqPCR panel with high analytic sensitivity as an initial screen for infectious agents in dogs with ME could facilitate the selection of early treatment strategies and improve outcomes.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.026556602,0.007111439,0.122818137,-0.073091734,-0.008979809,0.015639267,0.029534783,-0.003452671,-0.031070082,0.017592828,0.032091429,0.011902346,-0.00942618,-0.055541284,0.076499279,-0.02871659,-0.036134456,-0.065323063,0.098607879,-0.028232843,0.15285502,0.088397504,-0.047010143,-0.069461629,0.173213088,-0.11049156,-0.085439542,-0.028246779,-0.037182705,0.045191488
Multiplex SYBR Green Real-Time PCR Assay for Detection of Respiratory Viruses,"BACKGROUND: It is often difficult for a physician to distinguish between viral and bacterial causes of respiratory infections and this may result in overuse of antibiotics. In many cases of community-acquired respiratory infections, clinicians treat patients empirically. The development of molecular methods for direct detection of viruses has been progressed recently. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was recognizing the panel of respiratory RNA viruses by multiplex SYBR Green real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Randomized 172 influenza-negative respiratory specimens of all age groups of hospitalized patients were collected. After RNA extraction, cDNA was synthesized. Three SYBR Green multiplex real-time PCR assays were developed for simultaneous detection of 12 respiratory RNA viruses. Each set of multiplex methods detected four viruses, the first set: respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus; the second set: parainfluenza viruses 1 - 4 (PIV1-4); the third set: coronaviruses NL63, 229E, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and OC43. RESULTS: Application of the multiplex SYBR Green real-time PCR in clinical samples from 172 patients in a one-year study resulted in detection of 19 (11.04%) PIV3, 9 (5.23%) PIV4, and 1 (0.58%) coronavirus NL63. All the positive samples were detected during December to March (2011 - 2012).

"Detection of Viral and Bacterial Pathogens in Hospitalized Children With Acute Respiratory Illnesses, Chongqing, 2009–2013","Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) cause large disease burden each year. The codetection of viral and bacterial pathogens is quite common; however, the significance for clinical severity remains controversial. We aimed to identify viruses and bacteria in hospitalized children with ARI and the impact of mixed detections. Hospitalized children with ARI aged ≤16 were recruited from 2009 to 2013 at the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected for detection of common respiratory viruses by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or PCR. Bacteria were isolated from NPAs by routine culture methods. Detection and codetection frequencies and clinical features and severity were compared. Of the 3181 hospitalized children, 2375 (74.7%) were detected with ≥1 virus and 707 (22.2%) with ≥1 bacteria, 901 (28.3%) with ≥2 viruses, 57 (1.8%) with ≥2 bacteria, and 542 (17.0%) with both virus and bacteria. The most frequently detected were Streptococcus pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and influenza virus. Clinical characteristics were similar among different pathogen infections for older group (≥6 years old), with some significant difference for the younger. Cases with any codetection were more likely to present with fever; those with ≥2 virus detections had higher prevalence of cough; cases with virus and bacteria codetection were more likely to have cough and sputum. No significant difference in the risk of pneumonia, severe pneumonia, and intensive care unit admission were found for any codetection than monodetection. There was a high codetection rate of common respiratory pathogens among hospitalized pediatric ARI cases, with fever as a significant predictor. Cases with codetection showed no significant difference in severity than those with single pathogens.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.227226669,-0.105901096,-0.062642958,0.032535178,0.025514873,-0.069684874,0.025038336,-0.013557421,-0.016688916,0.048312821,-0.006632685,-0.030199981,0.002131873,-0.060853908,0.026087175,-0.006628918,-0.018902881,-0.038127047,-0.00324857,0.016160432,-0.058123126,0.104556636,0.03001239,0.052081698,0.012518508,0.087218352,0.006759714,0.019943416,0.033009356,-0.049639014
RNA methyltransferases involved in 5′ cap biosynthesis,"In eukaryotes and viruses that infect them, the 5′ end of mRNA molecules, and also many other functionally important RNAs, are modified to form a so-called cap structure that is important for interactions of these RNAs with many nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. The RNA cap has multiple roles in gene expression, including enhancement of RNA stability, splicing, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and translation initiation. Apart from guanosine addition to the 5′ end in the most typical cap structure common to transcripts produced by RNA polymerase II (in particular mRNA), essentially all cap modifications are due to methylation. The complexity of the cap structure and its formation can range from just a single methylation of the unprocessed 5′ end of the primary transcript, as in mammalian U6 and 7SK, mouse B2, and plant U3 RNAs, to an elaborate m(7)Gpppm(6,6)AmpAmpCmpm(3)Um structure at the 5′ end of processed RNA in trypanosomes, which are formed by as many as 8 methylation reactions. While all enzymes responsible for methylation of the cap structure characterized to date were found to belong to the same evolutionarily related and structurally similar Rossmann Fold Methyltransferase superfamily, that uses the same methyl group donor, S-adenosylmethionine; the enzymes also exhibit interesting differences that are responsible for their distinct functions. This review focuses on the evolutionary classification of enzymes responsible for cap methylation in RNA, with a focus on the sequence relationships and structural similarities and dissimilarities that provide the basis for understanding the mechanism of biosynthesis of different caps in cellular and viral RNAs. Particular attention is paid to the similarities and differences between methyltransferases from human cells and from human pathogens that may be helpful in the development of antiviral and antiparasitic drugs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14434934,-0.074376845,-0.066331867,0.023682613,-0.025346508,-0.061342447,-0.007563746,0.048480851,-0.081922502,0.033726985,-0.066832009,-0.024519094,0.034838106,-0.01323801,-0.057421779,-0.018595648,-0.033413461,0.005929916,-0.086695121,0.074122995,-0.000803138,0.091448161,0.10847269,0.066451792,0.07156565,-0.135749161,-0.015261865,0.06637675,0.225017492,0.004443628
"Parainfluenza Virus Infection Among Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-Infected and HIV-Uninfected Children and Adults Hospitalized for Severe Acute Respiratory Illness in South Africa, 2009–2014","Background. Parainfluenza virus (PIV) is a common cause of acute respiratory tract infections, but little is known about PIV infection in children and adults in Africa, especially in settings where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence is high. Methods. We conducted active, prospective sentinel surveillance for children and adults hospitalized with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) from 2009 to 2014 in South Africa. We enrolled controls (outpatients without febrile or respiratory illness) to calculate the attributable fraction for PIV infection. Respiratory specimens were tested by multiplex real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay for parainfluenza types 1, 2, and 3. Results. Of 18 282 SARI cases enrolled, 1188 (6.5%) tested positive for any PIV type: 230 (19.4%) were type 1; 168 (14.1%) were type 2; 762 (64.1%) were type 3; and 28 (2.4%) had coinfection with 2 PIV types. After adjusting for age, HIV serostatus, and respiratory viral coinfection, the attributable fraction for PIV was 65.6% (95% CI [confidence interval], 47.1–77.7); PIV contributed to SARI among HIV-infected and -uninfected children <5 years of age and among individuals infected with PIV types 1 and 3. The observed overall incidence of PIV-associated SARI was 38 (95% CI, 36–39) cases per 100 000 population and was highest in children <1 year of age (925 [95% CI, 864–989] cases per 100 000 population). Compared with persons without HIV, persons with HIV had an increased relative risk of PIV hospitalization (9.4; 95% CI, 8.5–10.3). Conclusions. Parainfluenza virus causes substantial severe respiratory disease in South Africa among children <5 years of age, especially those that are infected with HIV.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.185398223,-0.094372769,-0.081831406,-0.00016994,0.023381642,-0.036556166,0.0179202,-0.064991193,0.05361339,-0.08682815,0.016243604,0.057119625,-0.059293311,-0.06666859,-0.026678977,0.073389554,-0.089827556,-0.058429527,0.034536202,-0.010050499,-0.098360854,0.095607741,0.016890935,0.060459746,0.011064488,0.022997759,-0.021104951,-0.047945283,-0.042489218,-0.02427077
Frequent Asymptomatic Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections During an Epidemic in a Rural Kenyan Household Cohort,"Background. The characteristics, determinants, and potential contribution to transmission of asymptomatic cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection have not been well described. Methods. A cohort of 47 households (493 individuals) in coastal Kenya was recruited and followed for a 26-week period spanning a complete RSV season. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were requested weekly, during the first 4 weeks, and twice weekly thereafter from all household members, regardless of illness status. The samples were screened for a range of respiratory viruses by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results. Tests on 16 928 samples yielded 205 RSV infection episodes in 179 individuals (37.1%) from 40 different households. Eighty-six episodes (42.0%) were asymptomatic. Factors independently associated with an increased risk of asymptomatic RSV infection episodes were higher age, shorter duration of infection, bigger household size, lower peak viral load, absence of concurrent RSV infections within the household, infection by RSV group B, and no prior human rhinovirus infections. The propensity of RSV spread in households was dependent on symptom status and amount (duration and load) of virus shed. Conclusions. While asymptomatic RSV was less likely to spread, the high frequency of symptomless RSV infection episodes highlights a potentially important role of asymptomatic infections in the community transmission of RSV.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.180350846,-0.105215974,-0.079291616,0.035980388,0.025836704,-0.07530936,0.0741504,-0.083300726,0.150429413,-0.077620487,0.059764635,-0.113903532,-0.138974262,-0.069819248,-0.036594595,0.003101518,-0.045658567,0.027064248,0.019948981,-0.037559056,-0.024848754,-0.159296357,-0.060810199,-0.048463685,0.114146628,-0.158133902,0.264199545,0.091116418,-0.06336589,0.07188211
Viral Polymerase-Helicase Complexes Regulate Replication Fidelity To Overcome Intracellular Nucleotide Depletion,"To date, the majority of work on RNA virus replication fidelity has focused on the viral RNA polymerase, while the potential role of other viral replicase proteins in this process is poorly understood. Previous studies used resistance to broad-spectrum RNA mutagens, such as ribavirin, to identify polymerases with increased fidelity that avoid misincorporation of such base analogues. We identified a novel variant in the alphavirus viral helicase/protease, nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) that operates in concert with the viral polymerase nsP4 to further alter replication complex fidelity, a functional linkage that was conserved among the alphavirus genus. Purified chikungunya virus nsP2 presented delayed helicase activity of the high-fidelity enzyme, and yet purified replication complexes manifested stronger RNA polymerization kinetics. Because mutagenic nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin also affect intracellular nucleotide pools, we addressed the link between nucleotide depletion and replication fidelity by using purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors. High-fidelity viruses were more resistant to these conditions, and viral growth could be rescued by the addition of exogenous nucleosides, suggesting that mutagenesis by base analogues requires nucleotide pool depletion. This study describes a novel function for nsP2, highlighting the role of other components of the replication complex in regulating viral replication fidelity, and suggests that viruses can alter their replication complex fidelity to overcome intracellular nucleotide-depleting conditions. IMPORTANCE Previous studies using the RNA mutagen ribavirin to select for drug-resistant variants have highlighted the essential role of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in regulating replication fidelity. However, the role of other viral replicase components in replication fidelity has not been studied in detail. We identified here an RNA mutagen-resistant variant of the nsP2 helicase/protease that conferred increased fidelity and yet could not operate in the same manner as high-fidelity polymerases. We show that the alphavirus helicase is a key component of the fidelity-regulating machinery. Our data show that the RNA mutagenic activity of compounds such as ribavirin is coupled to and potentiated by nucleotide depletion and that RNA viruses can fine-tune their replication fidelity when faced with an intracellular environment depleted of nucleotides.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.208910201,-0.069599124,-0.1006779,0.124657388,-0.091972787,-0.02052133,0.103543594,0.023733783,-0.04166579,0.084401154,0.125505228,0.094807146,-0.086397565,0.004194208,-0.007481341,0.010028756,-0.016161018,-0.025401611,-0.056512566,0.003514617,0.08271625,-0.047097072,0.047038138,0.086632778,-0.01561065,0.076422294,0.035333139,-0.079748158,-0.100197592,-0.105586954
Identification of potential drug targets by subtractive genome analysis of Escherichia coli O157:H7: an in silico approach,"Bacterial enteric infections resulting in diarrhea, dysentery, or enteric fever constitute a huge public health problem, with more than a billion episodes of disease annually in developing and developed countries. In this study, the deadly agent of hemorrhagic diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome, Escherichia coli O157:H7 was investigated with extensive computational approaches aimed at identifying novel and broad-spectrum antibiotic targets. A systematic in silico workflow consisting of comparative genomics, metabolic pathways analysis, and additional drug prioritizing parameters was used to identify novel drug targets that were essential for the pathogen’s survival but absent in its human host. Comparative genomic analysis of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotated metabolic pathways identified 350 putative target proteins in E. coli O157:H7 which showed no similarity to human proteins. Further bio-informatic approaches including prediction of subcellular localization, calculation of molecular weight, and web-based investigation of 3D structural characteristics greatly aided in filtering the potential drug targets from 350 to 120. Ultimately, 44 non-homologous essential proteins of E. coli O157:H7 were prioritized and proved to have the eligibility to become novel broad-spectrum antibiotic targets and DNA polymerase III alpha (dnaE) was the top-ranked among these targets. Moreover, druggability of each of the identified drug targets was evaluated by the DrugBank database. In addition, 3D structure of the dnaE was modeled and explored further for in silico docking with ligands having potential druggability. Finally, we confirmed that the compounds N-coeleneterazine and N-(1,4-dihydro-5H-tetrazol-5-ylidene)-9-oxo-9H-xanthene-2-sulfon-amide were the most suitable ligands of dnaE and hence proposed as the potential inhibitors of this target protein. The results of this study could facilitate the discovery and release of new and effective drugs against E. coli O157:H7 and other deadly human bacterial pathogens.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.062608552,-0.006989694,-0.002506267,-0.039420565,-0.06152377,0.074044723,0.092158535,-0.014817612,0.027805569,0.051178324,-0.066566684,0.024658332,0.032516903,-0.070973228,-0.009027557,-0.067636332,-0.010147976,0.062281898,0.006444841,0.01531849,-0.010892767,0.041963641,-0.054480939,0.037150058,0.038619586,0.016174167,0.048802265,-0.025239107,0.092658336,-0.021260477
"Pilot study of participant-collected nasal swabs for acute respiratory infections in a low-income, urban population","OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and validity of unsupervised participant-collected nasal swabs to detect respiratory pathogens in a low-income, urban minority population. METHODS: This project was conducted as part of an ongoing community-based surveillance study in New York City to identify viral etiologies of acute respiratory infection. In January 2014, following sample collection by trained research assistants, participants with acute respiratory infection from 30 households subsequently collected and returned a self-collected/parent-collected nasal swab via mail. Self/parental swabs corresponding with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction primary research samples were analyzed. RESULTS: Nearly all (96.8%, n=30/31) households agreed to participate; 100% reported returning the sample and 29 were received (median time: 8 days). Most (18; 62.1%) of the primary research samples were positive. For eight influenza-positive research samples, seven (87.5%) self-swabs were also positive. For ten other respiratory pathogen-positive research samples, eight (80.0%) self-swabs were positive. Sensitivity of self-swabs for any respiratory pathogen was 83.3% and 87.5% for influenza, and specificity for both was 100%. There was no relationship between level of education and concordance of results between positive research samples and their matching participant swab. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, self-swabbing was feasible and valid in a low-income, urban minority population.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.151635661,-0.019014732,0.011255542,0.009211273,0.036101369,0.020600653,-0.029942833,0.002659131,-0.024448138,-0.023462209,0.056849773,0.007484831,-0.020800431,-0.005384875,0.067968864,-0.012186676,-0.009271979,-0.096328391,0.082854015,-0.081767438,-0.047503786,-0.039939584,-0.061919648,-0.069626004,0.080764094,0.011319572,-0.059418786,0.03001696,0.009328539,-0.100104756
Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes: A Functional Genomics Tool for the Study of Positive-strand RNA Viruses,"Reverse genetics, an approach to rescue infectious virus entirely from a cloned cDNA, has revolutionized the field of positive-strand RNA viruses, whose genomes have the same polarity as cellular mRNA. The cDNA-based reverse genetics system is a seminal method that enables direct manipulation of the viral genomic RNA, thereby generating recombinant viruses for molecular and genetic studies of both viral RNA elements and gene products in viral replication and pathogenesis. It also provides a valuable platform that allows the development of genetically defined vaccines and viral vectors for the delivery of foreign genes. For many positive-strand RNA viruses such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), however, the cloned cDNAs are unstable, posing a major obstacle to the construction and propagation of the functional cDNA. Here, the present report describes the strategic considerations in creating and amplifying a genetically stable full-length infectious JEV cDNA as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) using the following general experimental procedures: viral RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, cDNA subcloning and modification, assembly of a full-length cDNA, cDNA linearization, in vitro RNA synthesis, and virus recovery. This protocol provides a general methodology applicable to cloning full-length cDNA for a range of positive-strand RNA viruses, particularly those with a genome of >10 kb in length, into a BAC vector, from which infectious RNAs can be transcribed in vitro with a bacteriophage RNA polymerase.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.180779227,-0.063611187,-0.01861597,0.120565134,0.012252719,-0.086198951,-0.063048584,0.02721694,-0.041955967,0.075283785,0.041208241,-0.077956042,0.048665772,0.038490975,0.062057691,0.026128311,-0.05460477,-0.01119328,-0.019241926,0.019115694,-0.061728294,0.018494636,-0.00762538,-0.023414661,-0.072759172,-0.046331504,0.01679899,-0.013415074,-0.045162217,0.078089913
Comprehensive Molecular Testing for Respiratory Pathogens in Community-Acquired Pneumonia,"Background. The frequent lack of a microbiological diagnosis in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) impairs pathogen-directed antimicrobial therapy. This study assessed the use of comprehensive multibacterial, multiviral molecular testing, including quantification, in adults hospitalized with CAP. Methods. Clinical and laboratory data were collected for 323 adults with radiologically-confirmed CAP admitted to 2 UK tertiary care hospitals. Sputum (96%) or endotracheal aspirate (4%) specimens were cultured as per routine practice and also tested with fast multiplex real-time polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) assays for 26 respiratory bacteria and viruses. Bacterial loads were also calculated for 8 bacterial pathogens. Appropriate pathogen-directed therapy was retrospectively assessed using national guidelines adapted for local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Results. Comprehensive molecular testing of single lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens achieved pathogen detection in 87% of CAP patients compared with 39% with culture-based methods. Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the main agents detected, along with a wide variety of typical and atypical pathogens. Viruses were present in 30% of cases; 82% of these were codetections with bacteria. Most (85%) patients had received antimicrobials in the 72 hours before admission. Of these, 78% had a bacterial pathogen detected by PCR but only 32% were culture-positive (P < .0001). Molecular testing had the potential to enable de-escalation in number and/or spectrum of antimicrobials in 77% of patients. Conclusions. Comprehensive molecular testing significantly improves pathogen detection in CAP, particularly in antimicrobial-exposed patients, and requires only a single LRT specimen. It also has the potential to enable early de-escalation from broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobials to pathogen-directed therapy.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.192232289,-0.031308619,-0.005888861,-0.039280498,-0.078510637,-0.071389892,0.003415249,0.098345061,-0.18002355,0.148263765,-0.094475931,-0.019043912,0.073094641,-0.036561698,-0.048751222,-0.071567224,-0.011932527,0.001033246,-0.04113962,0.012044309,0.012133464,0.076363634,0.197327205,-0.01580694,0.085866163,-0.048420037,0.012336138,0.039712628,0.137393651,-0.005133904
"Relative frequency, Possible Risk Factors, Viral Codetection Rates, and Seasonality of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Among Children With Lower Respiratory Tract Infection in Northeastern Brazil","Few studies, each limited to a single major city, have investigated the prevalence and seasonal patterns of different viruses among children with low respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in Northeastern Brazil. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and of 7 other viruses in children for LRTI in 4 capitals from this region, and investigate their association with several risk factors, including meteorological data. From April 2012 to March 2013, 507 children, aged up to 24 months and hospitalized with LRTI in one of the participating centers at Aracajú, Salvador, Recife, and Maceió, had a sample of nasopharyngeal aspirate collected and analyzed for the following viruses by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction followed by hybridization on low-density microarrays: RSV, influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, and coronavirus. The result was positive in 66.5% of cases, RSV was the most common virus (40.2%). Except for rhinovirus (17%), all other virus had frequency rates lower than 6%. Viral coinfections were detected in 13.8% of samples. Possible related risk factors for RSV infection were low age upon entry, attendance of daycare, low gestational age, and low educational level of the father. The relative frequency of viral infections was associated with increasing temperature and decreasing humidity separately, but the results also suggested both associated with increased frequency of RSV. Some of these findings differ from those reported for other regions in Brazil and may be used to guide policies that address LRTI.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.20599671,-0.153335767,-0.091370261,0.086479837,0.072463569,-0.083110541,0.068395507,-0.113311938,0.11780681,-0.035742756,0.054517156,-0.08748947,-0.084182047,-0.069428651,-0.015910836,0.000145472,-0.041192313,-0.011216137,-0.004866957,-0.009524364,-0.018800043,-0.025802968,-0.006672627,0.040139512,0.036084067,-0.087851576,0.156546554,0.071746825,-0.03849284,0.034529931

"Population-based Surveillance for Medically Attended Human Parainfluenza Viruses From the Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project, 2010–2014","BACKGROUND: Parainfluenza viruses (PIV) have been shown to contribute substantially to pediatric hospitalizations in the United States. However, to date, there has been no systematic surveillance to estimate the burden among pediatric outpatients. METHODS: From August 2010 through July 2014, outpatient health care providers with enumerated patient populations in 13 states and jurisdictions participating in the Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project conducted surveillance of patients with influenza-like illness (ILI). Respiratory specimens were collected from the first 10 ILI patients each week with demographic and clinical data. Specimens were tested for multiple respiratory viruses, including PIV1–4, using reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction assays. Cumulative incidence was calculated using provider patient population size as the denominator. RESULTS: PIVs 1–3 were detected in 8.0% of 7716 ILI-related outpatient specimens: 30% were PIV1, 26% PIV2 and 44% PIV3. PIV circulation varied noticeably by year and type, with PIV3 predominating in 2010–2011 (incidence 110 per 100,000 children), PIV1 in 2011–2012 (89 per 100,000), dual predominance of PIV2 and PIV3 (88 and 131 per 100,000) in 2012–2013 and PIV3 (100 per 100,000) in 2013–2014. The highest incidence of PIV detections was among patients aged <5 years (259–1307 per 100,000). The median age at detection for PIV3 (3.4 years) was significantly lower than the median ages for PIV1 (4.5 years) and PIV2 (7.0 years; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PIVs 1–3 comprise a substantial amount of medically attended pediatric ILI, particularly among children aged <5 years. Distinct seasonal circulation patterns as well as significant differences in rates by age were observed between PIV types.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.155932736,-0.077513302,-0.052715562,0.03388207,0.030546353,0.031229808,-0.031927408,-0.009266803,0.008034416,-0.068425188,0.002893919,0.041300664,-0.046972713,-0.042613202,-0.017932778,0.027086791,-0.022739161,-0.034282926,0.018821237,-0.02317665,-0.010344655,-0.020211879,0.014328165,-0.00031102,0.017725146,-0.020228039,0.011985012,0.094864417,-0.009615173,-0.021404246
Analytical and Clinical Validation of Six Commercial Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus RNA Detection Kits Based on Real-Time Reverse-Transcription PCR,"BACKGROUND: During the 2015 outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), six different commercial MERS-CoV RNA detection kits based on real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) were available in Korea. We performed analytical and clinical validations of these kits. METHODS: PowerChek (Kogene Biotech, Korea), DiaPlexQ (SolGent, Korea), Anyplex (Seegene, Korea), AccuPower (Bioneer, Korea), LightMix (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Switzerland), and UltraFast kits (Nanobiosys, Korea) were evaluated. Limits of detection (LOD) with 95% probability values were estimated by testing 16 replicates of upstream of the envelope gene (upE) and open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) RNA transcripts. Specificity was estimated by using 28 nasopharyngeal swabs that were positive for other respiratory viruses. Clinical sensitivity was evaluated by using 18 lower respiratory specimens. The sensitivity test panel and the high inhibition panel were composed of nine specimens each, including eight and six specimens that were positive for MERS-CoV, respectively. RESULTS: The LODs for upE ranged from 21.88 to 263.03 copies/reaction, and those for ORF1a ranged from 6.92 to 128.82 copies/reaction. No cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses was found. All six kits correctly identified 8 of 8 (100%) positive clinical specimens. Based on results from the high inhibition panel, PowerChek and AccuPower were the least sensitive to the presence of PCR inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: The overall sensitivity and specificity of all six assay systems were sufficient for diagnosing MERS-CoV infection. However, the analytical sensitivity and detection ability in specimens with PCR inhibition could be improved with the use of appropriate internal controls.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.09072336,0.201558962,0.033767458,0.065886139,0.00396725,-0.066689597,-0.036300999,0.217644059,0.16911502,-0.003732873,0.008598061,-0.016193012,-0.01969861,-0.013444934,-0.007622686,-0.042540276,0.009531527,-0.069195728,0.052425747,-0.07507259,-0.029864105,0.00552768,0.078543608,-0.004550598,-0.008186877,-0.040738301,-0.025853225,-0.045184407,-0.0151742,-0.028347092
Incidence of Medically Attended Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Influenza Illnesses in Children 6–59 Months Old During Four Seasons,"Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza are significant causes of seasonal respiratory illness in children. The incidence of influenza and RSV hospitalization is well documented, but the incidence of medically attended, laboratory-confirmed illness has not been assessed in a well defined community cohort. Methods. Children aged 6–59 months with medically attended acute respiratory illness were prospectively enrolled during the 2006–2007 through 2009–2010 influenza seasons in a Wisconsin community cohort. Nasal swabs were tested for RSV and influenza by multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The population incidence of medically attended RSV and influenza was estimated separately and standardized to weeks 40 through 18 of each season. Results. The cohort included 2800–3073 children each season. There were 2384 children enrolled with acute respiratory illness; 627 (26%) were positive for RSV and 314 (13%) for influenza. The mean age was 28 months (standard deviation [SD] = 15) for RSV-positive and 38 months (SD = 16) for influenza-positive children. Seasonal incidence (cases per 10 000) was 1718 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1602–1843) for RSV and 768 (95% CI, 696–848) for influenza. Respiratory syncytial virus incidence was highest among children 6–11 (2927) and 12–23 months old (2377). Influenza incidence was highest (850) in children 24–59 months old. The incidence of RSV was higher than influenza across all seasons and age groups. Conclusions. The incidence of medically attended RSV was highest in children 6–23 months old, and it was consistently higher than influenza. The burden of RSV remains high throughout the first 2 years of life.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.28893587,-0.195254422,-0.12673508,0.161877795,0.040143453,0.085557327,-0.070881655,-0.135295018,0.117223645,-0.218868458,0.05856153,-0.035466322,-0.175209917,-0.121103117,-0.097776894,0.071222428,-0.058112498,0.004552238,0.001046415,-0.04744721,-0.096715117,-0.023641933,0.067208109,-0.044171046,0.072079197,-0.140010006,0.160781909,0.054430942,-0.024889171,0.072999226
Clinical Presentation and Outcomes of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in the Republic of Korea,"BACKGROUND: From May to July 2015, the Republic of Korea experienced the largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outside the Arabian Peninsula. A total of 186 patients, including 36 deaths, had been diagnosed with MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection as of September 30th, 2015. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained information of patients who were confirmed to have MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV infection was diagnosed using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 16 to 86). A total of 55.4% of the patients had one or more coexisting medical conditions. The most common symptom was fever (95.2%). At admission, leukopenia (42.6%), thrombocytopenia (46.6%), and elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (42.7%) were observed. Pneumonia was detected in 68.3% of patients at admission and developed in 80.8% during the disease course. Antiviral agents were used for 74.7% of patients. Mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and convalescent serum were employed for 24.5%, 7.1%, and 3.8% of patients, respectively. Older age, presence of coexisting medical conditions including diabetes or chronic lung disease, presence of dyspnea, hypotension, and leukocytosis at admission, and the use of mechanical ventilation were revealed to be independent predictors of death. CONCLUSION: The clinical features of MERS-CoV infection in the Republic of Korea were similar to those of previous outbreaks in the Middle East. However, the overall mortality rate (20.4%) was lower than that in previous reports. Enhanced surveillance and active management of patients during the outbreak may have resulted in improved outcomes.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.182642844,0.213476818,-0.169577589,-0.100530845,-0.060771259,-0.02194614,-0.084256544,0.38313587,0.130517272,0.023917505,0.000815833,0.014766983,-0.052960838,0.04578791,-0.070111977,-0.005592178,0.011757351,0.00356692,-0.000316248,0.060986393,0.035532234,-0.023538754,0.017892842,0.036081871,-0.020423735,-0.039752994,-0.008028885,-0.006068573,-0.070470212,0.038243541
Sendai virus intra-host population dynamics and host immunocompetence influence viral virulence during in vivo passage,"In vivo serial passage of non-pathogenic viruses has been shown to lead to increased viral virulence, and although the precise mechanism(s) are not clear, it is known that both host and viral factors are associated with increased pathogenicity. Under- or overnutrition leads to a decreased or dysregulated immune response and can increase viral mutant spectrum diversity and virulence. The objective of this study was to identify the role of viral mutant spectra dynamics and host immunocompetence in the development of pathogenicity during in vivo passage. Because the nutritional status of the host has been shown to affect the development of viral virulence, the diet of animal model reflected two extremes of diets which exist in the global population, malnutrition and obesity. Sendai virus was serially passaged in groups of mice with differing nutritional status followed by transmission of the passaged virus to a second host species, guinea pigs. Viral population dynamics were characterized using deep sequence analysis and computational modeling. Histopathology, viral titer and cytokine assays were used to characterize viral virulence. Viral virulence increased with passage and the virulent phenotype persisted upon passage to a second host species. Additionally, nutritional status of mice during passage influenced the phenotype. Sequencing revealed the presence of several non-synonymous changes in the consensus sequence associated with passage, a majority of which occurred in the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and polymerase genes, as well as the presence of persistent high frequency variants in the viral population. In particular, an N1124D change in the consensus sequences of the polymerase gene was detected by passage 10 in a majority of the animals. In vivo comparison of an 1124D plaque isolate to a clone with 1124N genotype indicated that 1124D was associated with increased virulence.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.075463551,-0.056234687,-0.025617203,-0.040673876,0.005544897,0.064490272,0.076895277,-0.012252965,0.001871479,0.039588006,-0.009868582,-0.045922741,0.004235895,0.019352868,0.028799169,-0.000606422,-0.062655079,-0.034369125,-0.061128053,0.025229215,0.037044975,-0.007585479,-0.022892423,0.104968851,-0.057915132,-0.034739889,0.085206803,-0.071500737,-0.028051435,0.003847779
Detection of Common Respiratory Viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in Patient-Occupied Rooms in Pediatric Wards,"Few studies have assessed viral contamination in the rooms of hospital wards. This cross-sectional study evaluated the air and objects in patient-occupied rooms in pediatric wards for the presence of common respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Air samplers were placed at a short (60–80 cm) and long (320 cm) distance from the head of the beds of 58 pediatric patients, who were subsequently confirmed to be infected with enterovirus (n = 17), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n = 13), influenza A virus (n = 13), adenovirus (n = 9), or M pneumoniae (n = 6). Swab samples were collected from the surfaces of 5 different types of objects in the patients’ rooms. All air and swab samples were analyzed via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for the presence of the above pathogens. All pathogens except enterovirus were detected in the air, on the objects, or in both locations in the patients’ rooms. The detection rates of influenza A virus, adenovirus, and M pneumoniae for the long distance air sampling were 15%, 67%, and 17%, respectively. Both adenovirus and M pneumoniae were detected at very high rates, with high concentrations, on all sampled objects. The respiratory pathogens RSV, influenza A virus, adenovirus, and M pneumoniae were detected in the air and/or on the objects in the pediatric ward rooms. Appropriate infection control measures should be strictly implemented when caring for such patients.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.176394204,-0.078400055,-0.023077797,0.023526602,0.009670585,0.010251089,-0.030566598,0.031471366,-0.086833316,0.027369949,-0.018677576,-0.046117322,-0.030016817,0.000576272,0.010176486,-0.02727883,0.006226843,-0.049630803,0.04462233,-0.014804324,0.016614133,0.019313242,0.108845455,0.005562989,0.047210797,-0.018687825,0.045183595,0.116182456,-0.009648489,-0.046271531
Production of specific IgY antibody to the recombinant FanC protein produced in Escherichia coli,"OBJECTIVE(S): Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains are one of the primary causes of diarrhea in newborn calves and in humans, pigs, and sheep. IgY technology has been identified as a promising alternative to generating a mass amount of specific antibody for use in immunotherapy and immunodiagnostics. The purpose of this study was to produce specific antibody by egg yolk antibody (IgY) to recombinant FanC protein from ETEC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FanC (K99) gene was amplified from ETEC by specific primers and polymerase chain reaction. The gene was cloned and subcloned into pTZ57R/T and pET32a (+) vectors, respectively. Recombinant vector was transferred into E. coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3). Protein expression was investigated by 1 mM IPTG induction. Hens were immunized by the purified recombinant FanC protein. The activity and specificity of the IgY antibody were detected by dot-blotting, Western blotting, and indirect ELISA. RESULTS: We obtained FanC specific IgYs by immunizing the hens with the recombinant FanC protein. The anti-FanC IgY showed binding specifically to the FanC protein of ETEC. CONCLUSION: The results emphasize that specific IgY against the recombinant FanC protein could be recommended as a candidate for passive immunization against ETEC infection in animals and humans.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.098187263,-0.014844038,0.049024102,-0.107241522,-0.01580383,0.035966177,-0.045182768,-0.070743618,0.069755415,-0.029001019,-0.085657153,-0.016058613,-0.009690695,0.013335875,-0.027841398,-0.111347935,0.058631978,-0.036868493,0.003780341,-0.004182752,0.003318133,-0.001100432,0.068261732,-0.01100875,0.068507954,0.108416358,0.035751964,-0.062420709,-0.062072053,0.094309177
Impact of a porcine epidemic diarrhea outbreak on swine productivity in Japan: a retrospective cohort study,"The objective was to investigate porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) outbreak that occurred in 2014 in Japan and its effects on herd-level productivity using a data recording system (PigINFO). The study herds were selected from farrow-to-finish herds (n=99) that entered in the PigINFO system between July 2013 and March 2015. From 1 April to 30 June 2014 (PED epidemic), any herds with clinical signs of PED and feces positive for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) on polymerase chain reaction analysis and/or immunohistochemical staining were defined as PED-positive (n=38). They were further classified into those with long PED periods (L-PED-positive; n=28) and those with short PED periods (S-PED-positive; n=10). Herds with no clinical signs of PED were classified as PED-negative (n=61). Herd-level production data, including preweaning mortality (%; PRWM), postweaning mortality (%; POWM), pigs weaned per litter (PWL), pigs born alive per litter, litters per mated female per year and pigs marketed per sow (MP), were calculated every 3 months during study period. During the PED epidemic, L-PED-positive herds had significantly higher PRWM and POWM than PED-negative herds, and L-PED-positive and S-PED-positive herds had significantly lower PWL. During October–December 2014, L-PED-positive herds had significantly fewer MP than PED-negative herds. The PED outbreak increased mortality and consequently reduced the numbers of marketed pigs. The rapid control of an outbreak is important for reducing the financial losses arising from PED infections.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.003672598,-0.013288783,0.022747025,-0.100394861,0.004183981,0.032445565,0.002380172,0.007856554,-0.0057498,-0.035678236,0.025738487,0.05402058,-0.073106761,-0.009514256,0.108774547,-0.046290977,-0.022865706,0.008821198,-0.021630814,0.030075597,-0.05284724,-0.031627747,-0.00042602,-0.035107808,-0.013729015,-0.01155197,-0.028302058,0.006714845,0.020132826,-0.026777462
Human bocavirus: Current knowledge and future challenges,"Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a parvovirus isolated about a decade ago and found worldwide in both respiratory samples, mainly from early life and children of 6-24 mo of age with acute respiratory infection, and in stool samples, from patients with gastroenteritis. Since then, other viruses related to the first HBoV isolate (HBoV1), namely HBoV2, HBoV3 and HBoV4, have been detected principally in human faeces. HBoVs are small non-enveloped single-stranded DNA viruses of about 5300 nucleotides, consisting of three open reading frames encoding the first two the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and nuclear phosphoprotein (NP1) and the third the viral capsid proteins 1 and 2 (VP1 and VP2). HBoV pathogenicity remains to be fully clarified mainly due to the lack of animal models for the difficulties in replicating the virus in in vitro cell cultures, and the fact that HBoV infection is frequently accompanied by at least another viral and/or bacterial respiratory and/or gastroenteric pathogen infection. Current diagnostic methods to support HBoV detection include polymerase chain reaction, real-time PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and enzyme immunoassay using recombinant VP2 or virus-like particle capsid proteins, although sequence-independent amplification techniques combined with next-generation sequencing platforms promise rapid and simultaneous detection of the pathogens in the future. This review presents the current knowledge on HBoV genotypes with emphasis on taxonomy, phylogenetic relationship and genomic analysis, biology, epidemiology, pathogenesis and diagnostic methods. The emerging discussion on HBoVs as true pathogen or innocent bystander is also emphasized.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.047082176,-0.040323245,0.029909752,0.011490323,0.01613352,-0.066957303,0.066677563,-0.02191425,0.021678675,0.067367784,-0.066156391,-0.034125848,0.082530194,-0.036264494,0.013714275,-0.079247818,-0.016946331,-0.037625591,0.009848813,0.024433558,0.029732439,0.043471239,-0.014263584,0.020714876,-0.059565328,0.002932561,-0.068863767,-0.002137606,-0.028906115,0.045797157
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease is rare in children: An update from Saudi Arabia,"AIM: To summarize the reported Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cases, the associated clinical presentations and the outcomes. METHODS: We searched the Saudi Ministry of Health website, the World Health Organization website, and the Flutracker website. We also searched MEDLINE and PubMed for the keywords: Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, MERS-CoV in combination with pediatric, children, childhood, infancy and pregnancy from the initial discovery of the virus in 2012 to 2016. The retrieved articles were also read to further find other articles. Relevant data were placed into an excel sheet and analyzed accordingly. Descriptive analytic statistics were used in the final analysis as deemed necessary. RESULTS: From June 2012 to April 19, 2016, there were a total of 31 pediatric MERS-CoV cases. Of these cases 13 (42%) were asymptomatic and the male to female ratio was 1.7:1. The mean age of patients was 9.8 ± 5.4 years. Twenty-five (80.6%) of the cases were reported from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The most common source of infection was household contact (10 of 15 with reported source) and 5 patients acquired infection within a health care facility. Using real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of pediatric patients revealed that 9 out of 552 (1.6%) was positive in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. CONCLUSION: Utilizing serology for MERS-CoV infection in Jordan and Saudi Arabia did not reveal any positive patients.

Clinical Impact of Mixed Respiratory Viral Infection in Children with Adenoviral Infection,"BACKGROUND: Although adenovirus (ADV) infection occurs steadily all year round in Korea and the identification of respiratory viral coinfections has been increasing following the introduction of multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction tests, the clinical impact of viral coinfection in children with ADV infection has rarely been reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of children diagnosed with ADV infection were retrospectively reviewed. The enrolled children were divided into two groups based on the identified respiratory viruses: ADV group and coinfection group. Clinical and laboratory parameters were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: In total, 105 children (60 males and 45 females) with a median age of 29 months (range: 0-131 months) diagnosed with an ADV infection were enrolled. Fever (99.0%) was by far the most frequent symptom, followed by respiratory (82.9%), and gastrointestinal (22.9%) symptoms. Upper and lower respiratory tract infections were diagnosed in 56 (53.3%), and 32 (30.5%) children, respectively. Five (4.8%) children received oxygen therapy, and no child died due to ADV infection. Coinfection was diagnosed in 32 (30.5%) children, with rhinovirus (46.9%), and respiratory syncytial virus (21.9%) being the most frequent. The proportions of children younger than 24 months (P <0.001), with underlying medical conditions (P = 0.020), and diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infection (P = 0.011) were significantly higher in the coinfection group than in the ADV group. In a multivariate analysis, only the younger age was significantly associated with coinfection (P <0.001). Although more children in the coinfection group received oxygen therapy (P = 0.029), the duration of fever and hospitalization was not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viral coinfection with ADV occurred more frequently in children younger than 24 months of age compared with children aged 24 months or older. Respiratory viral coinfection may increase the severity of ADV infection, however, appropriate therapy prevented prolonged hospitalization and poor prognosis due to coinfection.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.21717216,-0.114344179,-0.10528872,-0.031119769,0.029206003,-0.126736202,0.069518072,-0.059420856,0.07161072,-0.014184702,0.01118274,-0.044215985,-0.047687465,-0.038001799,0.004197325,0.014931419,-0.015480325,-0.005982712,0.01403686,0.009523424,-0.040667297,0.038397409,-0.005614121,0.007761896,-0.034066615,0.031706385,-0.005395821,-0.030143231,0.001612353,0.007397774
The Relationships between Respiratory Virus Infection and Aminotransferase in Children,"PURPOSE: We sought to examine the relationship between the clinical manifestations of nonspecific reactive hepatitis and respiratory virus infection in pediatric patients. METHODS: Patients admitted to the pediatric unit of Konyang University Hospital for lower respiratory tract disease between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2014 and who underwent reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests were examined. The patients were divided into those with increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and those with normal ALT or AST levels. Further, patients with increased ALT and AST levels were individually compared with patients in the normal group, and the blood test results were compared according to the type of respiratory virus. RESULTS: Patients with increased ALT or AST levels had one more day of hospital stay, on average, compared with patients in the normal group (5.3±3.1 days vs. 4.4±3.0 days, p=0.019). Patients in the increased ALT level group were younger and had a longer mean hospital stay, compared with patients in the normal group (p=0.022 and 0.003, respectively). The incidences of increased ALT or AST were the highest in adenovirus infections (6/24, 25.0%), followed by enterovirus (2/11, 18.2%) and respiratory syncytial virus A (21/131, 16.0%) infections. CONCLUSION: Nonspecific reactive hepatitis is more common among patients with adenovirus, enterovirus and respiratory syncytial virus infection, as well as among those infected at a younger age.

Development and application of multiplex PCR assays for detection of virus-induced respiratory disease complex in dogs,"Canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC) viruses have been detected in dogs with respiratory illness. Canine influenza virus (CIV), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAdV-2) and canine herpesvirus 1 (CaHV-1), are all associated with the CIRDC. To allow diagnosis, two conventional multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were developed to simultaneously identify four RNA and two DNA viruses associated with CIRDC. The two multiplex PCR assays were then validated on 102 respiratory samples collected from 51 dogs with respiratory illness by sensitivity and specificity determination in comparison to conventional simplex PCR and a rapid three-antigen test kit. All six viruses were detected in either individual or multiple infections. The developed multiplex PCR assays had a >87% sensitivity and 100% specificity compared to their simplex counterpart. Compared to the three-antigen test kit, the multiplex PCR assays yielded 100% sensitivity and more than 83% specificity for detection of CAdV-2 and CDV, but not for CIV. Therefore, the developed multiplex PCR modalities were able to simultaneously diagnose a panel of CIRDC viruses and facilitated specimen collection through being suitable for use of nasal or oral samples.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.131506169,0.020186383,0.173665538,0.103381308,0.035907006,-0.027211425,0.002724771,-0.024384414,-0.016322875,0.027635954,0.048834884,-0.011795955,0.029459743,-0.006761622,0.094101749,-0.080403664,0.024069037,-0.117109868,0.133726379,-0.083552356,0.215302222,0.080342368,-0.043359567,-0.036923923,0.201983205,-0.13313042,-0.097353645,-0.065149439,-0.076910488,0.00532259
Preparation of a cell line persistently infected with maedi/visna virus and production of viral antigens,"We attempted to prepare a cell line that produces maedi/visna virus (MVV) and is free of contamination by other viruses and mycoplasmas. Three cell lines, which originated from a sheep, goat and bat, were infected with MVV and passaged approximately every 5 days. The cultured cells were then subjected to polymerase chain reaction analysis for MVV provirus. As a result, a cell line persistently infected with MVV was established from ZZ-R cells, which originated from the fetal goat tongue.

"Development of Dual TaqMan Based One-Step rRT-PCR Assay Panel for Rapid and Accurate Diagnostic Test of MERS-CoV: A Novel Human Coronavirus, Ahead of Hajj Pilgrimage","BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses (CoVs) are large ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses causing primarily respiratory disease in humans. A novel human coronavirus, subsequently named middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was first reported in Saudi Arabia in September of 2012. With increasing numbers of infections and deaths from MERS-CoV, development of a rapid and reliable kit was crucial to prevent further spread of MERS-CoV. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we present two real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays for in-house rapid and sensitive diagnostic testing of MERS-CoV, detecting the regions upstream of the envelope gene (upE) and open reading frame (ORF) 1b, respectively, for initial screening and final confirmation of MERS-CoV infection, as recommended by the world health organization (WHO). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, acquiring patient samples was difficult; thus, according to WHO recommendations and standard protocols, we synthesized RNA sequences of upE and ORF1b genes as the template signatures and TaqMan based-diagnostic rRT-PCR assays were carried out using these synthetic genes for detection of MERS-CoV. In this research, we also inaugurated a cell-free system to transcribe these RNA sequences using the DNA templates synthesized. RESULTS: The upE and ORF1b based one-step rRT-PCR assays were optimized by testing several times via different synthetic RNAs, and validation results were highly successful. The sensitivity obtained for upE was fewer than ten copies of RNA template per reaction and for ORF1b was 50 or fewer copies per reaction. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the developed rRT-PCR assays are rapid, reliable, reproducible, specific, sensitive, and simple tools for detection of MERS-CoV. Finally, a kit consisting of two assay signatures and controls was assembled, which can be distributed to public health laboratories in Iran to support international MERS-CoV surveillance and public health response.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.014773244,0.350705371,-0.013730392,0.100838029,0.035382637,-0.032454751,-0.041161989,0.362036348,0.297870649,0.006335406,-0.006857233,-0.064439422,0.007577483,-0.041791322,-0.004156452,-0.044576537,0.006484064,-0.068308768,0.011264406,-0.088008425,-0.023888007,0.00969675,0.088134512,0.00880856,-0.048666118,-0.052020386,-0.01002536,-0.021854332,-0.000761321,0.027763907
Progress of small molecular inhibitors in the development of anti-influenza virus agents,"The influenza pandemic is a major threat to human health, and highly aggressive strains such as H1N1, H5N1 and H7N9 have emphasized the need for therapeutic strategies to combat these pathogens. Influenza anti-viral agents, especially active small molecular inhibitors play important roles in controlling pandemics while vaccines are developed. Currently, only a few drugs, which function as influenza neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors and M2 ion channel protein inhibitors, are approved in clinical. However, the acquired resistance against current anti-influenza drugs and the emerging mutations of influenza virus itself remain the major challenging unmet medical needs for influenza treatment. It is highly desirable to identify novel anti-influenza agents. This paper reviews the progress of small molecular inhibitors act as antiviral agents, which include hemagglutinin (HA) inhibitors, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors, NA inhibitors and M2 ion channel protein inhibitors etc. Moreover, we also summarize new, recently reported potential targets and discuss strategies for the development of new anti-influenza virus drugs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.018652352,-0.081026798,-0.049735522,0.196786101,-0.120361918,0.361086028,-0.020590492,-0.00535902,0.008838294,-0.004670217,0.010408363,0.066490361,0.058806085,-0.059367321,-0.010131752,-0.036424351,-0.018198971,0.142535309,0.040714885,0.025124014,0.010596021,0.032208263,-0.024181252,0.05608762,0.048541613,0.002262365,0.022504264,-0.054747173,0.157435529,0.074131182
SIRT7-dependent deacetylation of CDK9 activates RNA polymerase II transcription,"SIRT7 is an NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase that regulates cell growth and proliferation. Previous studies have shown that SIRT7 is required for RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription and pre-rRNA processing. Here, we took a proteomic approach to identify novel molecular targets and characterize the role of SIRT7 in non-nucleolar processes. We show that SIRT7 interacts with numerous proteins involved in transcriptional regulation and RNA metabolism, the majority of interactions requiring ongoing transcription. In addition to its role in Pol I transcription, we found that SIRT7 also regulates transcription of snoRNAs and mRNAs. Mechanistically, SIRT7 promotes the release of P-TEFb from the inactive 7SK snRNP complex and deacetylates CDK9, a subunit of the elongation factor P-TEFb, which activates transcription by phosphorylating serine 2 within the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II.

Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin as a potential novel biomarker for ventilator-associated lung injury,"Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a 25-kDa protein of the lipocalin superfamily and its presence was initially observed in activated neutrophils. It has previously been demonstrated that the expression of NGAL is markedly increased in stimulated epithelia, and is important in the innate immunological response to various pathophysiological conditions, including infection, cancer, inflammation and kidney injury. The present study constructed a ventilator-associated lung injury model in mice. NGAL mRNA and protein expression levels in lung tissue were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. In addition, NGAL protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum were measured via western blotting. The results of the present study suggested that NGAL expression increased under all mechanical ventilation treatments. The increase was most prominent in the high peak inflation pressure and high-volume mechanical ventilation groups, where there was the greatest extent of lung injury. In addition, NGAL expression increased in a time-dependent manner under high-volume mechanical ventilation, consistent with the degree of lung injury. These findings suggested that NGAL may serve as a potential novel biomarker in ventilator-associated lung injury.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.046604469,-0.01804772,-0.013162351,-0.149534656,-0.078222904,0.03334027,0.006998974,-0.03302499,0.030303432,-0.040025581,-0.066672442,-0.029192987,-0.017368956,0.066333176,-0.034904154,-0.010856377,0.009769923,-0.054362646,-0.036964517,-0.040657343,0.038260007,-0.031352052,0.01465602,-0.007496151,-0.016695043,0.006461788,0.002573466,-0.002550525,0.016817427,-0.05640243
"Etiology, Seasonality, and Clinical Features of Viral Respiratory Tract Infections in Children Hospitalized With Acute Bronchiolitis: A Single-Center Study","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the viral frequency, seasonality, and clinical and demographic features of patients hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis. A cross-sectional, descriptive study was performed in 316 infants younger than 2 years of age who were hospitalized for acute viral bronchiolitis. Respiratory tract infection agents were investigated with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 316 infants were included in this study. Of the 316 infants, at least one respiratory tract pathogen was detected in 75% (237/316). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common virus identified in 127 infants (40.1%) followed by rhinovirus (n = 78, 24.6%).

A novel cause of chronic viral meningoencephalitis: Cache Valley virus,"OBJECTIVE: Immunodeficient patients are particularly vulnerable to neuroinvasive infections that can be challenging to diagnose. Metagenomic next generation sequencing can identify unusual or novel microbes and is therefore well suited for investigating the etiology of chronic meningoencephalitis in immunodeficient patients. METHODS: We present the case of a 34‐year‐old man with X‐linked agammaglobulinemia from Australia suffering from 3 years of meningoencephalitis that defied an etiologic diagnosis despite extensive conventional testing, including a brain biopsy. Metagenomic next generation sequencing of his cerebrospinal fluid and brain biopsy tissue was performed to identify a causative pathogen. RESULTS: Sequences aligning to multiple Cache Valley virus genes were identified via metagenomic next generation sequencing. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry subsequently confirmed the presence of Cache Valley virus in the brain biopsy tissue. INTERPRETATION: Cache Valley virus, a mosquito‐borne orthobunyavirus, has only been identified in 3 immunocompetent North American patients with acute neuroinvasive disease. The reported severity ranges from a self‐limiting meningitis to a rapidly fatal meningoencephalitis with multiorgan failure. The virus has never been known to cause a chronic systemic or neurologic infection in humans. Cache Valley virus has also never previously been detected on the Australian continent. Our research subject traveled to North and South Carolina and Michigan in the weeks prior to the onset of his illness. This report demonstrates that metagenomic next generation sequencing allows for unbiased pathogen identification, the early detection of emerging viruses as they spread to new locales, and the discovery of novel disease phenotypes.

Performance Evaluation of the PowerChek MERS (upE & ORF1a) Real-Time PCR Kit for the Detection of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus RNA,"BACKGROUND: Molecular detection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) using real-time reverse transcription (rRT)-PCR assays is the method of choice for diagnosis of MERS. We evaluated the performance of the PowerChek MERS (upE & ORF1a) real-time PCR Kit (PowerChek MERS assay; Kogene Biotech, Korea) a one-step rRT-PCR assay for the qualitative detection of MERS-CoV. METHODS: We evaluated PowerChek MERS assay performance in comparison with nested RT-PCR and sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and N genes. To evaluate diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, 100 clinical specimens (50 positive and 50 negative for MERS-CoV) were simultaneously tested by using the PowerChek MERS and sequencing assays. Assay performance, including limit of detection and precision, was evaluated in vitro by using MERS-CoV RNA transcripts. Analytical specificity was evaluated with a diverse collection of 16 respiratory virus–positive clinical specimens and 14 respiratory bacterial isolates. RESULTS: The 95% limits of detection of the PowerChek MERS assay for the upE and the open rading frame (ORF)1a were 16.2 copies/µL and 8.2 copies/µL, respectively. No cross-reactivity was observed. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the PowerChek MERS assay were both 100% (95% confidence interval, 91.1–100%). CONCLUSIONS: The PowerChek MERS assay is a straightforward and accurate assay for detecting MERS-CoV RNA. The assay will be a useful tool for the rapid diagnosis of MERS and could prove especially important for MERS outbreak control.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.053835561,0.2968149,0.05840409,0.084577562,-0.019459118,-0.060944874,-0.041478538,0.400367204,0.302783579,-0.034238349,0.039499986,-0.00568147,-0.083027048,0.000261925,-0.034727752,-0.034045369,0.021992347,-0.096581242,0.044765825,-0.056232775,-0.014196225,0.020198604,0.11482202,0.041612694,-0.042551704,-0.043957301,-0.00179052,-0.042327356,-0.021258614,0.013196072

MERS-CoV Infection in a Pregnant Woman in Korea,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a lethal respiratory disease — caused by MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which was first identified in 2012. Especially, pregnant women can be expected as highly vulnerable candidates for this viral infection. In May 2015, this virus was spread in Korea and a pregnant woman was confirmed with positive result of MERS-CoV polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Her condition was improved only with conservative treatment. After a full recovery of MERS, the patient manifested abrupt vaginal bleeding with rupture of membrane. Under an impression of placenta abruption, an emergent cesarean section was performed. Our team performed many laboratory tests related to MERS-CoV and all results were negative.

Prevalence of Respiratory Viral Infections in Korean Adult Asthmatics With Acute Exacerbations: Comparison With Those With Stable State,"PURPOSE: Viral infections are involved in ~50% of exacerbations among Caucasian adult asthmatics. However, there have been few reports on the causative virus of exacerbations in Korean adult asthmatics. Thus, we compared frequencies and types of viruses between lower respiratory tract illnesses (LRTIs) with exacerbations (exacerbated LRTIs) and those without exacerbations (stable LRTIs) to evaluate contribution of respiratory viruses to exacerbations. METHODS: Viral RNA was extracted from sputum using the Viral Gene-spin™ Kit. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect adenovirus (ADV), metapneumovirus (MPV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1/2/3, influenza virus (IFV) A, IFV B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A/B, and rhinovirus (RV) A. RESULTS: Among the 259 patients, 210 underwent a single sputum examination, and the remaining 49 underwent 2 to 4 sputum examinations. Virus was detected in 68 of the 259 exacerbated episodes and in 11 of the 64 stable episodes. Among the exacerbated episodes, RV was the most frequently detected virus, followed by influenza A, parainfluenza, RSV A/B, and ADV. Among the 11 stable episodes, RV was most frequently detected. Detection rates of these viruses did not differ between the 2 groups (P>0.05). Thirty-five patients underwent the virus examination at 2 episodes of exacerbation, while 14 patients underwent at each time of exacerbated and stable episodes. Virus detection rate at the second examination was significantly higher in cases with 2 exacerbation episodes than in those with initial exacerbation and sequential stable episodes (P=0.003). A seasonal pattern was noted in the detection rates of RV (September to December), IFV (January to April), PIV (May to September), and RSV A/B (September to April). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses were identified in approximately 20% of LRTI irrespective of the presence of asthma exacerbation. RV and IFV A/B were most frequently detected. A group of patients experienced frequent viral infections followed by asthma exacerbations.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.170538757,-0.103769322,-0.05619165,0.031607889,0.009056102,-0.070109551,0.002487644,-0.019706689,-0.027956422,0.029132813,-0.014431161,-0.078216905,-0.046621318,0.030126229,0.003802145,-0.025089565,0.048129165,-0.056949377,0.040490502,-0.005390796,0.024370782,-0.183392533,-0.037183197,0.118184152,0.019947969,0.022517958,0.072176569,0.049371557,0.006399503,0.123822392
Elucidation of Bacterial Pneumonia-Causing Pathogens in Patients with Respiratory Viral Infection,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial pneumonia occurring after respiratory viral infection is common. However, the predominant bacterial species causing pneumonia secondary to respiratory viral infections other than influenza remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to know whether the pathogens causing post-viral bacterial pneumonia vary according to the type of respiratory virus. METHODS: Study subjects were 5,298 patients, who underwent multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction for simultaneous detection of respiratory viruses, among who visited the emergency department or outpatient clinic with respiratory symptoms at Ulsan University Hospital between April 2013 and March 2016. The patients' medical records were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 251 clinically significant bacteria were identified in 233 patients with post-viral bacterial pneumonia. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the most frequent bacterium in patients aged <16 years, regardless of the preceding virus type (p=0.630). In patients aged ≥16 years, the isolated bacteria varied according to the preceding virus type. The major results were as follows (p<0.001): pneumonia in patients with influenza virus (type A/B), rhinovirus, and human metapneumovirus infections was caused by similar bacteria, and the findings indicated that Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia was very common in these patients. In contrast, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus infections were associated with pneumonia caused by gram-negative bacteria. CONCLUSION: The pathogens causing post-viral bacterial pneumonia vary according to the type of preceding respiratory virus. This information could help in selecting empirical antibiotics in patients with post-viral pneumonia.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.261777146,-0.108762826,-0.139694905,-0.007332748,-0.058901284,-0.035554703,-0.050756486,0.10225876,-0.179613623,0.141656876,-0.065069836,-0.032407717,0.051921965,0.043662583,-0.026210706,-0.061860008,0.014530244,0.014067318,-0.021951721,0.134583833,0.028522939,0.071324564,0.096155197,0.061801544,0.06980189,0.018811453,0.012097437,0.030027459,0.000659974,-0.042681439
Effect of Rapid Molecular Diagnostic Testing and Antimicrobial Stewardship on Antimicrobial Therapy of Respiratory Infections,"BACKGROUND: Rapid molecular methods have created new opportunities for the clinical microbiology laboratory to affect patient care in the areas of initial diagnosis and therapy. Rapid diagnostic tests provide collaborative opportunities for antimicrobial stewardship Teams (AST) to improve patient outcomes and decrease antimicrobial use. In January of 2017 our institution initiated use of a FDA approved multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Respiratory Panel. The objective of this evaluation was to assess the clinical impact along with procalcitonin (PCT) on quality of patient care when used in conjunction with antimicrobial stewardship. METHODS: Molecular testing was performed using the BioFire FilmArray® Respiratory Panel [RP] (BioMerieux). The medical staff was encouraged to order an Influenza/RSV PCR test prior to ordering the full RP. The results of RP and PCT were available the same day as ordered. AST recommended the RP as part of its intervention on several patients and provided advice based on results. RESULTS: From January-April the results of 81 tests for the respiratory panel were evaluated. Of these 30 were positive (+) for virus (most common-Human Metapneumovirus [HMV]-13, Coronavirus-7). PCT (ng/mL) results were available on 69. Most common final diagnosis: Pneumonia-31; AECOPD-16. Effect on duration of antimicrobial therapy (ABX) and hospital length of stay (LOS): CONCLUSION: The results of the RP led to a decrease in ABX duration, which was most profound in the patients for whom AST intervened. LOS was also reduced. Utilization of RP and PCT facilitated better ABX use. DISCLOSURES: T. M.

Comparison of cytokine expression profiles in infants with a rhinovirus induced lower respiratory tract infection with or without wheezing: a comparison with respiratory syncytial virus,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether infants with rhinovirus (RV) infection-induced wheezing and those with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection-induced wheezing have different cytokine profiles in the acute stage. METHODS: Of the infants with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) between September 2011 and May 2012, 88 were confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and hospitalized. Systemic interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and Treg-type cytokine (IL-10) responses were examined with multiplex assay using acute phase serum samples. RESULTS: Of the 88 patients, 38 had an RV infection (RV group) and 50 had an RSV infection (RSV group). In the RV group, the IFN-γ and IL-10 concentrations were higher in the patients with than in the patients without wheezing (P=0.022 and P=0.007, respectively). In the RSV group, the differences in IFN-γ and IL-10 concentrations did not reach statistical significance between the patients with and the patients without wheezing (P=0.105 and P=0.965, respectively). The IFN-γ and IL-10 concentrations were not significantly different between the RV group with wheezing and the RSV group with wheezing (P=0.155 and P=0.801, respectively), in contrast to the significant difference between the RV group without wheezing and the RSV group without wheezing (P=0.019 and P=0.035, respectively). CONCLUSION: In comparison with RSV-induced LRTI, RV-induced LRTI combined with wheezing showed similar IFN-γ and IL-10 levels, which may have an important regulatory function.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.1090378,-0.069371015,-0.052379071,-0.121347907,-0.040357318,-0.061861981,0.036671401,-0.065161121,0.045056581,-0.091838081,-0.010608464,-0.083110629,-0.137485547,0.08262069,-0.093761011,0.016844173,0.020903134,0.009337986,0.013563212,-0.022466,0.038955147,-0.20245748,0.03156988,0.002728455,0.00174836,-0.148421545,0.183733527,0.083990716,-0.058000732,0.055374645

"Stimulation of reverse transcriptase generated cDNAs with specific indels by template RNA structure: retrotransposon, dNTP balance, RT-reagent usage","RNA dependent DNA-polymerases, reverse transcriptases, are key enzymes for retroviruses and retroelements. Their fidelity, including indel generation, is significant for their use as reagents including for deep sequencing. Here, we report that certain RNA template structures and G-rich sequences, ahead of diverse reverse transcriptases can be strong stimulators for slippage at slippage-prone template motif sequence 3′ of such ‘slippage-stimulatory’ structures. Where slippage is stimulated, the resulting products have one or more additional base(s) compared to the corresponding template motif. Such structures also inhibit slippage-mediated base omission which can be more frequent in the absence of a relevant stem–loop. Slippage directionality, base insertion and omission, is sensitive to the relative concentration ratio of dNTPs specified by the RNA template slippage-prone sequence and its 5′ adjacent base. The retrotransposon-derived enzyme TGIRT exhibits more slippage in vitro than the retroviral enzymes tested including that from HIV. Structure-mediated slippage may be exhibited by other polymerases and enrich gene expression. A cassette from Drosophila retrotransposon Dme1_chrX_2630566, a candidate for utilizing slippage for its GagPol synthesis, exhibits strong slippage in vitro. Given the widespread occurrence and importance of retrotransposons, systematic studies to reveal the extent of their functional utilization of RT slippage are merited.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.102921583,-0.025743332,0.007305373,-0.016965994,-0.019670101,-0.016889201,0.008400582,0.015595302,-0.012005556,-0.025928928,-0.000380039,0.037118756,-0.024837389,-0.03988615,-0.018443454,0.025534046,-0.000855353,-0.00223373,-0.046401871,-0.040605114,0.000992309,-0.02599668,-0.027394399,0.016090262,-0.019305853,-0.031712058,-0.03255366,0.025205969,0.042470888,-0.034627119
Isolation and characterization of a new porcine epidemic diarrhea virus variant that occurred in Korea in 2014,"Outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) have resulted in significant economic losses in the swine industry, and another PED outbreak occurred in 2014 in Korea. Isolating and culturing PED virus (PEDV) allow investigations into its pathogenesis and the development of vaccines and diagnostic assays. In this study, we successfully isolated two PEDV isolates (QIAP1401 and QIAP1402) from naturally infected piglets at Jeju-do, Korea. Viral propagation was confirmed in Vero cells based on cytopathic effect, immunofluorescence assay, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and electron microscopic analyses. The QIAP401 isolate propagated well in Vero cells for 70 passages, with titers of 10(6.5) to 10(7.0) 50% tissue culture infectious dose/mL, which increased gradually with passaging. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the QIAP1401 isolate were determined and compared with those of other PEDV isolates. The QIAP1401 isolate was determined to be closely related to the USA/Minnesota271/2014 strain (> 99.9% nucleotide similarity) that was isolated in the USA in 2014. Phylogenetic analysis based on several PEDV genes suggested that a new PEDV variant is circulating in the Korean swine industry, with 93.08% similarity to the SM98 strain isolated in 1998. In addition, the QIAP1401 strain showed strong virulence in 3-day-old piglets and 11-week-old growing pigs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.048358343,0.006468753,0.093987655,-0.143337186,0.077329836,0.085548719,-0.047041403,-0.048205952,0.029567436,0.013667543,0.027199262,0.095124389,-0.165292911,0.017460569,0.259683131,-0.207846464,-0.075058146,0.062084408,-0.044548743,0.174296972,-0.127715498,-0.079919118,0.121738142,-0.01538076,-0.085342442,-0.013826321,-0.003382439,0.040750503,-0.00552805,0.018078971
"Incidence, Etiology, and Outcomes of Community-Acquired Pneumonia: A Population-Based Study","BACKGROUND: The microbial etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is often unclear in clinical practice, and previous studies have produced variable results. Population-based studies examining etiology and incidence are lacking. This study examined the incidence and etiology of CAP requiring hospitalization in a population-based cohort as well as risk factors and outcomes for specific etiologies. METHODS: Consecutive admissions due to CAP in Reykjavik, Iceland were studied. Etiologic testing was performed with cultures, urine-antigen detection, and polymerase chain reaction analysis of airway samples. Outcomes were length of stay, intensive care unit admission, assisted ventilation, and mortality. RESULTS: The inclusion rate was 95%. The incidence of CAP requiring hospitalization was 20.6 cases per 10000 adults/year. A potential pathogen was detected in 52% (164 of 310) of admissions and in 74% (43 of 58) with complete sample sets. Streptococcuspneumoniae was the most common pathogen (61 of 310, 20%; incidence: 4.1/10000). Viruses were identified in 15% (47 of 310; incidence: 3.1/10000), Mycoplasmapneumoniae were identified in 12% (36 of 310; incidence: 2.4/10000), and multiple pathogens were identified in 10% (30 of 310; incidence: 2.0/10000). Recent antimicrobial therapy was associated with increased detection of M pneumoniae (P < .001), whereas a lack of recent antimicrobial therapy was associated with increased detection of S pneumoniae (P = .02). Symptoms and outcomes were similar irrespective of microbial etiology. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococci, M pneumoniae, and viruses are the most common pathogens associated with CAP requiring hospital admission, and they all have a similar incidence that increases with age. Symptoms do not correlate with specific agents, and outcomes are similar irrespective of pathogens identified.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.133773936,-0.067724906,-0.038498407,-0.067328299,-0.03426892,-0.044959318,0.015878746,0.056553373,-0.116679084,0.055985732,-0.058434708,-0.00012208,-0.012678513,-0.099666984,-0.060243151,-0.006890479,-0.030612751,-0.02289088,-0.041489519,0.042196201,-0.031315726,0.077977879,0.16167717,0.052160204,0.111389044,-0.094026271,0.026089651,0.051252478,0.097171026,0.006818427
Viral and Bacterial Etiologies of Acute Respiratory Infections Among Children Under 5 Years in Senegal,"Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are the leading cause of infectious disease–related morbidity, hospitalization, and morbidity among children worldwide. This study aimed to assess the viral and bacterial causes of ARI morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years in Senegal.

Low-fidelity Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus polymerase mutants to improve live-attenuated vaccine safety and efficacy,"During RNA virus replication, there is the potential to incorporate mutations that affect virulence or pathogenesis. For live-attenuated vaccines, this has implications for stability, as replication may result in mutations that either restore the wild-type phenotype via reversion or compensate for the attenuating mutations by increasing virulence (pseudoreversion). Recent studies have demonstrated that altering the mutation rate of an RNA virus is an effective attenuation tool. To validate the safety of low-fidelity mutations to increase vaccine attenuation, several mutations in the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) were tested in the live-attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus vaccine strain, TC-83. Next generation sequencing after passage in the presence of mutagens revealed a mutant containing three mutations in the RdRp, TC-83 3x, to have decreased replication fidelity, while a second mutant, TC-83 4x displayed no change in fidelity, but shared many phenotypic characteristics with TC-83 3x. Both mutants exhibited increased, albeit inconsistent attenuation in an infant mouse model, as well as increased immunogenicity and complete protection against lethal challenge of an adult murine model compared with the parent TC-83. During serial passaging in a highly permissive model, the mutants increased in virulence but remained less virulent than the parent TC-83. These results suggest that the incorporation of low-fidelity mutations into the RdRp of live-attenuated vaccines for RNA viruses can confer increased immunogenicity whilst showing some evidence of increased attenuation. However, while in theory such constructs may result in more effective vaccines, the instability of the vaccine phenotype decreases the likelihood of this being an effective vaccine strategy.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.145967306,-0.050388948,-0.050388371,0.045668072,-0.02590722,0.026750196,0.055779803,0.009313691,-0.02809834,0.062785783,0.126645504,0.09654275,-0.116240666,-0.036652305,0.008881289,0.02783725,-0.06419437,-0.044564935,-0.09036083,-0.011854849,0.152118173,-0.098895873,0.096386494,0.102302395,-0.017158882,0.060718771,0.043323664,-0.058220352,-0.088528314,-0.094032978
Discrimination of Kawasaki disease with concomitant adenoviral detection differentiating from isolated adenoviral infection,"PURPOSE: Human adenovirus infection mimics Kawasaki disease (KD) but can be detected in KD patients. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical differences between KD with adenovirus infection and only adenoviral infection and to identify biomarkers for prediction of adenovirus-positive KD from isolated adenoviral infection. METHODS: A total of 147 patients with isolated adenovirus were identified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, 11 patients having KD with adenovirus, who were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy during the acute phase of KD were also evaluated. RESULTS: Compared with the adenoviral infection group, the KD with adenovirus group was significantly associated with frequent lip and tongue changes, skin rash and changes in the extremities. In the laboratory parameters, higher C-reactive protein (CRP) level and presence of hypoalbuminemia and sterile pyuria were significantly associated with the KD group. In the multivariate analysis, lip and tongue changes (odds ratio [OR], 1.416; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.151–1.741; P=0.001), high CRP level (OR, 1.039; 95% CI 1.743–1.454; P= 0.021) and sterile pyuria (OR 1.052; 95% CI 0.861–1.286; P=0.041) were the significant predictive factors of KD. In addition, the cutoff CRP level related to KD with adenoviral detection was 56 mg/L, with a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 75.9%. CONCLUSION: Lip and tongue changes, higher serum CRP level and sterile pyuria were significantly correlated with adenovirus-positive KD.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.063430871,-0.038946306,-0.020013776,-0.115961429,-0.007366343,-0.017680746,0.004404819,0.004925847,-0.056810245,-0.039807404,-0.025634907,0.041067165,-0.031255154,0.021840749,-0.043910259,0.026292373,-0.024870999,-0.045727309,0.01220855,-0.04276149,-0.042521099,0.003876922,-0.013382829,0.046709406,-0.041105372,-0.008367015,-0.00433307,-0.093815841,-0.081756103,-0.047973423
"Cameroonian fruit bats harbor divergent viruses, including rotavirus H, bastroviruses, and picobirnaviruses using an alternative genetic code","Most human emerging infectious diseases originate from wildlife and bats are a major reservoir of viruses, a few of which have been highly pathogenic to humans. In some regions of Cameroon, bats are hunted and eaten as a delicacy. This close proximity between human and bats provides ample opportunity for zoonotic events. To elucidate the viral diversity of Cameroonian fruit bats, we collected and metagenomically screened eighty-seven fecal samples of Eidolon helvum and Epomophorus gambianus fruit bats. The results showed a plethora of known and novel viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of the eleven gene segments of the first complete bat rotavirus H genome, showed clearly separated clusters of human, porcine, and bat rotavirus H strains, not indicating any recent interspecies transmission events. Additionally, we identified and analyzed a bat bastrovirus genome (a novel group of recently described viruses, related to astroviruses and hepatitis E viruses), confirming their recombinant nature, and provide further evidence of additional recombination events among bat bastroviruses. Interestingly, picobirnavirus-like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene segments were identified using an alternative mitochondrial genetic code, and further principal component analyses suggested that they may have a similar lifestyle to mitoviruses, a group of virus-like elements known to infect the mitochondria of fungi. Although identified bat coronavirus, parvovirus, and cyclovirus strains belong to established genera, most of the identified partitiviruses and densoviruses constitute putative novel genera in their respective families. Finally, the results of the phage community analyses of these bats indicate a very diverse geographically distinct bat phage population, probably reflecting different diets and gut bacterial ecosystems.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.097803793,0.035136623,-0.02962226,0.008212351,0.385984175,0.143666011,0.28357247,0.092154305,-0.165965834,-0.032545196,-0.126740762,-0.123912487,-0.042032884,0.07166114,-0.032729405,0.024967064,0.01268157,0.058676429,0.006671859,0.008497203,-0.009732956,0.013591755,-0.022445491,-0.037985744,0.01744682,0.013033093,0.01910493,-0.013228238,-0.041610049,0.012756317
Nucleosides for the treatment of respiratory RNA virus infections,"Influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronaviruses, and rhinoviruses are among the most common viruses causing mild seasonal colds. These RNA viruses can also cause lower respiratory tract infections leading to bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Young children, the elderly, and patients with compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or immune systems are at greatest risk for serious disease associated with these RNA virus respiratory infections. In addition, swine and avian influenza viruses, together with severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, represent significant pandemic threats to the general population. In this review, we describe the current medical need resulting from respiratory infections caused by RNA viruses, which justifies drug discovery efforts to identify new therapeutic agents. The RNA polymerase of respiratory viruses represents an attractive target for nucleoside and nucleotide analogs acting as inhibitors of RNA chain synthesis. Here, we present the molecular, biochemical, and structural fundamentals of the polymerase of the four major families of RNA respiratory viruses: Orthomyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae/Paramyxoviridae, Coronaviridae, and Picornaviridae. We summarize past and current efforts to develop nucleoside and nucleotide analogs as antiviral agents against respiratory virus infections. This includes molecules with very broad antiviral spectrum such as ribavirin and T-705 (favipiravir), and others targeting more specifically one or a few virus families. Recent advances in our understanding of the structure(s) and function(s) of respiratory virus polymerases will likely support the discovery and development of novel nucleoside analogs.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.080738739,-0.095651459,-0.155307831,0.261386431,0.008560265,0.023744928,0.085657062,0.011212727,0.043052287,0.138262267,0.046200655,-0.014106196,0.095419687,-0.023840897,0.064056117,-0.060526101,-0.00690701,0.063869016,0.074511227,0.078616422,0.015259611,-0.063852381,-0.047613862,0.098181561,0.017819661,-0.021615678,-0.038532417,-0.039882183,0.072516134,-0.11309693
Nucleoside analogs as a rich source of antiviral agents active against arthropod-borne flaviviruses,"Nucleoside analogs represent the largest class of small molecule-based antivirals, which currently form the backbone of chemotherapy of chronic infections caused by HIV, hepatitis B or C viruses, and herpes viruses. High antiviral potency and favorable pharmacokinetics parameters make some nucleoside analogs suitable also for the treatment of acute infections caused by other medically important RNA and DNA viruses. This review summarizes available information on antiviral research of nucleoside analogs against arthropod-borne members of the genus Flavivirus within the family Flaviviridae, being primarily focused on description of nucleoside inhibitors of flaviviral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, methyltransferase, and helicase/NTPase. Inhibitors of intracellular nucleoside synthesis and newly discovered nucleoside derivatives with high antiflavivirus potency, whose modes of action are currently not completely understood, have drawn attention.

Identifying agents triggering bronchiolitis in the State of Qatar,"BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis is considered as the most frequent lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children. This disorder is marked by acute inflammation, edema, damage of epithelial cells lining small airways, and augmentation of mucus production. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to identify agents triggering bronchiolitis in the State of Qatar. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective study was performed at Hamad Medical Corporation, the only tertiary and academic medical center in the State of Qatar. The study included infants and young children aged 0–24 months who were admitted to our pediatric ward with diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis (2010–2012) RESULTS: Eight hundred thirty-five infants and young children met the study inclusion criteria with mean age at diagnosis of 3.61±3.56 months. Respiratory virus real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on 769 (92.0%) of the participants. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was positive in 352 (45.7%) children admitted with clinical bronchiolitis. In addition, no viruses were identified in 142 (18.4%) of those admitted, and respiratory viruses other RSV were found in 275 (35.7%) of the children. Our investigations and observations show that there has been a steady and periodic seasonal variation in the RSV rate over the study period. A seasonal trend for the RSV (detected by respiratory virus real-time polymerase chain reaction) rate was evident, showing annual peaks in the months of October, November, December, and January, with a significant test for seasonality (test statistics [T]=3.15, P=0.009). CONCLUSION: In countries with desert hot weather, bronchiolitis might affect children throughout the year. Our results suggest that the combination of date regarding uninterrupted RSV seasonality can provide guidance for health care planning and application of RSV prevention scheme, such as extending the palivizumab immunoglobulin series.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.245951321,-0.126839469,-0.084130873,0.048983928,0.028999828,-0.124535175,0.06605315,-0.12719499,0.166688338,-0.067245979,0.033418818,-0.083400811,-0.129609124,-0.090798299,-0.012013095,0.044520462,-0.008589598,0.016599155,0.02179089,-0.016634648,-0.02228545,-0.05418171,0.001805708,-0.055810225,0.044792635,-0.070710447,0.164970086,0.083143857,-0.024592363,0.006707978
Community-Acquired Respiratory Paramyxovirus Infection After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: A Single-Center Experience,"BACKGROUND: Paramyxoviruses include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), and human metapneumovirus (MPV), which may cause significant respiratory tract infectious disease (RTID) and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, clinical data regarding frequency and outcome are scarce. METHODS: We identified all paramyxovirus RTIDs in allogeneic HCT recipients diagnosed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction between 2010 and 2014. Baseline characteristics of patients, treatment, and outcome of each episode were analyzed; ie, moderate, severe, and very severe immunodeficiency (verySID) according to HCT ≤6 months, T- or B-cell depletion ≤3 months, graft-versus-host disease, neutropenia, lymphopenia, or hypo-gammaglobulinemia. RESULTS: One hundred three RTID episodes in 66 patients were identified (PIV 47% [48 of 103], RSV 32% [33 of 103], MPV 21% [22 of 103]). Episodes occurred in 85% (87 of 103) at >100 days post-HCT. Lower RTID accounted for 36% (37 of 103). Thirty-nine percent (40 of 103) of RTID episodes required hospitalization and more frequently affected patients with lower RTID. Six percent progressed from upper to lower RTID. Overall mortality was 6% and did not differ between paramyxoviruses. Sixty-one percent (63 of 103) of episodes occurred in patients with SID, and 20.2% (19 of 63) of episodes occurred in patients with verySID. Oral ribavirin plus intravenous immunoglobulin was administered in 38% (39 of 103) of RTIDs, preferably for RSV or MPV (P ≤ .001) and for SID patients (P = .001). Patients with verySID frequently progressed to lower RTID (P = .075), required intensive care unit transfer, and showed higher mortality. CONCLUSION: Paramyxovirus RTID remains a major concern in allogeneic HCT patients fulfilling SID and verySID, emphasizing that efficacious and safe antiviral treatments are urgently needed.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.140011935,-0.057605153,-0.086435143,-0.076539545,-0.034993904,-0.046737018,-0.003970077,0.027735527,-0.043393092,0.010355822,-0.021545419,0.001580805,-0.042425429,0.042449406,-0.041732072,0.006129014,0.012557612,0.059342556,0.015975594,0.033104489,0.051101508,-0.125211378,-0.028488979,-0.003253233,0.03933189,-0.064738506,0.078029257,0.018706671,-0.053229541,0.008031448
Juglanin ameliorates UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis via anti-inflammatory and proapoptotic effects in vivo and in vitro,"Ultraviolet (UV) radiation induces skin injury, and is associated with the development and formation of melanoma, which is a highly lethal form of skin cancer. Juglanin is a natural product, which is predominantly extracted from Polygonum aviculare, and is considered a functional component among its various compounds. Juglanin has been reported to exert marked protective effects in various diseases via the inhibition of inflammation and tumor cell growth. The present study aimed to explore the effects of juglanin on human skin cancer induced by UV and to reveal the underlying molecular mechanism. In the present study, immunohistochemical analysis, western blot analysis, RT-qPCR analysis and flow cytometry assays were mainly used in vivo and/or in vitro. The results indicated that in mice, UVB exposure increased susceptibility to carcinogens, and accelerated disease pathogenesis. Conversely, juglanin was able to ameliorate this condition via inhibition of inflammation, suppression of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis via p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) blockage, nuclear factor (NF)-κB inactivation and caspase stimulation in vivo. In addition, in vitro, the present study demonstrated that treatment of UVB-stimulated B16F10 melanoma cells with juglanin resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability, as well as increased apoptosis via the upregulation of caspase expression and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. In addition, juglanin markedly attenuated p38/JNK signaling, inactivated the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway and suppressed UVB-induced NF-κB activation. Taken together, these results indicated the possibility of applying juglanin in combination with UVB as a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing skin cancer.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.091559054,-0.027293488,0.004599592,-0.122673748,-0.117544956,0.072994588,0.048789264,-0.053680685,0.078449293,-0.03298093,-0.069427451,-0.013765405,-0.013909091,0.092852411,-0.023787265,0.013789459,0.002784742,-0.034070339,-0.011634452,-0.035039187,0.047597253,-0.018936265,0.030647121,-0.004872611,0.02737407,0.026166472,-0.011028563,0.041488321,0.047447573,-0.090901296
Viral Fitness Correlates with the Magnitude and Direction of the Perturbation Induced in the Host’s Transcriptome: The Tobacco Etch Potyvirus—Tobacco Case Study,"Determining the fitness of viral genotypes has become a standard practice in virology as it is essential to evaluate their evolutionary potential. Darwinian fitness, defined as the advantage of a given genotype with respect to a reference one, is a complex property that captures, in a single figure, differences in performance at every stage of viral infection. To what extent does viral fitness result from specific molecular interactions with host factors and regulatory networks during infection? Can we identify host genes in functional classes whose expression depends on viral fitness? Here, we compared the transcriptomes of tobacco plants infected with seven genotypes of tobacco etch potyvirus that differ in fitness. We found that the larger the fitness differences among genotypes, the more dissimilar the transcriptomic profiles are. Consistently, two different mutations, one in the viral RNA polymerase and another in the viral suppressor of RNA silencing, resulted in significantly similar gene expression profiles. Moreover, we identified host genes whose expression showed a significant correlation, positive or negative, with the virus' fitness. Differentially expressed genes which were positively correlated with viral fitness activate hormone- and RNA silencing-mediated pathways of plant defense. In contrast, those that were negatively correlated with fitness affect metabolism, reducing growth, and development. Overall, these results reveal the high information content of viral fitness and suggest its potential use to predict differences in genomic profiles of infected hosts.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.095761288,-0.047207745,-0.019799332,-0.027681319,-0.043336873,0.01627982,0.05971913,-0.009539844,0.010325059,0.018972726,-0.022956027,-0.026709281,-0.005954916,0.065654073,-0.01100815,-0.000992349,-0.028232074,-0.044710302,-0.063898375,-0.015645096,0.019745378,0.00137947,-0.027812683,0.057898622,-0.09344239,-0.056726509,0.076820532,-0.042849296,0.000804141,-0.002498022

Clinical and laboratory profiles of hospitalized children with acute respiratory virus infection,"PURPOSE: Despite the availability of molecular methods, identification of the causative virus in children with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) has proven difficult as the same viruses are often detected in asymptomatic children. METHODS: Multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays were performed to detect 15 common respiratory viruses in children under 15 years of age who were hospitalized with ARI between January 2013 and December 2015. Viral epidemiology and clinical profiles of single virus infections were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 3,505 patients, viruses were identified in 2,424 (69.1%), with the assay revealing a single virus in 1,747 cases (49.8%). While major pathogens in single virus-positive cases differed according to age, human rhinovirus (hRV) was common in patients of all ages. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (IF), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) were found to be seasonal pathogens, appearing from fall through winter and spring, whereas hRV and adenovirus (AdV) were detected in every season. Patients with ARIs caused by RSV and hRV were frequently afebrile and more commonly had wheezing compared with patients with other viral ARIs. Neutrophil-dominant inflammation was observed in ARIs caused by IF, AdV, and hRV, whereas lymphocyte-dominant inflammation was observed with RSV A, parainfluenza virus, and hMPV. Monocytosis was common with RSV and AdV, whereas eosinophilia was observed with hRV. CONCLUSION: In combination with viral identification, recognition of virus-specific clinical and laboratory patterns will expand our understanding of the epidemiology of viral ARIs and help us to establish more efficient therapeutic and preventive strategies.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.265826877,-0.153701716,-0.099333412,0.11658277,0.031985128,-0.113249942,0.054652607,-0.090350031,0.078224881,0.023273789,-0.003702684,-0.100886048,-0.050519142,0.008942025,-0.016536629,-0.056384508,0.005481887,0.056119136,0.002071004,0.027608529,0.057877517,-0.074372876,-0.05044086,0.059249874,-0.077239552,0.067701984,0.013244739,0.050063019,0.028855035,0.156046299
CXCL9 promotes prostate cancer progression through inhibition of cytokines from T cells,"Chemokines have been demonstrated to serve an important role in a variety of diseases, particularly in tumor progression. There have been numerous studies that have reported that T cells serve major roles in tumor progression. However, the function of CXC motif chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9) in prostate cancer remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the role of CXCL9 in prostate cancer. A prostate cancer mouse model was generated by treating C57/BL-6 and B6.Cg-Selplgtm1Fur/J mice with 3,2′-dimethyl 4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB). Hematoxylin and eosin staining detected the histopathological alterations of mouse prostate tissues. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining determined cell proliferation of the mice. Flow cytometry was used to detect the alterations of T cells in C57+DMAB or CXCL9+DMAB mice. Immunofluorescence revealed that there was positive expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β in the mouse tissues. The survival rates of C57+DMAB and CXCL9+DMAB mice was analyzed. The association of CXCL9 expression and clinical stages was also evaluated. Results revealed that prostate cancer pathology and cell proliferation in CXCL9+DMAB mice were significantly greater compared with the C57+DMAB mice. Compared with C57+DMAB mice, the number of T cells in peripheral blood and spleen of CXCL9+DMAB mice was significantly reduced. IHC demonstrated that the expression of IL-6 and TGF-β was significantly downregulated in the CXCL9+DMAB mice. The survival rate of CXCL9+DMAB mice was significantly decreased compared with the C57+DMAB mice. In addition, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that CXCL9 mRNA expression in clinical samples was positively associated with clinical pathological stages of prostate cancer. In conclusion, CXCL9 may promote prostate cancer progression via inhibition of cytokines from T cells.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.046675905,-0.028397366,0.01187688,-0.113654873,-0.060408209,0.040672545,0.021649518,-0.027341793,0.031835296,-0.042864872,-0.027429918,-0.017845007,-0.015845707,0.041326576,0.004067652,0.02816152,-0.012221391,-0.036530429,-0.027049719,-0.044449975,0.038086225,-0.032481319,0.021737591,0.006204014,0.001532652,-0.000565389,-0.008365991,0.014261718,0.015920135,-0.043523022
Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (MERS CoV): case reports from a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome caused by novel coronavirus (MERS CoV) has been a major public health challenge since it was first described in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. So far, there is no effective treatment for this serious illness, which features a high mortality rate. We report an initial experience of the use of ribavirin and interferon (IFN)-α2b in the management of MERS CoV at a tertiary care hospital. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: A case series of 6 patients admitted with a confirmed diagnosis of MERS CoV were treated with ribavirin and IFN-α2b in addition to supportive management. The patients’ demographics, clinical parameters, and outcomes were recorded. Fifty-four close contacts of these patients were screened for MERS CoV. METHODS: Six patients with MERS CoV infection were included in this study. Four cases featured symptomatic disease, including pneumonia and respiratory failure, while 2 were asymptomatic close contacts of the MERS CoV patients. The MERS CoV infection was confirmed by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction detection of the consensus viral RNA targets upstream of the E gene (UPE) and open reading frame (ORF1b) on a sputum sample. The patients’ demographics, comorbid conditions, time to diagnosis and initiation of treatment, and clinical outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Three out of 6 patients who had comorbid conditions died during the study period, while 3 had successful outcomes. The diagnosis and treatment was delayed by an average of 15 days in those patients who died. Only 2 close contacts out of the 54 screened (3.7%) were positive for MERS CoV. CONCLUSION: Treatment with ribavirin and IFN-α2b may be effective in patients infected with MERS CoV. There appears to be a low infectivity rate among close contacts of MERS CoV patients.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.134832919,0.32830137,-0.216368816,-0.067194929,-0.070702829,-0.003945792,-0.08479124,0.465440467,0.222194387,0.033189913,0.012680901,-0.017755695,-0.031350955,0.021401086,-0.060803297,-0.027714706,0.012763712,0.011961697,-0.011425475,0.042607959,0.025335774,-0.026964615,0.024192912,0.057438468,-0.028928935,-0.043629073,0.0012935,-0.010283626,-0.041295551,0.055782082
Emodin induces apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepaRG cells via the mitochondrial caspase-dependent pathway,"Emodin-induced hepatotoxicity in vivo and in vitro has been gaining increasing attention. However, the exact molecular pathways underlying these effects remain poorly clarified. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of emodin on HepaRG cells and to define the underlying mechanism. The results demonstrated that emodin evidently inhibited HepaRG cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner by blocking cell cycle progression in the S and G2/M phase and by inducing apoptosis. Emodin treatment also resulted in generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which abrogated mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). The above effects were all suppressed by antioxidants, such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Further studies by western blot analysis howed that emodin upregulated p53, p21, Bax, cyclin E, cleaved caspase-3, 8 and 9, and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP). However, the protein expression of Bcl-2, cyclin A and CDK2 was downregulated. Taken together, our results suggest that emodin induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway through cell cycle arrest and ROS generation in HepaRG cells.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.087687808,-0.034039115,-0.010506157,-0.116060281,-0.096323428,0.067568943,0.051056225,-0.040930108,0.061925554,-0.024924674,-0.05796214,-0.016964171,-0.016337599,0.078084651,-0.008151167,0.028185319,0.003258935,-0.015527187,0.014688813,-0.02185687,0.029574887,-0.008677489,0.020592337,-0.033811561,0.030735954,0.03532532,-0.031837173,0.046397441,0.002437505,-0.061102018
Elevated serum LAMC2 is associated with lymph node metastasis and predicts poor prognosis in penile squamous cell carcinoma,"PURPOSE: Molecular biomarkers, especially serologic factors, have been widely applied in cancer diagnosis and patient follow-up. However, there are few valuable prognostic factors in penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC). Here, the authors investigated whether laminin gamma 2 (LAMC2) expression, especially serum LAMC2 (sLAMC2) level, was a suitable prognostic factor that could aid in the prediction of survival in PSCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 114 PSCC patients. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were performed to detect LAMC2 expression; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to test sLAMC2 concentration; and a Transwell assay and an in vivo experiment in nude mice were used to test PSCC cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. The chi-squared test was used to analyze the association between LAMC2 level and clinical parameters, the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate the hazard ratio for death, and Kaplan–Meier analysis with a log-rank test was used for the survival analysis. RESULTS: LAMC2 was overexpressed in PSCC tissues, and the LAMC2 expression level was higher in metastatic lymph node (LN) tissues than in primary cancer tissues; moreover, the LAMC2 levels in primary cancer tissues and sLAMC2 were higher in patients with LN metastasis than in those without LN metastasis. Upregulated LAMC2 facilitated the migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of PSCC cells in vitro and promoted LN metastasis of PSCC cells in nude mice. Elevated LAMC2 levels were strongly correlated with advanced clinicopathologic parameters, especially LN metastasis, in PSCC patients and predicted shorter disease-specific survival. The predictive value of sLAMC2 is superior to that of C-reactive protein and squamous cell carcinoma antigen previously reported in PSCC patients, and a stratification analysis revealed that the level of sLAMC2 had a higher predictive value for disease-specific survival in early penile cancer (especially at the N(0/X) stage) than in later-stage penile cancer. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that sLAMC2 is a potential serologic prognostic marker in PSCC and could aid in risk stratification in early-stage PSCC patients.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.006040493,-0.007907028,0.007567363,-0.119117226,-0.075217467,0.021693545,-0.002717349,0.007270186,-0.017886603,-0.017309087,-0.043025992,-0.006094154,-0.001966722,0.044074038,-0.021426354,0.014527181,0.004496009,-0.009517073,-0.027249225,-0.035968673,0.031000955,-0.042676116,0.016292972,-0.016986558,-0.018966285,-0.006394901,-0.002701902,-0.008169878,-0.013968623,-0.019168583
Identification of Cystoisospora ohioensis in a Diarrheal Dog in Korea,"A 3-month-old female Maltese puppy was hospitalized with persistent diarrhea in a local veterinary clinic. Blood chemistry and hematology profile were analyzed and fecal smear was examined. Diarrheal stools were examined in a diagnostic laboratory, using multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) against 23 diarrheal pathogens. Sequence analysis was performed using nested PCR amplicon of 18S ribosomal RNA. Coccidian oocysts were identified in the fecal smear. Although multiplex real-time PCR was positive for Cyclospora cayetanensis, the final diagnosis was Cystoisospora ohioensis infection, confirmed by phylogenetic analysis of 18S rRNA.

Restriction of H1N1 influenza virus infection by selenium nanoparticles loaded with ribavirin via resisting caspase-3 apoptotic pathway,"INTRODUCTION: Ribavirin (RBV) is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug. Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) attract much attention in the biomedical field and are used as carriers of drugs in current research studies. In this study, SeNPs were decorated by RBV, and the novel nanoparticle system was well characterized. Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells were infected with H1N1 influenza virus before treatment with RBV, SeNPs, and SeNPs loaded with RBV (Se@RBV). METHODS AND RESULTS: MTT assay showed that Se@RBV nanoparticles protect cells during H1N1 infection in vitro. Se@RBV depressed virus titer in the culture supernatant. Intracellular localization detection revealed that Se@RBV accumulated in lysosome and escaped to cytoplasm as time elapsed. Furthermore, activation of caspase-3 was resisted by Se@RBV. Expressions of proteins related to caspase-3, including cleaved poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, caspase-8, and Bax, were downregulated evidently after treatment with Se@RBV compared with the untreated infection group. In addition, phosphorylations of phosphorylated 38 (p38), JNK, and phosphorylated 53 (p53) were inhibited as well. In vivo experiments indicated that Se@RBV was found to prevent lung injury in H1N1-infected mice through hematoxylin and eosin staining. Tunel test of lung tissues present that DNA damage reached a high level but reduced substantially when treated with Se@RBV. Immunohistochemical test revealed an identical result with the in vitro experiment that activations of caspase-3 and proteins on the apoptosis pathway were restrained by Se@RBV treatment. CONCLUSION: Taken together, this study elaborates that Se@RBV is a novel promising agent against H1N1 influenza virus infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.030178015,-0.033513842,0.010460203,-0.061413579,-0.059980085,0.094074207,0.005127746,-0.009838737,0.023989879,-0.038757856,-0.012703479,0.012672789,-0.015683989,-0.006627241,0.041368294,0.069642763,0.058547952,0.023662222,-0.002033645,0.008520021,0.03068594,0.014535421,-0.002519313,-0.018475312,-0.002205849,0.002476435,-0.023719059,0.021900011,0.007486119,-0.002199108
"Molecular detection and phylogenetic properties of isolated infectious bronchitis viruses from broilers in Ahvaz, southwest Iran, based on partial sequences of spike gene","Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious disease involving mostly upper respiratory tract in chickens, leading to significant economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. One of the major concerns regarding to IB is the emergence of new types of infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs). The purpose of this study was to identify the IBVs isolated from Iranian broiler chickens with respiratory symptoms. Twenty-five broiler flocks around Ahwaz (southwest of Iran) were examined for IBV. The specimens including trachea, lung, liver, kidney, and ceacal tonsil, were collected from diseased birds and inoculated into chicken embryonated eggs. Harvested allantoic fluids were subjected to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers in order to amplify spike 1 (S1) gene of IBV. The RT-PCR products of four IBV isolates were sequenced. The results showed that from 25 examined flocks with respiratory disease, 12 flocks (48.00%) were positive for IBV. In phylogenetic analysis, our isolates were closely related to the QX-like viruses such as PCRLab/06/2012 (Iran), QX, HC9, HC10, CK/CH/GX/NN11-1, CK/CH/JS/YC11-1, CK/CH/JS/2010/13, CK/CH/JS/2011/2 (China), QX/SGK-21, QX/SGK-11 (Iraq) with nucleotide homology up to 99.00%. This study indicates the role of IBVs in the respiratory disorders of broiler flocks located in southwest Iran, and also the existence of a variant of IBV, which is distinguishable from the other Iranian variants.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.012636917,-0.006561795,0.089550445,-0.093570965,0.176477342,0.06705657,-0.13336958,-0.088429919,0.109676007,0.302645038,0.084233105,0.037555286,-0.079899976,0.060303921,-0.112987891,0.115216857,0.024566439,0.010237233,0.030037855,0.020474366,-0.039500263,-0.018149389,-0.020911806,-0.034801556,0.005026588,0.022794172,-0.02405618,0.024366949,0.066448269,-0.074533074
739. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection Profile in Qatar: A 7-Year Retrospective Study,"BACKGROUND: A deadly zoonotic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) had emerged over the last 7 years in the Arabian Peninsula. As of February 28, 2018, 2,182 cases of MERS-CoV infection (with 779 deaths) in 27 countries were reported to WHO worldwide. The objectives of this study were to identify the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of MERS-CoV infection as well as determine its clinical outcome. METHODS: This was a retrospective-observational study of all laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection conducted at the main seven hospitals in the State of Qatar from January, 2012 to April 2018. We used the Fast Track diagnostics real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), targeting the upE and ORF1a genes respectively. Demographics, clinical information, potential contacts and probable risk factors were collected and analyzed by standard statistical methods. RESULTS: The mean annual incidence was 1.7 per 100,0000 person-years. Among the 24 confirmed cases of of MERS-CoV, males constituted the vast majority of cases (23 males) with a median age of 52 years (range 22–74). Fifty percent of the cases were Qatari and 42% reside in the same region. 67% of the cases had contact with camels, and 21% had contact with MERS-CoV-infected patient. Thirty-eight had travel history within 2 weeks of symptoms onset to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Fifty percent were smokers and 42% had comorbidities. The median symptoms duration was 4.5 days. Most of the patient presented with flu-like symptoms, were fever was the most common presentation, followed by cough, SOB, diarrhea, abdominal pain and headache, 96%, 83%, 33%, 8%, 8% and 4%, respectively. All patients were admitted to a tertiary hospital with a median hospital stay 41 days (8–97). Forty-five percent patients developed severe sepsis with multi-organ failure and needed ICU admission. Fifty percent patients developed acute kidney injury, 29% patients were on hemodialysis and 16% needed extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. Thirty-three percent patients died. The rest of patients had recovered from the infection and discharged home. Among those who died all had one or more comorbidities. CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV infection is a rare infection in the State of Qatar, seen in both Qataris and expatriates with and without travel history. The infection in patients with comorbidities carries high mortality.

p53- and ROS-mediated AIF pathway involved in TGEV-induced apoptosis,"We previously demonstrated that transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) could induce apoptosis through caspase signaling. However, apoptosis was not completely prevented by caspases inhibitors, suggesting that there may be a caspase-independent pathway involved in TGEV-induced cell apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the regulation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) on TGEV-induced apoptotic pathway. Results indicated that AIF translocated from the mitochondria to nucleus during TGEV infection, and the AIF inhibitor, N-phenylmaleimide (NP), significantly attenuated the apoptosis. In addition, the translocation of AIF was inhibited by Veliparib (ABT-888), an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). And the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamic (PDTC), redistributed AIF in the mitochondria and nucleus in TGEV-infected cells. Moreover, the protein levels in nucleus and the mRNA levels of AIF were inhibited in the presence of the p53 inhibitor, piﬁthrin-α (PFT-α) or in TGEV-infected p53−/−cells. Furthermore, TGEV-induced apoptosis was blocked by combination of three or more inhibitors, such as pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, NP, ABT-888, PDTC, PFT-α, to treat PK-15 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the p53- and ROS-mediated AIF pathway and caspase-dependent pathway were involved in TGEV-induced apoptosis.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.096577933,-0.042394492,-0.005268582,-0.124494322,-0.084029151,0.06596842,0.022923077,-0.053412812,0.073330595,-0.053544862,-0.051498372,-0.013745085,-0.046663379,0.088643375,0.012837327,0.015456177,0.011051196,-0.024478497,0.028032254,0.026795995,0.029379834,0.003884342,0.027317321,-0.000399926,0.088772655,0.021791673,-0.043882677,0.032105411,0.024615497,-0.032084097
Xanthine-based acyclic nucleoside phosphonates with potent antiviral activity against varicella-zoster virus and human cytomegalovirus,"While noncanonic xanthine nucleotides XMP/dXMP play an important role in balancing and maintaining intracellular purine nucleotide pool as well as in potential mutagenesis, surprisingly, acyclic nucleoside phosphonates bearing a xanthine nucleobase have not been studied so far for their antiviral properties. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of xanthine-based acyclic nucleoside phosphonates and evaluation of their activity against a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses. Two acyclic nucleoside phosphonates within the series, namely 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]xanthine (PMEX) and 9-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]xanthine (HPMPX), were shown to possess activity against several human herpesviruses. The most potent compound was PMEX, a xanthine analogue of adefovir (PMEA). PMEX exhibited a single digit µM activity against VZV (EC(50) = 2.6 µM, TK(+) Oka strain) and HCMV (EC(50) = 8.5 µM, Davis strain), while its hexadecyloxypropyl monoester derivative was active against HSV-1 and HSV-2 (EC(50) values between 1.8 and 4.0 µM). In contrast to acyclovir, PMEX remained active against the TK(–) VZV 07–1 strain with EC(50) = 4.58 µM. PMEX was suggested to act as an inhibitor of viral DNA polymerase and represents the first reported xanthine-based acyclic nucleoside phosphonate with potent antiviral properties.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.086116411,-0.032690448,-0.008801635,-0.031059881,-0.061686543,0.053278013,0.051856671,-0.008812128,0.023743101,0.008394363,0.02038058,0.063943189,-0.009047525,-0.023159365,0.001633058,0.007454608,-0.019490625,0.089281148,0.078863794,-0.043218874,0.006493129,-0.000318132,0.018948993,0.053275661,0.028916845,0.001114147,-0.029521834,0.008961963,0.013215315,0.005677078
"Clinical Features, Severity, and Incidence of RSV Illness During 12 Consecutive Seasons in a Community Cohort of Adults ≥60 Years Old","BACKGROUND: The epidemiology and burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) illness are not well defined in older adults. METHODS: Adults ≥60 years old seeking outpatient care for acute respiratory illness were recruited from 2004–2005 through 2015–2016 during the winter seasons. RSV was identified from respiratory swabs by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were ascertained by interview and medical record abstraction. The incidence of medically attended RSV was estimated for each seasonal cohort. RESULTS: RSV was identified in 243 (11%) of 2257 enrollments (241 of 1832 individuals), including 121 RSV type A and 122 RSV type B. The RSV clinical outcome was serious in 47 (19%), moderate in 155 (64%), and mild in 41 (17%). Serious outcomes included hospital admission (n = 29), emergency department visit (n = 13), and pneumonia (n = 23) and were associated with lower respiratory tract symptoms during the enrollment visit. Moderate outcomes included receipt of a new antibiotic prescription (n = 144; 59%), bronchodilator/nebulizer (n = 45; 19%), or systemic corticosteroids (n = 28; 12%). The relative risk of a serious outcome was significantly increased in persons aged ≥75 years (vs 60–64 years) and in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure. The average seasonal incidence was 139 cases/10 000, and it was significantly higher in persons with cardiopulmonary disease compared with others (rate ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.44–2.48). CONCLUSIONS: RSV causes substantial outpatient illness with lower respiratory tract involvement. Serious outcomes are common in older patients and those with cardiopulmonary disease.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.247390824,-0.113588373,-0.119897255,-0.001644911,-0.001100295,-0.069769543,-0.008366749,-0.047435536,0.074042921,-0.080702114,0.026827497,-0.034332856,-0.140865487,-0.077840426,-0.102219303,0.015464622,-0.038243683,0.078695587,-0.014901454,0.004549425,0.005389036,-0.151549137,-0.008705571,-0.065330075,0.114889218,-0.155234489,0.215633895,0.080028647,-0.062015008,0.044591532
Construction and next-generation sequencing analysis of a large phage-displayed V(NAR) single-domain antibody library from six naïve nurse sharks,"BACKGROUND: Shark new antigen receptor variable domain (V(NAR)) antibodies can bind restricted epitopes that may be inaccessible to conventional antibodies. METHODS: Here, we developed a library construction method based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-Extension Assembly and Self-Ligation (named “EASeL”) to construct a large V(NAR) antibody library with a size of 1.2 × 10(10) from six naïve adult nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum). RESULTS: The next-generation sequencing analysis of 1.19 million full-length V(NAR)s revealed that this library is highly diversified because it covers all four classical V(NAR) types (Types I–IV) including 11% of classical Type I and 57% of classical Type II. About 30% of the total V(NAR)s could not be categorized as any of the classical types. The high variability of complementarity determining region (CDR) 3 length and cysteine numbers are important for the diversity of V(NAR)s. To validate the use of the shark V(NAR) library for antibody discovery, we isolated a panel of V(NAR) phage binders to cancer therapy-related antigens, including glypican-3, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and programmed cell death-1 (PD1). Additionally, we identified binders to viral antigens that included the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spike proteins. The isolated shark single-domain antibodies including Type I and Type II V(NAR)s were produced in Escherichia coli and validated for their antigen binding. A Type II V(NAR) (PE38-B6) has a high affinity (K(d) = 10.1 nM) for its antigen. CONCLUSIONS: The naïve nurse shark V(NAR) library is a useful source for isolating single-domain antibodies to a wide range of antigens.

Use of Dipstick Assay and Rapid PCR-DNA Analysis of Nasal Secretions for Diagnosis of Bacterial Sinusitis in Children With Chronic Cough,"BACKGROUND: Chronic cough in children is a diagnostic challenge. OBJECTIVE: To discover the utility of nasal dipsticks and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-DNA analysis in differentiating bacterial sinusitis from other causes of chronic cough and identifying pathogens from the nasal cavity. METHOD: We recruited 22 patients under 15 years of age with cough lasting longer than 4 weeks (group 1), 7 controls with allergic rhinitis (group 2), and 10 controls without respiratory symptoms (group 3). Based on symptoms, the results of nasal secretion assays, and nasal endoscopy, a diagnosis of clinical bacterial sinusitis was made. We identified potential pathogens by quantitative PCR of nasal secretions. RESULTS: Group 1A (cough with clinical bacterial sinusitis n = 10): Eight (80%) patients had bacterial sinusitis associated with dominant potential pathogenic bacteria (PPB): Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Group 1B (cough without clinical bacterial sinusitis n = 12): None had dominant PPB. Group 2 (allergic rhinitis n = 7): None had dominant PPB. Group 3 (asymptomatic n = 10): None had dominant PPB. Twenty to 57% of all groups were colonized with Staphylococcus aureus. Fifty to 70% were colonized with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, and Dolosigranulum pigrum. CONCLUSION: In children with chronic cough, clinicians can utilize a simple and inexpensive nasal secretion dipstick assay for rapid diagnosis of sinusitis and identify PPB by DNA-PCR test for specific antibiotic treatment.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.109617587,-0.026585281,0.011899157,-0.090963253,-0.031987593,-0.054262943,0.029133064,0.023865343,-0.075709236,0.021629235,-0.029124292,-0.023786883,-0.022318548,-0.033327597,-0.019073015,-0.002859615,-0.013845664,-0.012251775,0.026111488,-0.033442787,-0.046057241,-0.011065306,0.036094517,-0.020049308,-0.006530287,0.007931045,-0.014619789,-0.020374389,0.022745519,-0.013236927
Respiratory Viral Infections in Children and Adolescents with Hematological Malignancies,"BACKGROUND: Despite the introduction of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for the diagnosis of respiratory viral infection (RVI), guidance on the application of this test and the management of RVI in immunocompromised children is lacking. This study evaluated the clinical characteristics of RVI and established strategies for the PCR test in children and adolescents with hematological malignancies. METHODS: This study included children and adolescents with underlying hematological malignancies and respiratory symptoms, in whom a multiplex PCR test was performed. Patients in whom RVI was identified and not identified were categorized into Groups I and II, respectively. Group I was sub-divided into patients with upper and lower respiratory infections. The medical records of the enrolled patients were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 93 respiratory illnesses were included. Group I included 46 (49.5%) cases of RVI, including 31 (67.4%) upper and 15 (32.6%) lower respiratory infections. Rhinovirus (37.0%) was the most common viral pathogen. Significantly more patients in Group I had community-acquired respiratory illnesses (p=0.003) and complained of rhinorrhea (p<0.001) and sputum (p=0.008) than those in Group II. In Group I, significantly more patients with lower respiratory infections had uncontrolled underlying malignancies (p=0.038) and received re-induction or palliative chemotherapy (p=0.006) than those with upper respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS: A multiplex PCR test should be considered for RVI diagnosis in immunocompromised children and adolescents with respiratory symptoms, especially in those with rhinorrhea or sputum prominent over a cough. The early application of the PCR test in patients with uncontrolled underlying malignancies may improve outcomes.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.220770765,-0.045799148,-0.066291572,-0.046680286,-0.017163317,-0.102244532,-0.00163024,0.028026668,-0.037149338,0.048862666,-0.018827573,-0.019604923,0.014228205,0.040620854,-0.00703011,-0.02123481,0.044485242,0.016907812,0.000750054,-0.007154722,0.022895003,-0.062383047,-0.01477053,-0.044358911,-0.000608954,0.01280807,-0.033563011,-0.052029203,0.025169061,-0.024641154
SOX2 knockdown inhibits the migration and invasion of basal cell carcinoma cells by targeting the SRPK1-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway,"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of human skin cancer, which is driven by the aberrant activation of Hedgehog signaling. Previous evidence indicated that sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2) is associated with the tumor metastasis. However, the expression and role of SOX2 in BCC remain unknown. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to analyze the possible mechanism of SOX2 in the progression of BCC. The levels of SOX2 in BCC cells were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Transwell assays were also used to determine the migration and invasion of BCC cells. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence were used for analyzing the role of SOX2 knockdown in the serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1)-mediated phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway in BCC cells. The results demonstrated that SOX2 is overexpressed in BCC tissues and cells. In addition, SOX2 knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of BCC cells, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress of BCC cells. It was also observed that SOX2 knockdown decreased SRPK1 expression, which further led to the downregulation of PI3K and AKT expression levels in BCC cells. Furthermore, SRPK1 transfection or PI3K/AKT pathway activation abolished the inhibitory effects of SOX2 knockdown on the migration, invasion and EMT progress of BCC cells. In conclusion, these results indicated that SOX2 may potentially serve as a target for BCC therapy by targeting the SRPK1-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.063348596,-0.028626952,0.005403163,-0.097352572,-0.062906435,0.036049813,0.019119603,-0.029870272,0.037904347,-0.03573309,-0.036769073,-0.008909912,-0.012277274,0.044097591,0.004133742,0.026327864,-0.0015398,-0.024152607,-0.008015685,-0.025786391,0.02346145,-0.007395276,0.020905253,-0.004321011,0.010897367,0.012351477,-0.018568437,0.031745059,0.00256453,-0.029203713
"Molecular Characterization of Two Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases: p38 MAP Kinase and Ribosomal S6 Kinase From Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae), and Insight Into Their Roles in Response to BmNPV Infection","Proteins p38 map kinase and ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) as members of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play important roles against pathogens. In this study, Bmp38 and BmS6K were identified as differentially expressed proteins from iTRAQ database. Bmp38 and BmS6K were expressed, and recombinant proteins were purified. The bioinformatics analysis showed that both proteins have serine/threonine-protein kinases, catalytic domain (S_TKc) with 360 and 753 amino acids, respectively. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results suggest that Bmp38 and BmS6K had high expression in the midgut and hemolymph. The comparative expression level of Bmp38 and BmS6K in BC9 was upregulated than in P50 in the midgut after Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) infection. Western bolt results showed a positive correlation between RT-qPCR and iTRAQ data for Bmp38, but BmS6K data showed partial correlation with iTRAQ. Injection of anti-Bmp38 and anti-BmS6K serum suggested that Bmp38 may be involved against BmNPV infection, whereas BmS6K may require phosphorylation modification to inhibit BmNPV infection. Taken together, our results suggest that Bmp38 and BmS6k might play an important role in innate immunity of silkworm against BmNPV.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.082258125,-0.006773196,0.028874897,-0.079512628,-0.06077698,0.017773831,-0.003023588,-0.045931771,0.063397141,-0.06120681,-0.094859839,-0.013437097,-0.01701154,0.072046033,-0.064888092,-0.090131562,0.098363842,-0.065813609,-0.01198564,-0.018757932,-0.006150802,0.046668384,-0.01407151,-0.029372407,0.043476595,0.080587559,0.059711521,-0.009159843,0.010597407,-0.018025518
C3P3-G1: first generation of a eukaryotic artificial cytoplasmic expression system,"Most eukaryotic expression systems make use of host-cell nuclear transcriptional and post-transcriptional machineries. Here, we present the first generation of the chimeric cytoplasmic capping-prone phage polymerase (C3P3-G1) expression system developed by biological engineering, which generates capped and polyadenylated transcripts in host-cell cytoplasm by means of two components. First, an artificial single-unit chimeric enzyme made by fusing an mRNA capping enzyme and a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Second, specific DNA templates designed to operate with the C3P3-G1 enzyme, which encode for the transcripts and their artificial polyadenylation. This system, which can potentially be adapted to any in cellulo or in vivo eukaryotic expression applications, was optimized for transient expression in mammalian cells. C3P3-G1 shows promising results for protein production in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO-K1) cells.

Evaluation of equine coronavirus fecal shedding among hospitalized horses,"BACKGROUND: Currently, diagnosis of equine coronavirus (ECoV) relies on the exclusion of other infectious causes of enteric disease along with molecular detection of ECoV in feces or tissue. Although this approach is complete, it is costly and may not always be achievable. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the overall fecal shedding of ECoV in hospitalized horses is low. Our objective was to determine whether systemically healthy horses and horses with gastrointestinal disorders shed ECoV in their feces at the time of admission to a referral hospital and after 48 hours of stress associated with hospitalization. ANIMALS: One‐hundred thirty adult horses admitted to the Washington State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital for gastrointestinal disease (n = 65) or for imaging under anesthesia (n = 65) that were hospitalized for 48 hours. Owner consent was obtained before sampling. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected at admission and 48 hours later. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for ECoV and electron microscopy (EM) were performed on all samples. RESULTS: Only 1 of 258 fecal samples was PCR‐positive for ECoV. Electron microscopy identified ECoV‐like particles in 9 of 258 samples, parvovirus‐like particles in 4 of 258 samples, and rotavirus‐like particles in 1 of 258 samples. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The presence of ECoV in feces of hospitalized adult horses was low. Thus, fecal samples that are PCR‐positive for ECoV in adult horses that have clinical signs consistent with this viral infection are likely to be of diagnostic relevance. The clinical relevance of the viruses observed using EM remains to be investigated.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.041466246,0.001408196,0.063867408,-0.075433683,0.026641755,-0.00077664,0.017111604,0.013765812,-0.031991496,-0.023176333,0.044197367,0.018287999,-0.023805826,-0.001174304,0.047308796,-0.015014848,0.016156839,0.001058354,-0.004451549,-0.054539456,0.01225135,0.034510428,-0.060819001,-0.026622809,0.039824911,-0.022347988,-0.039657812,-0.019252321,-0.013784023,-0.00890556
Plant-derived antiviral drugs as novel hepatitis B virus inhibitors: Cell culture and molecular docking study,"Despite high anti-HBV efficacies, while the nucleoside analogs (e.g., lamivudine) lead to the emergence of drug-resistance, interferons (e.g., IFN-α causes adverse side-effects. Comparatively, various natural or plant products have shown similar or even better efficacy. Hence, new antiviral strategies must focus not only on synthetic molecules but also on potential natural compounds. In this report, we have combined the in vitro cell culture and in silico molecular docking methods to assess the novel anti-HBV activity and delineate the inhibitory mechanism of selected plant-derived pure compounds of different classes. Of the tested (2.5-50 μg/ml) twelve non-cytotoxic compounds, ten (10 μg/ml) were found to maximally inhibit HBsAg production at day 5. Compared to quercetin (73%), baccatin III (71%), psoralen (67%), embelin (65%), menisdaurin (64%) and azadirachtin (62%) that showed high inhibition of HBeAg synthesis, lupeol (52%), rutin (47%), β-sitosterol (43%) and hesperidin (41%) had moderate efficacies against HBV replication. Further assessment of quercetin in combination with the highly active compounds, enhanced its anti-HBV activity up to 10%. Being the most important drug target, a 3-D structure of HBV polymerase (Pol/RT) was modeled and docked with the active compounds, including lamivudine as standard. Docking of lamivudine indicated strong interaction with the modeled HBV Pol active-site residues that formed stable complex (∆G = −5.2 kcal/mol). Similarly, all the docked antiviral compounds formed very stable complexes with HBV Pol (∆G = −6.1 to −9.3 kcal/mol). Taken together, our data suggest the anti-HBV potential of the tested natural compounds as novel viral Pol/RT inhibitors.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.092364888,-0.019736591,0.001724342,-0.031269624,-0.131243013,0.080773857,0.086775414,-0.020042058,0.045553869,-0.00994525,-0.00774991,0.053186575,-0.035335941,0.026679545,-0.034464103,0.001386612,-0.006285412,0.112680828,0.067322244,-0.034938034,-0.007272829,0.028067923,-0.011361467,0.084297685,0.04096485,0.018554619,0.048853174,-0.024315079,0.089076705,-0.021298228
The contribution of viruses and bacteria to community-acquired pneumonia in vaccinated children: a case–control study,"INTRODUCTION: Respiratory pathogens associated with childhood pneumonia are often detected in the upper respiratory tract of healthy children, making their contribution to pneumonia difficult to determine. We aimed to determine the contribution of common pathogens to pneumonia adjusting for rates of asymptomatic detection to inform future diagnosis, treatment and preventive strategies. METHODS: A case–control study was conducted among children <18 years in Perth, Western Australia. Cases were children hospitalised with radiologically confirmed pneumonia; controls were healthy children identified from outpatient and local immunisation clinics. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and tested for 14 respiratory viruses and 6 bacterial species by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For each pathogen, adjusted odds ratio (aOR; 95% CI) was calculated using multivariate logistic regression and population-attributable fraction (95% CI) for pneumonia was estimated. RESULTS: From May 2015 to October 2017, 230 cases and 230 controls were enrolled. At least one respiratory virus was identified in 57% of cases and 29% of controls (aOR: 4.7; 95% CI: 2.8 to 7.8). At least one bacterial species was detected in 72% of cases and 80% of controls (aOR: 0.7; 95% CI: 0.4 to 1.2). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detection was most strongly associated with pneumonia (aOR: 58.4; 95% CI: 15.6 to 217.5). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the only bacteria associated with pneumonia (aOR: 14.5; 95% CI: 2.2 to 94.8). We estimated that RSV, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza, adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were responsible for 20.2% (95% CI: 14.6 to 25.5), 9.8% (5.6% to 13.7%), 6.2% (2.5% to 9.7%), 4% (1.1% to 7.1%) and 7.2% (3.5% to 10.8%) of hospitalisations for childhood pneumonia, respectively.

"Occurrence of infectious bronchitis in layer birds in Plateau state, north central Nigeria","A flock of 54 wk-old layer birds exhibiting signs of respiratory distress, greenish diarrhea, and drop in egg production was investigated. A marked drop in egg production (55%) was recorded with eggs appearing white and soft-shelled. Mortality was in the range of 1%–2% with post-mortem lesions revealing cloudy air sacs, frothy, and congested lungs. Viral RNA was extracted from pooled tissue samples (trachea, lungs, spleen, and liver) and tested for Avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, virus isolation was attempted in 9–11 day-old embryonating chicken eggs (ECE). In order to determine the prevalence of IBV serotype(s) in the flock, serum samples were screened by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test using IBV antigens and antisera (Arkansas, Connecticut, and Massachusetts). Neither AIV nor NDV but IBV was detected in the tissue samples by RT-PCR. In addition, virus isolate obtained after four serial passages in ECE produced dwarfed, stunted, and hemorrhagic embryos, and the isolate was confirmed by RT-PCR to be IBV. The serum samples were 100% seropositive for three serotypes with HI titres ranging from 5 to 12 Log(2). In this study, IBV was confirmed as the causative agent of the observed respiratory distress and drop in egg production. Also, the evidence of co-circulation of multiple IBV serotypes was established, this to the best of our knowledge is the first of such report in Nigeria. We recommend extensive molecular and sero-epidemiology of circulating IBV genotypes and serotypes in Nigeria with the aim of developing better control strategies, including vaccination.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.01781741,-0.00190507,0.138046254,-0.068189122,0.160243408,0.094713241,-0.179712777,-0.101540611,0.106468614,0.337680489,0.1357388,0.00027531,-0.099217238,0.120492061,-0.123247494,0.152740455,0.046414532,0.006343686,0.040181099,0.021030682,-0.075935626,0.011479379,-0.021822253,-0.05506133,0.018977011,0.036183746,-0.014410214,0.014178721,0.064630776,-0.048035139
Evidence for Cross-Protection Against Subsequent Febrile Respiratory Illness Episodes From Prior Infections by Different Viruses Among Singapore Military Recruits 2009–2014,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the relative cross-protection conferred by infection with different groups of viruses through studies of sequential infections in humans. We investigated the presence of short-lived relative cross-protection conferred by specific prior viral infections against subsequent febrile respiratory illness (FRI). METHODS: Men enlisted in basic military training between December 2009 and December 2014 were recruited, with the first FRI as the study entry point. ResPlex II assays and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect viral pathogens in nasal wash samples, and survival analyses were performed to determine whether infection with particular viruses conferred short-lived relative cross-protection against FRI. RESULTS: Prior infection with adenovirus (hazard ratio [HR], 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], .14–.44) or influenza virus (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, .38–.73) conferred relative protection against subsequent FRI episode. Results were statistically significant even after adjustment for the interval between enlistment and FRI (P < .001). Adenovirus-positive participants with FRI episodes tended to be protected against subsequent infection with adenovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus/rhinovirus, and influenza virus (P = .062–.093), while men with influenza virus–positive FRI episodes tended be protected against subsequent infection with adenovirus (P = .044) and influenza virus (P = .081). CONCLUSION: Prior adenovirus or influenza virus infection conferred cross-protection against subsequent FRI episodes relative to prior infection due to other circulating viruses.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.085166934,-0.071502142,-0.016130675,0.032527002,0.004831996,0.09220822,-0.015414028,-0.00981736,-0.002874098,-0.042827961,0.004906296,-0.002863566,-0.01493732,-0.018006671,0.02037358,0.026300401,-0.030982171,-0.072625984,0.039350594,-0.028978477,-0.02914898,0.021251885,-0.006344737,0.040639442,-0.000665887,-0.000724497,-0.013525359,-0.017816266,-0.049030759,-0.027707087
The prevalence of respiratory pathogens in adults with community-acquired pneumonia in an outpatient cohort,"PURPOSE: Community-acquired pneumonia is a common illness worldwide. In adults, community-acquired bacterial pneumonia has been well studied, but viral pneumonia is less well understood. We designed this study to identify respiratory pathogens, including common pneumonia-causing bacteria, viruses and atypical pneumonia pathogens, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia at the Fever Clinic of Peking University Third Hospital. We collected sputum or throat swabs from patients diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. Multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed for 20 pathogens, including 9 viruses, 3 atypical pathogens and 8 bacteria. RESULTS: There were 232 outpatients enrolled in our study, and 153 patients (65.9%) had positive test results, of which 26.7% were viruses, 19.4% were atypical pathogens and 19.8% were bacteria. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was detected at the highest frequency (19.0%), exceeding Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. The most commonly identified viral pathogens were IFVs (15.1%), PIVs (3.4%) and RhV (2.6%). The most commonly identified bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.1%), Haemophilus influenza (6.5%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.6%). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that viruses were commonly detected in outpatients with CAP, and IFVs were the most common viruses, especially during flu season. Patients with viral infection were prone to viral-bacterial coinfection. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the leading pathogen in the outpatients with CAP. Viral infection occurs in a large number of outpatients with CAP, and it should receive greater attention in clinical work.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.217571443,-0.097771554,-0.090695036,-0.034968444,-0.055563508,-0.051227367,-0.020497709,0.119794624,-0.229514916,0.147535021,-0.081739849,-0.03854745,0.038053699,-0.005198626,-0.055071334,-0.070187333,-0.003965388,-0.018243635,-0.058663107,0.094041809,-0.029369273,0.203412201,0.207794917,0.057598303,0.126800647,-0.008459478,0.035747252,0.102856346,0.142714823,-0.053434015
Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients with Pulmonary Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Infected with Influenza versus Other Respiratory Viruses,"BACKGROUND: Although the frequency of respiratory viral infection in patients with pulmonary acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is not uncommon, clinical significance of the condition remains to be further elucidated. The purpose of this study was to compare characteristics and outcomes of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with influenza and other respiratory viruses. METHODS: Clinical data of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with respiratory viruses January 2014–June 2018 were reviewed. Respiratory viral infection was identified by multiplex reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Among 126 patients who underwent multiplex RT-PCR, respiratory viral infection was identified in 46% (58/126): 28 patients with influenza and 30 patients with other respiratory viruses. There was no significant difference in baseline and clinical characteristics between patients with influenza and those with other respiratory viruses. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was more frequent in patients with influenza than in those with other respiratory viruses (32.1% vs 3.3%, p=0.006). Co-bacterial pathogens were more frequently isolated from respiratory samples of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with influenza virus than those with other respiratory viruses. (53.6% vs 26.7%, p=0.036). There were no significant differences regarding clinical outcomes. In multivariate analysis, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II was associated with 30-mortality (odds ratio, 1.158; 95% confidence interval, 1.022–1.312; p=0.022). CONCLUSION: Respiratory viral infection was not uncommon in patients with pulmonary ARDS. Influenza virus was most commonly identified and was associated with more co-bacterial infection and ECMO therapy.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.309836259,-0.073604485,-0.130084173,0.079385941,-0.03679312,0.026134656,-0.123165572,0.082217389,-0.143287477,0.061406983,-0.035891662,-0.014612317,0.05462885,0.147906974,-0.025910993,-0.051063103,0.075847059,-0.019406137,0.029264025,0.085052301,0.065413934,-0.095623086,-0.034375443,0.042471258,0.0162121,-0.043252668,-0.047736194,-0.0536547,-0.051726049,-0.035486301
Comparison of Rates of Hospitalization Between Single and Dual Virus Detection in a Mexican Cohort of Children and Adults With Influenza-Like Illness,"BACKGROUND: Molecular detection methods allow for the simultaneous detection of several infectious agents. This study assesses whether co-infection with 2 viruses as compared with 1 is associated with increased hospitalization in those with acute respiratory infections. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled a cohort of pediatric and adult participants with influenza-like illness during 2010–2014 in Mexico. Clinical information and respiratory samples were collected at enrollment. Respiratory viruses were detected with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and influenza-specific reverse transcription PCR assays. Participants were followed for 14 and 28 days after inclusion. Severity of disease, as measured by hospitalization with acute respiratory infections, was compared between single and dual viral infections. RESULTS: Among 5662 participants in the study, either 1 (n = 3285) or 2 (n = 641) viruses were detected in 3926 participants. Rhinovirus (n = 1433), influenza (n = 888), and coronaviruses (n = 703) were the most frequently detected viruses (either alone or in co-infection). Bocavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), metapneumovirus, and rhinovirus cases were hospitalized more often than other viruses. Bocavirus+rhinovirus cases were hospitalized more often than those with rhinovirus alone (but not bocavirus alone). RSV cases were more likely to be hospitalized than cases with co-infections of RSV and parainfluenza virus or coronavirus. Metapneumovirus cases were hospitalized more often than those co-infected with metapneumovirus+coronavirus. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, detection of 2 viruses did not significantly increase hospitalizations compared with single virus infections. Larger studies will allow for distinguishing between sequential and simultaneous infection and for a better understanding of the role of each virus during the evolution of acute respiratory episodes.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.300375209,-0.124061622,-0.0746493,0.191021519,0.066674218,-0.020976199,0.011609759,-0.075347539,0.080246884,0.026047205,0.028520502,-0.102795121,0.022608514,-0.023703487,0.053683475,-0.047022257,0.020116833,-0.057196389,0.057869685,-0.004667945,0.00387255,-0.08723265,-0.046158339,0.023170656,0.064365496,-0.017793995,0.044637271,0.065282494,-0.024507568,-0.062740933
Causative agents and epidemiology of diarrhea in Korean native calves,"Calf diarrhea caused by infectious agents is associated with economic losses in the cattle industry. The purpose of this study was to identify the causative agents and epidemiological characteristics of diarrhea in Korean native calves (KNC). In total, 207 diarrheal KNC aged less than 7 months were investigated. Fecal samples collected from the rectum were examined for causative agents using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time PCR and the number of oocysts were counted. Fourteen causative agents were detected from 164 of the 207 diarrheal KNC. Rotavirus was the most common agent (34.8%), followed by Eimeria spp. (31.7%), Escherichia coli (22.0%), Giardia spp. (14.0%), Clostridium difficile (9.8%), bovine viral diarrhea virus (8.5%), coronavirus (7.9%), Cryptosporidium spp. (7.3%), torovirus (6.7%), parvovirus (5.5%), norovirus (4.9%), kobuvirus (1.8%), adenovirus (1.2%), and Salmonella spp. (0.6%). About 95 (57.9%) of 164 calves were infected with a single causative agent and 42.1% were infected by multiple agents. No significant difference was observed in mortality between calves infected with a single agent and multiple agents. The occurrence of diarrhea caused by rotavirus, Eimeria spp., kobuvirus, and Giardia spp. was significantly different based on onset age, and the prevalence of diarrhea caused by rotavirus or C. difficile was significantly different between seasons. This study help the understanding of KNC diarrhea for the development of an effective strategy for disease prevention and control, especially in Eastern provinces of South Korea.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.028615761,-0.012378898,0.058074945,-0.109196748,0.019582799,0.019256723,0.038076235,-0.023629782,-0.013675505,0.007516979,0.034325133,0.043651985,-0.067810702,-0.035423605,0.113579407,-0.047554478,-0.02900657,-0.002019369,0.042025276,-0.009885321,-0.005617696,0.061707832,-0.055057336,-0.000443925,0.059695318,-0.059389424,-0.010800252,-0.09849247,0.030279191,-0.011659382
Respiratory syncytial virus–associated illness in adults with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or congestive heart failure,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is recognized as a serious pathogen in people with chronic cardiopulmonary conditions. Immunoprophylaxis might be considered for adults at high‐risk for frequent and severe RSV infection. Thus, we studied the incidence of RSV‐related medically attended acute respiratory illness (MARI) in adults with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or congestive heart failure (CHF). METHODS: Subjects ≥50 years of age with Gold Class III/IV COPD and/or American Heart Association class III/IV CHF and exposure to children ≥once per month were recruited. Subjects were evaluated over 1.5 to 2.5 years for RSV‐associated MARI, defined as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or seroresponse. RESULTS: Four hundred forty‐five subjects were enrolled between October 2011 and May 2012. Overall, 99 RSV infections were documented by PCR or serology for a cumulative incidence of 22.2%. Of these, 42 (9.4%) subjects had protocol‐specified RSV‐MARI for an incidence of 4.68/100 patient‐seasons. All‐cause MARI was common (63.85/100 patient‐seasons) with rhinovirus most commonly identified. CONCLUSION: RSV infection was common in adults with severe COPD and/or advanced CHF. Given the severity of underlying cardiopulmonary diseases in the study population, most illnesses were surprisingly mild. Thus, active immunization rather than passive immunoprophylaxis with monoclonal antibodies may be a more cost‐effective strategy.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.173672959,-0.087410171,-0.067548527,-0.000989808,-0.003988351,-0.058460341,0.036250581,-0.07426155,0.106486563,-0.066462544,0.020781338,-0.060752581,-0.106440613,-0.074248564,-0.072867039,0.009171021,-0.032610558,0.072992182,-0.024709116,-0.028049995,0.013597347,-0.150557056,0.020666751,-0.040180473,0.103548774,-0.149041517,0.199060562,0.101845358,-0.026115913,0.109386595
Prevalence of feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukaemia virus in domestic cats in Hungary,"OBJECTIVES: Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) are retroviruses affecting cats worldwide. The objectives of the study were to estimate the prevalence of these retroviruses in domestic cats in Hungary and to characterise the phylogenetic relationships of FIV strains. METHODS: A total of 335 anticoagulated whole-blood samples obtained from both a healthy and ill cat population were examined for the presence of FIV and FeLV with two methods: ELISA and PCR. Statistical analysis was carried out to analyse the data obtained. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of partial polymerase (pol) gene sequences was performed to describe circulating FIV subtypes. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed 11.8% and 9.9% true prevalence of FeLV and FIV, respectively, with ELISA. The apparent prevalence calculated from the PCR results were 17.3% for FeLV and 13.1% for FIV. Phylogenetic analysis of partial pol gene sequences obtained from 22 FIV strains showed that all observed Hungarian strains belonged to FIV subtype B. The strains were grouped into several monophyletic subgroups reflecting the geographic locations of the origin of the samples. The overall mean genetic similarity between the analysed strains was 98.2%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We report the first thorough overview of the prevalence of FeLV and FIV in Hungary, which is relatively high, and give insight into the genetic diversity of Hungarian strains of FIV.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.023976794,-0.012314502,0.06201492,-0.125808604,0.098006624,0.048075225,0.011191439,-0.007509602,-0.019708655,-0.044906438,0.124635276,-0.007598759,0.050693593,-0.024841066,-0.039070549,-0.019967301,0.001778916,-0.006674812,-0.007667862,-0.002103446,0.03979043,0.015754283,0.024043807,0.031684398,-0.001461248,-0.017216659,0.000436773,0.019607177,-0.00749756,0.03187172
Pathogens Causing Respiratory Tract Infections in Children Less Than 5 Years of Age in Senegal,"INTRODUCTION: While acute respiratory tract infections are the main cause of paediatric mortality and morbidity worldwide, pathogen patterns shift due to factors such as hygiene, vaccinations, and antibiotic resistance. Knowledge about current cause of respiratory infections is lacking, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The aim of this study was to identity the various respiratory pathogens causing acute respiratory tract infections in children below 5 years of age visiting a sub-urban primary care clinic in Senegal. METHODS: A case-control study was performed in September and October 2018. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from cases; infants with fever and respiratory symptoms, and controls; children involved in the vaccination programme. Viral identification was conducted by polymerase chain reaction for 21 different viruses; bacteria were identified by culture studies. Associations between microorganisms, acute respiratory infection and severity of disease were calculated by multivariate regression adjusting for confounders such as age, sex, and living area. RESULTS: Overall, 102 cases and 96 controls were included. Microorganisms were detected in 90.1% of cases and 53.7% of controls (P < .001). Influenza virus A (including H1N1), influenza virus B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and Streptococcus pneumoniae were independently associated with acute respiratory tract infections. Co-detection of two or more pathogens was present in 49.5% of cases; 31.7% of cases had a pneumonia and 90.2% was treated with antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: This case-control study in a primary care setting in sub-Saharan Africa found influenza virus A and B, RSV, and S pneumoniae to be the main causes of acute respiratory tract infections in children below 5 years of age. We recommend evaluation of antibiotics prescription behaviour in this setting.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.33482243,-0.138262398,-0.142468148,0.097888112,0.010668858,-0.023828587,0.013665752,-0.031242005,0.065848706,0.041405042,0.002915821,-0.059450198,0.007942232,-0.097749404,0.030312278,-0.017144235,-0.022184364,-0.034203801,0.032085875,0.026712771,-0.051567702,0.00555726,0.009434595,-0.011088168,0.082030104,0.032492099,-0.000322192,0.050575794,0.066606479,-0.0745196
"Hospital-based surveillance of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in Saudi Arabia, 2010-2016","BACKGROUND: Influenza is a highly contagious acute viral respiratory tract infection. The emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2009 caused a pandemic. Since then it has become a seasonal influenza virus. It causes symptoms ranging from mild to severe illness, which might be fatal, particularly in people with underlying chronic medical conditions, immunocompromised people, the elderly, and pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: Describe the data generated by the influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 surveillance in Saudi Arabia from 2010 to 2016. DESIGN: Retrospective, descriptive. SETTING: Hospitals reporting to the Ministry of Health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied aggregate data on hospitalized cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Saudi Arabia between 2010 and 2016. The surveillance system used the case definition proposed by the WHO. The cases were confirmed by performing the real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) on upper respiratory samples. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Suspected and confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases. SAMPLE SIZE: 113 502 suspected H1N1 cases and 17 094 (15.1%) confirmed cases. RESULTS: Most of the reported cases were registered in the Riyadh region. During the period of the study, the highest number of confirmed cases, 9262 (54.2 %), was in 2015. The case fatality rate for confirmed cases was 3.6%. CONCLUSION: Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 showed seasonal trends. The number of suspected influenza cases each year was proportionate to the number of confirmed cases for that year. Riyadh, Jeddah and the Eastern areas (regions with the highest population) reported most of the cases. LIMITATION: Only one strain of H1N1 was tested.

The profile of respiratory pathogens in induced sputum of elderly and non-elderly asthmatics,"INTRODUCTION: Respiratory pathogens are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis and exacerbations of asthma at all ages; however, little is known about the airway microbiome in the elderly. AIM OF THE STUDY: To identify respiratory pathogens in the induced sputum (IS) of elderly asthmatics, and to determine the association between pathogens and the markers of asthma activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-nine subjects with stable asthma, 15 above 65 years of age and 14 aged 30-49 years, underwent clinical evaluation, fractional exhaled nitric oxide measurement, and sputum induction. Pathogens were detected by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The periostin concentration of IS supernatants was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum eosinophil cationic protein and total IgE levels were measured by ImmunoCAP. RESULTS: Elderly patients, as compared to non-elderly, had significantly higher eosinophilia in IS, although other markers of eosinophilic inflammation were comparable. Half of the subjects were positive for Haemophilus influenzae. Chlamydophila pneumoniae was found in two subjects. Respiratory viruses were detected in more than 70% of patients. The detection rates and profiles of atypical bacteria and respiratory viruses were similar in both groups. Only in the elderly asthmatics was influenza A positivity associated with lower predicted FVC%, RSV A positivity connected with decreased tIgE concentration, and RSV B positivity related to a lower percentage of lymphocytes in IS. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the existence of differences in some clinical and inflammatory characteristics of asthma between elderly and non-elderly asthmatics, the pathogen detection rates in the IS from the two groups are similar.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.15033622,-0.083797332,-0.046821161,-0.036873368,-0.024187468,-0.049234445,0.023643235,-0.014432014,-0.033215899,0.008290349,-0.038419276,-0.039541197,-0.037235736,-0.000117794,-0.036588483,-0.035152215,0.023477983,-0.06305591,0.020578214,-0.018600743,0.02052858,-0.155242097,0.047495797,0.050112571,0.031184233,0.024251299,-0.009236425,0.035894993,0.088428256,0.052131543
Gene-Specific Countermeasures against Ebola Virus Based on Antisense Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomers,"The filoviruses Marburg virus and Ebola virus (EBOV) quickly outpace host immune responses and cause hemorrhagic fever, resulting in case fatality rates as high as 90% in humans and nearly 100% in nonhuman primates. The development of an effective therapeutic for EBOV is a daunting public health challenge and is hampered by a paucity of knowledge regarding filovirus pathogenesis. This report describes a successful strategy for interfering with EBOV infection using antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs). A combination of EBOV-specific PMOs targeting sequences of viral mRNAs for the viral proteins (VPs) VP24, VP35, and RNA polymerase L protected rodents in both pre- and post-exposure therapeutic regimens. In a prophylactic proof-of-principal trial, the PMOs also protected 75% of rhesus macaques from lethal EBOV infection. The work described here may contribute to development of designer, “druggable” countermeasures for filoviruses and other microbial pathogens.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.053092752,-0.027799408,-0.000100716,-0.028817123,-0.065636932,0.054034537,0.059597839,0.020058065,0.021224659,0.02092415,-0.00666623,-0.024543745,0.013304578,-0.017782359,0.013129412,0.012142988,-0.034659201,0.028033823,-0.041104217,0.008137944,-0.012471494,0.004044968,-0.059674272,0.021918112,0.02475496,-0.015395522,0.034276647,-0.009439052,0.016397561,0.0100016
TaqMan probe array for quantitative detection of DNA targets,"To date real-time quantitative PCR and gene expression microarrays are the methods of choice for quantification of nucleic acids. Herein, we described a unique fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based microarray platform for real-time quantification of nucleic acid targets that combines advantages of both and reduces their limitations. A set of 3′ amino-modified TaqMan probes were designed and immobilized on a glass slide composing a regular microarray pattern, and used as probes in the consecutive PCR carried out on the surface. During the extension step of the PCR, 5′ nuclease activity of DNA polymerase will cleave quencher dyes of the immobilized probe in the presence of nucleic acids targets. The increase of fluorescence intensities generated by the change in physical distance between reporter fluorophore and quencher moiety of the probes were collected by a confocal scanner. Using this new approach we successfully monitored five different pathogenic genomic DNAs and analyzed the dynamic characteristics of fluorescence intensity changes on the TaqMan probe array. The results indicate that the TaqMan probe array on a planar glass slide monitors DNA targets with excellent specificity as well as high sensitivity. This set-up offers the great advantage of real-time quantitative detection of DNA targets in a parallel array format.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.030469432,0.046252451,0.161388538,0.000574895,-0.05959791,0.004675677,0.032638019,-0.014374458,0.001690542,0.011756875,-0.073123584,-0.013465753,0.048602117,-0.058315578,-0.01062818,-0.005216436,-0.020320253,-0.028353039,-0.007723108,-0.104146389,-0.005364638,-0.005706367,0.04654551,-0.058483391,-0.054639793,-0.020992827,-0.003941212,-0.007349047,-0.015967701,0.051591362

Here we detail a series of genetic and biochemical techniques used in combination to find an essential molecular contact point on the duck hepatitis B virus polymerase. These techniques include differential immunoprecipitation, mutagenesis and peptide competition.

Nucleolus: the fascinating nuclear body,"Nucleoli are the prominent contrasted structures of the cell nucleus. In the nucleolus, ribosomal RNAs are synthesized, processed and assembled with ribosomal proteins. RNA polymerase I synthesizes the ribosomal RNAs and this activity is cell cycle regulated. The nucleolus reveals the functional organization of the nucleus in which the compartmentation of the different steps of ribosome biogenesis is observed whereas the nucleolar machineries are in permanent exchange with the nucleoplasm and other nuclear bodies. After mitosis, nucleolar assembly is a time and space regulated process controlled by the cell cycle. In addition, by generating a large volume in the nucleus with apparently no RNA polymerase II activity, the nucleolus creates a domain of retention/sequestration of molecules normally active outside the nucleolus. Viruses interact with the nucleolus and recruit nucleolar proteins to facilitate virus replication. The nucleolus is also a sensor of stress due to the redistribution of the ribosomal proteins in the nucleoplasm by nucleolus disruption. The nucleolus plays several crucial functions in the nucleus: in addition to its function as ribosome factory of the cells it is a multifunctional nuclear domain, and nucleolar activity is linked with several pathologies.

Quantitative measurement of thyroglobulin mRNA in peripheral blood of patients after total thyroidectomy,"Previous studies have reported the clinical usefulness of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of thyroglobulin (TG) mRNA in the peripheral blood of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma. To evaluate this usefulness, we measured TG mRNA in the peripheral blood of patients diagnosed with thyroid carcinoma after total thyroidectomy by real-time quantitative RT-PCR using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA as an internal control. Surprisingly, we detected TG mRNA in all samples obtained after total thyroidectomy, including those from 4 medullary carcinomas. Further, there was no statistical difference in expression levels of TG mRNA in the patients with or without metastasis, and no significant correlation was found between serum TG concentrations and the expression levels of TG mRNA. These results give rise to a question regarding the clinical applications of not only RT-PCR detection but also quantitative measurement of TG mRNA in peripheral blood. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign http://www.bjcancer.com",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.042114773,0.03637444,0.103584413,-0.090240975,-0.079064644,-0.047538471,-0.048260488,0.013968068,-0.056822951,-0.063031584,-0.031856421,-0.052993862,0.017002178,0.150493285,-0.056572605,0.003696866,0.048794739,-0.031595212,-0.050563448,-0.08780352,0.038720169,0.013446461,0.007471026,0.019303708,-0.032342287,-0.080947767,0.011580833,0.010828615,0.13289492,-0.025461661
Norwalk-like calicivirus genes in farm animals.,"Viruses closely related to Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) were recently found in stored stool samples from two calves (United Kingdom and Germany) and four pigs (Japan), sparking discussions about the potential for zoonotic transmission. To investigate if NLVs are commonly present in farm animals, pooled stool samples from 100 pig farms, 48 chicken farms, 43 dairy cow herds, and 75 veal calf farms from the Netherlands were assayed by reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction amplification, using primers specific for the detection of NLVs from humans. NLV RNA was detected in 33 (44%) of the specimens from veal calf farms and two (2%) specimens from pig farms. Our data show that NLV infections until recently thought to be restricted to humans occur often in calves and sometimes in pigs. While zoonotic transmission has not been proven, these findings suggest that calves and pigs may be reservoir hosts of NLVs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.013196831,0.000995352,0.06107226,-0.050187552,0.074925593,0.039453981,0.03269838,0.010660286,-0.012666695,-0.000899589,0.021202241,0.036760154,-0.057760233,-0.009775984,0.087012073,-0.036179041,-0.019198231,-0.011123249,0.0050283,-0.010883905,-0.019571764,-0.004889565,-0.053120198,0.004285363,0.009076387,-0.033929397,-0.044772027,-0.042377486,0.015682611,-0.050897159

Frequency and clinical relevance of human bocavirus infection in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"OBJECTIVE: Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a recently discovered parvovirus associated with acute respiratory tract infections in children. The objective of the present study was to determine the frequency and clinical relevance of HBoV infection in adult patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD). METHODS: We retrospectively tested 212 COPD patients, 141 (66.5%) with AE-COPD and 71 (33.5%) with stable disease, of whom nasal lavage and induced sputum had been obtained for the presence of HBoV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The specificity of positive polymerase chain reaction results was confirmed by sequencing. RESULTS: Two hundred two of 212 patients for whom PCR results were available both for nasal lavage and induced sputum samples were eligible for data analysis. HBoV DNA was detected in three patients (1.5%). Of those, only one patient had AE-COPD. Thus, the frequency of HBoV infection demonstrated to be low in both AE-COPD (0.8%) and stable COPD (2.9%). HBoV was found in two sputum and one nasal lavage sample in different patients, respectively. Sequencing revealed >99% sequence identity with the reference strain. CONCLUSION: HBoV detection was infrequent. Since we detected HBoV in both upper and lower respiratory tract specimens and in AE-COPD as well as stable disease, a major role of HBoV infection in adults with AE-COPD is unlikely.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.115002342,-0.036673227,-0.028339268,-0.115300408,-0.01563842,-0.073913937,0.0121025,0.021380792,-0.040124343,0.041966086,-0.047225786,0.007188398,0.016409332,0.028857383,-0.02009216,-0.015330657,-0.018651605,-0.022618533,-0.000440672,-0.02439224,0.066098835,-0.059220582,-0.01161127,0.029580227,-0.049527655,0.010203411,-0.082297499,0.031789065,0.010365013,0.096301416

Detection of multiple respiratory pathogens during primary respiratory infection: nasal swab versus nasopharyngeal aspirate using real-time polymerase chain reaction,"In this study, we present the multiple detection of respiratory viruses in infants during primary respiratory illness, investigate the sensitivity of nasal swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates, and assess whether patient characteristics and viral load played a role in the sensitivity. Healthy infants were included at signs of first respiratory tract infection. Paired nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasal swabs were collected. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out for 11 respiratory pathogens. Paired nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasal swabs were collected in 98 infants. Rhinovirus (n = 67) and respiratory syncytial virus (n = 39) were the most frequently detected. Co-infection occurred in 48% (n = 45) of the infants. The sensitivity of the nasal swab was lower than the nasopharyngeal aspirate, in particular, for respiratory syncytial virus (51% vs. 100%) and rhinovirus (75% vs. 97%). The sensitivity of the nasal swab was strongly determined by the cycle threshold (CT) value (p < 0.001). The sensitivity of the swab for respiratory syncytial virus, but not rhinovirus, was 100% in children with severe symptoms (score ≥11). It is concluded that, for community-based studies and surveillance purposes, the nasal swab can be used, though the sensitivity is lower than the aspirate, in particular, for the detection of mild cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.239385149,-0.062948483,-0.022063566,0.055944584,0.021180265,-0.11111081,0.034782929,-0.046374634,0.070274132,0.011686121,0.022530741,-0.057514776,-0.0258513,-0.040390127,0.06877925,0.008907333,0.024441546,-0.09967593,0.115517414,-0.059373841,-0.045571263,-0.109420432,-0.046117481,-0.029755928,0.124922246,0.005763732,0.035928205,0.046953248,-0.035968303,-0.122410918
Examining Landscape Factors Influencing Relative Distribution of Mosquito Genera and Frequency of Virus Infection,"Mosquito-borne infections cause some of the most debilitating human diseases, including yellow fever and malaria, yet we lack an understanding of how disease risk scales with human-driven habitat changes. We present an approach to study variation in mosquito distribution and concomitant viral infections on the landscape level. In a pilot study we analyzed mosquito distribution along a 10-km transect of a West African rainforest area, which included primary forest, secondary forest, plantations, and human settlements. Variation was observed in the abundance of Anopheles, Aedes,Culex, and Uranotaenia mosquitoes between the different habitat types. Screening of trapped mosquitoes from the different habitats led to the isolation of five uncharacterized viruses of the families Bunyaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Rhabdoviridae, as well as an unclassified virus. Polymerase chain reaction screening for these five viruses in individual mosquitoes indicated a trend toward infection with specific viruses in specific mosquito genera that differed by habitat. Based on these initial analyses, we believe that further work is indicated to investigate the impact of anthropogenic landscape changes on mosquito distribution and accompanying arbovirus infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.000994025,-0.040630501,0.000712436,-0.021971525,0.006812994,0.036063273,0.084270711,-0.002416075,0.010675457,0.038934865,-0.012554711,0.001433715,0.02673537,-0.010953143,0.030868806,-0.005769299,-0.025893987,-0.010982738,-0.038132569,0.006908437,0.01955695,-0.004843258,-0.041589154,0.034809279,-0.02715755,0.004934291,0.004247927,-0.005163203,-0.0096749,-0.036381108
Evolutionary Relationships between Bat Coronaviruses and Their Hosts,"Recent studies have suggested that bats are the natural reservoir of a range of coronaviruses (CoVs), and that rhinolophid bats harbor viruses closely related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV, which caused an outbreak of respiratory illness in humans during 2002–2003. We examined the evolutionary relationships between bat CoVs and their hosts by using sequence data of the virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene and the bat cytochrome b gene. Phylogenetic analyses showed multiple incongruent associations between the phylogenies of rhinolophid bats and their CoVs, which suggested that host shifts have occurred in the recent evolutionary history of this group. These shifts may be due to either virus biologic traits or host behavioral traits. This finding has implications for the emergence of SARS and for the potential future emergence of SARS-CoVs or related viruses.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.067589339,0.241334179,-0.180492956,0.062057673,0.306352425,0.127001241,0.248570447,-0.050120438,-0.149551737,-0.04045935,-0.118192309,-0.150951257,-0.030539202,0.050083017,-0.034875957,0.065234183,0.004885908,0.054549747,0.028395032,0.042179283,-0.028838979,-0.052370939,0.016332099,-0.032792386,0.00550409,-3.85E-05,-0.033542159,-0.012672602,0.010151129,-0.031667677
Sequence analysis of the S1 glycoprotein gene of infectious bronchitis viruses: identification of a novel phylogenetic group in Korea,"Twelve Korean infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs) were isolated in the field from chickens suspected of being carriers of infectious bronchitis between 2001 and 2003. The S1 glycoprotein genes of these IBV isolates were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. These Korean IBV isolates were classified into three groups according to their RFLP patterns obtained using the restriction enzyme HaeIII. Half of the twelve isolates were similar to the KM91 RFLP pattern, which is a common pattern in Korea. Three more isolates were related to the Arkansas strain pattern, but with some unique variations. The other three viruses showed variant RFLP patterns. For a comparison with the published sequences for non-Korean IBV strains, amplified PCR products from the twelve isolates were cloned and sequenced. The Korean IBV field isolates had 71.2-99.7% nucleotide sequence homology with each other and 45.9-80.7% nucleotide sequence homology with non-Korean IBV strains. With respect to the deduced amino acid sequence, the Korean IBV isolates had 71.5-99.3% similarity with each other and 44.9-80.3% similarity with non-Korean IBV strains. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that some of the IBV isolates appear to belong to a new group, different from the non-Korean IBV strains or from previously isolated Korean IBV strains. Specifically, the new Korean IBV isolates K10217-03, K3-3 and K1255-03 represented a separate group. These findings suggest that the Korean IBVs appear to be continuously evolving.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.064587661,-0.01340521,0.099866651,-0.152599828,0.21700677,0.089296146,-0.173325978,-0.092742944,0.079987765,0.294684243,0.075884418,0.070874736,-0.0959381,-0.010403747,-0.117451244,0.079222268,-0.008259401,0.04395242,0.004570053,0.04111782,-0.019676499,-0.012696405,0.010933968,-7.84E-05,-0.013059218,-0.00199471,0.000833255,0.019320478,0.029526255,0.036996839
Swabbing for respiratory viral infections in older patients: a comparison of rayon and nylon flocked swabs,"The purpose of this study was to compare the sampling efficacy of rayon swabs and nylon flocked swabs, and of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens for the detection of respiratory viruses in elderly patients. Samples were obtained from patients 60 years of age or above who were newly admitted to Sorlandet Hospital Arendal, Norway. The patients were interviewed for current symptoms of a respiratory tract infection. Using rayon swabs and nylon flocked swabs, comparable sets of mucosal samples were harvested from the nasopharynx and the oropharynx. The samples were analysed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. A total of 223 patients (mean age 74.9 years, standard deviation [SD] 9.0 years) were swabbed and a virus was recovered from 11% of the symptomatic patients. Regardless of the sampling site, a calculated 4.8 times higher viral load (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–17, p = 0.017) was obtained using the nylon flocked swabs as compared to the rayon swabs. Also, regardless of the type of swab, a calculated 19 times higher viral load was found in the samples from the nasopharynx as compared to the oropharynx (95% CI 5.4–67.4, p < 0.001). When swabbing for respiratory viruses in elderly patients, nasopharyngeal rather than oropharyngeal samples should be obtained. Nylon flocked swabs appear to be more efficient than rayon swabs.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.201170413,-0.034622499,-0.03818209,-0.04551687,0.006645463,-0.074431784,-0.042801966,0.049280677,-0.113067893,-0.003075365,0.009947782,0.036423178,-0.05651415,0.050302777,-0.028381731,0.011702238,-0.00951875,-0.071638803,0.076105625,-0.036534043,-0.062532211,-0.000184303,-0.025216726,0.014211523,0.000482038,-0.003778652,-0.005046902,-0.089712711,-0.067122013,-0.049442421
Coronavirus-positive Nasopharyngeal Aspirate as Predictor for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Mortality,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has caused a major epidemic worldwide. A novel coronavirus is deemed to be the causative agent. Early diagnosis can be made with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal aspirate samples. We compared symptoms of 156 SARS-positive and 62 SARS-negative patients in Hong Kong; SARS was confirmed by RT-PCR. The RT-PCR–positive patients had significantly more shortness of breath, a lower lymphocyte count, and a lower lactate dehydrogenase level; they were also more likely to have bilateral and multifocal chest radiograph involvement, to be admitted to intensive care, to need mechanical ventilation, and to have higher mortality rates. By multivariate analysis, positive RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal aspirate samples was an independent predictor of death within 30 days.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.156778074,0.311195213,-0.021525409,-0.011751645,-0.02539749,-0.078367209,-0.113828933,-0.148808874,-0.16287074,-0.015997023,0.02849766,0.034411691,-0.028293396,0.120717269,0.021383194,-0.003721553,0.076550462,0.045440683,-0.022384394,-0.024897154,0.008755916,0.020062034,-0.101262465,0.023978482,-0.0041733,0.00249565,0.043016439,-0.060534728,0.035520258,-0.049148976
Is respiratory viral infection really an important trigger of asthma exacerbations in children?,"We performed a prospective cohort study from September 2003 to December 2004 to delineate attributing the effect of different respiratory viral infections including newly discovered ones to asthma exacerbations in children in Hong Kong. One hundred and fourteen children aged 6–14 years with chronic stable asthma and on regular inhaled steroid were monitored for respiratory symptoms over a full calendar year from recruitment. They would attend the study clinic if peak expiratory flow rate decreased to below 80% of their baselines, if they met a predefined symptom score, or if parents subjectively felt them developing a cold. Virological diagnosis using virus culture, antigen detection, and polymerase chain reaction methods on nasal swab specimens would be attempted for all these visits irrespective of triggers. Physician diagnosed outcome of each episode was documented. Three hundred and five episodes of respiratory illnesses were captured in the cohort. Nasal specimens were available in 166 episodes, 92 of which were diagnosed as asthma exacerbations, and 74 non-asthma related episodes. Respiratory viruses were detected in 61 of 166 episodes (36.7%). There was no significant difference in virus detection rate between asthma exacerbations (32 out of 97 episodes, 34.8%) and non-asthma respiratory illnesses (29 out of 79 episodes, 39.2%). Although newly discovered respiratory viruses were identified in these episodes, rhinovirus was the commonest organism associated with both asthma exacerbations and non-asthma related episodes. Plausible explanations for much lower virus detection rate than previously reported include improved personal hygiene and precautionary measures taken during respiratory tract infections in the immediate post-severe acute respiratory syndrome period together with a significant contribution of other adverse factors like environmental air pollution. We conclude that not all viral infections in children with asthma lead to an asthma exacerbation and the attributing effect of different triggers of asthma exacerbations in children vary across different time periods and across different localities.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.155874992,-0.085618632,-0.06530521,-0.024389106,0.008750238,-0.088840118,0.084513079,-0.053515474,0.043670742,0.032243983,-0.017341332,-0.049863361,-0.022231533,-0.050089332,0.054785552,0.021147072,0.016408953,-0.127546131,0.076834766,-0.054013583,-0.036216333,-0.196198605,-0.086964048,0.109775545,0.000642964,0.13828163,-0.081835904,-0.011636756,0.129024115,0.116325935
SARS–associated Coronavirus Replication in Cell Lines,"Given the potential for laboratory-associated severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections, we must know which cell lines are susceptible to the virus. We investigated 21 cell lines routinely used for virus isolation or research. After infection with SARS-CoV, cells were observed for cytopathic effects, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure ongoing viral replication. An indirect immunofluorescence assay was also used as a confirmatory test. The study identified 10 new cell lines capable of supporting the replication of SARS-CoV and confirmed the susceptibility of 4 cell lines previously reported.

Rapid Identification of Emerging Pathogens: Coronavirus,"We describe a new approach for infectious disease surveillance that facilitates rapid identification of known and emerging pathogens. The process uses broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify nucleic acid targets from large groupings of organisms, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry for accurate mass measurements of PCR products, and base composition signature analysis to identify organisms in a sample. We demonstrate this principle by using 14 isolates of 9 diverse Coronavirus spp., including the severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We show that this method could identify and distinguish between SARS and other known CoV, including the human CoV 229E and OC43, individually and in a mixture of all 3 human viruses. The sensitivity of detection, measured by using titered SARS-CoV spiked into human serum, was ≈1 PFU/mL.

"Bat Coronaviruses and Experimental Infection of Bats, the Philippines","Fifty-two bats captured during July 2008 in the Philippines were tested by reverse transcription–PCR to detect bat coronavirus (CoV) RNA.

Phylogenetic analysis of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene showed that groups 1 and 2 CoVs were similar to Bat-CoV/China/A515/2005 (95% nt sequence identity) and Bat-CoV/HKU9–1/China/2007 (83% identity), respectively. To propagate group 2 CoVs obtained from a lesser dog-faced fruit bat (Cynopterus brachyotis), we administered intestine samples orally to Leschenault rousette bats (Rousettus leschenaulti) maintained in our laboratory.

"Molecular Epidemiology of SARS-associated Coronavirus, Beijing","Single nucleotide variations (SNVs) at 5 loci (17564, 21721, 22222, 23823, and 27827) were used to define the molecular epidemiologic characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from Beijing patients. Five fragments targeted at the SNV loci were amplified directly from clinical samples by using reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), before sequencing the amplified products. Analyses of 45 sequences obtained from 29 patients showed that the GGCTC motif dominated among samples collected from March to early April 2003; the TGTTT motif predominanted afterwards. The switch from GGCTC to TGTTT was observed among patients belonging to the same cluster, which ruled out the possibility of the coincidental superposition of 2 epidemics running in parallel in Beijing.

Managing Febrile Respiratory Illnesses during a Hypothetical SARS Outbreak,"Since the World Health Organization declared the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) contained in July 2003, new cases have periodically reemerged in Asia. This situation has placed hospitals and health officials worldwide on heightened alert. In a future outbreak, rapidly and accurately distinguishing SARS from other common febrile respiratory illnesses (FRIs) could be difficult. We constructed a decision-analysis model to identify the most efficient strategies for managing undifferentiated FRIs within a hypothetical SARS outbreak in New York City during the season of respiratory infections. If establishing reliable epidemiologic links were not possible, societal costs would exceed $2.0 billion per month. SARS testing with existing polymerase chain reaction assays would have harmful public health and economic consequences if SARS made up <0.1% of circulating FRIs.

Coronaviridae and SARS-associated Coronavirus Strain HSR1,"During the recent severe acute respiratory (SARS) outbreak, the etiologic agent was identified as a new coronavirus (CoV). We have isolated a SARS-associated CoV (SARS-CoV) strain by injecting Vero cells with a sputum specimen from an Italian patient affected by a severe pneumonia; the patient traveled from Vietnam to Italy in March 2003. Ultrastructural analysis of infected Vero cells showed the virions within cell vesicles and around the cell membrane. The full-length viral genome sequence was similar to those derived from the Hong-Kong Hotel M isolate. By using both real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction TaqMan assay and an infectivity plaque assay, we determined that approximately 360 viral genomes were required to generate a PFU. In addition, heparin (100 μg/mL) inhibited infection of Vero cells by 50%.

Real-Time Reverse Transcription–Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay for SARS-associated Coronavirus,"A real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed to rapidly detect the severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV).

Susceptibility of Pigs and Chickens to SARS Coronavirus,"An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans, associated with a new coronavirus, was reported in Southeast Asia, Europe, and North America in early 2003. To address speculations that the virus originated in domesticated animals, or that domestic species were susceptible to the virus, we inoculated 6-week-old pigs and chickens intravenously, intranasally, ocularly, and orally with 10(6) PFU of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Clinical signs did not develop in any animal, nor were gross pathologic changes evident on postmortem examinations. Attempts at virus isolation were unsuccessful; however, viral RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in blood of both species during the first week after inoculation, and in chicken organs at 2 weeks after inoculation. Virus-neutralizing antibodies developed in the pigs. Our results indicate that these animals do not play a role as amplifying hosts for SARS-CoV.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.008203502,0.319172351,-0.154859133,-0.01065381,0.03456614,0.045586518,-0.007925508,-0.197813776,-0.036212842,0.013824547,0.042444834,-0.053477189,0.009527947,-0.015554866,0.106138079,-0.005765241,-0.045070089,-0.015928423,0.021395804,0.07466715,-0.007777695,-0.012600983,-0.013475907,0.022858001,-0.000894157,-0.025114511,-0.041301924,0.007046768,-0.019797842,0.00192932
"Introduction of SARS in France, March–April, 2003","We describe severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in France. Patients meeting the World Health Organization definition of a suspected case underwent a clinical, radiologic, and biologic assessment at the closest university-affiliated infectious disease ward. Suspected cases were immediately reported to the Institut de Veille Sanitaire. Probable case-patients were isolated, their contacts quarantined at home, and were followed for 10 days after exposure. Five probable cases occurred from March through April 2003; four were confirmed as SARS coronavirus by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, serologic testing, or both. The index case-patient (patient A), who had worked in the French hospital of Hanoi, Vietnam, was the most probable source of transmission for the three other confirmed cases; two had been exposed to patient A while on the Hanoi-Paris flight of March 22–23.

"Serologic and Molecular Biologic Methods for SARS-associated Coronavirus Infection, Taiwan","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has raised a global alert since March 2003. After its causative agent, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was confirmed, laboratory methods, including virus isolation, reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and serologic methods, have been quickly developed. In this study, we evaluated four serologic tests ( neutralization test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA], immunofluorescent assay [IFA], and immunochromatographic test [ICT]) for detecting antibodies to SARS-CoV in sera of 537 probable SARS case-patients with correlation to the RT-PCR . With the neutralization test as a reference method, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 98.2%, 98.7%, 98.7%, and 98.4% for ELISA; 99.1%, 87.8%, 88.1% and 99.1% for IFA; 33.6%, 98.2%, 95.7%, and 56.1% for ICT, respectively.

The latest stool sample that was positive by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was collected on day 75 while the patient was receiving intensive care. Tracheal aspirate and stool samples had a higher diagnostic yield (RT-PCR average positive rate for first 2 weeks: 66.7% and 56.5%, respectively). Pooled throat and nasal swabs, rectal swab, nasal swab, throat swab, and nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens provided a moderate yield (29.7%–40.0%), whereas throat washing and urine specimens showed a lower yield (17.3% and 4.5%). The collection procedures for stool and pooled nasal and throat swab specimens were the least likely to transmit infection, and the combination gave the highest yield for coronavirus detection by RT-PCR.

Genetic Variation of SARS Coronavirus in Beijing Hospital,"To characterize genetic variation of severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) transmitted in the Beijing area during the epidemic outbreak of 2003, we sequenced 29 full-length S genes of SARS-CoV from 20 hospitalized SARS patients on our unit, the Beijing 302 Hospital. Viral RNA templates for the S-gene amplification were directly extracted from raw clinical samples, including plasma, throat swab, sputum, and stool, during the course of the epidemic in the Beijing area. We used a TA-cloning assay with direct analysis of nested reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction products in sequence. One hundred thirteen sequence variations with nine recurrent variant sites were identified in analyzed S-gene sequences compared with the BJ01 strain of SARS-CoV.

HCoV-HKU1 is therefore likely circulating in the United States and is associated with upper and lower respiratory tract disease.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.195597826,-0.083657993,-0.109963923,0.021830229,0.16952076,-0.096527096,0.046271242,-0.081996652,0.156958155,-0.078463429,-0.020188193,0.316083588,0.258790976,0.140775977,0.023874767,0.053675498,-0.055084794,-0.058934088,-0.05449903,0.025765954,-0.021051861,0.019765421,0.017411087,-0.057929327,0.001716625,0.023483395,0.019977391,0.013296234,0.032794081,0.017206587
Microbiological study of patients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD) and the usefulness of analytical and clinical parameters in its identification (VIRAE study),"PURPOSE: Respiratory infection is the most common cause for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD). The aim of this work was to study the etiology of the respiratory infection in order to assess the usefulness of the clinical and analytical parameters used for COPD identification. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 132 patients over a period of 2 years. The etiology of the respiratory infection was studied by conventional sputum, paired serology tests for atypical bacteria, and viral diagnostic techniques (immunochromatography, immunofluorescence, cell culture, and molecular biology techniques). We grouped the patients into four groups based on the pathogens isolated (bacterial versus. viral, known etiology versus unknown etiology) and compared the groups. RESULTS: A pathogen was identified in 48 patients. The pathogen was identified through sputum culture in 34 patients, seroconversion in three patients, and a positive result from viral techniques in 14 patients. No significant differences in identifying etiology were observed in the clinical and analytical parameters within the different groups. The most cost-effective tests were the sputum test and the polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION: Based on our experience, clinical and analytical parameters are not useful for the etiological identification of COPD exacerbations. Diagnosing COPD exacerbation is difficult, with the conventional sputum test for bacterial etiology and molecular biology techniques for viral etiology providing the most profitability. Further studies are necessary to identify respiratory syndromes or analytical parameters that can be used to identify the etiology of new AE-COPD cases without the laborious diagnostic techniques.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.158145699,-0.027173346,-0.030454458,-0.082954483,-0.092207377,-0.058903034,0.0079853,0.070534955,-0.130246166,0.143019467,-0.073390422,-0.037874869,0.076583418,0.004809639,-0.011887874,-0.039670725,0.025514401,0.029902954,-0.039726817,0.002403901,0.039165963,-0.082680341,0.038968321,-0.023697529,0.004049612,0.009751208,-0.010229525,-0.005690279,-0.018978286,0.09517835
Genetic variation analysis of reemerging porcine epidemic diarrhea virus prevailing in central China from 2010 to 2011,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea has re-emerged with devastating impact in central China since October 2010. To investigate and analyze the reason of this outbreak, the M and ORF3 genes of 15 porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDV), which were collected from different areas of central China during October 2010 and December 2011, were amplified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, cloned, sequenced, and analyzed. Sequence analyses showed that the nucleotides and amino acids were changed at some sites in the M and ORF3 genes of the 15 PEDV strains compared with those genes of CV777 reference strain. Based on the phylogenetic analyses, PEDVs in central China and reference strains could be separated into three groups: G1, G2, and G3. The 15 PEDV strains belonged to G3 group and showed a close relationship with Korean strains (2007), Thai strains (2007–2008), and partial other Chinese strains (2010–2011), but differed genetically from European strains (Br1/87) and the vaccine strain (CV777 vs) being used in China. Furthermore, all 15 PEDV strains from central China and some other isolates in China from 2003 to 2007 (LJB-03, QH, and LZC) belonged to different group. Therefore, PEDV exhibits rapid variation and genetic evolution, and the currently prevailing PEDV strains in central China are a new genotype.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.034865724,0.002318396,0.069625657,-0.154145957,0.176220664,0.102484147,-0.041974834,-0.043231119,-0.000495955,-0.009955491,0.018202586,0.16451688,-0.15493308,-0.009796378,0.222882469,-0.204599464,-0.092375458,0.076888541,-0.070624569,0.163043753,-0.093916097,-0.036444304,0.050403407,0.014104132,-0.048767168,-0.052257194,0.028180292,0.067551105,0.021721346,0.051733822
A Prospective Evaluation of Real-Time PCR Assays for the Detection of Orientia tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia spp. for Early Diagnosis of Rickettsial Infections during the Acute Phase of Undifferentiated Febrile Illness,"One hundred and eighty febrile patients were analyzed in a prospective evaluation of Orientia tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia spp. real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for early diagnosis of rickettsial infections. By paired serology, 3.9% (7 of 180) and 6.1% (11 of 180) of patients were confirmed to have acute scrub or murine typhus, respectively. The PCR assays for the detection of O. tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia spp. had high specificity (99.4% [95% confidence interval (CI): 96.8–100] and 100% [95% CI: 97.8–100], respectively). The PCR results were also compared with immunoglobulin M (IgM) immunofluorescence assay (IFA) on acute sera. For O. tsutsugamushi, PCR sensitivity was twice that of acute specimen IgM IFA (28.6% versus 14.3%; McNemar's P = 0.3). For Rickettsia spp., PCR was four times as sensitive as acute specimen IgM IFA (36.4% versus 9.1%; P = 0.08), although this was not statistically significant. Whole blood and buffy coat, but not serum, were acceptable specimens for these PCRs. Further evaluation of these assays in a larger prospective study is warranted.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.101908184,0.040557017,0.091259172,-0.04569797,-0.039454236,-0.043373953,-0.025345313,-0.006559685,-0.059137198,-0.04390155,-0.009481611,0.038709081,-0.033519659,-0.002601856,-0.028582367,0.035708867,-0.000712011,-0.042151896,0.056528578,-0.097891961,-0.036298247,0.013810844,0.057391124,-0.022265001,0.011740903,-0.003263725,0.015575929,-0.140606774,-0.036194213,-0.022198595
In vitro RNA interference targeting the DNA polymerase gene inhibits orf virus replication in primary ovine fetal turbinate cells,"Orf, which is caused by orf virus (ORFV), is distributed worldwide and is endemic in most sheep- and/or goat-raising countries. RNA interference (RNAi) pathways have emerged as important regulators of virus-host cell interactions. In this study, the specific effect of RNAi on the replication of ORFV was explored. The application of RNA interference (RNAi) inhibited the replication of ORFV in cell culture by targeting the ORF025 gene of ORFV, which encodes the viral polymerase. Three small interfering RNA (siRNA) (named siRNA704, siRNA1017 and siRNA1388) were prepared by in vitro transcription. The siRNAs were evaluated for antiviral activity against the ORFV Jilin isolate by the observation of cytopathic effects (CPE), virus titration, and real-time PCR. After 48 h of infection, siRNA704, siRNA1017 and siRNA1388 reduced virus titers by 59- to 199-fold and reduced the level of viral replication by 73-89 %. These results suggest that these three siRNAs can efficiently inhibit ORFV genome replication and infectious virus production. RNAi targeting of the DNA polymerase gene is therefore potentially useful for studying the replication of ORFV and may have potential therapeutic applications.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.157175254,-0.043609793,-0.013417464,0.053707309,-0.088314349,0.010962086,0.01006342,-0.02087201,0.045195948,0.043422795,0.002977474,-0.071773754,0.003108865,0.104507405,0.030198188,-0.000999286,-0.013951251,0.015247608,0.053087258,0.040284107,-0.008238922,0.042356434,0.004214969,-0.004252203,-0.049285375,-0.001583603,0.050432601,-0.036250884,-0.033919335,0.011434568
Common and unique features of viral RNA-dependent polymerases,"Eukaryotes and bacteria can be infected with a wide variety of RNA viruses.

Detection of Respiratory Viruses in Nasopharyngeal Swab and Adenoid Tissue from Children Submitted to Adenoidectomy: Pre- and Postoperative Analysis,"Introduction The presence of respiratory viruses in lymphoid tissues of the nasopharynx and oropharynx and its impact on recurrent infections and hypertrophy of these tissues are not yet fully understood. Objective To identify and determine the prevalence of major respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal secretions and adenoid tissue pre- and postoperatively of children undergoing adenoidectomy. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted in 36 patients under 12 years of age with upper airway lymphoid hypertrophy who were undergoing adenoidectomy, in which various respiratory viruses were investigated using real-time polymerase chain reaction in adenoid tissue and nasopharyngeal secretions collected preoperatively and 30 days postoperatively. Results At least 1 viral agent was isolated in any of the samples collected in 58.3% of children and 25.9% of total samples. Respiratory viruses were identified in 33.8% of preoperative nasopharyngeal specimens and in 19.8% of postoperative secretion. Of the 21 patients with positive results for any respiratory virus, 6 (28.6%) had more than 1 virus. Considering all 36 respiratory viruses found, the main agent isolated was rhinovirus (27.8%), followed by bocavirus (22.2%). Conclusion The virus found more frequently in all samples was rhinovirus. After removal of adenoid tissue, there was a decrease in the prevalence of the virus contained in nasopharyngeal secretion 30 days after surgery.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.221569712,-0.085775655,-0.065533502,0.020226112,0.063570851,-0.087465907,0.01398731,-0.027271129,-0.00137556,0.067197857,0.019246178,-0.036572077,0.005156215,0.047552625,0.076706745,-0.034208031,0.039568693,-0.084155646,0.078838109,0.00413919,0.010915557,-0.010416342,-0.035533831,0.047788915,-0.015332546,0.047305814,-0.036593989,0.008857638,-0.02762193,-0.100977714
Respiratory Syncytial Virus Outbreak in the Basic Military Training Camp of the Republic of Korea Air Force,"OBJECTIVES: An outbreak of acute febrile illness occurred in the Republic of Korea Air Force boot camp from May to July 2011. An epidemiological investigation of the causative agent, which was of a highly infective nature, was conducted. METHODS: Throat swabs were carried out and a multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was performed to identify possible causative factors. RESULTS: The mean age of patients who had febrile illness during the study period was 20.24 years. The multiplex RT-PCR assay identified respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as the causative agent. The main symptoms were sore throat (76.0%), sputum (72.8%), cough (72.1%), tonsillar hypertrophy (67.9%), and rhinorrhea (55.9%). The mean temperature was 38.75°C and the attack rate among the recruits was 15.7% (588 out of 3750 recruits), while the mean duration of fever was 2.3 days. The prognosis was generally favorable with supportive care but recurrent fever occurred in 10.1% of the patients within a month. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first epidemiological study of an RSV outbreak that developed in a healthy young adult group. In the event of an outbreak of an acute febrile illness of a highly infective nature in facilities used by a young adult group, RSV should be considered among the possible causative agents.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.167794504,-0.000639402,0.002980238,-0.013861381,-0.00340626,-0.056615861,-0.024727047,-0.013905082,-0.011845384,-0.04687561,0.017205581,-0.018489565,-0.109283422,0.002169993,-0.023621351,-0.014648063,0.014192774,0.054107505,0.005524099,-0.005706751,0.026137814,-0.061547248,-0.062166815,-0.039809074,0.016014367,-0.024027004,0.137091254,0.092017558,-0.041513997,-0.003026687
Epidemiology and Virology of Acute Respiratory Infections During the First Year of Life: A Birth Cohort Study in Vietnam,"BACKGROUND: Understanding viral etiology and age-specific incidence of acute respiratory infections in infants can help identify risk groups and inform vaccine delivery, but community-based data is lacking from tropical settings. METHODS: One thousand four hundred and seventy-eight infants in urban Ho Chi Minh City and 981 infants in a semi-rural district in southern Vietnam were enrolled at birth and followed to 1 year of age. Acute respiratory infection (ARI) episodes were identified through clinic-based illness surveillance, hospital admissions and self-reports. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from infants with respiratory symptoms and tested for 14 respiratory pathogens using multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Estimated incidence of ARI was 542 and 2691 per 1000 infant-years, and hospitalization rates for ARI were 81 and 138 per 1000 infant-years, in urban and semi-rural cohorts, respectively, from clinic- and hospital-based surveillance. However self-reported ARI episodes were just 1.5-fold higher in the semi-rural versus urban cohort, indicating that part of the urban–rural difference was explained by under-ascertainment in the urban cohort. Incidence was higher in infants ≥6 months of age than <6 months, but this was pathogen-specific. One or more viruses were detected in 53% (urban) and 64% (semi-rural) of samples from outpatients with ARI and in 78% and 66% of samples from hospitalized ARI patients, respectively. The most frequently detected viruses were rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus A and bocavirus. ARI-associated hospitalizations were associated with longer stays and more frequent ICU admission than other infections. CONCLUSIONS: ARI is a significant cause of morbidity in Vietnamese infants and influenza virus A is an under-appreciated cause of vaccine-preventable disease and hospitalizations in this tropical setting. Public health strategies to reduce infant ARI incidence and hospitalization rates are needed.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.17074207,-0.097944146,-0.064258367,0.023585107,0.030984701,-0.00421969,0.01506532,-0.03374923,0.039490477,-0.017187537,0.024710716,-0.003073415,-0.017124914,-0.071619629,0.047323744,0.045145172,-0.00049171,-0.088807818,0.054489413,-0.030003778,-0.060203585,-0.078318003,-0.05151016,0.023484393,0.103586721,-0.02522915,0.017568963,0.042272144,0.027030363,-0.076833638
Severe Measles Infection: The Spectrum of Disease in 36 Critically Ill Adult Patients,"France has recently witnessed a nationwide outbreak of measles. Data on severe forms of measles in adults are lacking. We sought to describe the epidemiologic, clinical, treatment, and prognostic aspects of the disease in adult patients who required admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). We performed a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 36 adults admitted to a total of 64 ICUs throughout France for complications of measles from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2011. All cases of measles were confirmed by serologic testing and/or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The cohort consisted of 21 male and 15 female patients, with a median age of 29.2 years (25th–75th interquartile range [IQR], 27.2–34.2 yr) and a median Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) of 13 (IQR, 9–18). Among the 26 patients whose measles vaccination status was documented, none had received 2 injections. One patient had developed measles during childhood. Underlying comorbid conditions included chronic respiratory disease in 9 patients, immunosuppression in 7 patients, and obesity in 3 patients, while measles affected 5 pregnant women. Respiratory complications induced by measles infection led to ICU admission in 32 cases, and measles-related neurologic complications led to ICU admission in 2 cases. Two patients were admitted due to concurrent respiratory and neurologic complications. Bacterial superinfection of measles-related airway infection was suspected in 28 patients and was documented in 8. Four cases of community-acquired pneumonia, 6 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia, 1 case of tracheobronchitis, and 2 cases of sinusitis were microbiologically substantiated. Of 11 patients who required mechanical ventilation, 9 developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among the patients with ARDS, extraalveolar air leak complications occurred in 4 cases. Five patients died, all of whom were severely immunocompromised. On follow-up, 1 patient had severe chronic respiratory failure related to lung fibrosis, and 2 patients had mild lower limb paraparesis along with bladder dysfunction, both of which were ascribable to measles-induced encephalitis and myelitis. Among the 5 pregnant patients, the course of measles infection was uneventful, albeit 1 patient underwent emergent cesarean delivery because of fetal growth restriction. Measles is a disease with protean and potentially deceptive clinical manifestations, especially in the immunocompromised patient. Measles-associated pneumonitis and its complications, and less commonly postinfectious encephalomyelitis, are the main source of morbidity and mortality. In contrast with the usually benign course of the disease in immunocompetent patients, measles occurring in immunocompromised patients gives rise to lethal complications including ARDS, with or without bacterial superinfection. Other patients potentially at high risk for severe measles are young adults and pregnant women. Measles pneumonitis may predispose to air leak disease in patients using mechanical ventilation. To date, vaccination remains the most potent tool to control measles infection.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.136865345,-0.005870384,-0.09970362,-0.127435829,-0.0741297,-0.02015519,-0.059510115,0.103226264,-0.108460149,0.033378027,-0.038133214,0.037605371,-0.008821707,0.036519735,-0.04144848,0.021760845,0.008298397,0.066307703,-0.02792076,0.050736465,0.052260364,-0.053191776,-0.05030256,-0.01847553,0.000438594,-0.019892933,-0.006675219,0.023621513,-0.03849925,-0.002294985
Development of a Rapid Detection Method for Potato virus X by Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification,"The primary step for efficient control of viral diseases is the development of simple, rapid, and sensitive virus detection. Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) has been used to detect viral RNA molecules because of its simplicity and high sensitivity for a number of viruses. RT-LAMP for the detection of Potato virus X (PVX) was developed and compared with conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to demonstrate its advantages over RT-PCR. RT-LAMP reactions were conducted with or without a set of loop primers since one out of six primers showed PVX specificity. Based on real-time monitoring, RT-LAMP detected PVX around 30 min, compared to 120 min for RT-PCR. By adding a fluorescent reagent during the reaction, the extra step of visualization by gel electrophoresis was not necessary. RT-LAMP was conducted using simple inexpensive instruments and a regular incubator to evaluate whether RNA could be amplified at a constant temperature instead of using an expensive thermal cycler. This study shows the potential of RT-LAMP for the diagnosis of viral diseases and PVX epidemiology because of its simplicity and rapidness compared to RT-PCR.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.028489455,0.138667194,0.388036387,0.190964087,-0.049538978,-0.120951167,-0.007132175,-0.00604996,-0.029255208,-0.067585706,-0.020575528,0.035283173,-0.056884237,0.15209031,-0.105914005,0.063150641,0.105403573,0.094164504,-0.197445051,0.017545493,-0.159427338,-0.0191073,-0.144440726,0.293509572,0.162741149,0.03330873,-0.044804786,0.076296647,-0.009696953,-0.023066133

Background There is a requirement to detect and differentiate pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (H1N1v) and established swine influenza A viruses (SIVs) by real time reverse transcription (RRT) PCR methods. Objectives First, modify an existing matrix (M) gene RRT PCR for sensitive generic detection of H1N1v and other European SIVs. Second, design an H1 RRT PCR to specifically detect H1N1v infections. Methods RRT PCR assays were used to test laboratory isolates of SIV (n = 51; 37 European and 14 North American), H1N1v (n = 5) and avian influenza virus (AIV; n = 43). Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were calculated for swabs (n = 133) and tissues (n = 116) collected from field cases and pigs infected experimentally with SIVs and H1N1v. Results The “perfect match” M gene RRT PCR was the most sensitive variant of this test for detection of established European SIVs and H1N1v. H1 RRT PCR specifically detected H1N1v but not European SIVs. Validation with clinical specimens included comparison with virus isolation (VI) as a “gold standard”, while field infection with H1N1v in swine was independently confirmed by sequencing H1N1v amplified by conventional RT PCR. “Perfect match” M gene RRT PCR had 100% sensitivity and 95·2% specificity for swabs, 93·6% and 98·6% for tissues. H1 RRT PCR demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 99·1%, respectively, for the swabs, and 100% and 100% for the tissues. Conclusions Two RRT PCRs for the purposes of (i) generic detection of SIV and H1N1v infection in European pigs, and for (ii) specific detection of H1N1v (pandemic influenza) infection were validated.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.073495759,0.015464281,0.125450311,0.06356424,0.004302946,0.109134286,-0.081649492,0.020000025,0.000740047,-0.03911645,0.016169315,0.000981624,-0.014925015,0.013175207,0.04802294,-0.010376532,0.020591398,-0.027984903,-0.014278534,-0.084627376,-0.020434074,0.004922175,0.044530782,-0.043165762,-0.027594915,0.009153746,-0.019427271,-0.026988133,0.012565531,0.013226501
Acute respiratory infection and bacteraemia as causes of non-malarial febrile illness in African children: a narrative review,"The replacement of “presumptive treatment for malaria” by “test before treat” strategies for the management of febrile illness is raising awareness of the importance of knowing more about the causes of illness in children who are suspected to have malaria but return a negative parasitological test. The most common cause of non-malarial febrile illness (NMFI) in African children is respiratory tract inflection. Whilst the bacterial causes of NMFI are well known, the increasing use of sensitive techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests is revealing large numbers of viruses that are potential respiratory pathogens. However, many of these organisms are commonly present in the respiratory tract of healthy children so causality and risk factors for pneumonia remain poorly understood. Inflection with a combination of viral and bacterial pathogens is increasingly recognised as important in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Similarly, blood stream inflections with organisms typically grown by aerobic culture are well known but a growing number of organisms that can be identified only by PCR, viral culture, or serology are now recognised to be common pathogens in African children. The high mortality of hospitalised children on the first or second day of admission suggests that, unless results are rapidly available, diagnostic tests to identify specific causes of illness will still be of limited use in guiding the potentially life saving decisions relating to initial treatment of children admitted to district hospitals in Africa with severe febrile illness and a negative test for malaria. Malaria control and the introduction of vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b and pneumococcal disease are contributing to improved child survival in Africa. However, increased parasitological testing for malaria is associated with increased use of antbiotics to which resistance is already high.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.157052623,-0.062687619,-0.036725177,-0.014503641,-0.047298743,-0.048807854,0.075779951,-0.015648553,0.023639059,0.063116645,-0.012446259,-0.040900489,0.031716591,-0.106350951,0.009839236,-0.001593449,-0.06152118,0.005034015,-0.054157181,-0.033562632,-0.047058193,0.105896923,0.045193521,-0.03530271,-0.013999046,0.038285581,-0.007007418,-0.056182948,0.055863492,-0.025582848

Influenza virus assays based on virus‐inducible reporter cell lines,"Background Virus‐inducible reporter genes have been used as the basis of virus detection and quantitation assays for a number of viruses. A strategy for influenza A virus‐induction of a reporter gene was recently described. In this report, we describe the extension of this strategy to influenza B virus, the generation of stable cell lines with influenza A and B virus‐inducible reporter genes, and the use of these cells in various clinically relevant viral assays. Each of the cell lines described herein constitutively express an RNA transcript that contains a reporter gene coding region flanked by viral 5′‐ and 3′‐untranslated regions (UTR) and therefore mimics an influenza virus genomic segment. Upon infection of the cells with influenza virus the virus‐inducible reporter gene segment (VIRGS) is replicated and transcribed by the viral polymerase complex resulting in reporter gene expression. Findings Reporter gene induction occurs after infection with a number of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of influenza virus including several H5N1 strains. The induction is dose‐dependent and highly specific for influenza A or influenza B viruses. Conclusions These cell lines provide the basis of simple, rapid, and objective assays that involve virus quantitation such as determination of viral titer, assessment of antiviral susceptibility, and determination of antibody neutralization titer. These cell lines could be very useful for influenza virus researchers and vaccine manufacturers.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.021212939,-0.100660595,0.011380521,0.136920375,-0.014196048,0.258350683,-0.130731274,-0.04022447,0.028094697,-0.044500848,-0.050617566,-0.078074413,0.046082461,0.055201926,0.007290465,-0.025250855,-0.001800689,-0.043785968,0.001490989,0.018879421,0.041963891,0.002715501,0.051187902,0.052702299,-0.040580941,-0.018067633,0.030802442,-0.011581917,-0.032791756,0.053207455
Genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses isolated from pigs during 2000 to 2005 in Thailand,"Background Recent studies have revealed the existence of genetic diversity in swine influenza viruses (SIVs) in the world. In Thailand, there has been a little information on the molecular characteristics of the SIVs since the first isolation of viruses of H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes in the late 1970s. Our previous study demonstrated that Thai H1N1 SIVs possessed the classical swine H1 and avian‐like swine N1 genes (Takemae et al., Proceedings of the Options for the Control of Influenza VI.2007;350–353). Objectives In the present study, we genetically characterized 12 SIVs including those of H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 subtypes isolated between 2000 and 2005. Methods We determined the entire nucleotide sequences of the eight gene segments of those isolates. Results Phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of nine distinct genotypes amongst the Thai SIVs. These genotypes arose from multiple introductions of classical swine, avian‐like swine and human viruses. The existence of two distinct sublineages within classical swine H1 and NS, avian‐like swine PA and M and human H3 and N2 genes of the Thai SIVs suggested that introduction of viruses of classical swine, avian‐like swine and human origins occurred twice respectively into the Thai pig population. The predominance of avian‐like swine genes amongst the Thai SIVs was evident. In particular, three polymerase (PB1, PB2 and PA) and matrix genes of avian‐like swine origin were retained in all the Thai SIVs examined. Conclusions These observations may suggest that genes of avian‐like swine lineages have some advantages to be maintained in pigs as seen in the SIVs established through multiple introductions in other regions.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.025284756,-0.042896685,0.023768919,-0.009476815,0.051474045,0.155246008,-0.026748629,-0.007901855,-0.002733498,-0.022827925,-0.018916864,0.03760701,-0.024898431,-0.008274149,0.052244062,-0.030058141,-0.007843634,-0.007923241,-0.044931325,-0.000439761,0.009060644,-0.013134971,-0.001464531,0.006050473,-0.08638233,-0.000676488,-0.031997093,0.023935893,0.026987752,-0.02720474
Virus detection and its association with symptoms during influenza‐like illness in a sample of healthy adults enrolled in a randomised controlled vaccine trial,"Background Viral respiratory infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Many new aetiological agents have been described recently. Objectives We looked for respiratory viruses in a population‐based sample of healthy adults with influenza‐like illness (ILI). We investigated host and spatio‐temporal associations with virus isolation and host, spatio‐temporal and virus associations with self‐reported symptoms. Patients/Methods We recruited 586 participants experiencing 651 illness episodes from a population of healthy adults enrolled in an influenza vaccine effectiveness trial. At ILI assessment visits, a respiratory swab was collected and tested for viruses using a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Participants also completed a questionnaire detailing their clinical course in 336 episodes. Results Of 643 samples analysed, a virus was identified in 44%. Half were picornaviruses, with influenza and coronaviruses the next most common. Individuals with influenza were significantly less likely to have been immunised than the reference (virus negative) population (OR = 0·52 (0·31, 0·87) P = 0·01). The mean symptom score (95% CI) reported by individuals with influenza was significantly higher than in all other episodes [Influenza: 10·2 (9·4, 10·9); Other: 7·4 (7·2, 7·7); Difference (95% CI): 2·5 (1·5, 3·5); P < 0·001]. In an analysis restricted to influenza‐positive cases, the symptom score was not attenuated by vaccination. Conclusions Our findings indicate that a greater number of symptoms are displayed by individuals presenting with influenza confirmed ILI compared with other agents that cause ILI. While influenza vaccination reduced the probability of influenza virus detection, symptom score for influenza‐positive ILI was not attenuated.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.207805606,-0.129019456,-0.069718487,0.179823015,0.013887091,0.283052997,-0.135140709,-0.013213282,-0.044115539,-0.115534519,0.025530085,0.004195274,-0.02310055,-0.027139566,-0.024323827,0.029927795,-0.03141779,-0.09648399,0.048818423,-0.040682171,-0.057089869,-0.064863679,-0.010395118,0.017685781,0.015522186,-0.031495445,-0.024334722,-0.050851354,-0.000158008,-0.008170854
Hospitalization due to human parainfluenza virus–associated lower respiratory tract illness in rural Thailand,"Background Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are an important cause of acute respiratory illness in young children but little is known about their epidemiology in the tropics. Methods From 2003–2007, we conducted surveillance for hospitalized respiratory illness in rural Thailand. We performed reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal specimens and enzyme immunoassay on paired sera Results Of 10,097 patients enrolled, 573 (5%) of all ages and 370 (9%) of children <5 years of age had evidence of HPIV infection (HPIV1=189, HPIV2=54, HPIV3=305, untyped=27). Average adjusted annual incidence of HPIV‐associated hospitalized respiratory illness was greatest in children aged <1 year (485 per 100,000 person years).

"Viral pneumonia in adults and older children in sub-Saharan Africa — epidemiology, aetiology, diagnosis and management","Community-acquired pneumonia causes substantial morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa with an estimated 131 million new cases each year. Viruses — such as influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus — are now recognised as important causes of respiratory disease in older children and adults in the developed world following the emergence of sensitive molecular diagnostic tests, recent severe viral epidemics, and the discovery of novel viruses. Few studies have comprehensively evaluated the viral aetiology of adult pneumonia in Africa, but it is likely to differ from Western settings due to varying seasonality and the high proportion of patients with immunosuppression and co-morbidities. Emerging data suggest a high prevalence of viral pathogens, as well as multiple viral and viral/bacterial infections in African adults with pneumonia. However, the interpretation of positive results from highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction tests can be challenging. Therapeutic and preventative options against viral respiratory infections are currently limited in the African setting.

Upper airway viruses and bacteria detection in clinical pneumonia in a population with high nasal colonisation do not relate to clinical signs,"Indigenous Australian children have high (up to 90%) rates of nasopharyngeal microbial colonisation and of hospitalisation for pneumonia. In Indigenous children hospitalised with pneumonia in Central Australia, we describe the nasopharyngeal detection of viruses and bacteria and assessed whether their presence related to signs of pneumonia (tachypnoea and/or chest in-drawing) on hospital admission and during subsequent days. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and data were prospectively collected from 145 children (median age = 23.5 months, interquartile range [IQR] 8.7–50) hospitalised with pneumonia at Alice Springs Hospital, Australia, between April 2001 and July 2002. The cohort was enrolled in a randomised controlled study using zinc and/or vitamin A supplementation. NPS were taken within 24 hours of hospitalisation and kept frozen at-80°C until analysed in 2014. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and 16 respiratory viruses. Uni- and multi-variate analyses were used to examine the relationships. One or more organisms were present in 137 (94.5%) NPS; 133 (91.7%) detected ≥ 1 bacterium, 34 (37.2%) for ≥ 1 virus and 50 (34.5%) were positive for both viruses and bacteria. C. pneumoniae (n = 3) and M. pneumoniae (n = 2) were rare. In multi-variate analyses, age < 12 months (odds ratio [OR] 6.6 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.7–25.4]) and fever (OR 4.1 [95% CI 1.7–10.4]) were associated with tachypnoea and chest in-drawing. However the presence of bacteria and/or virus type was not associated with tachypnoea and/or chest in-drawing on admission or during recovery. In children with high nasopharyngeal microbial colonisation rates, the utility of NPS in determining the diagnosis of clinical pneumonia or duration of tachypnoea or in-drawing is likely limited.

Respiratory Viruses and Atypical Bacteria Co-Infection in Children with Acute Respiratory Infection,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are one of the prevalent pediatric diseases. Coinfections of respiratory viruses and atypical bacterial respiratory pathogens are common. AIM: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of co-infection between respiratory pathogens including viruses, bacteria and atypical bacteria in a sample of Egyptian children presenting with symptoms of acute respiratory tract infection. METHODS: This one-year prospective cohort study conducted in Abo El Rish Pediatric Hospital, Cairo University over one year included children presenting with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Enrolled children were subjected to nasopharyngeal swabs or throat swabs and then processed to detect viral, bacterial and atypical bacterial causative agents by culture), retrotranscription polymerase, Monoplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Multiplex PCR. RESULTS: Viral etiological agents were detected in 20 cases (20.8%), while 76 patients (79.2%) had no definite viral aetiology. The most abundant virus detected was Rhinovirus in 36 (27.3%), followed by 21 (15.9%) were positive for RSV, 12 (9.1%) were positive for HMPV, 6 (4.5%) were positive for adenovirus and 3 (2.3%) were positive for influenza B. For Atypical bacterial causes Mycoplasma were positive for 9 (6.8%) cases and one case was positive for Bordetella parapertussis. Viral and atypical bacteria Co infection were detected in 14 (10.6%) of cases. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that coinfection with bacteria or atypical bacteria in children with acute respiratory tract infection is common and this co-infection can induce serious illness. The multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction should become an essential tool for epidemiological studies and can fill the gap between clinical presentation and definitive diagnosis.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.316592003,-0.107509424,-0.103502173,0.042098258,0.023195869,-0.121240103,0.031703779,-0.028770237,0.008326732,0.07026356,0.024592174,-0.074086129,0.010769742,-0.013986118,0.047247289,-0.050293304,0.031097563,-0.025350932,0.021294698,0.00583737,-0.015709571,0.089903846,0.027064751,-0.03257967,0.040157042,0.045652243,-0.038893546,0.044270606,0.063294066,-0.066918983
Stable Occupancy of the Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus-Encoded Deubiquitinase Blocks Viral Infection,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) infection can result in a severe hemorrhagic syndrome for which there are no antiviral interventions available to date. Certain RNA viruses, such as CCHFV, encode cysteine proteases of the ovarian tumor (OTU) family that antagonize interferon (IFN) production by deconjugating ubiquitin (Ub). The OTU of CCHFV, a negative-strand RNA virus, is dispensable for replication of the viral genome, despite being part of the large viral RNA polymerase. Here, we show that mutations that prevent binding of the OTU to cellular ubiquitin are required for the generation of recombinant CCHFV containing a mutated catalytic cysteine. Similarly, the high-affinity binding of a synthetic ubiquitin variant (UbV-CC4) to CCHFV OTU strongly inhibits viral growth. UbV-CC4 inhibits CCHFV infection even in the absence of intact IFN signaling, suggesting that its antiviral activity is not due to blocking the OTU’s immunosuppressive function. Instead, the prolonged occupancy of the OTU with UbV-CC4 directly targets viral replication by interfering with CCHFV RNA synthesis. Together, our data provide mechanistic details supporting the development of antivirals targeting viral OTUs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.113670934,-0.043506815,-0.047272771,0.007723158,-0.082706223,0.012169521,0.045563343,0.009936643,0.018917114,0.023001429,0.024104224,-0.004885506,-0.011752062,0.030124962,0.007779898,0.013963554,-0.010377189,0.006447361,-0.000865186,0.029453755,-0.014263205,0.024900311,-0.041896237,-0.006025092,0.014541688,-0.004289177,0.013675193,-0.017465986,-0.001804721,0.010710994
Spectrum of respiratory viral infections in liver disease patients with cirrhosis admitted in critical care unit,"BACKGROUND: Clinical significance of respiratory viruses (RVs) as an etiology of pneumonia in liver disease patients with cirrhosis is usually underestimated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the spectrum of RVs in cirrhotic patients with pneumonia admitted in critical care units (CCUs) and its impact on the clinical outcome of cirrhotic patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective study was conducted in a tertiary care CCU, and consecutive cirrhotic patients with pneumonia were included. Bronchoalveolar lavage or throat swab/nasal swab was collected in viral transport medium for analysis of RVs by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. A total of 135 cirrhotic patients were included, viral and bacterial etiology of pneumonia was identified, and analysis was done with the clinical outcome. RESULTS: Overall, RVs were detected in 30 (22.2%) cirrhotic patients and viral–bacterial coinfection in 16 (11.8%) cirrhotic patients. The most common virus detected was rhinovirus in 9 (30%) patients. Mortality in cirrhotic patients with RV infection was significantly higher in comparison to cirrhotic patients with no RV infection (25 [83.3%] and 11 [12.3%], respectively, P < 0.001).

Identification of etiologic agents and clinical characteristics for patients suspected of having pertussis in a large Children’s Hospital in China,"BACKGROUND: In China, pertussis is a major health problem with an increasing incidence despite immunization efforts. Timely and accurate diagnosis is essential for the optimal management of pertussis, especially in severe cases. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum specimens were obtained from patients suspected of having pertussis on the day of hospitalization at Shanghai Children’s Medical Center from December 01, 2016, to November 30, 2017. The specimens were tested with the FilmArray Respiratory Panel, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that detects 16 viruses, Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae), and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae). RESULTS: Among the 140 children studied, 50.0% (70/140) were detected with a single pathogen, 45.0% (63/140) were detected with multiple pathogens, and 5.0% (7/140) had no detected pathogens. Forty-nine (35%, 49/140) patients tested positive for B. pertussis. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (Para) and rhinovirus/enterovirus (Rhino/Entero) were the most prevalent pathogens in patients with pertussis-like syndrome. No significant differences between the groups with pertussis and pertussis-like syndrome were observed regarding the clinical symptoms. Severe cases were more frequently observed in unvaccinated, premature and pertussis/RSV co-infection patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the importance of the timely and accurate diagnosis of pertussis based on both clinical symptoms and laboratory methods.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.153574515,-0.050357297,-0.04185744,-0.042527024,-0.012519863,-0.053643763,0.007482134,0.011080159,-0.031299809,0.017853274,-0.008135923,-0.011424695,-0.035787581,-0.074746284,0.019720819,0.035380892,0.03369998,0.002908008,0.029917496,-0.018577348,-0.004874776,0.005974231,0.050128371,-0.058129481,0.065484589,-0.02453327,0.048028264,0.107012566,0.038260348,-0.078806607
Direct RNA nanopore sequencing of full-length coronavirus genomes provides novel insights into structural variants and enables modification analysis,"Sequence analyses of RNA virus genomes remain challenging owing to the exceptional genetic plasticity of these viruses. Because of high mutation and recombination rates, genome replication by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases leads to populations of closely related viruses, so-called “quasispecies.” Standard (short-read) sequencing technologies are ill-suited to reconstruct large numbers of full-length haplotypes of (1) RNA virus genomes and (2) subgenome-length (sg) RNAs composed of noncontiguous genome regions. Here, we used a full-length, direct RNA sequencing (DRS) approach based on nanopores to characterize viral RNAs produced in cells infected with a human coronavirus. By using DRS, we were able to map the longest (∼26-kb) contiguous read to the viral reference genome. By combining Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing, we reconstructed a highly accurate consensus sequence of the human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E genome (27.3 kb). Furthermore, by using long reads that did not require an assembly step, we were able to identify, in infected cells, diverse and novel HCoV-229E sg RNAs that remain to be characterized. Also, the DRS approach, which circumvents reverse transcription and amplification of RNA, allowed us to detect methylation sites in viral RNAs. Our work paves the way for haplotype-based analyses of viral quasispecies by showing the feasibility of intra-sample haplotype separation. Even though several technical challenges remain to be addressed to exploit the potential of the nanopore technology fully, our work illustrates that DRS may significantly advance genomic studies of complex virus populations, including predictions on long-range interactions in individual full-length viral RNA haplotypes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.179474841,-0.046265334,-0.042218393,0.137840758,0.08165566,-0.101356064,0.013117677,0.032673183,-0.017142304,0.040956176,0.011756486,0.045426578,0.166817979,0.066634206,0.05631423,0.061046436,-0.115366001,-0.00904013,-0.078345227,0.042830902,-0.022027012,0.013357732,-0.017211088,0.014407782,-0.083850937,-0.086139629,0.080023067,0.005644893,-0.058246516,0.057892512
Identification and Characterization of a Human Coronavirus 229E Nonstructural Protein 8-Associated RNA 3′-Terminal Adenylyltransferase Activity,"Coronavirus nonstructural protein 8 (nsp8) has been suggested to have diverse activities, including noncanonical template-dependent polymerase activities. Here, we characterized a recombinant form of the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) nsp8 and found that the protein has metal ion-dependent RNA 3′-terminal adenylyltransferase (TATase) activity, while other nucleotides were not (or very inefficiently) transferred to the 3′ ends of single-stranded and (fully) double-stranded acceptor RNAs. Using partially double-stranded RNAs, very efficient TATase activity was observed if the opposite (template) strand contained a short 5′ oligo(U) sequence, while very little (if any) activity was detected for substrates with other homopolymeric or heteropolymeric sequences in the 5′ overhang. The oligo(U)-assisted/templated TATase activity on partial-duplex RNAs was confirmed for two other coronavirus nsp8 proteins, suggesting that the activity is conserved among coronaviruses. Replacement of a conserved Lys residue with Ala abolished the in vitro RNA-binding and TATase activities of nsp8 and caused a nonviable phenotype when the corresponding mutation was introduced into the HCoV-229E genome, confirming that these activities are mediated by nsp8 and critical for viral replication. In additional experiments, we obtained evidence that nsp8 has a pronounced specificity for adenylate and is unable to incorporate guanylate into RNA products, which strongly argues against the previously proposed template-dependent RNA polymerase activity of this protein. Given the presence of an oligo(U) stretch at the 5′ end of coronavirus minus-strand RNAs, it is tempting to speculate (but remains to be confirmed) that the nsp8-mediated TATase activity is involved in the 3′ polyadenylation of viral plus-strand RNAs. IMPORTANCE Previously, coronavirus nsp8 proteins were suggested to have template-dependent RNA polymerase activities resembling those of RNA primases or even canonical RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, while more recent studies have suggested an essential cofactor function of nsp8 (plus nsp7) for nsp12-mediated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. In an effort to reconcile conflicting data from earlier studies, the study revisits coronavirus nsp8-associated activities using additional controls and proteins. The data obtained for three coronavirus nsp8 proteins provide evidence that the proteins share metal ion-dependent RNA 3′ polyadenylation activities that are greatly stimulated by a short oligo(U) stretch in the template strand. In contrast, nsp8 was found to be unable to select and incorporate appropriate (matching) nucleotides to produce cRNA products from heteropolymeric and other homooligomeric templates. While confirming the critical role of nsp8 in coronavirus replication, the study amends the list of activities mediated by coronavirus nsp8 proteins in the absence of other proteins.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.208416501,-0.021516678,-0.100741425,0.099191681,0.001210805,-0.095514352,-0.006685384,0.01342207,-0.012857497,-0.030742536,0.051834391,0.109657449,0.043118294,0.030317957,-0.023651053,0.025391776,0.039821432,-0.032919664,0.001662682,0.011952391,-0.060442608,0.014527501,0.006315157,-0.092900202,0.051566709,0.008482928,-0.06833565,0.045991212,0.004866226,0.026271056
Introducing a New Algorithm for Classification of Etiology in Studies on Pediatric Pneumonia: Protocol for the Trial of Respiratory Infections in Children for Enhanced Diagnostics Study,"BACKGROUND: There is a need to better distinguish viral infections from antibiotic-requiring bacterial infections in children presenting with clinical community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) to assist health care workers in decision making and to improve the rational use of antibiotics. OBJECTIVE: The overall aim of the Trial of Respiratory infections in children for ENhanced Diagnostics (TREND) study is to improve the differential diagnosis of bacterial and viral etiologies in children aged below 5 years with clinical CAP, by evaluating myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) as a biomarker for viral CAP and by evaluating an existing (multianalyte point-of-care antigen detection test system [mariPOC respi] ArcDia International Oy Ltd.) and a potential future point-of-care test for respiratory pathogens. METHODS: Children aged 1 to 59 months with clinical CAP as well as healthy, hospital-based, asymptomatic controls will be included at a pediatric emergency hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. Blood (analyzed for MxA and C-reactive protein) and nasopharyngeal samples (analyzed with real-time polymerase chain reaction as the gold standard and antigen-based mariPOC respi test as well as saved for future analyses of a novel recombinase polymerase amplification–based point-of-care test for respiratory pathogens) will be collected. A newly developed algorithm for the classification of CAP etiology will be used as the reference standard. RESULTS: A pilot study was performed from June to August 2017. The enrollment of study subjects started in November 2017. Results are expected by the end of 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from the TREND study can be an important step to improve the management of children with clinical CAP.

Association between IFN-γ +874 T/A (Rs2430561) Polymorphisms and Bipolar 1 Disorder: A Study in an Ethnic Iranian Population,"BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of bipolar 1 disorder (B1D), a major psychiatric disorder with inflammatory origins and structural changes in the brain, is of great interest to researchers. Pro-inflammatory biomarkers and specific gene expression play pivotal roles in B1D development, and IFN-γ has emerged as an important inflammatory marker. The aim of this research was to determine whether the INF-γ +874 T/A polymorphism is associated with B1D susceptibility in an ethnic Iranian population. METHODS: The IFN-γ +874 T/A (rs2430561) gene polymorphism was studied in 106 B1D patients and 109 control subjects using sequence specific primers (SSPs) and amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR). RESULTS: Significant statistical differences in IFN-γ +874 T/A polymorphism genotype distribution were found between the patients and control subjects (P = 0.0006). Decreased risk of B1D was detected in the codominant model (T/T vs T/A and A/A, OR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.07-0.49 for T/A, OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.12-1.24 for A/A, P value=0.0006), and in the dominant model (T/T vs T/A-A/A, OR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.08-0.54, P = 0.0005). However, no significant difference in the IFN-γ polymorphism allele distribution was found between the two groups (P = 0.25). CONCLUSION: The IFN-γ +874 T/A polymorphism may have a significant role in BID development.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.029269311,-0.035955393,-0.004355093,-0.145351298,-0.037753079,0.023460828,-0.010264413,-0.011256245,-0.042207055,-0.058071186,-0.033640836,0.062865792,-0.045587447,-0.004301793,-0.098981726,0.081230407,-0.069134293,-0.066236524,0.014451867,-0.044687486,-0.080687117,-0.018682692,0.040309464,0.081411106,-0.038579897,-0.070505089,0.027612362,-0.189841878,-0.06198382,-0.019925949
Efficacy and Safety of Nitazoxanide in Addition to Standard of Care for the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness,"BACKGROUND: Effective therapeutics for respiratory viruses are needed. Early data suggest that nitazoxanide (NTZ) may be beneficial for treating acute respiratory viral illness. METHODS: From March 2014 through March 2017, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 260 participants ≥1 year old hospitalized with influenza-like illness at 6 hospitals in Mexico. Participants were randomized 1:1 to NTZ (age ≥12 years, 600 mg twice daily; age 4–11 years and 1–3 years, 200 or 100 mg twice daily, respectively) or placebo for 5 days in addition to standard of care. The primary endpoint was time from first dose to hospital discharge. Influenza reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Respifinder 22 multiplex test were used for virus detection. RESULTS: Of 260 participants enrolled, 257 were randomized and took at least 1 dose of study treatment (intention-to-treat population): 130 in the NTZ group and 127 in the placebo group. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median duration of hospitalization was 6.5 (interquartile range [IQR], 4.0–9.0) days in the NTZ group vs 7.0 (IQR, 4.0–9.0) days in the placebo group (P = .56). Duration of hospitalization between the 2 treatments was similar in children (P = .29) and adults (P = .62), influenza A and B (P = .32), and other respiratory viruses. Seven (5.4%) and 6 (4.7%) participants in the NTZ and placebo groups, respectively, reported serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with NTZ did not reduce the duration of hospital stay in severe influenza-like illness. Further analyses based on age and evaluations by virus did not reveal any subgroups that appeared to benefit from NTZ.

Development and biochemical and immunological characterization of early passage and immortalized bovine intestinal epithelial cell lines from the ileum of a young calf,"The intestinal epithelium is a major site of interaction with pathogens. In bovine intestinal epithelial cells (BIECs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in innate immune responses against enteric pathogens. This study is aimed at establishing a stable bovine intestinal epithelial cell line that can be maintained by a continuous passage so that studies on innate immune responses against various enteric pathogens can be performed. The main goal was to establish pure cultures of primary and immortalized bovine intestinal epithelial cells from the ileum and then characterize them biochemically and immunologically. Mixed epithelial and fibroblast bovine ileal intestinal cultures were first established from a 2-day old calf. Limiting dilution method was used to obtain a clone of epithelial cells which was characterized using immunocytochemistry (ICC). The selected clone BIEC-c4 was cytokeratin positive and expressed low levels of vimentin, confirming the epithelial cell phenotype. Early passage BIEC-c4 cells were transfected with either simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen or human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), or human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16E6/E7 genes to establish three immortalized BIEC cell lines. The expression of SV40, hTERT and HPV E6/E7 genes in immortalized BIECs was confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence assays also confirmed the expression of SV40, hTERT and HPV E6 proteins. The immortalized BIECs were cytokeratin positive and all except HPV-BIECs expressed low levels of vimentin. A growth kinetics study indicated that there were no significant differences in the doubling time of immortalized BIECs as compared to early passage BIEC-c4 cells. All four BIEC types expressed TLR 1-10 genes, with TLR 3 and 4 showing higher expression across all cell types. These newly established early passage and immortalized BIEC cell lines should serve as a good model for studying infectivity, pathogenesis and innate immune responses against enteric pathogens.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.058442245,-0.028235083,0.036465263,-0.112373405,-0.062421285,0.047447277,0.017984454,-0.059434162,0.057285204,-0.026631644,-0.066982607,-0.067266132,0.006659131,0.114200673,0.052840731,-0.025218979,-0.020649001,-0.06818093,-0.005544352,-0.047964242,0.065282016,0.007023199,0.055627314,0.006887366,-0.021444818,0.004518908,0.017426673,0.013046518,-0.004810229,-0.093108045
Genotyping of avian infectious bronchitis virus in Afghanistan (2016-2017): the first report,"BACKGROUND: Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious viral disease which affects the poultry industry. The virus exists in a wide variety of genotypes, and phylogenetic analysis has been used to classify infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains. AIMS: The object of the study is a molecular characterization of circulating IBV in Afghanistan as a first study. METHODS: The tracheal tissue specimens from 100 different commercial broiler flocks with respiratory distress in Afghanistan were collected during 2016-2017. After real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR), IBV-positive samples were further characterized. A 390 bp hypervariable spike glycoprotein gene segment was amplified using Nested PCR, sequenced, and analyzed. RESULTS: The results of real-time RT-PCR showed that 45/100 of the mentioned flocks were IBV positive. Phylogenetic analysis of all positive samples revealed that IBV strains were clustered into two distinct genotypes: LX4 (GI-19) (9/45) and IS-1494 like (GI-23) (34/45). Also, 2 of the 45 samples remained uncharacterized. CONCLUSION: It is the first study focusing on the molecular epidemiology of IBV in Afghanistan, extending our understanding of IB in the region. These results showed the high rate of IB infection in Afghanistan broiler farms and confirm the continuing monitoring of IBVs to modify the vaccination program.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.022767143,0.023998277,0.165244554,-0.096756291,0.239419273,0.075842462,-0.181186838,-0.093844914,0.112462247,0.371144128,0.113508075,0.034769872,-0.095845186,0.093833924,-0.13985039,0.124907608,0.031475213,0.003436276,0.051863134,-0.011382856,-0.04604081,0.02941666,-0.018672172,-0.081385122,0.009327506,0.012466209,-0.001253825,0.017787402,0.059773294,-0.007155702
Respiratory Viral Infection: An Underappreciated Cause of Acute Febrile Illness Admissions in Southern Sri Lanka,"The contribution of respiratory viruses to acute febrile illness (AFI) burden is poorly characterized. We describe the prevalence, seasonality, and clinical features of respiratory viral infection among AFI admissions in Sri Lanka. We enrolled AFI patients ≥ 1 year of age admitted to a tertiary care hospital in southern Sri Lanka, June 2012–October 2014. We collected epidemiologic/clinical data and a nasal or nasopharyngeal sample that was tested using polymerase chain reaction (Luminex NxTAG, Austin, TX). We determined associations between weather data and respiratory viral activity using the Spearman correlation and assessed respiratory virus seasonality using a Program for Appropriate Technology definition. Bivariable and multivariable regression analyses were conducted to identify features associated with respiratory virus detection. Among 964 patients, median age was 26.2 years (interquartile range 14.6–39.9) and 646 (67.0%) were male. One-fifth (203, 21.1%) had respiratory virus detected: 13.9% influenza, 1.4% human enterovirus/rhinovirus, 1.4% parainfluenza virus, 1.1% respiratory syncytial virus, and 1.1% human metapneumovirus. Patients with respiratory virus identified were younger (median 9.8 versus 27.7 years, P < 0.001) and more likely to have respiratory signs and symptoms. Influenza A and respiratory viral activity peaked in February–June each year. Maximum daily temperature was associated with influenza and respiratory viral activity (P = 0.03 each). Patients with respiratory virus were as likely as others to be prescribed antibiotics (55.2% versus 52.6%, P = 0.51), and none reported prior influenza vaccination. Respiratory viral infection was a common cause of AFI. Improved access to vaccines and respiratory diagnostics may help reduce disease burden and inappropriate antibiotic use.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.314476903,-0.124504052,-0.163087939,0.147986816,0.005722259,0.016471929,-0.051068221,0.008465802,0.006293711,0.045608341,-0.011069394,-0.024858708,0.062181895,0.040803301,0.007814161,-0.037344189,0.0372728,-0.046070108,0.066657579,0.082679461,0.027651301,-0.120253326,-0.032479873,-0.002878468,0.052442578,0.013140347,-0.074825769,0.014290378,-0.025119962,-0.061866162
"Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerases in Host-Pathogen Interactions, Inflammation, and Immunity","The literature review presented here details recent research involving members of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of proteins. Among the 17 recognized members of the family, the human enzyme PARP1 is the most extensively studied, resulting in a number of known biological and metabolic roles. This review is focused on the roles played by PARP enzymes in host-pathogen interactions and in diseases with an associated inflammatory response. In mammalian cells, several PARPs have specific roles in the antiviral response; this is perhaps best illustrated by PARP13, also termed the zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP). Plant stress responses and immunity are also regulated by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. PARPs promote inflammatory responses by stimulating proinflammatory signal transduction pathways that lead to the expression of cytokines and cell adhesion molecules. Hence, PARP inhibitors show promise in the treatment of inflammatory disorders and conditions with an inflammatory component, such as diabetes, arthritis, and stroke.

Clinical features of Mycoplasma pneumoniae coinfection and need for its testing in influenza pneumonia patients,"BACKGROUND: To investigate the clinical features of coinfection due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae), a common copathogen in influenza, in influenza pneumonia patients. METHODS: We reviewed 4,465 patients with influenza who visited a tertiary care hospital emergency department in Seoul (Korea) from 2010 through 2016, and underwent immunoglobulin M (IgM) serology or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for M. pneumoniae. Influenza pneumonia was defined as laboratory-confirmed influenza plus radiographic pneumonia. Patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia or non-mycoplasma bacterial coinfection were excluded. Clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings and outcomes of the influenza pneumonia patients with and without M. pneumoniae coinfection were compared. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the coinfection. RESULTS: Of 244 influenza pneumonia patients, 41 (16.8%) had M. pneumoniae coinfection. These patients were younger with a higher frequency of age of 5–10 years, and had higher white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte counts; lower concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP). The coinfection had no association with specific radiographic findings and poor outcome. Multivariable analysis showed the age of 5–10 years (adjusted odds ratio, 18.83; 95% confidence interval, 5.899–60.08; P<0.001) as the factor associated with the coinfection. CONCLUSIONS: M. pneumoniae coinfection in influenza pneumonia may be associated with the age of 5–10 years, and otherwise clinically indistinct from influenza pneumonia without the coinfection. This finding suggests the need for M. pneumoniae testing in patients aged 5–10 years with influenza pneumonia.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.221657831,-0.109490448,-0.108710703,-0.010889261,-0.079455878,0.127868883,-0.155579762,0.093469151,-0.209065121,-0.038468963,-0.053358321,0.025290068,-0.028121753,-0.013857676,-0.111212373,0.018272087,-0.004872178,0.019374774,-0.043183594,0.052077759,-0.034258592,0.121568618,0.175523949,0.013767625,0.037372971,-0.012806205,0.007633392,0.016606285,0.017900346,0.008722373
Identification of Nonstructural Protein 8 as the N-Terminus of the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a member within the family Arteriviridae of the order Nidovirales. Replication of this positive-stranded RNA virus within the host cell involves expression of viral replicase proteins encoded by two ORFs, namely ORF1a and ORF1b. In particular, translation of ORF1b depends on a -1-ribosomal frameshift strategy. Thus, nonstructural protein 9 (nsp9), the first protein within ORF1b that specifies the function of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is expressed as the C-terminal extension of nsp8, a small nsp that is encoded by ORF1a. However, it has remained unclear whether the mature form of nsp9 in virus-infected cells still retains nsp8, addressing which is clearly critical to understand the biological function of nsp9. By taking advantage of specific antibodies to both nsp8 and nsp9, we report the following findings. (1) In infected cells, PRRSV nsp9 was identified as a major product with a size between 72 and 95 kDa (72–95 KDa form), which exhibited the similar mobility on the gel to the in vitro expressed nsp8–9(ORF1b), but not the ORF1b-coded portion (nsp9(ORF1b)). (2) The antibodies to nsp8, but not to nsp7 or nsp10, could detect a major product that had the similar mobility to the 72–95 KDa form of nsp9. Moreover, nsp9 could be co-immunoprecipitated by antibodies to nsp8, and vice versa. (3) Neither nsp4 nor nsp2 PLP2 was able to cleave nsp8–nsp9 in vitro. Together, our studies provide experimental evidence to suggest that nsp8 is an N-terminal extension of nsp9. Our findings here paves way for further charactering the biological function of PRRSV nsp9.

ADP-ribosyl–binding and hydrolase activities of the alphavirus nsP3 macrodomain are critical for initiation of virus replication,"Alphaviruses are plus-strand RNA viruses that cause encephalitis, rash, and arthritis. The nonstructural protein (nsP) precursor polyprotein is translated from genomic RNA and processed into four nsPs. nsP3 has a highly conserved macrodomain (MD) that binds ADP-ribose (ADPr), which can be conjugated to protein as a posttranslational modification involving transfer of ADPr from NAD(+) by poly ADPr polymerases (PARPs). The nsP3(MD) also removes ADPr from mono ADP-ribosylated (MARylated) substrates. To determine which aspects of alphavirus replication require nsP3(MD) ADPr-binding and/or hydrolysis function, we studied NSC34 neuronal cells infected with chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Infection induced ADP-ribosylation of cellular proteins without increasing PARP expression, and inhibition of MARylation decreased virus replication. CHIKV with a G32S mutation that reduced ADPr-binding and hydrolase activities was less efficient than WT CHIKV in establishing infection and in producing nsPs, dsRNA, viral RNA, and infectious virus. CHIKV with a Y114A mutation that increased ADPr binding but reduced hydrolase activity, established infection like WT CHIKV, rapidly induced nsP translation, and shut off host protein synthesis with reduced amplification of dsRNA. To assess replicase function independent of virus infection, a transreplicase system was used. Mutant nsP3(MD)s D10A, G32E, and G112E with no binding or hydrolase activity had no replicase activity, G32S had little, and Y114A was intermediate to WT. Therefore, ADP ribosylation of proteins and nsP3(MD) ADPr binding are necessary for initiation of alphavirus replication, while hydrolase activity facilitates amplification of replication complexes. These observations are consistent with observed nsP3(MD) conservation and limited tolerance for mutation.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.139796148,-0.052164819,-0.039277166,0.007826663,-0.0913821,0.009529618,0.036628963,-0.014261718,0.032215466,-0.010297812,-0.003294977,0.01819871,-0.024009036,0.03052599,-0.023662792,0.013915812,0.043219034,-0.052170381,-0.004668964,0.047591312,-0.016969046,0.011652418,-0.006941347,-0.057863042,0.046512063,0.048438475,-0.041596726,0.013042738,-0.028678856,-0.022066459
From APOBEC to ZAP: Diverse mechanisms used by cellular restriction factors to inhibit virus infections,"Antiviral restriction factors are cellular proteins that inhibit the entry, replication, or spread of viruses. These proteins are critical components of the innate immune system and function to limit the severity and host range of virus infections. Here we review the current knowledge on the mechanisms of action of several restriction factors that affect multiple viruses at distinct stages of their life cycles. For example, APOBEC3G deaminates cytosines to hypermutate reverse transcribed viral DNA; IFITM3 alters membranes to inhibit virus membrane fusion; MXA/B oligomerize on viral protein complexes to inhibit virus replication; SAMHD1 decreases dNTP intracellular concentrations to prevent reverse transcription of retrovirus genomes; tetherin prevents release of budding virions from cells; Viperin catalyzes formation of a nucleoside analogue that inhibits viral RNA polymerases; and ZAP binds virus RNAs to target them for degradation. We also discuss countermeasures employed by specific viruses against these restriction factors, and mention secondary functions of several of these factors in modulating immune responses. These important examples highlight the diverse strategies cells have evolved to combat virus infections.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.124254193,-0.08477656,-0.052767609,0.074049162,-0.11450906,0.041762401,0.093708576,-0.027330732,0.048151785,0.069760781,-0.001411783,-0.073970177,0.03953777,0.091873761,0.031179179,0.005036821,-0.006199085,-0.031162707,0.001304897,0.082398338,-0.054103593,0.067688732,-0.079492958,0.0343117,0.020877968,-0.013390651,0.042160823,-0.056888354,-0.033596925,0.016172544
Clinical characteristics and outcomes of human rhinovirus positivity in hospitalized children,"BACKGROUND: The clinical relevance of positive human rhinovirus (HRV) in hospitalized patients is unclear. Our objective was to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of HRV positivity in a heterogeneous population of hospitalized children, compared to those positive for another respiratory virus and those where no respiratory virus was detected. METHODS: A retrospective case–control study of children hospitalized between January 2014 to April 2015 who had a respiratory viral specimen collected. Clinical and laboratory data were collected, and baseline characteristics and clinical variables were compared. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 671 specimens obtained from 577 patients that were processed for the respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction assay, of which 198 were positive for HRV, 167 positive for another respiratory virus, and 306 where no respiratory virus was detected. A history of asthma was significantly associated with HRV-positive patients (odds ratio [OR] 3.71; P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, HRV-positive patients had a higher requirement for mechanical ventilation (OR 1.44), lower rates of readmission (OR 0.53), and lower mortality (OR 0.35) compared to patients with no respiratory virus isolated; however, none were statistically significant. HRV-positive patients did have a significantly shorter length of stay (LOS) compared with patients with no respiratory virus isolated (difference–0.35; P = 0.001). Similar outcomes were seen in patients positive for other respiratory viruses. CONCLUSIONS: HRV-positive hospitalized pediatric patients with a heterogeneous set of clinical diagnoses had higher association with asthma compared to patients who had another, or no, respiratory virus isolated. HRV-positive patients had shorter LOS compared to patients who had no respiratory viruses isolated. These findings suggest that HRV positivity in hospitalized pediatric patients may not lead to adverse clinical outcomes, although asthma is a risk factor regardless of clinical comorbidities and diagnoses. Further research is warranted to understand the predisposition of asthma to HRV positivity.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.277936301,-0.080337441,-0.133600068,-0.056962836,-0.003462512,-0.14349766,-0.029164382,0.051079927,-0.092761269,0.057471628,-0.024287882,0.00196171,-0.020697022,0.101231013,0.017833883,-0.00229501,0.077924875,-0.021626734,0.090920609,0.00820205,0.054152059,-0.205885356,-0.115822871,0.11241877,-0.135829881,0.155817886,-0.130238039,-0.038631228,0.063993657,0.262909958
Recurring and Emerging Questions Related to Management of HIV-Related Opportunistic Infections,"The incidence of HIV-related opportunistic infections (OIs) has dramatically declined with the ability to achieve viral suppression and immune reconstitution with potent antiretroviral therapy. However, a large number of patients remain at risk for OIs because they are diagnosed at late stages of HIV disease, fail to stay in treatment, or fail to maintain viral suppression. Clinicians should remain vigilant for OIs and for changes in recommended management strategies. Issues that often arise in this regard include how to interpret polymerase chain reaction diagnostic results in individuals with HIV infection; whether primary prophylaxis for Mycobacterium avium complex is still needed; whether clinicians should screen asymptomatic patients for cryptococcal antigen; and need for amphotericin B in treatment regimens for cryptococcal meningitis.

The HIV Integrase Inhibitor Raltegravir Inhibits Felid Alphaherpesvirus 1 Replication by Targeting both DNA Replication and Late Gene Expression,"Alphaherpesvirus-associated ocular infections in humans caused by human alphaherpesvirus 1 (HHV-1) remain challenging to treat due to the frequency of drug application required and the potential for the selection of drug-resistant viruses. Repurposing on-the-market drugs is a viable strategy to accelerate the pace of drug development. It has been reported that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) integrase inhibitor raltegravir inhibits HHV-1 replication by targeting the DNA polymerase accessory factor and limits terminase-mediated genome cleavage of human betaherpesvirus 5 (HHV-5). We have previously shown, both in vitro and in vivo, that raltegravir can also inhibit the replication of felid alphaherpesvirus 1 (FeHV-1), a common ocular pathogen of cats with a pathogenesis similar to that of HHV-1 ocular disease. In contrast to what was reported for HHV-1, we were unable to select for a raltegravir-resistant FeHV-1 strain in order to define any basis for drug action. A candidate-based approach to explore the mode of action of raltegravir against FeHV-1 showed that raltegravir did not impact FeHV-1 terminase function, as described for HHV-5. Instead, raltegravir inhibited DNA replication, similarly to HHV-1, but by targeting the initiation of viral DNA replication rather than elongation. In addition, we found that raltegravir specifically repressed late gene expression independently of DNA replication, and both activities are consistent with inhibition of ICP8. Taken together, these results suggest that raltegravir could be a valuable therapeutic agent against herpesviruses. IMPORTANCE The rise of drug-resistant herpesviruses is a longstanding concern, particularly among immunocompromised patients. Therefore, therapies targeting viral proteins other than the DNA polymerase that may be less likely to lead to drug-resistant viruses are urgently needed. Using FeHV-1, an alphaherpesvirus closely related to HHV-1 that similarly causes ocular herpes in its natural host, we found that the HIV integrase inhibitor raltegravir targets different stages of the virus life cycle beyond DNA replication and that it does so without developing drug resistance under the conditions tested. This shows that the drug could provide a viable strategy for the treatment of herpesvirus infections.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.073404281,-0.036317463,-0.01233354,-0.029501749,-0.09366024,0.061654247,0.085407237,-0.011974949,0.028706831,0.024705844,0.004604409,0.002687199,0.037957763,0.002609961,-0.011838603,0.009297255,-0.031690123,0.052379589,0.015968484,0.035925685,0.003882661,0.025300053,-0.038852221,0.048807838,0.008706343,-0.000106932,-0.019590642,-0.011379675,0.032934701,-0.004393947
Contribution of a Multifunctional Polymerase Region of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus to Lethal Mutagenesis,"Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) are major determinants of high mutation rates and generation of mutant spectra that mediate RNA virus adaptability. The RdRp of the picornavirus foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), termed 3D, is a multifunctional protein that includes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in its N-terminal region. Previous studies documented that some amino acid substitutions within the NLS altered nucleotide recognition and enhanced the incorporation of the mutagenic purine analogue ribavirin in viral RNA, but the mutants tested were not viable and their response to lethal mutagenesis could not be studied. Here we demonstrate that NLS amino acid substitution M16A of FMDV serotype C does not affect infectious virus production but accelerates ribavirin-mediated virus extinction. The mutant 3D displays polymerase activity, RNA binding, and copying processivity that are similar to those of the wild-type enzyme but shows increased ribavirin-triphosphate incorporation. Crystal structures of the mutant 3D in the apo and RNA-bound forms reveal an expansion of the template entry channel due to the replacement of the bulky Met by Ala. This is a major difference with other 3D mutants with altered nucleotide analogue recognition. Remarkably, two distinct loop β9-α11 conformations distinguish 3Ds that exhibit higher or lower ribavirin incorporation than the wild-type enzyme. This difference identifies a specific molecular determinant of ribavirin sensitivity of FMDV. Comparison of several polymerase mutants indicates that different domains of the molecule can modify nucleotide recognition and response to lethal mutagenesis. The connection of this observation with current views on quasispecies adaptability is discussed. IMPORTANCE The nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) polymerase includes residues that modulate the sensitivity to mutagenic agents. Here we have described a viable NLS mutant with an amino acid replacement that facilitates virus extinction by ribavirin. The corresponding polymerase shows increased incorporation of ribavirin triphosphate and local structural modifications that implicate the template entry channel. Specifically, comparison of the structures of ribavirin-sensitive and ribavirin-resistant FMDV polymerases has identified loop β9-α11 conformation as a determinant of sensitivity to ribavirin mutagenesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.147062221,-0.045184965,-0.017932481,0.03730446,-0.049551222,-0.001310125,0.035826662,0.007803613,-0.01362959,0.034272458,0.041276904,0.071956263,-0.045152327,-0.066431016,-0.024165821,-0.012837265,0.002124795,0.008406629,-0.051903208,-0.011579606,0.058624013,-0.082550435,0.026256541,0.068630094,0.012713294,0.040920159,0.00727094,-0.009276234,-0.04590303,-0.028070334
Respiratory viruses in returning Hajj & Umrah pilgrims with acute respiratory illness in 2014-2015,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Respiratory tract infections are common among Hajj and Umrah pilgrims which pose a public health risk of spread of respiratory infections. Influenza has been reported from Indian Hajj and Umrah returning pilgrims, but data on other respiratory pathogens are sparse in India. Here we report the presence of common respiratory viral pathogens in returning Hajj and Umrah pilgrims suffering from acute respiratory illness (ARI) in 2014-2015. METHODS: Respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and throat swabs) were collected from 300 consenting pilgrims with ARI in the past one week and tested for influenza and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and other respiratory viruses using in-house standardized quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Clinical features among the pathogen positive and negative patients were compared. The patients received symptomatic treatment and antivirals where appropriate and were followed telephonically to collect data on illness outcome. RESULTS: Ninety seven (32.3%) of the 300 participants were tested positive for any virus, most common being influenza viruses (n=33, 11%). Other respiratory viruses that were detected included human coronaviruses [n=26, 8.7%; OC43 (n=19, 6.3%) and C229E (n=7, 2.3%)], rhinovirus (n=20, 6%), adenoviruses (n=8, 2.6%), parainfluenza viruses (n=7, 2.3%), respiratory syncytial virus (n=3, 1%) and bocaviruses (n=2, 0.6%). Clinical features observed in pathogen positive and pathogen negative patients did not differ significantly. Eighteen influenza positive patients were treated with oseltamivir. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Pilgrims returning from mass gatherings are often afflicted with respiratory pathogens with a potential to facilitate transmission of respiratory pathogens across international borders. The study reinforces the need for better infection prevention and control measures such as vaccination, health education on cough etiquette and hand hygiene.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.282373974,-0.023413615,-0.130357425,0.116916698,0.03520473,0.03870812,-0.044445022,0.105275319,0.038625851,0.042577343,0.002173273,-0.021804495,0.071937621,0.029410285,0.052592735,-0.058204591,0.026464745,-0.073287442,0.070346375,0.014690487,0.021745682,-0.092996809,-0.047260492,-0.015559837,0.040515523,0.006944498,-0.07780206,0.039546974,0.038822071,-0.124232932
Strand-Specific Dual RNA Sequencing of Bronchial Epithelial Cells Infected with Influenza A/H3N2 Viruses Reveals Splicing of Gene Segment 6 and Novel Host-Virus Interactions,"Host-influenza virus interplay at the transcript level has been extensively characterized in epithelial cells. Yet, there are no studies that simultaneously characterize human host and influenza A virus (IAV) genomes. We infected human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells with two seasonal IAV/H3N2 strains, Brisbane/10/07 and Perth/16/09 (reference strains for past vaccine seasons) and the well-characterized laboratory strain Udorn/307/72. Strand-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of the infected BEAS-2B cells allowed for simultaneous analysis of host and viral transcriptomes, in addition to pathogen genomes, to reveal changes in mRNA expression and alternative splicing (AS). In general, patterns of global and immune gene expression induced by the three IAVs were mostly shared. However, AS of host transcripts and small nuclear RNAs differed between the seasonal and laboratory strains. Analysis of viral transcriptomes showed deletions of the polymerase components (defective interfering-like RNAs) within the genome. Surprisingly, we found that the neuraminidase gene undergoes AS and that the splicing event differs between seasonal and laboratory strains. Our findings reveal novel elements of the host-virus interaction and highlight the importance of RNA-seq in identifying molecular changes at the genome level that may contribute to shaping RNA-based innate immunity. IMPORTANCE The use of massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has revealed insights into human and pathogen genomes and their evolution. Dual RNA-seq allows simultaneous dissection of host and pathogen genomes and strand-specific RNA-seq provides information about the polarity of the RNA. This is important in the case of negative-strand RNA viruses like influenza virus, which generate positive (complementary and mRNA) and negative-strand RNAs (genome) that differ in their potential to trigger innate immunity. Here, we characterize interactions between human bronchial epithelial cells and three influenza A/H3N2 strains using strand-specific dual RNA-seq.

Feed batch sequencing to decrease the risk of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) cross-contamination during feed manufacturing,"Feed has been identified as a vector of transmission for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The objective of this study was to determine if feed batch sequencing methods could minimize PEDV cross-contamination. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus-free swine feed was manufactured to represent the negative control. A 50 kg feed batch was mixed in a pilot scale feed mill for 5 min, sampled, then discharged for 10 min into a bucket elevator and sampled again upon exit. Next, a pathogenic PEDV isolate was used to inoculate 49.5 kg of PEDV-free feed to form the positive control. The positive control was mixed, conveyed and sampled similar to the negative control. Subsequently, 4 sequence batches (sequence 1 to 4) were formed by adding a 50 kg batch of PEDV-negative feed to the mixer after the prior batch was mixed and conveyed; all sequences were mixed, conveyed, and sampled similar to the negative and positive control batches. None of the equipment was cleaned between batches within a replicate. This entire process was replicated 3 times with cleaning the feed mill between replicates. Feed was then analyzed for PEDV RNA by real-time reverse transcriptase semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) as measured by cycle threshold (Ct) and for infectivity by bioassay. Sequence 1 feed had higher (P ˂ 0.05) rRT-PCR Ct values than the positive batch and sequence 2 feed had higher (P ˂ 0.05) Ct values than sequence 1, regardless of sampled location. Feed sampled from the mixer from sequence 2, 3, and 4 was rRT-PCR negative whereas feed sampled from the bucket elevator was rRT-PCR negative from sequence 3 and 4. Bioassay was conducted using 66 mixed sex 10-d-old pigs confirmed negative for PEDV allocated to 22 different rooms. Pigs were initially 10-d old. Control pigs remained PEDV negative for the study. All pigs from the mixer positive batch (9/9) and bucket elevator positive batch (3/3) were rRT-PCR positive on fecal swabs by the end of the study. One replicate of pigs from mixer sequence 1 was rRT-PCR positive (3/3) by 7 dpi. One replicate of mixer pigs from sequence 2 was rRT-PCR positive (3/3) by 7 dpi although no detectable PEDV RNA was found in the feed. The results demonstrate sequenced batches had reduced quantities of PEDV RNA although sequenced feed without detectible PEDV RNA by rRT-PCR can be infectious. Therefore, a sequencing protocol can reduce but not eliminate the risk of producing infectious PEDV carryover from the first sequenced batch of feed.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.02816174,0.013559784,0.07849782,-0.089437132,0.061126209,0.014297583,-0.051316082,0.033642795,-0.022241498,-0.037009278,0.058816603,0.065081472,-0.146033002,0.034287582,0.240508809,-0.149880974,-0.035224592,0.03787804,-0.040891074,0.082139983,-0.181566472,-0.051283265,0.075975276,-0.092670044,-0.087040402,-0.027888308,-0.010868987,0.006092225,0.068534646,-0.010756726
Orally Efficacious Broad-Spectrum Ribonucleoside Analog Inhibitor of Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Viruses,"Morbidity and mortality resulting from influenza-like disease are a threat, especially for older adults. To improve case management, next-generation broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics that are efficacious against major drivers of influenza-like disease, including influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), are urgently needed. Using a dual-pathogen high-throughput screening protocol for influenza A virus (IAV) and RSV inhibitors, we have identified N(4)-hydroxycytidine (NHC) as a potent inhibitor of RSV, influenza B viruses, and IAVs of human, avian, and swine origins. Biochemical in vitro polymerase assays and viral RNA sequencing revealed that the ribonucleotide analog is incorporated into nascent viral RNAs in place of cytidine, increasing the frequency of viral mutagenesis. Viral passaging in cell culture in the presence of an inhibitor did not induce robust resistance. Pharmacokinetic profiling demonstrated dose-dependent oral bioavailability of 36 to 56%, sustained levels of the active 5′-triphosphate anabolite in primary human airway cells and mouse lung tissue, and good tolerability after extended dosing at 800 mg/kg of body weight/day. The compound was orally efficacious against RSV and both seasonal and highly pathogenic avian IAVs in mouse models, reducing lung virus loads and alleviating disease biomarkers. Oral dosing reduced IAV burdens in a guinea pig transmission model and suppressed virus spread to uninfected contact animals through direct transmission. Based on its broad-spectrum efficacy and pharmacokinetic properties, NHC is a promising candidate for future clinical development as a treatment option for influenza-like diseases.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.047877335,-0.109021208,-0.058250653,0.167028824,-0.065267488,0.223709316,-0.007595378,-0.046102383,0.0718169,-0.017499007,0.024065953,-0.063882525,-0.018931428,0.000483525,-0.010055332,-0.017683475,-0.05822915,0.085726951,-0.002268505,0.016298244,0.019912728,-0.051582686,0.008187321,0.005533924,0.029693185,-0.075030269,0.121391554,0.031012153,-0.004202803,0.035032364
N-terminal acetylation by NatB is required for the shutoff activity of influenza A virus PA-X,"N-terminal acetylation is a major posttranslational modification in eukaryotes catalyzed by N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs), NatA through NatF. Although N-terminal acetylation modulates diverse protein functions, little is known about its roles in virus replication. We found that NatB, which comprises NAA20 and NAA25, is involved in the shutoff activity of influenza virus PA-X. The shutoff activity of PA-X was suppressed in NatB-deficient cells, and PA-X mutants that are not acetylated by NatB showed reduced shutoff activities. We also evaluated the importance of N-terminal acetylation of PA, because PA-X shares its N-terminal sequence with PA. Viral polymerase activity was reduced in NatB-deficient cells. Moreover, mutant PAs that are not acetylated by NatB lost their function in the viral polymerase complex. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that N-terminal acetylation is required for the shutoff activity of PA-X and for viral polymerase activity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.113343622,-0.070299796,-0.044285886,0.005529217,-0.076729081,0.079495365,-0.00012493,-0.015112494,0.024746804,-0.04388492,-0.020474702,0.005737951,-0.024184459,0.03859496,-0.01794391,-0.001250355,0.039117362,-0.042803645,-0.005895429,0.006864184,0.019387589,0.01577269,0.015252968,-0.022968174,0.02581058,0.054419852,-0.019591495,0.015226517,0.00728145,0.024419673
Evaluation of the effects of flushing feed manufacturing equipment with chemically treated rice hulls on porcine epidemic diarrhea virus cross-contamination during feed manufacturing,"Various strategies have been proposed to mitigate potential risk of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) transmission via feed and feed ingredients. Wet disinfection has been found to be the most effective decontamination of feed mill surfaces; however, this is not practical on a commercial feed production scale. Another potential mitigation strategy would be using chemically treated rice hulls flushed through the feed manufacturing equipment. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) or formaldehyde-treated rice hull flush batches as potential chemical mitigation strategies for PEDV during feed manufacturing. Feed without evidence of PEDV RNA contamination was inoculated with PEDV. Based on polymerase chain reaction analysis, this feed had a cycle threshold (Ct) = 30.2 and was confirmed infective in bioassay. After manufacturing the PEDV-positive feed, untreated rice hulls, formaldehyde-treated rice hulls, 2% MCFA- (a 1:1:1 blend of hexanoic, octanoic, and decanoic acid) treated rice hulls, or 10% MCFA-treated rice hulls were flushed through laboratory scale mixers. For the untreated rice hulls, 3 of 6 samples had detectable PEDV RNA, whereas 1 of 6 formaldehyde-treated rice hull flush samples and 2 of 6 of the 2% MCFA rice hull flush samples had detectable PEDV RNA. However, PEDV RNA was not detected in any of the 10% MCFA rice hull flush samples. Then, rice hulls treated with 10% MCFA were mixed and discharged through a production scale mixer and bucket elevator following PEDV-positive feed. No rice hull flush or feed samples from the mixer following chemically treated rice hull flush had detectible PEDV RNA. However, one 10% MCFA rice hull sample collected from the bucket elevator discharge spout had detectible PEDV RNA. Dust collected following mixing of PEDV contaminated feed had detectable PEDV RNA (Ct = 29.4) and was infectious. However, dust collected immediately after the 10% MCFA rice hull flush batch had a reduced quantity of PEDV RNA (Ct = 33.7) and did not cause infection. Overall, the use of rice hull flushes effectively reduced the quantity of detectible RNA present after mixing a batch of PEDV-positive feed. Chemical treatment of rice hulls with formaldehyde or 10% MCFA provided additional reduction in detectible RNA. Finally, dust collected after manufacturing PEDV-inoculated feed has the potential to serve as a vector for PEDV transmission.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.050684696,-0.009484627,0.043250319,-0.081602684,0.017121714,0.02041187,-0.002389882,0.008432551,-0.0130554,-0.029397754,0.060342032,0.080219794,-0.15076127,0.02896525,0.229579247,-0.129663947,-0.052145286,0.044506042,-0.033946517,0.124707988,-0.178883848,-0.072640373,0.070879461,-0.074680071,-0.067015748,-0.039805147,-0.029783713,0.03064576,0.058636238,-0.015926147
A Processive Protein Chimera Introduces Mutations Across Defined DNA Regions In Vivo,"Laboratory time scale evolution in vivo relies on the generation of large, mutationally diverse gene libraries to rapidly explore biomolecule sequence landscapes. Traditional global mutagenesis methods are problematic because they introduce many off-target mutations that are often lethal and can engender false positives. We report the development and application of the MutaT7 chimera, a potent and highly targeted in vivo mutagenesis agent. MutaT7 utilizes a DNA-damaging cytidine deaminase fused to a processive RNA polymerase to continuously direct mutations to specific, well-defined DNA regions of any relevant length. MutaT7 thus provides a mechanism for in vivo targeted mutagenesis across multi-kb DNA sequences.

Viral infection in community acquired pneumonia patients with fever: a prospective observational study,"BACKGROUND: Patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by viruses can develop severe complications, which result in hospitalization and death. The purpose of this study was to analyse the aetiology, incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of CAP patients with fever during non-pandemics, and then to provide theoretical basis for accurate diagnosis and treatment in CAP patients. METHODS: An enrolment system was established for monitoring the CAP patients with fever. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) kits were used to detect 10 viruses [influenza A and B, adenovirus (ADV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, picornavirus, parainfluenza virus (PIV), coronavirus, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and bocavirus]. Data on age, gender, underlying diseases, complications, laboratory indexes, and outcomes were collected by physicians. RESULTS: This prospective study included 320 patients with fever. Among them, 23.4% were viral-positive by mPCR, with influenza virus most prominent followed by picornavirus. Strong variation in seasonal distribution was shown in viral infections, with peak months from December to February. Patients with influenza infection were likely to be taken to emergency rooms and have respiratory failure with higher creatinine kinase levels and lower white blood cell counts. Streptococcus pneumoniae followed by haemophilus influenzae were the most common bacteria in viral co-infections, which accounted for one third of virus-positive patients. Viral CAP and mixed CAP were not independent factors for death. In addition, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) >246 IU/L [odds ratio (OR) =7.06, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.15–23.2, P=0.001], and serum calcium <2.18 mmol/L (OR =6.67, 95% CI: 1.42–31.3, P=0.016) were associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: Viruses play an important role in CAP patients with fever, a systematic clinical, radiological and biological analysis of these patients can contribute to effective therapy that may prevent the development of CAP and improve the outcomes. The present work showed an elaborate analysis evidence of viral infection among fever CAP inpatients.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.243632816,-0.106318191,-0.142179393,-0.014022215,-0.081314397,-0.024707436,-0.062479186,0.085227863,-0.19578126,0.072925443,-0.070145303,-0.020219578,0.010635862,0.053379586,-0.143553453,-0.053698074,-0.008240912,0.035639412,-0.064814049,0.157839977,-9.45E-05,0.105265945,0.173013412,0.091203548,0.087977316,-0.129980763,0.014507398,-0.017686078,0.077937178,0.038811948
Xenotransplantation panel for the detection of infectious agents in pigs,"Recent advances in xenotransplantation have produced organs from pigs that are well tolerated in primate models because of genetic changes engineered to delete major antigens from donor animals. To ensure the safety of human transplant recipients, it will be essential to understand both the spectrum of infectious agents in donor pigs and their potential to be transmitted to immunocompromised transplant recipients. Equally important will be the development of new highly sensitive diagnostic methods for use in the detection of these agents in donor animals and for the monitoring of transplant recipients. Herein, we report results from a panel of 30 quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays for infectious agents with the potential to be transmitted to the human host. The reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity of each assay were evaluated and were found to exhibit analytic sensitivity that was similar to that of quantitative assays used to perform viral load testing of human viruses in clinical laboratories. This analytical approach was used to detect nucleic acids of infectious agents present in specimens from 9 sows and 22 piglets derived by caesarean section. The most commonly detected targets in adult animals were Mycoplasma species and two distinct herpesviruses, porcine lymphotrophic herpesvirus 2 and 3. A total of 14 piglets were derived from three sows infected with either or both herpesviruses, yet none tested positive for the viruses indicating that vertical transmission of these viruses is inefficient.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.009958003,0.007796934,0.095590172,0.00031205,-0.007838715,0.036243049,0.095591476,0.002126724,-0.013306267,0.054540325,-0.018632289,-0.012931322,0.038527029,-0.02312657,0.069138675,-0.062766522,-0.052008784,0.019792721,-0.016123852,0.010834913,0.00108685,-0.005181206,0.000463506,-0.006427655,-0.016232506,-0.032930429,-0.011172142,-0.03829544,-0.017294225,-0.016584275
Development and evaluation of armored RNA‐based standards for quantification of BCR‐ABL1 (p210/p190) fusion gene transcripts,"BACKGROUND: Standards play an important role in detection of the BCR‐ABL1 fusion gene (FG) transcript. However, the standards widely used in laboratories are mainly based on plasmids or cDNA, which cannot accurately reflect the process of RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. Therefore, we aimed to develop armored RNA‐based standards for p210 and p190 BCR‐ABL1 FG transcripts’ quantification. METHODS: Using overlapping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, we first linked a segment of the p210 or p190 BCR‐ABL1 FG transcript with four control genes (CGs; ABL1,BCR,GUSB, and B2M) to form p210FG‐CG and p190FG‐CG. Subsequently, using armored RNA technology, we prepared p210FG‐CG‐ and p190FG‐CG‐armored RNAs and the p210FG‐CG and p190FG‐CG standards, the values of which were assigned by digital PCR (dPCR). RESULTS: The p210FG‐CG and p190FG‐CG standards were stable and homogeneous, and were significantly linear with r (2) > 0.98. A field trial including 52 laboratories across China showed that the coefficient of variation (CV%) of BCR‐ABL1 values among samples was in the range of 58.6%‐129.6% for p210 samples and 73.2%‐194.0% for p190 samples when using local standards. By contrast, when using the p210FG‐CG and p190FG‐CG standards, the CV% of BCR‐ABL1 values was decreased to 35.6%‐124.9% and 36.6%‐170.6% for p210 and p190 samples, respectively. In addition, 33.3% (3/9) of the p210 and p190 samples had CV% values <50.0%, whereas 44.4% (4/9) and 77.8% (7/9) of the samples had lower CV% values when using the p210FG‐CG and p190FG‐CG standards. CONCLUSION: The overall variability of detection of BCR‐ABL1 transcripts decreased significantly when using the p210FG‐CG or p190FG‐CG standards, especially the p190FG‐CG standard.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.034873146,-0.004955099,0.049846735,-0.046976959,-0.004695084,-0.005252822,0.001646623,0.002582672,-0.009273102,-0.020927953,0.003046923,0.01155886,-0.020487617,-0.008905616,0.02122678,0.019351876,-0.014279776,-0.013817886,0.00025983,-0.060491852,-0.00689741,-5.89E-06,0.007878289,-0.021482758,-0.009577378,-0.018190389,-0.00893155,-0.012406544,0.016054908,0.004761617
"Urban Rodent Surveillance, Climatic Association, and Genomic Characterization of Seoul Virus Collected at U.S. Army Garrison, Seoul, Republic of Korea, 2006–2010","Rodent-borne pathogens pose a critical public health threat in urban areas. An epidemiological survey of urban rodents was conducted from 2006 to 2010 at the U.S. Army Garrison (USAG), Seoul, Republic of Korea (ROK), to determine the prevalence of Seoul virus (SEOV), a rodent-borne hantavirus. A total of 1,950 rodents were captured at USAG, Yongsan, near/in 19.4% (234/1,206) of the numbered buildings. Annual mean rodent infestation rates were the highest for food service facilities, e.g., the Dragon Hill Lodge complex (38.0 rodents) and the Hartell House (18.8 rodents). The brown rat, Rattus norvegicus, accounted for 99.4% (1,939/1,950) of all the rodents captured in the urban area, whereas only 0.6% (11/1,950) of the rodents was house mice (Mus musculus). In November 2006, higher numbers of rats captured were likely associated with climatic factors, e.g., rainfall and temperatures as rats sought harborage in and around buildings. Only 4.7% (34/718) of the rodents assayed for hantaviruses was serologically positive for SEOV. A total of 8.8% (3/34) R. norvegicus were positive for SEOV RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, of which two SEOV strains were completely sequenced and characterized. The 3′ and 5′ terminal sequences revealed incomplete complementary genomic configuration. Seoul virus strains Rn10-134 and Rn10-145 formed a monophyletic lineage with the prototype SEOV strain 80-39. Seoul virus Medium segment showed the highest evolutionary rates compared with the Large and Small segments. In conclusion, this report provides significant insights into continued rodent-borne disease surveillance programs that identify hantaviruses for analysis of disease risk assessments and development of mitigation strategies.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.019682974,-0.02817378,0.009547501,-0.053991168,0.038403234,0.035338472,0.010389504,0.007548409,-0.00260636,-0.010796567,0.011720681,0.028026115,-0.020654182,-0.029266393,0.022398536,0.012998007,-0.023952787,0.002035638,-0.014729651,-0.003917968,0.007412034,-0.002594772,-0.029399165,-9.49E-05,0.020158618,0.001919218,0.00463319,0.012119398,-0.007223238,0.007130952
Wheat streak mosaic virus: a century old virus with rising importance worldwide,"Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) causes wheat streak mosaic, a disease of cereals and grasses that threatens wheat production worldwide. It is a monopartite, positive‐sense, single‐stranded RNA virus and the type member of the genus Tritimovirus in the family Potyviridae. The only known vector is the wheat curl mite (WCM, Aceria tosichella), recently identified as a species complex of biotypes differing in virus transmission. Low rates of seed transmission have been reported. Infected plants are stunted and have a yellow mosaic of parallel discontinuous streaks on the leaves. In the autumn, WCMs move from WSMV‐infected volunteer wheat and other grass hosts to newly emerged wheat and transmit the virus which survives the winter within the plant, and the mites survive as eggs, larvae, nymphs or adults in the crown and leaf sheaths. In the spring/summer, the mites move from the maturing wheat crop to volunteer wheat and other grass hosts and transmit WSMV, and onto newly emerged wheat in the fall to which they transmit the virus, completing the disease cycle. WSMV detection is by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) or quantitative RT‐PCR (RT‐qPCR). Three types of WSMV are recognized: A (Mexico), B (Europe, Russia, Asia) and D (USA, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, Turkey, Canada). Resistance genes Wsm1, Wsm2 and Wsm3 have been identified. The most effective, Wsm2, has been introduced into several wheat cultivars. Mitigation of losses caused by WSMV will require enhanced knowledge of the biology of WCM biotypes and WSMV, new or improved virus detection techniques, the development of resistance through traditional and molecular breeding, and the adaptation of cultural management tactics to account for climate change.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.028806332,0.004926407,0.072014643,-0.004530811,-0.006655366,0.025533485,0.032759449,0.000744144,0.003607051,-0.000621054,0.003596231,-0.001545095,-0.01565366,0.012594481,0.021310228,0.010086563,0.005921831,0.013219756,-0.039403666,-0.006988937,0.005462548,0.003653824,-0.027095161,0.02401431,-0.006725355,0.014693285,0.021880866,-0.007697582,0.015169642,-0.010781179
Anti–Ebola Virus Antibody Levels in Convalescent Plasma and Viral Load After Plasma Infusion in Patients With Ebola Virus Disease,"BACKGROUND: Ebola virus (EBOV) neutralizing antibody in plasma may reduce viral load following administration of plasma to patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD), but measurement of these antibodies is complex. METHODS: Anti-EBOV antibody was measured by 2 neutralization and 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) in convalescent plasma (ECP) from 100 EVD survivor donors in Liberia. Viral load was assessed repetitively in patients with EVD participating in a clinical trial of enhanced standard of care plus ECP. RESULTS: All 4 anti-EBOV assays were highly concordant for detection of EBOV antibody. Antibodies were not detected in plasma specimens obtained from 15 of 100 donors, including 7 with documented EBOV-positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction during EVD. Viral load was reduced following each dose in the 2 clinical trial participants who received ECP with higher antibody levels but not in the 2 who received ECP with lower antibody levels. CONCLUSIONS: Recovery from EVD can occur with absence of detectable anti-EBOV antibody several months after disease onset. ELISAs may be useful to select ECP donors or identify ECP units that contain neutralizing antibody. ECP with higher anti-EBOV antibody levels may have greater effect on EBOV load—an observation that requires further investigation.

Analytical Performance of a Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay for Leishmania DNA Detection in Sandflies and Direct Smears of Patients with Cutaneous Leishmaniasis,"Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is ideal for the detection of Leishmania DNA as it is a quick and easy-to-perform test that does not require complex or sophisticated equipment or infrastructure. However, the application of this technique in the detection of Leishmania DNA has not been comprehensively analyzed to date (analytical validation). Our objective was to evaluate the sensitivity and analytical specificity (anticipated reportable range [ARR], the limit of detection [LoD], and accuracy) of LAMP targeting the 18S rRNA gene in the diagnosis of six New World Leishmania species. We then applied the validated LAMP assay across 50 samples of sandflies and 50 direct smears from a recent outbreak of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia to determine its diagnostic performance. The LAMP assay exclusively amplified the DNA of Leishmania spp., and an ARR of between 1 × 10(4) and 1 × 10(−2) equivalent parasites/mL was determined. An LoD of 1 × 10(−2) equivalent parasites/mL was established and there was no statistically significant variation in terms of accuracy. Finally, a sensitivity of 100% in direct smears and sandflies samples was calculated and a specificity of 90.9% for direct smears using microscopy as reference and 96.8% for sandflies using real-time polymerase chain reaction as reference were determined. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analytically validate a LAMP test to detect Leishmania DNA, which showed good diagnostic potential from sandflies and direct smear samples.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.00383968,0.071163205,0.247088275,0.018891076,-0.063794412,-0.03829,0.055226855,-0.006413738,-0.012197468,-0.052752961,-0.061198463,0.014145903,-0.02623906,-0.01823047,-0.06344986,0.044131167,-0.010392597,0.037356048,-0.06226807,-0.007445792,-0.096295134,-0.047194682,-0.035061449,0.124475651,0.057567027,-0.032092078,-0.134791284,0.110920351,-0.103340335,0.019662395
Evaluation of real-time reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for clinical diagnosis of West Nile virus in patients,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus. The disease can be diagnosed by isolation followed by fluorescent antibody tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. These diagnostic methods are laborious and time-consuming. The present study was aimed to evaluate the real-time reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method for rapid, early and accurate diagnosis of WNV. METHODS: A one-step single tube accelerated quantitative RT-LAMP assay was evaluated by targeting the Env gene of WNV. The gene amplification was accomplished by incubating the reaction mixture at 63°C for 60 min in both real time turbidimeter as well as routine laboratory water bath/dry heating bath. To rule out contamination issues, proper negative controls, including no template, no primer; and no enzyme, were always kept alongside each run. The RT-LAMP assay was evaluated on 105 clinical samples from individuals having ocular infection. RESULTS: Of the 105 samples tested, 27 were positive for WNV by RT-LAMP assay. The comparative evaluation with conventional RT-PCR revealed 100 per cent accordance with sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 95 per cent, respectively. The specificity of this assay was confirmed with serum samples obtained from patients with dengue and chikungunya. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The RT-LAMP test seemed to be a sensitive and specific method for rapid detection of WNV infection and would be useful for rapid screening of a large number of clinical samples in endemic areas during outbreaks.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.080744857,0.139187895,0.345095012,0.092338078,-0.068847116,-0.092239058,-0.008046756,0.011146608,-0.026964434,-0.085085711,-0.021956462,0.033850779,-0.064102564,0.094515264,-0.096965748,0.034180703,0.068766758,0.057285006,-0.100591544,-0.002628253,-0.086858149,-0.038892218,-0.06911252,0.168458857,0.075913221,0.044134234,-0.035957087,0.046393495,-0.061269851,-0.014882468
Characteristics and Outcomes of Coronavirus Infection in Children: The Role of Viral Factors and an Immunocompromised State,"BACKGROUND: Immunocompromised children might be predisposed to serious infections from human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including strains OC43, NL63, HKU1, and 229E; however, the virologic and clinical features of HCoV infection in immunocompromised children have not been compared to those in nonimmunocompromised children. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of children who presented to Seattle Children’s Hospital and in whom HCoV was detected by a multiplex respiratory polymerase chain reaction assay of a nasal sample between October 2012 and March 2016. Lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) was defined as possible or definite infiltrate seen in chest imaging, need for oxygen, or abnormal lung examination in conjunction with a physician diagnosis of LRTD. We used logistic regression modeling to evaluate risk factors for LRTD and LRTD that necessitated oxygen use (severe LRTD), including an immunocompromised state, in children with HCoV infection. RESULTS: The median ages of 85 immunocompromised and 1152 nonimmunocompromised children with HCoV infection were 6.3 and 1.6 years, respectively. The prevalence of LRTD and of severe LRTD did not differ greatly between the immunocompromised and nonimmunocompromised patients (22% vs 26% [LRTD] and 15% vs 11% [severe LRTD], respectively); however, in a multivariable model, an immunocompromised state was associated with an increased likelihood of severe LRTD (adjusted odds ratio, 2.5 [95% confidence interval, 1.2–4.9]; P = .01). Younger age, having an underlying pulmonary disorder, and the presence of respiratory syncytial virus were also associated with LRTD or severe LRTD in multivariable models. The risks of LRTD or severe LRTD did not differ among the children with different HCoV strains. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a copathogen and host factors, including an immunocompromised state, were associated with increased risk for severe LRTD. Recognizing risk factors for severe respiratory illness might assist in risk stratification.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.097519483,-0.054440994,-0.06605856,-0.062764982,0.043992186,-0.052962248,0.059375086,-0.047806885,0.070575265,-0.055767952,-0.018154622,0.151945777,0.073327056,0.025739275,-0.020079158,0.069197527,-0.058402174,-0.010488321,-0.039216514,0.016929786,-0.035989686,0.020486611,0.005323857,-0.023551891,0.004881629,-0.014671344,0.009642753,-0.0456395,-0.003871754,0.019546352
Human Norovirus NS3 Has RNA Helicase and Chaperoning Activities,"RNA-remodeling proteins, including RNA helicases and chaperones, act to remodel RNA structures and/or protein-RNA interactions and are required for all processes involving RNAs. Although many viruses encode RNA helicases and chaperones, their in vitro activities and their roles in infected cells largely remain elusive. Noroviruses are a diverse group of positive-strand RNA viruses in the family Caliciviridae and constitute a significant and potentially fatal threat to human health. Here, we report that the protein NS3 encoded by human norovirus has both ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity that unwinds RNA helices and ATP-independent RNA-chaperoning activity that can remodel structured RNAs and facilitate strand annealing. Moreover, NS3 can facilitate viral RNA synthesis in vitro by norovirus polymerase. NS3 may therefore play an important role in norovirus RNA replication. Lastly, we demonstrate that the RNA-remodeling activity of NS3 is inhibited by guanidine hydrochloride, an FDA-approved compound, and, more importantly, that it reduces the replication of the norovirus replicon in cultured human cells. Altogether, these findings are the first to demonstrate the presence of RNA-remodeling activities encoded by Caliciviridae and highlight the functional significance of NS3 in the noroviral life cycle. IMPORTANCE Noroviruses are a diverse group of positive-strand RNA viruses, which annually cause hundreds of millions of human infections and over 200,000 deaths worldwide. For RNA viruses, cellular or virus-encoded RNA helicases and/or chaperones have long been considered to play pivotal roles in viral life cycles. However, neither RNA helicase nor chaperoning activity has been demonstrated to be associated with any norovirus-encoded proteins, and it is also unknown whether norovirus replication requires the participation of any viral or cellular RNA helicases/chaperones. We found that a norovirus protein, NS3, not only has ATP-dependent helicase activity, but also acts as an ATP-independent RNA chaperone. Also, NS3 can facilitate in vitro viral RNA synthesis, suggesting the important role of NS3 in norovirus replication. Moreover, NS3 activities can be inhibited by an FDA-approved compound, which also suppresses norovirus replicon replication in human cells, raising the possibility that NS3 could be a target for antinoroviral drug development.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.221171317,-0.070836061,-0.098558089,0.130785197,-0.062295907,-0.069187727,0.051467181,0.031685844,-0.024364884,0.021931365,0.071599779,0.030193784,-0.019263023,0.074584745,0.014552258,-0.003003579,-0.001690536,0.026409353,0.075121221,0.035560141,-0.038267507,0.067229494,-0.065600109,-0.042153115,0.001050297,-0.025164798,-0.019768538,-0.011056274,0.006474354,0.015270545
Rhinovirus in Febrile Infants and Risk of Bacterial Infection,"BACKGROUND: Febrile infants with viral respiratory infections have a reduced risk of bacterial infection compared with virus-negative infants. The risk of concomitant bacterial infection in febrile infants positive for human rhinovirus (HRV) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is unknown. METHODS: Infants 1–90 days old managed using the care process model for well-appearing febrile infants and with respiratory viral testing by PCR (RVPCR) in the emergency department or inpatient setting of 22 hospitals in the Intermountain Healthcare system from 2007-2016 were identified. Relative risk (RR) of bacterial infection was calculated for infants with HRV, non-HRV viruses, or no virus detected. RESULTS: Of 10 964 febrile infants identified, 4037 (37%) had RVPCR. Of these, 2212 (55%) were positive for a respiratory virus; 1392 (35%) for HRV alone. Bacterial infection was identified in 9.5%. Febrile infants with HRV detected were more likely to have bacterial infection than those with non-HRV viruses (7.8% vs 3.7%; P < .001; RR 2.12 [95% CI 1.43–3.15]). Risk of urinary tract infection was not significantly different for HRV-positive infants at any age, nor was risk of invasive bacterial infection (IBI; bacteremia and/or meningitis) meaningfully different for infants 1–28 day olds. Infants 29–90 days old with HRV had a decreased likelihood of IBI (RR 0.52 [95% CI 0.34–0.80]). CONCLUSIONS: HRV is common in febrile infants. Detection did not alter risk of concomitant urinary tract infection at any age or risk of IBI in infants 1–28 days old. HRV detection may be relevant in considering risk of IBI for infants 29–90 days of age.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.139559486,-0.086947646,-0.050916916,-0.067420792,0.002722973,-0.072371497,0.059755773,-0.013705087,0.024138637,-0.004474354,0.0178245,-0.029230956,-0.063617447,-0.042943667,0.059651425,0.076109212,0.017209182,-0.073757787,0.109105429,-0.053656443,-0.074201275,-0.132251991,-0.109044881,0.085613948,-0.011392952,0.054262435,-0.045689823,-0.043188331,0.073571083,0.1585822
β-d-N(4)-Hydroxycytidine Is a Potent Anti-alphavirus Compound That Induces a High Level of Mutations in the Viral Genome,"Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a representative member of the New World alphaviruses. It is transmitted by mosquito vectors and causes highly debilitating disease in humans, equids, and other vertebrate hosts. Despite a continuous public health threat, very few compounds with anti-VEEV activity in cell culture and in mouse models have been identified to date, and rapid development of virus resistance to some of them has been recorded. In this study, we investigated the possibility of using a modified nucleoside analog, β-d-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (NHC), as an anti-VEEV agent and defined the mechanism of its anti-VEEV activity. The results demonstrate that NHC is a very potent antiviral agent. It affects both the release of genome RNA-containing VEE virions and their infectivity. Both of these antiviral activities are determined by the NHC-induced accumulation of mutations in virus-specific RNAs. The antiviral effect is most prominent when NHC is applied early in the infectious process, during the amplification of negative- and positive-strand RNAs in infected cells. Most importantly, only a low-level resistance of VEEV to NHC can be developed, and it requires acquisition and cooperative function of more than one mutation in nsP4. These adaptive mutations are closely located in the same segment of nsP4. Our data suggest that NHC is more potent than ribavirin as an anti-VEEV agent and likely can be used to treat other alphavirus infections. IMPORTANCE Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) can cause widespread epidemics among humans and domestic animals. VEEV infections result in severe meningoencephalitis and long-term sequelae. No approved therapeutics exist for treatment of VEEV infections. Our study demonstrates that β-d-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (NHC) is a very potent anti-VEEV compound, with the 50% effective concentration being below 1 μM. The mechanism of NHC antiviral activity is based on induction of high mutation rates in the viral genome. Accordingly, NHC treatment affects both the rates of particle release and the particle infectivity. Most importantly, in contrast to most of the anti-alphavirus drugs that are under development, resistance of VEEV to NHC develops very inefficiently. Even low levels of resistance require acquisition of multiple mutations in the gene of the VEEV-specific RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsP4.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.085027326,-0.02901707,-0.012623285,-0.007464172,-0.077431287,0.059947537,0.054557662,-0.003089615,0.02642692,0.020007379,0.017392693,0.013194156,-0.000263453,-0.002683985,0.032528012,0.017946439,-0.0432025,0.065743997,0.026797457,-0.005295896,0.013880926,-0.011060255,-0.004982539,0.029191469,0.013080082,0.02058222,0.022452136,-0.018086451,0.025356242,-0.00040234
Varicella zoster meningitis: an atypical case of zoster reactivation in immunocompetent young adult,"Varicella virus is a neurotropic virus that can reactivate later in life to cause zoster or shingles. Typically, it affects elderly, immunocompromised population. We report an unusual case of an immunocompetent young adult presenting with occipital headache and zoster rash, without preherpetic and postherpetic neuralgia, who was diagnosed with varicella meningitis on Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). He was treated with intravenous acyclovir and later discharged on famciclovir.

Structural and molecular basis of mismatch correction and ribavirin excision from coronavirus RNA,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) stand out among RNA viruses because of their unusually large genomes (∼30 kb) associated with low mutation rates. CoVs code for nsp14, a bifunctional enzyme carrying RNA cap guanine N7-methyltransferase (MTase) and 3′-5′ exoribonuclease (ExoN) activities. ExoN excises nucleotide mismatches at the RNA 3′-end in vitro, and its inactivation in vivo jeopardizes viral genetic stability. Here, we demonstrate for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV an RNA synthesis and proofreading pathway through association of nsp14 with the low-fidelity nsp12 viral RNA polymerase. Through this pathway, the antiviral compound ribavirin 5′-monophosphate is significantly incorporated but also readily excised from RNA, which may explain its limited efficacy in vivo. The crystal structure at 3.38 Å resolution of SARS-CoV nsp14 in complex with its cofactor nsp10 adds to the uniqueness of CoVs among RNA viruses: The MTase domain presents a new fold that differs sharply from the canonical Rossmann fold.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.162422835,0.151929513,-0.194521001,0.150549997,0.026052742,-0.046191028,0.087149506,-0.009371963,-0.088147361,0.033521992,0.072793039,0.014280094,-0.056716906,-0.010117622,-0.016918428,0.042083744,-0.019828131,-0.015624125,-0.026633976,0.029669029,0.015758636,-0.03888696,0.11229776,0.064375488,0.026208889,5.70E-05,-0.057692004,-0.031083324,0.027092002,-0.061535338
"Dynamics of Bacterial Colonization With Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis During Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Viral Upper Respiratory Tract Infection","BACKGROUND: Virus is detected in about 80% of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in children and is also detectable in the nasopharynx of 30% of asymptomatic children. The effect of asymptomatic viral infection on the dynamics of bacterial density and colonization of the nasopharynx has not been reported. The current study was performed to assess the presence and density of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis in the nasopharynx of 4–7-year-old children during URTI and when well. METHODS: Nasal samples were obtained during 4 surveillance periods when children were asymptomatic and whenever they had symptoms of URTI. Respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens were identified and quantified using polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The proportion of children colonized with all 3 bacteria was higher during visits for acute URTI than during asymptomatic surveillance visits. Mean bacterial densities were significantly higher at all visits for all 3 pathogens when a virus was detected. The differences between the means were 1.0, 0.4, and 0.7 log(10) colony-forming unit equivalents per milliliter for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis, respectively, compared with visits in which virus was not detected. The percentage of children colonized and density were also higher at asymptomatic visits in which virus was detected than at visits in which virus was not detected.

Human Washington University Polyomavirus in Patients with Respiratory Tract Infection in Kuwait,"OBJECTIVE: To determine Washington University (WU) polyomavirus strains circulating among hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections (RTI) in Kuwait. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples from 459 hospitalized children and adult RTI patients were screened for respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction from April 2013 to April 2016. The VP2 gene from WU virus (WUV)-positive samples was sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Of the 459 hospitalized RTI patients, 18 (3.9$) patients were positive for WUV infection. WUV infection was common among children aged ≤11 years (9 patients, 50$). Among the 18 WUV-infected hospitalized patients, viral co-infection was detected in 9 patients (50$). The most common viruses associated with mixed infection were respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus (2 patients, 11.1$ each). Of the 18 WUV-infected patients, 4 were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. The circulating strains belong to type Ia and IIIb. CONCLUSION: This study enabled us to detect WUV among hospitalized RTI patients. Co-infection with other respiratory viruses was notable. Two circulating WUV genotypes (Ia and IIIb) were identified among hospitalized RTI patients in Kuwait.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.183282397,-0.061960272,-0.09227396,-0.079280612,0.042614238,-0.073819497,-0.034505239,0.040443346,-0.075070356,0.054412368,-0.026533838,0.052758621,0.009051078,0.100502636,-0.016903783,-0.028884473,0.028547865,0.035277993,0.017534533,0.054267732,0.088623323,-0.018605886,-0.019688238,0.035633623,-0.037351228,0.002398422,-0.05824794,0.000414138,-0.054395106,0.037193473
Nuclear TRIM25 specifically targets influenza virus ribonucleoproteins to block the onset of RNA chain elongation,"TRIM25 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that activates RIG-I to promote the anti-viral interferon response. The NS1 protein from all strains of influenza A virus bind TRIM25, although not all virus strains block the interferon response, suggesting alternative mechanisms for TRIM25 action. Here we present a nuclear role for TRIM25 in specifically restricting influenza A virus replication. TRIM25 inhibits viral RNA synthesis through a direct mechanism, independent of its ubiquitin ligase activity and the interferon pathway. This activity can be inhibited by the viral NS1 protein. TRIM25 inhibition of viral RNA synthesis results from its binding to viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs), the structures containing individual viral RNA segments, the viral polymerase, and multiple viral nucleoproteins. TRIM25 binding does not inhibit initiation of capped RNA-primed viral mRNA synthesis by the viral polymerase. Rather, the onset of RNA chain elongation is inhibited because TRIM25 prohibits the movement of RNA into the polymerase complex.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.183771238,-0.104476486,-0.100735458,0.152440905,-0.11721221,0.024694872,-0.003753904,0.001035633,-0.008408379,0.040586376,0.051193716,-0.040990523,-0.000226726,0.10914418,-0.007442281,-0.016422224,0.014592314,-0.034899655,0.006181267,0.05889504,-0.058511123,0.090668135,-0.048319851,-0.014925727,0.018238921,-0.049306975,0.011788014,-0.030581587,0.008711347,0.140502508
Detection of Respiratory Viruses from ARTI Patients by xTAG RVP Fast v2 Assay and Conventional Methods,"INTRODUCTION: Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in paediatric patients. Therefore, early detection of the viral aetiologies of ARTIs is essential for patient management and infection control. In this study, we evaluated the performance of a new multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel [RVP] Fast v2) in the detection of respiratory viruses by comparing it with that of viral culture and direct immunofluorescence (IF) staining. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swab and aspirate samples were collected prospectively from 199 patients who presented with ARTIs at the University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia during a 10-month period. The PCR assay was conducted in parallel with conventional culture and direct IF staining methods. RESULTS: The positive rate of the xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay (78.4%) in detecting respiratory viruses was higher than that of the viral isolation (7.5%) and direct IF (23.1%) methods. Using the xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay, human enterovirus/human rhinovirus (HEV/HRV) was the most frequently detected (46.2%). The xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay revealed mixed infection caused by two or three respiratory viruses in 40 specimens, and these were undetected by the viral isolation and direct IF methods. CONCLUSION: The xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay was superior to conventional methods in the identification of common respiratory viruses, with higher sensitivity and shorter turnaround times for laboratory results.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.136580649,-0.006862552,0.048284641,0.045189245,-0.02642823,-0.076384839,0.042978605,0.001937466,-0.006919685,0.049392206,-0.016276584,-0.019514857,0.019337829,0.041272228,0.030519145,-0.043105148,0.045436416,-0.022035262,0.048707461,-0.001341305,0.043056366,-0.043641482,-0.006428205,-0.002376993,-0.047469573,0.036299579,-0.037130535,-0.024684115,-0.006332556,-0.033514212
Expression profile and promoter analysis of HEPIS,"Human embryo lung cellular protein interacting with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus nonstructural protein-10 (HEPIS) is a novel transcriptional repressor, the expression profile and promoter activity of which have not been well studied. In the present study, in situ hybridization of RNA was used to study differential HEPIS expression levels in different types of cancer and normal tissues. A total of six truncated lengths of the HEPIS promoter regulatory sequences were cloned into the pGL3-basic vector, and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and dual luciferase reporter assays were performed. The results of RT-qPCR demonstrated that HEPIS expression levels differed across four breast cancer cell lines. The results of the dual luciferase reporter assays revealed that the activities of the reporter gene fragments spanning −1334/+373, −1203/+373, −1060/+373 and −899/+373 bp were higher compared with the reporter gene fragments spanning −759/+373 and −279/+373 bp. A search of the transcription factor database TRANSFAC identified numerous octamer transcription factor-1 (OCT-1), nuclear factor (NF)-κB and C-JUN transcription factor binding sites located on the HEPIS promoter (pHEPIS). Furthermore, the results revealed that mutations of the OCT-1 (−1236/−1223 bp), NF-κB (−1186/−1176 bp) and C-JUN (−856/−846 bp) sites on the human pHEPIS resulted in a decrease in luciferase activity. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that OCT-1, NF-κB and C-JUN bound to pHEPIS in a site-dependent manner at the basal state. The TRANSFAC database was used to analyze the pHEPIS of multiple species and several activator protein-1, NF-κB and OCT-1 transcription factor binding sites were predicted. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that HEPIS is expressed at different levels in multiple organs and breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, these findings indicate that OCT-1, NF-κB and C-JUN transcription factors are associated with transcriptional regulation of the HEPIS gene.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.088241944,-0.010858381,0.022446283,-0.077182633,-0.029207646,0.012093767,-0.011478171,-0.049671567,0.052252564,-0.062026922,-0.079242648,-0.028238343,-0.018057913,0.096884015,-0.033471862,-0.016313308,0.030069024,-0.062616177,-0.03044434,-0.04602212,0.026458734,-0.010178187,0.024749976,0.01322386,-0.00621618,-0.007688385,0.013127149,0.030839327,0.054888211,-0.037240337
Zinc Salts Block Hepatitis E Virus Replication by Inhibiting the Activity of Viral RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes an acute, self-limiting hepatitis in healthy individuals and leads to chronic disease in immunocompromised individuals. HEV infection in pregnant women results in a more severe outcome, with the mortality rate going up to 30%. Though the virus usually causes sporadic infection, epidemics have been reported in developing and resource-starved countries. No specific antiviral exists against HEV. A combination of interferon and ribavirin therapy has been used to control the disease with some success. Zinc is an essential micronutrient that plays crucial roles in multiple cellular processes. Zinc salts are known to be effective in reducing infections caused by few viruses. Here, we investigated the effect of zinc salts on HEV replication. In a human hepatoma cell (Huh7) culture model, zinc salts inhibited the replication of genotype 1 (g-1) and g-3 HEV replicons and g-1 HEV infectious genomic RNA in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis of a replication-defective mutant of g-1 HEV genomic RNA under similar conditions ruled out the possibility of zinc salts acting on replication-independent processes. An ORF4-Huh7 cell line-based infection model of g-1 HEV further confirmed the above observations. Zinc salts did not show any effect on the entry of g-1 HEV into the host cell. Furthermore, our data reveal that zinc salts directly inhibit the activity of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), leading to inhibition of viral replication. Taken together, these studies unravel the ability of zinc salts in inhibiting HEV replication, suggesting their possible therapeutic value in controlling HEV infection. IMPORTANCE Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a public health concern in resource-starved countries due to frequent outbreaks. It is also emerging as a health concern in developed countries owing to its ability to cause acute and chronic infection in organ transplant and immunocompromised individuals. Although antivirals such as ribavirin have been used to treat HEV cases, there are known side effects and limitations of such therapy. Our discovery of the ability of zinc salts to block HEV replication by virtue of their ability to inhibit the activity of viral RdRp is important because these findings pave the way to test the efficacy of zinc supplementation therapy in HEV-infected patients. Since zinc supplementation therapy is known to be safe in healthy individuals and since high-dose zinc is used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, it may be possible to control HEV-associated health problems following a similar treatment regimen.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.071948703,-0.037925605,-0.04648415,-0.01127471,-0.0836012,0.026624974,0.052797926,0.009991997,0.021821973,0.028067583,0.024396915,0.015216479,-0.009210425,0.00573888,0.007948546,-0.00291443,-0.018955919,0.048760658,0.030631854,0.013576735,0.014864435,0.006684746,-0.02917597,-0.024698832,0.007748199,0.027605023,0.00080396,-0.018914215,0.019096566,-0.013585419
Impact of Respiratory Viral Panel Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay Turnaround Time on Length of Stay and Antibiotic Use in Patients With Respiratory Viral Illnesses,"Background: Respiratory viral illnesses account for many hospitalizations and inappropriate antibiotic use. Respiratory viral panels by polymerase chain reaction (RVP-PCR) provide a reliable means of diagnosis. In 2015, the RVP-PCR assay at our institution was switched from respiratory viral panel (RVP) to rapid respiratory panel (rapid RP), which has a faster turnaround time (24 hours vs 12 hours, respectively). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of RVP-PCR tests on duration of antibiotic use and length of stay (LOS) in hospitalized patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who had a RVP-PCR ordered within a 1-year time period before and after the assay switch. Patients who were pregnant, had received antibiotics within 30 days prior to admission, were not discharged, or had not completed antibiotics by end of study period were excluded. Results: Data were obtained from a total of 140 patients (70 in each group). Of these, 25 (35.7%) in the RVP group and 28 (40.0%) in the rapid RP group had a positive result. The median LOS was 4.5 days (IQR, 3-9 days) in the RVP group and 5 days (IQR, 3-9 days) in the rapid RP group (P = .78). The median duration of antibiotic use was 4 days (IQR, 2-7 days) in the RVP group and 5 days (IQR, 1-7 days) in the rapid RP group (P = .8). Conclusion: Despite faster turnaround time, there was no significant difference in duration of antibiotic use, or LOS between the RVP and rapid RP groups.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.115150007,-0.006906814,0.008682978,-0.06630587,-0.048614872,-0.049627405,-0.015620872,0.057555132,-0.077903358,0.010780475,-0.017414816,-0.006143936,-0.031399216,0.0241078,-0.000463148,0.025305095,0.061946301,0.048308412,0.018594523,0.000720472,0.021092126,-0.088412423,-0.032355645,-0.091401801,-0.063677424,-0.019957298,0.00676498,-0.083560349,-0.034760656,-0.010404598
IL-35 may maintain homeostasis of the immune microenvironment in periodontitis,"T lymphocyte cells, including regulatory T (Treg) and T helper 17 cells, have important roles in the human periodontium. However, the basis for Treg cytokine expression in various compartments of the periodontium remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of interleukin (IL)-35 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and periodontal tissues of patients with chronic periodontitis (CP), with a view to understanding its role in this disease, and ultimately providing improved treatments. Peripheral blood, periodontal tissues and gingival crevicular fluids (GCFs) were collected from patients with CP or impacted teeth, the latter serving as healthy controls. The expression levels of IL-35 subunit mRNAs in PBMCs and periodontal tissues were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while the IL-35 protein expression in GCFs and sera was quantified by ELISA. The relative expression of IL-35 subunit mRNAs in the affected tissues of patients with CP was significantly higher compared with that in samples from healthy controls (P<0.05). The mean concentration of IL-35 protein in the GCFs and sera of patients with periodontitis was also significantly higher compared with that in samples from healthy controls (P<0.001). IL-35 protein and periodontal clinical indicators were negatively correlated. It was hypothesized that the increased level of IL-35 plays a protective role in periodontal disease by maintaining immune system homeostasis and dampening the inflammatory response, and highlights IL-35 as a potential new therapy for the treatment of periodontitis.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.005619928,-0.033346381,-0.019458871,-0.191022134,-0.103336752,0.006667016,-0.0026339,-0.029108726,-0.003517064,-0.063891997,-0.0463755,-0.057147494,-0.013738155,0.13676366,-0.07250528,-0.001949227,0.010503835,-0.069632877,-0.020676897,-0.065649127,0.026054633,-0.076563536,0.049130223,0.006917675,-0.056610807,-0.035925995,0.064941263,0.024058429,0.042413945,-0.00109991
Feline meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown origin: A retrospective analysis of 16 cases,"This study aimed to describe the signalment, clinical signs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, treatment, and outcome of feline meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown origin (FMUO). Medical records from 16 cats meeting the inclusion criteria of CSF pleocytosis, negative CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-infectious disease results, and characteristic MRI findings were retrospectively reviewed. Median age was 9.4 years. Clinical signs included ataxia, proprioceptive deficits, seizures, and spinal hyperesthesia. The CSF nucleated cell count was increased (median 70.7 cells/μL), with predominantly mixed pleocytosis and CSF protein concentration was increased in 15/16 cats. Magnetic resonance imaging showed intraparenchymal infiltrative ill-defined lesions in 13 cases. All cats received a corticosteroid-based treatment protocol; additional therapies included lomustine, cytarabine, and anticonvulsant medications. Mild neurological signs were recorded in 5/12 cats but 7/12 cats were neurologically normal at re-examination.

Zinc Finger-Containing Cellular Transcription Corepressor ZBTB25 Promotes Influenza Virus RNA Transcription and Is a Target for Zinc Ejector Drugs,"Influenza A virus (IAV) replication relies on an intricate interaction between virus and host cells. How the cellular proteins are usurped for IAV replication remains largely obscure. The aim of this study was to search for novel and potential cellular factors that participate in IAV replication. ZBTB25, a transcription repressor of a variety of cellular genes, was identified by an RNA interference (RNAi) genomic library screen. Depletion of ZBTB25 significantly reduced IAV production. Conversely, overexpression of ZBTB25 enhanced it. ZBTB25 interacted with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein and modulated its transcription activity. In addition, ZBTB25 also functioned as a viral RNA (vRNA)-binding protein, binding preferentially to the U-rich sequence within the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of vRNA. Both protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions involving ZBTB25 facilitated viral RNA transcription and replication. In addition, ZBTB25 suppressed interferon production, further enhancing viral replication. ZBTB25-associated functions required an intact zinc finger domain and posttranslational SUMO-1 modification of ZBTB25. Furthermore, treatment with disulfiram (a zinc ejector) of ZBTB25-overexpressing cells showed significantly reduced IAV production as a result of reduced RNA synthesis. Our findings indicate that IAV usurps ZBTB25 for IAV RNA synthesis and serves as a novel and potential therapeutic antiviral target. IMPORTANCE IAV-induced seasonal influenza causes severe illness and death in high-risk populations. However, IAV has developed resistance to current antiviral drugs due to its high mutation rate. Therefore, development of drugs targeting cellular factors required for IAV replication is an attractive alternative for IAV therapy. Here, we discovered a cellular protein, ZBTB25, that enhances viral RdRp activity by binding to both viral RdRp and viral RNA to stimulate viral RNA synthesis. A unique feature of ZBTB25 in the regulation of viral replication is its dual transcription functions, namely, promoting viral RNA transcription through binding to the U-rich region of vRNA and suppressing cellular interferon production. ZBTB25 contains a zinc finger domain that is required for RNA-inhibitory activity by chelating zinc ions. Disulfiram treatment disrupts the zinc finger functions, effectively repressing IAV replication. Based on our findings, we demonstrate that ZBTB25 regulates IAV RNA transcription and replication and serves as a promising antiviral target for IAV treatment.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.162473678,-0.062574459,-0.07169122,0.064590032,-0.105111875,0.020624327,0.028316096,0.002122505,0.008019157,0.007711371,0.035561064,0.011379063,-0.033425422,0.064160172,-0.007882003,0.005835231,0.006764476,-0.006510791,-0.003433474,0.032870411,-0.025297552,0.047134669,-0.019699762,-0.04100235,0.024856916,-0.003227422,0.026109482,-0.010517335,0.035916239,0.057869702
Novel Alphacoronaviruses and Paramyxoviruses Cocirculate with Type 1 and Severe Acute Respiratory System (SARS)-Related Betacoronaviruses in Synanthropic Bats of Luxembourg,"Several infectious disease outbreaks with high mortality in humans have been attributed to viruses that are thought to have evolved from bat viruses. In this study from Luxembourg, the genetic diversity and epidemiology of paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses shed by the bat species Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and Myotis emarginatus were evaluated. Feces collection (n = 624) was performed longitudinally in a mixed-species colony in 2015 and 2016. In addition, feces (n = 254) were collected cross-sectionally from six Myotis emarginatus colonies in 2016. By use of degenerate primers in a nested format, overall prevalences of 1.1% (10/878) and 4.9% (43/878) were determined for paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses. Sequences of the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and spike glycoprotein genes of coronaviruses, as well as sequences of the partial L gene of paramyxoviruses, were obtained. Novel paramyxovirus and Alphacoronavirus strains were identified in different Myotis emarginatus colonies, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related Betacoronavirus strains were shed by Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. Logistic regression revealed that the level of Alphacoronavirus shedding was highest in July (odds ratio, 2.8; P < 0.01), probably due to periparturient stress. Phylogenetic analyses point to close virus-host coevolution, and the high genetic similarity of the study strains suggests that the Myotis emarginatus colonies in Luxembourg are socially connected. Most interestingly, we show that bats also host Betacoronavirus 1 strains. The high similarity of the spike gene sequences of these viruses with mammalian Betacoronavirus 1 strains may be of concern. Both the SARS-related and Betacoronavirus 1 strains detected in bats in Luxembourg may cross the species barrier after a host adaptation process. IMPORTANCE Bats are a natural reservoir of a number of zoonotic pathogens. Several severe outbreaks in humans (e.g., a Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia in 1998, and the almost global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003) have been caused by bat-borne viruses that were transmitted to humans mostly after virus adaptation (e.g., in intermediate animal hosts). Despite the indigenousness of bat species that host viruses with suspected zoonotic potential and despite the zoonotic transmission of European bat 1 lyssavirus in Luxembourg, knowledge about the diversity and epidemiology of bat viruses remains limited in this country. Moreover, in contrast to other European countries, bat viruses are currently not included in the national surveillance activities of this land-locked country. We suggest that this gap in disease surveillance should be addressed, since we show here that synanthropic bats host viruses that may be able to cross the species barrier.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.047798227,0.088302419,-0.055387725,0.020084875,0.352718567,0.168210451,0.254647794,0.030262927,-0.131083741,-0.002719688,-0.095494297,-0.11320113,-0.009751837,0.05450397,-0.023717998,0.031401711,-0.018325425,0.040900106,0.016367242,0.055580926,0.004115087,7.70E-05,-0.027858589,0.001499881,0.017786849,-0.0150969,0.023816094,-0.003001274,-0.028553175,0.00499764
Partially Uncleaved Alphavirus Replicase Forms Spherule Structures in the Presence and Absence of RNA Template,"Alphaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses expressing their replicase as a polyprotein, P1234, which is cleaved to four final products, nonstructural proteins nsP1 to nsP4. The replicase proteins together with viral RNA and host factors form membrane invaginations termed spherules, which act as the replication complexes producing progeny RNAs. We have previously shown that the wild-type alphavirus replicase requires a functional RNA template and active polymerase to generate spherule structures. However, we now find that specific partially processed forms of the replicase proteins alone can give rise to membrane invaginations in the absence of RNA or replication. The minimal requirement for spherule formation was the expression of properly cleaved nsP4, together with either uncleaved P123 or with the combination of nsP1 and uncleaved P23. These inactive spherules were morphologically less regular than replication-induced spherules. In the presence of template, nsP1 plus uncleaved P23 plus nsP4 could efficiently assemble active replication spherules producing both negative-sense and positive-sense RNA strands. P23 alone did not have membrane affinity, but could be recruited to membrane sites in the presence of nsP1 and nsP4. These results define the set of viral components required for alphavirus replication complex assembly and suggest the possibility that it could be reconstituted from separately expressed nonstructural proteins. IMPORTANCE All positive-strand RNA viruses extensively modify host cell membranes to serve as efficient platforms for viral RNA replication. Alphaviruses and several other groups induce protective membrane invaginations (spherules) as their genome factories. Most positive-strand viruses produce their replicase as a polyprotein precursor, which is further processed through precise and regulated cleavages. We show here that specific cleavage intermediates of the alphavirus replicase can give rise to spherule structures in the absence of viral RNA. In the presence of template RNA, the same intermediates yield active replication complexes. Thus, partially cleaved replicase proteins play key roles that connect replication complex assembly, membrane deformation, and the different stages of RNA synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.221315931,-0.071630787,-0.091891418,0.104276182,-0.074504358,-0.082778714,0.009032382,0.029496538,-0.027897496,0.006828927,0.054502674,-0.005814273,-0.030625964,0.104639709,0.006513686,0.029570825,0.041068627,-0.077713337,0.01157346,0.044876128,-0.083769476,0.071932466,-0.084836054,-0.120207165,0.036163011,-0.019888957,-0.079899975,0.004092596,-0.085361929,-0.005431282
Coexistence of multiple genotypes of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus with novel mutant S genes in the Hubei Province of China in 2016,"The emergence of highly virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) variants in China caused huge economic losses in 2010. Since then, large-scale sporadic outbreaks of PED caused by PEDV variants have occasionally occurred in China. However, the molecular diversity and epidemiology of PEDV in different provinces has not been completely understood. To determine the molecular diversity of PEDV in the Hubei Province of China, we collected 172 PED samples from 34 farms across the province in 2016 and performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) by targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene. Seventy-four samples were found to be PEDV-positive. We further characterized the complete spike (S) glycoprotein genes from the positive samples and found 21 different S genes with amino acid mutations. The PEDV isolates here presented most of the genotypes which were found previously in field isolates in East and South-East Asia, North America, and Europe. Besides the typical Genotypes I and II, the INDEX groups were also found. Importantly, 58 new amino acids mutant sites in the S genes, including 44 sites in S1 and 14 sites in S2, were first described. Our results revealed that the S genes of PEDV showed variation and that diverse genotypes of PEDV coexisted and were responsible for the PED outbreaks in Hubei in 2016. This work highlighted the complexity of the epidemiology of PEDV and emphasized the need for reassessing the efficacy of classic PEDV vaccines against emerging variant strains and developing new vaccines to facilitate the prevention and control of PEDV in fields.

Human Bocavirus Capsid Messenger RNA Detection in Children With Pneumonia,"BACKGROUND: The role of human bocavirus (HBoV) in respiratory illness is uncertain. HBoV genomic DNA is frequently detected in both ill and healthy children. We hypothesized that spliced viral capsid messenger RNA (mRNA) produced during active replication might be a better marker for acute infection. METHODS: As part of the Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community (EPIC) study, children aged <18 years who were hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and children asymptomatic at the time of elective outpatient surgery (controls) were enrolled. Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal specimens were tested for HBoV mRNA and genomic DNA by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: HBoV DNA was detected in 10.4% of 1295 patients with CAP and 7.5% of 721 controls (odds ratio [OR], 1.4 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.0–2.0]); HBoV mRNA was detected in 2.1% and 0.4%, respectively (OR, 5.1 [95% CI, 1.6–26]). When adjusted for age, enrollment month, and detection of other respiratory viruses, HBoV mRNA detection (adjusted OR, 7.6 [95% CI, 1.5–38.4]) but not DNA (adjusted OR, 1.2 [95% CI, .6–2.4]) was associated with CAP. Among children with no other pathogens detected, HBoV mRNA (OR, 9.6 [95% CI, 1.9–82]) was strongly associated with CAP. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of HBoV mRNA but not DNA was associated with CAP, supporting a pathogenic role for HBoV in CAP. HBoV mRNA could be a useful target for diagnostic testing.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.120229476,-0.102161724,-0.054083959,-0.057049501,-0.028238712,-0.113104132,0.025838838,-0.014580192,-0.064261928,-0.039235577,-0.065328744,0.002548788,-0.015506155,-0.046009217,-0.121644727,0.057110701,-0.121458747,-0.111355454,-0.014125497,0.026436294,-0.133707032,0.20545753,0.161478353,0.126818883,-0.010417429,-0.111766242,-0.12611747,-0.068948009,0.078128001,0.056403721
Attenuation of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus by Engineered Viral Polymerase Fidelity,"Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (3D(pol)) catalyzes viral RNA synthesis. Its characteristic low fidelity and absence of proofreading activity allow FMDV to rapidly mutate and adapt to dynamic environments. In this study, we used the structure of FMDV 3D(pol) in combination with previously reported results from similar picornaviral polymerases to design point mutations that would alter replication fidelity. In particular, we targeted Trp237 within conserved polymerase motif A because of the low reversion potential inherent in the single UGG codon. Using biochemical and genetic tools, we show that the replacement of tryptophan 237 with phenylalanine imparts higher fidelity, but replacements with isoleucine and leucine resulted in lower-fidelity phenotypes. Viruses containing these W237 substitutions show in vitro growth kinetics and plaque morphologies similar to those of the wild-type (WT) A(24) Cruzeiro strain in BHK cells, and both high- and low-fidelity variants retained fitness during coinfection with the wild-type virus. The higher-fidelity W237F (W237F(HF)) mutant virus was more resistant to the mutagenic nucleoside analogs ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil than the WT virus, whereas the lower-fidelity W237I (W237I(LF)) and W237L(LF) mutant viruses exhibited lower ribavirin resistance. Interestingly, the variant viruses showed heterogeneous and slightly delayed growth kinetics in primary porcine kidney cells, and they were significantly attenuated in mouse infection experiments. These data demonstrate, for a single virus, that either increased or decreased RdRp fidelity attenuates virus growth in animals, which is a desirable feature for the development of safer and genetically more stable vaccine candidates. IMPORTANCE Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is the most devastating disease affecting livestock worldwide. Here, using structural and biochemical analyses, we have identified FMDV 3D(pol) mutations that affect polymerase fidelity. Recombinant FMDVs containing substitutions at 3D(pol) tryptophan residue 237 were genetically stable and displayed plaque phenotypes and growth kinetics similar to those of the wild-type virus in cell culture. We further demonstrate that viruses harboring either a W237F(HF) substitution or W237I(LF) and W237L(LF) mutations were highly attenuated in animals. Our study shows that obtaining 3D(pol) fidelity variants by protein engineering based on polymerase structure and function could be exploited for the development of attenuated FMDV vaccine candidates that are safer and more stable than strains obtained by selective pressure via mutagenic nucleotides or adaptation approaches.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.141831888,-0.060825282,-0.036343182,0.04704974,-0.044371545,0.032129531,0.082882259,-0.005792778,-0.019597714,0.072028115,0.091754321,0.093637067,-0.101692107,-0.028201133,0.002614795,-0.002740982,-0.034832648,-0.063590811,-0.116996444,-0.013702888,0.182387663,-0.10871034,0.087749597,0.170236192,-0.02660223,0.090471136,0.050594813,-0.052845315,-0.113978413,-0.136370133
Overexpressed eNOS upregulates SIRT1 expression and protects mouse pancreatic β cells from apoptosis,"Loss of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) activity may be associated with metabolic diseases, including diabetes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential effects of overexpressed endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) on cell proliferation and apoptosis with SIRT1 activation in the Min6 mouse pancreatic β cell line. A pcDNA3.0-eNOS plasmid was constructed and transfected into Min6 cells for 24 h prior to harvesting. eNOS expression was validated and SIRT1 expression was detected following plasmid transfection using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, which demonstrated that the expression levels of eNOS and SIRT1 were significantly upregulated. Furthermore, the cell proliferation and cell apoptosis of the Min6 cells were evaluated, using a cell counting kit-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The results suggested that overexpressed eNOS promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis in Min6 cells. The interaction between eNOS and SIRT1 was explored through co-immunoprecipitation, and it found that there was a strong interaction between eNOS and SIRT1. In conclusion, overexpressed eNOS may induce SIRT1 activation, which is implied to play a protective role in Min6 cells, and eNOS may be a new therapeutic target for diseases such as type 2 diabetes.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.068826114,-0.026871705,0.017418392,-0.105197668,-0.083751323,0.04901931,0.027931106,-0.047089973,0.055506737,-0.035377244,-0.050140165,-0.03058911,-0.012757531,0.089103739,0.009142884,0.028196797,-0.009671821,-0.034326564,0.013695539,-0.038257765,0.037381385,-0.008259586,0.047114385,-0.008104186,0.006405969,0.011335411,-0.012221974,0.036686692,-0.013602147,-0.047703911
Rapid detection of tomato leaf curl Bengaluru virus through loop mediated isothermal amplification assay,"A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique was employed to develop a simple and rapid method for the detection of tomato leaf curl Bangalore virus (ToLCBaV) in diseased plants of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Six sets of primers were designed for LAMP technique targeting the conserved AC1 region and successfully detected ToLCBaV. No reaction was detected in the tissues of healthy plants by either the LAMP or the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The LAMP products can be visualized by presence or absence of turbidity and staining (0.2 μL for 25 μL LAMP product) directly in the tube with nucleic acid stain dye which allowed easy detection. Sensitivity of LAMP assay is 100 times of conventional PCR technique. Although, both the LAMP and the PCR methods were capable of detecting ToLCBaV in infected tissues of tomato, the LAMP method would be more useful than the PCR method for detection of ToLCBaV infection in tomato plants because it is more rapid, simple and accurate method.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0046229,0.076043891,0.285121851,0.061198378,-0.058316339,-0.069116915,0.013391905,-0.008004801,-0.01061772,-0.046649993,-0.059346513,0.017948727,-0.01166138,0.012065081,-0.087566056,0.070957124,0.047604494,0.064814573,-0.169909493,-0.003181452,-0.159788482,-0.097092774,-0.060211959,0.225558942,0.146540761,0.014609367,-0.161260169,0.139821563,-0.109530645,0.007383006
Persistent bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) infection in cattle herds,"Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a significant pathogen associated with gastrointestinal, respiratory, and reproductive diseases of cattle worldwide. It causes continuous economic losses to the cattle industry primarily due to decreased reproductive performance. The ability of virus to cross the placenta during early pregnancy can result in the birth of persistently infected (PI) calves. Persistently infected animals are generally much more efficient transmitters of BVDV than transiently or acutely infected animals because they are capable of shedding large quantities of virus throughout their lives and are considered the primary reservoirs for BVDV. Due to the nature of viral infections, there is no treatment to fully cure an animal of a viral infection. All control programs which are in use in many countries of the world, mainly depend upon the detection of PI animals, eliminating them and preventing their return into the herds. Detection of PI animals at early stage, particularly soon after birth is of significant benefit to implement BVDV control programs. Available diagnostic tests such as virus isolation (VI), immunohistochemistry (IHC), Antigen-Capture ELISA (ACE), and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are used for detection of PI cattle. Each method to detect BVDV has advantages, disadvantages, and applicability for different diagnostic situations. The reliability of diagnostic tests is optimized by choosing the appropriate sampling strategy on the basis of animal age.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.015783781,0.008331376,0.098087906,-0.035385334,-0.029543225,0.019003255,0.052535805,-0.016864146,0.010229237,0.02951453,0.012669919,-0.020226921,0.019823723,-0.016387899,0.078857513,-0.018721359,-0.026982435,0.001620711,-0.020762001,0.006756682,-0.018566094,-0.018945629,-0.026421952,-0.022447204,0.0507715,-0.011534724,0.001117064,-0.090405221,-0.005379642,-0.003493153
"The Use of Xenosurveillance to Detect Human Bacteria, Parasites, and Viruses in Mosquito Bloodmeals","Infectious disease surveillance is hindered by several factors, including limited infrastructure and geographic isolation of many resource-poor regions. In addition, the complexities of sample acquisition, processing, and analysis, even in developed regions, can be rate limiting. Therefore, new strategies to survey human populations for emerging pathogens are necessary. Xenosurveillance is a method that utilizes mosquitoes as sampling devices to search for genetic signatures of pathogens in vertebrates. Previously we demonstrated that xenosurveillance can detect viral RNA in both laboratory and field settings. However, its ability to detect bacteria and parasites remains to be assessed. Accordingly, we fed Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes blood that contained Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Bacillus anthracis. In addition, we determined whether two additional emerging viruses, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and Zika virus could be detected by this method. Pathogen-specific real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate the sensitivity of xenosurveillance across multiple pathogen taxa and over time. We detected RNA from all pathogens at clinically relevant concentrations from mosquitoes processed up to 1 day postbloodfeeding. These results demonstrate that xenosurveillance may be used as a tool to expand surveillance for viral, parasitic, and bacterial pathogens in resource-limited areas.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.018907919,0.012655563,0.056045232,0.053852477,-0.006863453,-0.018087534,0.05426529,0.029892015,-0.01225387,0.090252782,-0.003579132,-0.0473713,0.069459731,-0.043931354,0.034922344,-0.019146023,-0.055602423,-0.045922141,-0.008279113,0.016741557,-0.023109467,0.018672887,0.017781627,-0.004828932,0.02130134,-0.00875586,-0.00718153,0.037842309,0.003921829,-0.03321422
Prolonged Shedding of Human Coronavirus in Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients: Risk Factors and Viral Genome Evolution,"BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that human coronavirus (HCoV) pneumonia is associated with significant mortality in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Investigation of risk factors for prolonged shedding and intrahost genome evolution may provide critical information for development of novel therapeutics. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed HCT recipients with HCoV detected in nasal samples by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HCoV strains were identified using strain-specific PCR. Shedding duration was defined as time between first positive and first negative sample. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate factors for prolonged shedding (≥21 days). Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) was conducted when ≥4 samples with cycle threshold values of <28 were available. RESULTS: Seventeen of 44 patients had prolonged shedding. Among 31 available samples, 35% were OC43, 32% were NL63, 19% were HKU1, and 13% were 229E; median shedding duration was similar between strains (P = .79). Bivariable logistic regression analyses suggested that high viral load, receipt of high-dose steroids, and myeloablative conditioning were associated with prolonged shedding. mNGS among 5 subjects showed single-nucleotide polymorphisms from OC43 and NL63 starting 1 month following onset of shedding. CONCLUSIONS: High viral load, high-dose steroids, and myeloablative conditioning were associated with prolonged shedding of HCoV in HCT recipients.

Density of Upper Respiratory Colonization With Streptococcus pneumoniae and Its Role in the Diagnosis of Pneumococcal Pneumonia Among Children Aged <5 Years in the PERCH Study,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggested an association between upper airway pneumococcal colonization density and pneumococcal pneumonia, but data in children are limited. Using data from the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study, we assessed this potential association. METHODS: PERCH is a case-control study in 7 countries: Bangladesh, The Gambia, Kenya, Mali, South Africa, Thailand, and Zambia. Cases were children aged 1–59 months hospitalized with World Health Organization–defined severe or very severe pneumonia. Controls were randomly selected from the community. Microbiologically confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia (MCPP) was confirmed by detection of pneumococcus in a relevant normally sterile body fluid. Colonization density was calculated with quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal specimens. RESULTS: Median colonization density among 56 cases with MCPP (MCPP cases; 17.28 × 10(6) copies/mL) exceeded that of cases without MCPP (non-MCPP cases; 0.75 × 10(6)) and controls (0.60 × 10(6)) (each P < .001). The optimal density for discriminating MCPP cases from controls using the Youden index was >6.9 log(10) copies/mL; overall, the sensitivity was 64% and the specificity 92%, with variable performance by site. The threshold was lower (≥4.4 log(10) copies/mL) when MCPP cases were distinguished from controls who received antibiotics before specimen collection. Among the 4035 non-MCPP cases, 500 (12%) had pneumococcal colonization density >6.9 log(10) copies/mL; above this cutoff was associated with alveolar consolidation at chest radiography, very severe pneumonia, oxygen saturation <92%, C-reactive protein ≥40 mg/L, and lack of antibiotic pretreatment (all P< .001).

Epidemiology and Clinical Features of Human Coronaviruses in the Pediatric Population,"BACKGROUND: The epidemiology and clinical features of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) in children are not fully characterized. METHODS: A retrospective study of children with HCoV detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed for a community cohort and a children’s hospital in the same community from January 2013 to December 2014. The RT-PCR assay detected HCoV 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43 in nasal swabs from symptomatic children ≤18 years. Factors associated with increased severity of illness in hospitalized children were assessed by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Human coronavirus was detected in 261 children, 49 and 212 from the community and hospital, respectively. The distribution of HCoV types and seasonal trends were similar in the community and hospital. Community cases were older than hospitalized cases (median age, 4.4 versus 1.7 years, respectively; P < .01), and a minority of community cases (26.5%) sought medical attention. Among the hospitalized children with HCoV detected, 39 (18.4%) received respiratory support and 24 (11.3%) were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Age <2 years (odds ratio [OR] = 5.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9–13.1) and cardiovascular (OR = 3.9; 95% CI, 1.6–9.5), genetic/congenital (OR = 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1–7.0), and respiratory chronic complex conditions ([CCCs] OR = 4.5; 95% CI, 1.7–12.0) were associated with receiving respiratory support. Genetic/congenital (OR = 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1–7.4) CCCs were associated with PICU admission. Severity of illness was similar among hospitalized children with different HCoV types. CONCLUSIONS: Children in the community with HCoV detected generally had mild illness as demonstrated by few medically attended cases. In hospitalized children, young age and CCCs, but not HCoV type, were associated with increased severity of illness.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.267463869,-0.114784536,-0.118564558,-0.0210746,0.132100535,-0.151557157,0.062457701,-0.091473371,0.119837536,-0.164951773,-0.004514504,0.292084096,0.092785689,0.027502121,-0.076470637,0.158273628,-0.12020645,-0.084438704,-0.033972751,-0.009818818,-0.189651293,0.158740535,0.058945124,0.036396177,-0.017392938,0.021536482,0.03888504,-0.134545244,0.000485675,0.025102275
Burden and Seasonality of Viral Acute Respiratory Tract Infections among Outpatients in Southern Sri Lanka,"In tropical and subtropical settings, the epidemiology of viral acute respiratory tract infections varies widely between countries. We determined the etiology, seasonality, and clinical presentation of viral acute respiratory tract infections among outpatients in southern Sri Lanka. From March 2013 to January 2015, we enrolled outpatients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI). Nasal/nasopharyngeal samples were tested in duplicate using antigen-based rapid influenza testing and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for respiratory viruses. Monthly proportion positive was calculated for each virus. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify associations between sociodemographic/clinical information and viral detection. Of 571 subjects, most (470, 82.3%) were ≥ 5 years of age and 53.1% were male. A respiratory virus was detected by PCR in 63.6% (N = 363). Common viral etiologies included influenza (223, 39%), human enterovirus/rhinovirus (HEV/HRV, 14.5%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 4.2%), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV, 3.9%). Both ILI and influenza showed clear seasonal variation, with peaks from March to June each year. RSV and hMPV activity peaked from May to July, whereas HEV/HRV was seen year-round. Patients with respiratory viruses detected were more likely to report pain with breathing (odds ratio [OR] = 2.60, P = 0.003), anorexia (OR = 2.29, P < 0.001), and fatigue (OR = 2.00, P = 0.002) compared with patients with no respiratory viruses detected. ILI showed clear seasonal variation in southern Sri Lanka, with most activity during March to June; peak activity was largely due to influenza. Targeted infection prevention activities such as influenza vaccination in January–February may have a large public health impact in this region.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.287346015,-0.148045523,-0.105507755,0.217112742,0.033777595,0.072076242,-0.0543461,-0.056336367,0.057377461,-0.046041723,0.021569,-0.042288451,-0.005531811,0.016886055,-0.028354821,-0.068845661,0.028730895,0.025643807,0.025766763,0.010169311,0.072068792,-0.10678775,-0.032176566,-0.029966819,0.009269205,0.020241579,-0.089032556,0.011367497,0.041013483,0.047604812
Efficacy of an accelerated hydrogen peroxide disinfectant to inactivate porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in swine feces on metal surfaces,"In May of 2013, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was detected in swine for the first time in North America. It spread rapidly, in part due to contaminated livestock trailers. The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of an accelerated hydrogen peroxide disinfectant for inactivating PEDV in the presence of feces on metal surfaces, such as those found in livestock trailers. Three-week-old barrows were inoculated intragastrically with 5 mL of PEDV-negative feces for the negative control, 5 mL of untreated PEDV-positive feces for the positive control, and 5 mL or 10 mL of PEDV-positive feces that was subjected to treatment with a 1:16 or 1:32 concentrations of accelerated hydrogen peroxide disinfectant for a contact time of 30 min at 20°C. These pigs served as a bioassay to determine the infectivity of virus following treatment. Rectal swabs collected from the inoculated pigs on days 3 and 7 post-inoculation were tested by using PEDV-specific real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and the proportion of pigs in each group that became infected with PEDV was assessed. None of the pigs used for the bioassay in the 4 treatment groups and the negative control group became infected with PEDV, which was significantly different from the positive control group (P < 0.05) in which all pigs were infected. The results suggest that the application of the accelerated hydrogen peroxide under these conditions was sufficient to inactivate the virus in feces found on metal surfaces.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.012088492,0.007661691,0.08661298,-0.131083984,0.035103237,0.050252317,-0.018778277,0.002260722,-0.022420005,-0.064590868,0.074634186,0.078393738,-0.217106518,0.082961152,0.333143537,-0.213023111,-0.067749168,0.051294221,-0.026191047,0.191678512,-0.251349592,-0.112444916,0.097680298,-0.098202034,-0.100303521,-0.026894193,-0.040156909,0.016461375,0.05879747,-0.010065206
Respiratory Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction: An Important Diagnostic Tool in Immunocompromised Patients,"BACKGROUND: Viruses and atypical pathogens can cause significant respiratory illness in immunocompromised patients. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MPCR) has improved the diagnostic yield of pathogens, and it is easier to identify the co-infections also. The present study was done to evaluate the performance of MPCR on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples in immunocompromised patients. METHODS: Atotal of 177 BAL specimens collected over a 19 months period from immunocompromised patients with respiratory illness were analyzed with the MPCR and aerobic culture. Patients were divided into four according to the pathogens. Category V (only viral), Category NV (nonviral, i.e., bacteria and atypical), Category M (mixed, i.e., both viral and nonviral pathogen), and Category UK (unknown etiology). RESULTS: MPCR identified the causative pathogen in 59.3% of patients while culture could identify only in 37.8% of patients. Most frequent etiological agent was Klebsiella pneumoniae (32%), followed by cytomegalovirus (21%), and Pneumocystis jirovecii (10%). Numbers of patients in each category were Category V (9.6%), Category NV (43.5%), Category M (19.8%), and Category UK (27.1%). Mortality was significantly higher in patients of Category M having mixed infections. CONCLUSION: MPCR is highly sensitive and rapid tool which can be considered in the routine diagnostic algorithm of respiratory illness in immunocompromised patients.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.124856561,-0.033262614,-0.039540604,-0.080770186,-0.053366229,-0.053212392,-0.01040551,0.065832091,-0.111326143,0.075355695,-0.04387226,0.013054519,0.016637104,0.031534029,-0.013376139,-0.027372265,0.023135472,0.031164909,-0.003271735,0.01337446,0.0561569,-0.03669467,0.009039239,-0.020909188,0.019173461,-0.017745976,-0.016891681,-0.00397043,-0.012955689,-0.015641076
Atypical RNA Elements Modulate Translational Readthrough in Tobacco Necrosis Virus D,"Tobacco necrosis virus, strain D (TNV-D), is a positive-strand RNA virus in the genus Betanecrovirus and family Tombusviridae. The production of its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, p82, is achieved by translational readthrough. This process is stimulated by an RNA structure that is positioned immediately downstream of the recoding site, termed the readthrough stem-loop (RTSL), and a sequence in the 3′ untranslated region of the TNV-D genome, called the distal readthrough element (DRTE). Notably, a base pairing interaction between the RTSL and the DRTE, spanning ∼3,000 nucleotides, is required for enhancement of readthrough. Here, some of the structural features of the RTSL, as well as RNA sequences and structures that flank either the RTSL or DRTE, were investigated for their involvement in translational readthrough and virus infectivity. The results revealed that (i) the RTSL-DRTE interaction cannot be functionally replaced by stabilizing the RTSL structure, (ii) a novel tertiary RNA structure positioned just 3′ to the RTSL is required for optimal translational readthrough and virus infectivity, and (iii) these same activities also rely on an RNA stem-loop located immediately upstream of the DRTE. Functional counterparts for the RTSL-proximal structure may also be present in other tombusvirids. The identification of additional distinct RNA structures that modulate readthrough suggests that regulation of this process by genomic features may be more complex than previously appreciated. Possible roles for these novel RNA elements are discussed. IMPORTANCE The analysis of factors that affect recoding events in viruses is leading to an ever more complex picture of this important process. In this study, two new atypical RNA elements were shown to contribute to efficient translational readthrough of the TNV-D polymerase and to mediate robust viral genome accumulation in infections. One of the structures, located close to the recoding site, could have functional equivalents in related genera, while the other structure, positioned 3′ proximally in the viral genome, is likely limited to betanecroviruses. Irrespective of their prevalence, the identification of these novel RNA elements adds to the current repertoire of viral genome-based modulators of translational readthrough and provides a notable example of the complexity of regulation of this process.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.188623118,-0.056437114,-0.054544644,0.083978173,0.017944356,-0.084230709,-0.016854518,0.05042574,-0.055182097,0.004489853,0.018002471,0.009932418,-0.001124197,-0.051396138,-0.007458032,0.005788479,0.003486955,0.001345161,-0.055514985,-0.020264484,-0.028278769,-0.001850663,-0.094608375,-0.007285039,-0.056997746,-0.102911103,-0.007384367,0.039003289,0.08558426,-0.037819142
Mutagen resistance and mutation restriction of St. Louis encephalitis virus,"The error rate of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of RNA viruses is important in maintaining genetic diversity for viral adaptation and fitness. Numerous studies have shown that mutagen-resistant RNA virus variants display amino acid mutations in the RdRp and other replicase subunits, which in turn exhibit an altered fidelity phenotype affecting viral fitness, adaptability and pathogenicity. St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), like its close relative West Nile virus, is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has the ability to cause neuroinvasive disease in humans. Here, we describe the successful generation of multiple ribavirin-resistant populations containing a shared amino acid mutation in the SLEV RdRp (E416K). These E416K mutants also displayed resistance to the antiviral T-1106, an RNA mutagen similar to ribavirin. Structural modelling of the E416K polymerase mutation indicated its location in the pinky finger domain of the RdRp, distant from the active site. Deep sequencing of the E416K mutant revealed lower genetic diversity than wild-type SLEV after growth in both vertebrate and invertebrate cells. Phenotypic characterization showed that E416K mutants displayed similar or increased replication in mammalian cells, as well as modest attenuation in mosquito cells, consistent with previous work with West Nile virus high-fidelity variants. In addition, attenuation was limited to mosquito cells with a functional RNA interference response, suggesting an impaired capacity to escape RNA interference could contribute to attenuation of high-fidelity variants. Our results provide increased evidence that RNA mutagen resistance arises through modulation of the RdRp and give further insight into the consequences of altered fidelity of flaviviruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.218633435,-0.060582698,-0.086671751,0.119529492,-0.0350672,0.005364348,0.102810615,0.025781953,-0.060221487,0.091409163,0.134850302,0.117813348,-0.103947458,-0.018260748,-0.015093022,4.22E-05,-0.02801272,-0.045006197,-0.093214186,-0.010548139,0.1470389,-0.085833378,0.085619461,0.073474921,-0.052280024,0.091403948,0.08357617,-0.035582293,-0.107164384,-0.051585833
The uncoupling of catalysis and translocation in the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,"The nucleotide addition cycle of nucleic acid polymerases includes 2 major events: the pre-chemistry active site closure leading to the addition of one nucleotide to the product chain; the post-chemistry translocation step moving the polymerase active site one position downstream on its template. In viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs), structural and biochemical evidences suggest that these 2 events are not tightly coupled, unlike the situation observed in A-family polymerases such as the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. Recently, an RdRP translocation intermediate crystal structure of enterovirus 71 shed light on how translocation may be controlled by elements within RdRP catalytic motifs, and a series of poliovirus apo RdRP crystal structures explicitly suggest that a motif B loop may assist the movement of the template strand in late stages of transcription. Implications of RdRP catalysis-translocation uncoupling and the remaining challenges to further elucidate RdRP translocation mechanism are also discussed.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.183219532,-0.033563452,-0.059408398,0.075492399,-0.041397273,-0.05635331,0.065600796,0.030240365,-0.070582269,0.021626495,0.098947865,0.156246245,-0.096479149,-0.097829121,-0.048884554,-0.004471884,0.035505356,-0.028397781,-0.066928505,-0.084150052,0.039971422,-0.065642336,0.023693019,-0.043390944,0.013351548,0.016591183,-0.021535011,0.058912275,0.075482498,0.01420822
Ebola Preparedness: Diagnosis Improvement Using Rapid Approaches for Proficiency Testing,"The unprecedented 2015 Ebolavirus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa was declared a public health emergency, making diagnosis and quality of testing a global issue. The accuracy of laboratory diagnostic capacity for EBOV was assessed in 2014 to 2016 using a proficiency testing (PT) strategy developed by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia Quality Assurance Programs (RCPAQAP) in Biosecurity. Following a literature search, EBOV-specific gene targets were ranked according to the frequency of their use in published methods. The most commonly used gene regions (nucleoprotein [NP], glycoprotein [GP], and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [L]) were selected for the design of in vitro RNA transcripts to be included in the simulated EBOV specimens used for EBOV detection with PCR-based assays. Specimens were tested for stability and found to be stable on long-term storage (1 year) at −80°C and on shorter-term storage in lyophilized form (1 week at ambient temperature and a subsequent week at −80°C). These specimens were used in three EBOV PTs offered from April 2014 to March 2016. In the first and third PTs, all laboratories (3/3 and 9/9, respectively) correctly identified specimens containing EBOV RNA transcripts, while in the second PT, all but one laboratory (5/6) correctly confirmed the presence of EBOV. The EBOV PT panel was useful for ensuring the competency of laboratories in detecting EBOV in the absence of readily available clinical samples.

Clinical Significance of Human Coronavirus in Bronchoalveolar Lavage Samples From Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients and Patients With Hematologic Malignancies,"BACKGROUND. The possible role of human coronavirus (HCoV) in lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients and patients with hematologic malignancies (HM) has not been well studied. METHODS. We conducted a retrospective review of HCT/HM patients with HCoV detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). HCoV strains were identified in BAL samples using strain-specific polymerase chain reaction. Mortality rates were compared among HCT recipients with LRTD caused by HCoV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, or parainfluenza virus (PIV) by multivariable Cox regression analysis. RESULTS. We identified 35 patients (37 episodes) with HCoV LRTD. Among 23 available BAL samples, 48% were strain OC43, 22% were NL63, 17% were 229E, and 13% were HKU1. Overall, 21 patients (60%) required oxygen therapy at diagnosis and 19 (54%) died within 90 days of diagnosis. Respiratory copathogens were detected in 21 episodes (57%), including viruses (n = 12), fungi (n = 10), and bacteria (n = 8). Mortality rates were not different between patients with and without copathogens (P = .65). In multivariable models, mortality associated with HCoV LRTD was similar to that seen with RSV, influenza, and PIV LRTD in HCT recipients (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.34 [95% confidence interval, .66–2.71], P = .41 vs RSV, adjusted for cell source, cytopenia, copathogens, oxygen use, and steroid use). CONCLUSIONS. HCoV LRTD in patients with HCT or HM is associated with high rates of oxygen use and mortality. Mortality associated with HCoV LRTD in HCT recipients appears to be similar to that seen with RSV, influenza virus, and PIV.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.155364282,-0.083276452,-0.084653316,-0.03435888,0.064907344,-0.027809149,-6.48E-06,-0.017248992,0.036810368,-0.067029965,-0.038772072,0.25154032,0.14672224,0.131375105,-0.051301148,0.057083344,-0.056164383,-0.004107842,-0.03462279,0.047704336,0.012662691,-0.099864251,0.034337981,-0.033179817,0.041579936,-0.111678921,0.124051008,-0.008370325,-0.077358452,0.058000546
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome,"Between September 2012 and January 20, 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) received reports from 27 countries of 1879 laboratory-confirmed cases in humans of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by infection with the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and at least 659 related deaths. Cases of MERS-CoV infection continue to occur, including sporadic zoonotic infections in humans across the Arabian Peninsula, occasional importations and associated clusters in other regions, and outbreaks of nonsustained human-to-human transmission in health care settings. Dromedary camels are considered to be the most likely source of animal-to-human transmission. MERS-CoV enters host cells after binding the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) receptor and the carcinoembryonic antigen–related cell-adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) cofactor ligand, and it replicates efficiently in the human respiratory epithelium. Illness begins after an incubation period of 2 to 14 days and frequently results in hypoxemic respiratory failure and the need for multiorgan support. However, asymptomatic and mild cases also occur. Real-time reverse-transcription–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) testing of respiratory secretions is the mainstay for diagnosis, and samples from the lower respiratory tract have the greatest yield among seriously ill patients. There is no antiviral therapy of proven efficacy, and thus treatment remains largely supportive; potential vaccines are at an early developmental stage. There are multiple gaps in knowledge regarding the evolution and transmission of the virus, disease pathogenesis, treatment, and prospects for a vaccine. The ongoing occurrence of MERS in humans and the associated high mortality call for a continued collaborative approach toward gaining a better understanding of the infection both in humans and in animals. MERS-CoV was first identified in September 20121 in a patient from Saudi Arabia who had hypoxemic respiratory failure and multiorgan illness. Subsequent cases have included infections in humans across the Arabian Peninsula, occasional importations and associated clusters in other regions, and outbreaks of nonsustained human-to-human transmission in health care settings (Fig. 1).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.140517419,0.222768501,-0.145159141,0.007622734,0.007931917,0.051235189,0.028727762,0.343006374,0.314941664,0.02744991,0.022832897,-0.034939013,0.006713046,-0.00679006,0.028179601,-0.03797431,-0.021499711,-0.019951314,-0.0156654,0.029982358,0.031535233,0.016407265,-0.052329908,0.061211966,0.009948362,-0.001375606,-0.029248572,0.006012021,0.003052735,-0.028387315
Viral aetiology of wheezing in children under five,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Wheezing is a common problem in children under five with acute respiratory infections (ARIs). Viruses are known to be responsible for a considerable proportion of ARIs in children. This study was undertaken to know the viral aetiology of wheezing among the children less than five years of age, admitted to a tertiary care hospital in eastern India. METHODS: Seventy five children, under the age of five years admitted with wheezing, were included in the study. Throat and nasal swabs were collected, and real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used to screen for influenza 1 and 2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1, 2, 3 and 4, rhinovirus, human meta-pneumovirus, bocavirus (HBoV), Coronavirus, adenovirus, Enterovirus and Parechovirus. RESULTS: The total viral detection rate was 28.57 per cent. Viral RNA markers were detected from children diagnosed to be having pneumonia (3 cases), bronchiolitis (9 cases), episodic wheeze (2 cases) and multitrigger wheeze (6 cases). RSV was the most common virus (35%) followed by PIV1, 2 and 3 (20%), HBoV (10%) and rhinovirus (5%). However, mixed infection was observed in 30 per cent of cases. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The study reported the presence of respiratory viral agents in 28.57 per cent of children with wheezing; RSV and PIV were most common, accounting to 55 per cent of the total cases. Mixed infection was reported in 30 per cent of cases. Seasonal variation in the occurrence of these viruses was also noted. Further studies need to be done with a large sample and longer follow up period to verify these findings.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.243312256,-0.125162747,-0.095808378,0.080884743,0.0363435,-0.113625364,0.042977752,-0.065810298,0.085726224,-0.027072804,0.028297606,-0.071889967,-0.071073472,-0.070897169,0.009398031,-0.002980062,-0.024626799,-0.015169701,0.020243497,-0.011248268,-0.040130349,0.095926638,-0.03022706,0.01541676,-0.024805666,0.047251502,0.08669989,0.117820359,-0.01844864,0.027116096
The Many Faces of the Flavivirus NS5 Protein in Antagonism of Type I Interferon Signaling,"The vector-borne flaviviruses cause severe disease in humans on every inhabited continent on earth. Their transmission by arthropods, particularly mosquitoes, facilitates large emergence events such as witnessed with Zika virus (ZIKV) or West Nile virus in the Americas. Every vector-borne flavivirus examined thus far that causes disease in humans, from dengue virus to ZIKV, antagonizes the host type I interferon (IFN-I) response by preventing JAK-STAT signaling, suggesting that suppression of this pathway is an important determinant of infection. The most direct and potent viral inhibitor of this pathway is the nonstructural protein NS5. However, the mechanisms utilized by NS5 from different flaviviruses are often quite different, sometimes despite close evolutionary relationships between viruses. The varied mechanisms of NS5 as an IFN-I antagonist are also surprising given that the evolution of NS5 is restrained by the requirement to maintain function of two enzymatic activities critical for virus replication, the methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This review discusses the different strategies used by flavivirus NS5 to evade the antiviral effects of IFN-I and how this information can be used to better model disease and develop antiviral countermeasures.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.110032301,-0.043894801,-0.038009214,0.011006974,-0.072686376,0.071310641,0.10385187,0.003080128,0.031199213,0.052336961,0.01122463,-0.005408701,-0.011298736,0.012974683,-0.004042497,6.71E-05,-0.011686892,0.008971004,-0.015225967,0.047715011,0.006486504,0.000930192,-0.04068295,0.011523924,0.032018752,0.048817521,0.052255569,-0.029141235,-0.029713875,0.03059429
"Development of polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostic tests for detection of Malsoor virus & adenovirus isolated from Rousettus species of bats in Maharashtra, India","BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Bats are recognized as important reservoirs for emerging infectious disease and some unknown viral diseases. Two novel viruses, Malsoor virus (family Bunyaviridae, genus, Phlebovirus) and a novel adenovirus (AdV) (family, Adenoviridae genus, Mastadenovirus), were identified from Rousettus bats in the Maharashtra State of India. This study was done to develop and optimize real time reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for Malsoor virus and real time and nested PCR for adenovirus from Rousettus bats. METHODS: For rapid and accurate screening of Malsoor virus and adenovirus a nested polymerase chain reaction and TaqMan-based real-time PCR were developed. Highly conserved region of nucleoprotein gene of phleboviruses and polymerase gene sequence from the Indian bat AdV isolate polyprotein gene were selected respectively for diagnostic assay development of Malsoor virus and AdV. Sensitivity and specificity of assays were calculated and optimized assays were used to screen bat samples. RESULTS: Molecular diagnostic assays were developed for screening of Malsoor virus and AdV and those were found to be specific. Based on the experiments performed with different parameters, nested PCR was found to be more sensitive than real-time PCR; however, for rapid screening, real-time PCR can be used and further nested PCR can be used for final confirmation or in those laboratories where real-time facility/expertise is not existing. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the development and optimization of nested RT-PCR and a TaqMan-based real-time PCR for Malsoor virus and AdV. The diagnostic assays can be used for rapid detection of these novel viruses to understand their prevalence among bat population.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.056882021,0.119974607,0.238901806,0.106017378,0.141326079,0.015298412,0.110610167,0.024108517,-0.054014808,0.007865783,-0.093712441,-0.120145127,0.022437632,0.074212766,-0.013403579,-0.032719288,0.053669892,0.021269613,0.018648896,-0.1326334,0.028837259,0.052496716,0.050534876,-0.089223597,-0.039749168,0.042775139,0.110893032,-0.06058139,0.001215725,0.025957347
"Viruses causing severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in children ≤5 years of age at a tertiary care hospital in Rajasthan, India","BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) is one of the leading causes of death among children worldwide. As different respiratory viruses exhibit similar symptoms, simultaneous detection of these viruses in a single reaction mixture can save time and cost. The present study was done in a tertiary care children's hospital for rapid identification of viruses causing SARI among children less than or equal to five years of age using multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit. METHODS: A total of 155 throat swabs were collected from equal number of children suspected to have SARI and processed for extraction of nucleic acids using automated extraction system. Multiplex real-time RT-PCR was done to identify the viruses in the samples. RESULTS: The overall positivity for viruses in the study was found to be 72.9 per cent with a co-infection rate of 19.5 per cent. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) was the predominant virus detected in 25.7 per cent children followed by influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, human rhinovirus (HRV) and human adenovirus (HAdV) in 19.9, 11.0 and 8.8 per cent children, respectively. The HMPV was at its peak in February 2013, HAdV showed two peaks in March-April, 2012 and November 2012-March 2013 while HRV was detected throughout the year. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex real-time PCR helped in rapid identification of viruses. Seventeen viruses were detected in SARI cases with overall positivity of 72.9 per cent. HMPV was the most predominant virus. However, for better clinico-virological correlation, studies are required with complete work up of all the aetiological agents, clinical profile of patients and treatment outcome.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.245026189,-0.076020321,0.013498433,0.120858717,0.06837805,-0.085919046,0.040776505,-0.065518233,0.07213566,-0.030642354,0.001831244,-0.016967535,-0.033792472,0.006322549,-0.004513649,-0.033391749,-0.021823095,0.036245599,-0.034785834,-0.058370871,0.048806781,0.165558096,-0.034572561,0.014110055,-0.156871828,0.15322774,-0.104170292,0.060349585,0.005101381,0.019551222
Differences in innate immune response gene regulation in the middle ear of children who are otitis prone and in those not otitis prone,"OBJECTIVE: Acute otitis media (AOM) causes an inflammatory response in the middle ear. We assessed differences in innate immune responses involved in bacterial defense at onset of AOM in children who were stringently defined as otitis prone (sOP) and children not otitis prone (NOP). STUDY DESIGN: Innate immune genes analysis from middle ear fluid (MEF) samples of children. METHODS: Genes of toll-like receptors (TLR), nod-like and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptors, downstream effectors important for inflammation and apoptosis, including cytokines and chemokines, were studied from MEF samples by using a real-time polymerase chain reaction array. Protein levels of differentially regulated genes were measured by Luminex. RESULTS: Gene expression in MEF among children who were sOP was significantly different in upregulation of interleukin 8, secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3, and in downregulation of interferon regulatory factor 7 and its related signaling molecules interferon alpha, Toll-like receptor adaptor molecule 2, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5, and mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 compared with children who were NOP. Differences in innate gene regulation were similar when AOM was caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae.

Hospital admissions for lower respiratory tract infections among infants in the Canadian Arctic: a cohort study,"BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether this burden of disease of lower respiratory tract infections is comparable across the Canadian Arctic. The objectives of this surveillance study were to compare the rates of hospital admission for lower respiratory tract infection and the severity of infection across Arctic Canada, and to describe the responsible viruses. METHODS: We performed a prospective multicentre surveillance study of infants less than 1 year of age admitted in 2009 with lower respiratory tract infection to all hospitals (5 regional, 4 tertiary) in the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Nunavik to assess for regional differences. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were processed by means of a polymerase chain reaction respiratory viral panel, testing for 20 respiratory viruses and influenza A (H1N1). The role of coinfection was assessed by means of regression analysis for length of stay (short: < 7 d; long: > 14 d). Outcomes compared included rates of lower respiratory tract infection, respiratory syncytial virus infection, transfer to tertiary hospital and severe lower respiratory tract infection (respiratory failure, intubation and mechanical ventilation, and/or cardiopulmonary resuscitation). RESULTS: There were 348 admissions for lower respiratory tract infection in the population of interest in 2009. Rates of admission per 1000 live births varied significantly, from 39 in the Northwest Territories to 456 in Nunavik (p < 0.001). The rates of tertiary admissions and severe lower respiratory tract infection per 1000 live births in the Northwest Territories were 5.6 and 1.4, respectively, compared to 55.9 and 17.1, respectively, in Nunavut and 52.0 and 20.0, respectively, in Nunavik (p ≤ 0.001). Respiratory syncytial virus was the most common virus identified (124 cases [41.6% of those tested]), and coinfection was detected in 51 cases (41.1%) of infection with this virus. Longer length of stay was associated with coinfection (odds ratio [OR] 2.64) and underlying risk factors (OR 4.39). Length of stay decreased by 32.2% for every 30-day increase in age (OR 0.68). INTERPRETATION: Nunavut and Nunavik have very elevated rates of lower respiratory tract infection, with severe outcomes. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most common virus identified, and coinfection was associated with longer length of stay. Targeted public health interventions are required to reduce the burden of disease for infants residing in these Arctic regions.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.238877474,-0.089880062,-0.132677681,0.030793486,0.02166665,-0.050472206,-0.006447226,-0.002054468,0.06276724,0.024196067,0.01226314,-0.020673529,0.017790302,0.000992834,0.041198825,0.013605713,0.019251323,-0.046521623,0.035321968,0.049283553,0.029964119,-0.127124306,-0.052446522,-0.004292127,0.044645564,-0.008044914,-0.027753379,-0.017084038,-0.019574201,-0.079489048
Successful treatment of suspected organizing pneumonia in a patient with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection: a case report,"A 54-year-old man with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection was transferred to our hospital. We initiated anti-viral drugs and supportive care. The patient’s fever and chills disappeared 3 days after admission and the results of serial follow-up reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing for MERS-CoV was negative soon thereafter. He was discharged from the hospital 14 days after admission with no symptoms; however, he presented with a fever 7 days after discharge and was re-hospitalized. Chest radiographs showed newly developed consolidative opacity. His fever persisted for 3 days after commencing empirical antibiotics. Subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed focal patchy airspace consolidation and ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in a subpleural lesion of the right lower and left upper lobes, which was indicative of organizing pneumonia. We initiated empirical corticosteroid treatment for this illness, and his fever markedly subsided 1 day later. A chest radiograph showed improvement in the lung lesions, and he was discharged from the hospital 10 days after re-admission. The corticosteroid dose was gradually tapered over 2 months at the outpatient clinic, and a follow-up CT scan showed complete resolution of the consolidation and GGOs.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.083067078,0.111987845,-0.099098717,-0.104200403,-0.063552471,0.008814782,-0.041970281,0.185419643,0.089694871,-0.013423222,0.028416678,0.012726914,-0.060497509,-0.00332171,0.002783738,0.020921243,-0.019764842,0.055138995,-0.019134997,0.007280315,-0.033438742,0.021914207,-0.081812866,-0.034969578,0.005233631,0.048376943,0.014940757,-0.012325464,0.005264893,-0.015659209
Intragraft Antiviral-specific Gene Expression as a Distinctive Transcriptional Signature for Studies in Polyomavirus Associated Nephropathy,"BACKGROUND: Polyomavirus nephropathy (PVAN) is a common cause of kidney allograft dysfunction and loss. To identify PVAN-specific gene expression and underlying molecular mechanisms we analyzed kidney biopsies with and without PVAN. METHODS: The study included 168 posttransplant renal allograft biopsies (T cell mediated rejection=26, PVAN=10, normal functioning graft (STA) =73, and interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA) =59) from 168 unique kidney allograft recipients. We performed gene expression assays and bioinformatics analysis to identify a set of PVAN-specific genes. Validity and relevance of a subset of these genes are validated by QPCR and IHC. RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of all the biopsies revealed high similarity between PVAN and TCMR gene expression. Increased statistical stringency identified 158 and 252 unique PVAN and TCMR injury-specific gene transcripts respectively. While TCMR-specific genes were overwhelmingly involved in immune response costimulation and TCR signaling, PVAN-specific genes were mainly related to DNA replication process, RNA polymerase assembly and pathogen recognition receptors. A principal component analysis using these genes further confirmed the most optimal separation between the 3 different clinical phenotypes. Validation of 4 PVAN-specific genes (RPS15, CFD, LTF, and NOSIP) by QPCR and confirmation by immunohistochemistry of 2 PVAN-specific proteins with anti-viral function (LTF and IFITM1) was done. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, even though PVAN and TCMR kidney allografts share great similarities on gene perturbation, PVAN-specific genes were identified with well-known anti-viral properties that provide tools for discerning PVAN and AR as well as attractive targets for rational drug design.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.065880307,-0.017993051,0.02495141,-0.082441821,-0.017585052,0.034576835,0.011094301,-0.012269325,0.032893693,-0.014570993,-0.059206396,-0.015241032,-0.003091234,0.009305865,-0.012913355,-0.009762271,-0.005808006,-0.026494617,-0.032839631,-0.037277737,0.022505417,-3.43E-05,0.000187724,0.019715003,-0.044537635,-0.029879873,0.01489697,0.018150213,0.0245224,-0.016104759
In Vivo Conditions Enable IFNAR-Independent Type I Interferon Production by Peritoneal CD11b(+) Cells upon Thogoto Virus Infection,"Type I interferons (IFNs) crucially contribute to host survival upon viral infections. Robust expression of type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) and induction of an antiviral state critically depend on amplification of the IFN signal via the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR). A small amount of type I IFN produced early upon virus infection binds the IFNAR and activates a self-enhancing positive feedback loop, resulting in induction of large, protective amounts of IFN-α. Unexpectedly, we found robust, systemic IFN-α expression upon infection of IFNAR knockout mice with the orthomyxovirus Thogoto virus (THOV). The IFNAR-independent IFN-α production required in vivo conditions and was not achieved during in vitro infection. Using replication-incompetent THOV-derived virus-like particles, we demonstrate that IFNAR-independent type I IFN induction depends on viral polymerase activity but is largely independent of viral replication. To discover the cell type responsible for this effect, we used type I IFN reporter mice and identified CD11b(+) F4/80(+) myeloid cells within the peritoneal cavity of infected animals as the main source of IFNAR-independent type I IFN, corresponding to the particular tropism of THOV for this cell type. IMPORTANCE Type I IFNs are crucial for the survival of a host upon most viral infections, and, moreover, they shape subsequent adaptive immune responses. Production of protective amounts of type I IFN critically depends on the positive feedback amplification via the IFNAR. Unexpectedly, we observed robust IFNAR-independent type I IFN expression upon THOV infection and unraveled molecular mechanisms and determined the tissue and cell type involved. Our data indicate that the host can effectively use alternative pathways to induce type I IFN responses if the classical feedback amplification is not available. Understanding how type I IFN can be produced in large amounts independently of IFNAR-dependent enhancement will identify mechanisms which might contribute to novel therapeutic strategies to fight viral pathogens.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.070668813,-0.043912272,-0.000991988,-0.072335585,-0.092301919,0.061641246,0.05761642,-0.017564942,0.049367136,-0.007455733,-0.015121946,-0.037295327,-0.004154871,0.055502823,-0.00049675,0.014432807,-0.025644538,-0.03089706,-0.012360937,0.025242595,0.046958601,-0.002278235,-0.005581192,0.033508577,0.014350636,-0.032304452,0.014012407,0.013135745,-0.04286964,-0.02883356
Development of a multiplex RT-PCR for simultaneous diagnosis of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) from clinical specimens,"Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) are ubiquitous respiratory viral pathogens. They belong to the family Paramyxoviridae (subfamily Pneumovirinae) and is responsible for acute respiratory tract infections in children, elderly and immunocompromised patients. We designed and tested a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) as a cost-effective alternative to real-time PCR and cell culture based detection for HMPV and HRSV. The newly developed PCR was used to screen nasal/throat swab samples from 356 patients with suspected acute respiratory infection attending the Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. The method was compared with a commercially available kit employing real time PCR, for its sensitivity and specificity. 53 (14.9 %) samples were positive for at least one tested pathogen by mRT-PCR. All except one among the positive samples showed similar pathogen profile when tested using real time PCR. 8 (15.1 %) among these 53 were positive for HRSVA, 33 (62.3 %) positive for HRSVB and 12 (22.6 %) were positive for HMPV. 17 (32.7 %) samples showed co-infections in them. Sensitivity and specificity of the mRT-PCR was comparable to that of the commercial kit. Our findings indicate that this newly developed mRT-PCR can be used as a cost-effective alternative for laboratory diagnosis of HMPV/HRSV infection and will significantly reduce diagnostic costs for these viruses in clinical settings.

Viral Macro Domains Reverse Protein ADP-Ribosylation,"ADP-ribosylation is a posttranslational protein modification in which ADP-ribose is transferred from NAD(+) to specific acceptors to regulate a wide variety of cellular processes. The macro domain is an ancient and highly evolutionarily conserved protein domain widely distributed throughout all kingdoms of life, including viruses. The human TARG1/C6orf130, MacroD1, and MacroD2 proteins can reverse ADP-ribosylation by acting on ADP-ribosylated substrates through the hydrolytic activity of their macro domains. Here, we report that the macro domain from hepatitis E virus (HEV) serves as an ADP-ribose-protein hydrolase for mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) and poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) chain removal (de-MARylation and de-PARylation, respectively) from mono- and poly(ADP)-ribosylated proteins, respectively. The presence of the HEV helicase in cis dramatically increases the binding of the macro domain to poly(ADP-ribose) and stimulates the de-PARylation activity. Abrogation of the latter dramatically decreases replication of an HEV subgenomic replicon. The de-MARylation activity is present in all three pathogenic positive-sense, single-stranded RNA [(+)ssRNA] virus families which carry a macro domain: Coronaviridae (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E), Togaviridae (Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus), and Hepeviridae (HEV), indicating that it might be a significant tropism and/or pathogenic determinant. IMPORTANCE Protein ADP-ribosylation is a covalent posttranslational modification regulating cellular protein activities in a dynamic fashion to modulate and coordinate a variety of cellular processes. Three viral families, Coronaviridae, Togaviridae, and Hepeviridae, possess macro domains embedded in their polyproteins. Here, we show that viral macro domains reverse cellular ADP-ribosylation, potentially cutting the signal of a viral infection in the cell. Various poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases which are notorious guardians of cellular integrity are demodified by macro domains from members of these virus families. In the case of hepatitis E virus, the adjacent viral helicase domain dramatically increases the binding of the macro domain to PAR and simulates the demodification activity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.115477851,-0.041068416,-0.053313345,-0.017322934,-0.055289645,0.018264815,0.041304471,-0.035653113,0.048791967,-0.008492486,-0.046914988,0.026467835,0.020288325,-0.01585921,-0.031782609,-0.042617057,0.098663002,-0.037364735,-0.011919006,0.045067994,-0.036980444,0.029612795,-0.031432486,-0.068895283,0.088576953,0.082866654,-0.053718426,0.019743988,0.023325353,-0.074349981
Rapid Detection of Cyprinid Herpesvirus 3 in Latently Infected Koi (Cyprinus carpio) by Recombinase Polymerase Amplification,"Since the emergence of cyprinid herpes virus 3 (CyHV-3), outbreaks have been devastating to koi and common carp leading to high economic losses. Current diagnostics for detecting CyHV-3 are limited in sensitivity and are further complicated by latency. Here we describe the detection of CyHV-3 by recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). The RPA assay can detect as low as 10 copies of CyHV-3 genome by an isothermal reaction and yields results in approximately 20 minutes. Using the RPA assay, CyHV-3 genome can be detected in total DNA of white blood cells isolated from koi latently infected with CyHV-3, while less than 10% of the latently infected koi can be detected by a real-time PCR assay in total DNA of white blood cells. In addition, RPA products can be detected in a lateral flow device that is cheap, fast, and can be used outside of the diagnostic lab. The RPA assay and lateral flow device provide for the rapid, sensitive, and specific amplification of CyHV-3 that with future modifications for field use and validation could lead to enhanced surveillance and early diagnosis of CyHV-3 in the laboratory and field.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.010558821,0.082187563,0.294394622,0.058442,-0.100250715,-0.057308947,0.058163088,0.0225737,-0.000375385,-0.075445535,-0.093152346,0.017903566,-0.015504838,-0.087668145,-0.081875413,0.129479816,-0.116002034,-0.105435809,0.211369561,0.317905129,0.097620683,-0.016939871,0.04266525,-0.081303424,-0.137261239,0.069875682,0.028627805,0.079586546,0.018141125,-0.010619304
Analysis of Ebola virus polymerase domains to find strain-specific differences and to gain insight on their pathogenicity,"Ebola virus, a member of the family Filoviridae has caused immense morbidity and mortality in recent times, especially in West Africa. The infection characterized by chills, fever, diarrhea, and myalgia can progress to hemorrhage and death. Hence, it is a high priority area to better understand its biology in order to expedite vaccine development pipelines. In this regard, this study analyzes the domains in RNA polymerase of fifteen publicly-available Ebola isolates belonging to three strains (Zaire, Sudan and Reston). The protein FASTA sequences of the isolates belonging Zaire, Sudan and Reston strains were extracted from UniProt database and submitted to the interactive web tool SMART for the polymerase domain profiles.

Anti-hepatitis C virus potency of a new autophagy inhibitor using human liver slices model,"AIM: To evaluate the antiviral potency of a new anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antiviral agent targeting the cellular autophagy machinery. METHODS: Non-infected liver slices, obtained from human liver resection and cut in 350 μm-thick slices (2.7 × 10(6) cells per slice) were infected with cell culture-grown HCV Con1b/C3 supernatant (multiplicity of infection = 0.1) cultivated for up to ten days. HCV infected slices were treated at day 4 post-infection with GNS-396 for 6 d at different concentrations. HCV replication was evaluated by strand-specific real-time quantitative reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction. The infectivity titers of supernatants were evaluated by foci formation upon inoculation into naive Huh-7.5.1 cells. The cytotoxic effect of the drugs was evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase leakage assays. RESULTS: The antiviral efficacy of a new antiviral drug, GNS-396, an autophagy inhibitor, on HCV infection of adult human liver slices was evidenced in a dose-dependent manner. At day 6 post-treatment, GNS-396 EC50 was 158 nmol/L without cytotoxic effect (compared to hydroxychloroquine EC50 = 1.17 μmol/L). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that our ex vivo model is efficient for evaluation the potency of autophagy inhibitors, in particular a new quinoline derivative GNS-396 as antiviral could inhibit HCV infection in a dose-dependent manner without cytotoxic effect.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.077880495,-0.02844929,-0.016315326,-0.042174844,-0.159269701,0.077590889,0.079249567,-0.014495801,0.078243166,0.013215303,-0.000733872,0.056893136,0.018886176,0.117227683,-0.001660951,-0.036826247,0.000732449,0.291465508,0.317011975,-0.09539511,-0.050275852,0.006325124,0.086858741,0.068240253,-0.039966171,-0.041163204,-0.038374438,0.042323416,-0.03776076,-0.033821348
Homology-Based Identification of a Mutation in the Coronavirus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase That Confers Resistance to Multiple Mutagens,"Positive-sense RNA viruses encode RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) essential for genomic replication. With the exception of the large nidoviruses, such as coronaviruses (CoVs), RNA viruses lack proofreading and thus are dependent on RdRps to control nucleotide selectivity and fidelity. CoVs encode a proofreading exonuclease in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN), which confers a greater-than-10-fold increase in fidelity compared to other RNA viruses. It is unknown to what extent the CoV polymerase (nsp12-RdRp) participates in replication fidelity. We sought to determine whether homology modeling could identify putative determinants of nucleotide selectivity and fidelity in CoV RdRps. We modeled the CoV murine hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp12-RdRp structure and superimposed it on solved picornaviral RdRp structures. Fidelity-altering mutations previously identified in coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3) were mapped onto the nsp12-RdRp model structure and then engineered into the MHV genome with [nsp14-ExoN(+)] or without [nsp14-ExoN(−)] ExoN activity. Using this method, we identified two mutations conferring resistance to the mutagen 5-fluorouracil (5-FU): nsp12-M611F and nsp12-V553I. For nsp12-V553I, we also demonstrate resistance to the mutagen 5-azacytidine (5-AZC) and decreased accumulation of mutations. Resistance to 5-FU, and a decreased number of genomic mutations, was effectively masked by nsp14-ExoN proofreading activity. These results indicate that nsp12-RdRp likely functions in fidelity regulation and that, despite low sequence conservation, some determinants of RdRp nucleotide selectivity are conserved across RNA viruses. The results also indicate that, with regard to nucleotide selectivity, nsp14-ExoN is epistatic to nsp12-RdRp, consistent with its proposed role in a multiprotein replicase-proofreading complex. IMPORTANCE RNA viruses have evolutionarily fine-tuned replication fidelity to balance requirements for genetic stability and diversity. Responsibility for replication fidelity in RNA viruses has been attributed to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, with mutations in RdRps for multiple RNA viruses shown to alter fidelity and attenuate virus replication and virulence. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are the only known RNA viruses to encode a proofreading exonuclease (nsp14-ExoN), as well as other replicase proteins involved in regulation of fidelity. This report shows that the CoV RdRp (nsp12) likely functions in replication fidelity; that residue determinants of CoV RdRp nucleotide selectivity map to similar structural regions of other, unrelated RNA viral polymerases; and that for CoVs, the proofreading activity of the nsp14-ExoN is epistatic to the function of the RdRp in fidelity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.229478055,0.036196423,-0.159066152,0.187998182,0.011418074,-0.051604089,0.122931431,0.063374603,-0.075687374,0.062767449,0.170778339,0.139588368,-0.146473628,-0.049761661,-0.035167875,0.018863626,0.017530707,-0.08469845,-0.091214212,-0.039413989,0.122055335,-0.107218159,0.169646545,0.078682638,0.011043293,0.126045954,-0.001654197,-0.056089991,-0.061777569,-0.113035761
"Regulatory effect of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant, epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide 78 and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate on pulmonary neutrophil aggregation mediated by nuclear factor-κB in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome mice","In the present study, the regulatory effect of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC) and epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide 78 (ENA-78) on pulmonary neutrophil (PMN) accumulation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) mice, and the therapeutic effect of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), was investigated. BALB/c mice were divided into control, LPS and PDTC + LPS groups using a random number table. The phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) was detected using a western blot, and the mRNA expression levels of CINC were evaluated using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expression of NF-κB, CINC and ENA-78 was detected using immunohistochemistry. The production of interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-10 in serum and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The total number of leukocytes and proportion of PMNs in BALF was also determined. Following injection with LPS (20 mg/kg), the expression levels of p-NF-κB, CINC and ENA-78 were increased in lung tissue, and the expression levels of IL-8, IL-10 and the number of PMNs increased in serum and BALF. However, in comparison with the LPS group, the degree of lung injury was reduced in ARDS mice that were treated with PDTC. In addition, the expression level of p-NF-κB and the production of chemokines in lung tissue decreased in ARDS mice that were treated with PDTC, and the number of PMNs in BALF also decreased. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that the LPS-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB may result in the synthesis and release of CINC and ENA-78, which induce the accumulation of PMNs in the lung. Therefore, PDTC may be used to reduce the production of chemokines and cytokines, thereby decreasing the activation of PMNs in lung tissue and reducing the damage of lung tissue in ARDS.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.03266234,-0.023884165,0.007486034,-0.169348,-0.091562383,0.039276129,0.017830089,-0.051739744,0.046068234,-0.065576408,-0.055944833,-0.037920533,-0.041500499,0.132974986,-0.032990835,0.021665464,-0.006508421,-0.083009018,-0.02731312,-0.069409557,0.058352868,-0.078060155,0.051816741,-0.008258116,-0.046767863,-0.040611151,0.000332101,0.042356859,0.053892418,-0.083651707
Structural basis of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalysis and translocation,"Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) play essential roles in viral genome replication and transcription.

Using the RdRP from another human enterovirus, enterovirus 71, here we report seven RdRP elongation complex structures derived from a crystal lattice that allows three NAC events. These structures suggested a key order of events in initial NTP binding and NTP-induced active site closure and revealed a bona fide translocation intermediate featuring asymmetric movement of the template–product duplex.

Antiviral Targets of Human Noroviruses,"Human noroviruses are major causative agents of sporadic and epidemic gastroenteritis both in children and adults. Currently there are no licensed therapeutic intervention measures either in terms of vaccines or drugs available for these highly contagious human pathogens. Genetic and antigenic diversity of these viruses, rapid emergence of new strains, and their ability to infect a broad population by using polymorphic histo-blood group antigens for cell attachment, pose significant challenges for the development of effective antiviral agents. Despite these impediments, there is progress in the design and development of therapeutic agents. These include capsid-based candidate vaccines, and potential antivirals either in the form of glycomimetics or designer antibodies that block HBGA binding, as well as those that target essential non-structural proteins such as the viral protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In addition to these classical approaches, recent studies suggest the possibility of interferons and targeting host cell factors as viable approaches to counter norovirus infection.

The Effects of Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine on Nasopharyngeal Bacteria in Healthy 2 to 4 Year Olds. A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Rationale: Viral infections of the upper respiratory tract may influence the commensal nasopharyngeal bacteria. Changes in the bacterial niche could affect transmission dynamics. Attenuated vaccine viruses can be used to investigate this empirically in humans. Objectives: To study the effects of mild viral upper respiratory infections on nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization using live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) as a surrogate. Methods: We used trivalent LAIV to evaluate the effects of viral infection on bacterial carriage and density of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 151 healthy children were randomized 1:1 to receive the vaccine starting either at recruitment (n = 74) or 28 days later (n = 77) in a stepped wedge fashion, allowing comparisons between recipients and nonrecipients as well as whole-group comparisons pre- and postvaccination. Bacterial carriage and density were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 151 children were recruited, 77 in the LAIV group and 74 in the control group. LAIV recipients (n = 63 analyzed) showed an apparent transient increase in H. influenzae carriage but no further significant differences in carriage prevalence of the four bacterial species compared with controls (n = 72 analyzed). S. pneumoniae density was substantially higher in vaccine recipients (16,687 vs. 1935 gene copies per milliliter) 28 days after the first dose (P < 0.001). Whole-group multivariable analysis (prevaccine, after one dose, and after two doses) also showed increases in density of other species and H. influenzae carriage prevalence. Conclusions: In the absence of any safety signals despite widespread use of the vaccine, these findings suggest that bacterial density, and thus transmission rates among children and to people in other age groups, may rise following attenuated influenza infections without associated clinical disease. LAIV could therefore be used as an experimental tool to elucidate the dynamics of transmission of nasopharyngeal bacteria.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.096120549,-0.081300384,-0.043962914,-0.058323171,0.003663804,0.017428679,0.045078868,-0.009153864,-0.027743312,0.025874419,-0.015099816,-0.022571185,-0.0426218,-0.043908575,-0.010905471,0.001795751,-0.046331074,-0.046469174,-0.014242952,-0.008990156,-0.03570341,0.036883215,0.064929771,0.05841159,0.008524642,0.016387971,-0.005988338,-0.036640455,0.054750586,-0.000332687

Intriguingly, NS5 exchange between the nucleus and nucleolus is dynamically modulated by extracellular pH, responding rapidly and reversibly to pH change, in contrast to GFP alone or other nucleolar and non-nucleolar targeted protein controls. The minimal pH-sensitive nucleolar targeting region (pHNTR), sufficient to target GFP to the nucleolus in a pH-sensitive fashion, was mapped to NS5 residues 1 to 244, with mutation of key hydrophobic residues, Leu-165, Leu-167, and Val-168, abolishing pHNTR function in NS5-transfected cells, and severely attenuating DENV growth in infected cells. This is the first report of a viral protein whose nucleolar targeting ability is rapidly modulated by extracellular stimuli, suggesting that DENV has the ability to detect and respond dynamically to the extracellular environment. IMPORTANCE Infections by dengue virus (DENV) threaten 40% of the world's population yet there is no approved vaccine or antiviral therapeutic to treat infections. Understanding the molecular details that govern effective viral replication is key for the development of novel antiviral strategies. Here, we describe for the first time dynamic trafficking of DENV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) to the subnuclear compartment, the nucleolus. We demonstrate that NS5's targeting to the nucleolus occurs in response to acidic pH, identify the key amino acid residues within NS5 that are responsible, and demonstrate that their mutation severely impairs production of infectious DENV. Overall, this study identifies a unique subcellular trafficking event and suggests that DENV is able to detect and respond dynamically to environmental changes.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.10575665,-0.038043237,0.003326062,-0.012190125,-0.08378378,0.028641341,0.046327723,-0.016575635,0.028458832,0.002053764,-0.019753036,0.01474451,-0.022071944,0.004988886,-0.022152959,0.001967641,0.019810387,-0.021266329,-0.010337336,0.029069361,-0.007573106,0.010498868,-0.015691428,-0.02545,0.059196058,0.092834982,0.022640184,-0.026040208,-0.003858693,0.028909533
Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus Nucleocapsid Protein Interacts with Nsp9 and Cellular DHX9 To Regulate Viral RNA Synthesis,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) nucleocapsid (N) protein is the main component of the viral capsid to encapsulate viral RNA, and it is also a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of host cell processes. Nonstructural protein 9 (Nsp9) is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that plays a critical role in viral RNA transcription and replication. In this study, we demonstrate that PRRSV N protein is bound to Nsp9 by protein-protein interaction and that the contacting surface on Nsp9 is located in the two predicted α-helixes formed by 48 residues at the C-terminal end of the protein. Mutagenesis analyses identified E646, E608, and E611 on Nsp9 and Q85 on the N protein as the pivotal residues participating in the N-Nsp9 interaction. By overexpressing the N protein binding fragment of Nsp9 in infected Marc-145 cells, the synthesis of viral RNAs, as well as the production of infectious progeny viruses, was dramatically inhibited, suggesting that Nsp9-N protein association is involved in the process of viral RNA production. In addition, we show that PRRSV N interacts with cellular RNA helicase DHX9 and redistributes the protein into the cytoplasm. Knockdown of DHX9 increased the ratio of short subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs); in contrast, DHX9 overexpression benefited the synthesis of longer sgmRNAs and the viral genomic RNA (gRNA). These results imply that DHX9 is recruited by the N protein in PRRSV infection to regulate viral RNA synthesis. We postulate that N and DHX9 may act as antiattenuation factors for the continuous elongation of nascent transcript during negative-strand RNA synthesis. IMPORTANCE It is unclear whether the N protein of PRRSV is involved in regulation of the viral RNA production process. In this report, we demonstrate that the N protein of the arterivirus PRRSV participates in viral RNA replication and transcription through interacting with Nsp9 and its RdRp and recruiting cellular RNA helicase to promote the production of longer viral sgmRNAs and gRNA. Our data here provide some new insights into the discontinuous to continuous extension of PRRSV RNA synthesis and also offer a new potential anti-PRRSV strategy targeting the N-Nsp9 and/or N-DHX9 interaction.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.240536792,-0.077640079,-0.103568382,0.083317847,-0.081090803,-0.084580503,-0.019188373,-0.010832484,0.014341833,0.020335096,-0.006115886,-0.044379361,-0.011290919,0.08376624,0.008879004,-0.089599655,0.088588056,-0.085999568,-0.006328131,0.099368712,-0.108745486,0.061886765,-0.011618399,-0.126013996,0.047198538,0.055704852,0.030802814,-0.054668011,-0.067364099,0.138360587
Trends and advances in food analysis by real-time polymerase chain reaction,"Analyses to ensure food safety and quality are more relevant now because of rapid changes in the quantity, diversity and mobility of food. Food-contamination must be determined to maintain health and up-hold laws, as well as for ethical and cultural concerns. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a rapid and inexpensive quantitative method to detect the presence of targeted DNA-segments in samples, helps in determining both accidental and intentional adulterations of foods by biological contaminants. This review presents recent developments in theory, techniques, and applications of RT-PCR in food analyses, RT-PCR addresses the limitations of traditional food analyses in terms of sensitivity, range of analytes, multiplexing ability, cost, time, and point-of-care applications. A range of targets, including species of plants or animals which are used as food ingredients, food-borne bacteria or viruses, genetically modified organisms, and allergens, even in highly processed foods can be identified by RT-PCR, even at very low concentrations. Microfluidic RT-PCR eliminates the separate sample-processing step to create opportunities for point-of-care analyses. We also cover the challenges related to using RT-PCR for food analyses, such as the need to further improve sample handling.

"Diversity and Evolutionary Histories of Human Coronaviruses NL63 and 229E Associated with Acute Upper Respiratory Tract Symptoms in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","The human alphacoronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E are commonly associated with upper respiratory tract infections (URTI). Information on their molecular epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics in the tropical region of southeast Asia however is limited. Here, we analyzed the phylogenetic, temporal distribution, population history, and clinical manifestations among patients infected with HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 2,060 consenting adults presented with acute URTI symptoms in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, between 2012 and 2013. The presence of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E was detected using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The spike glycoprotein, nucleocapsid, and 1a genes were sequenced for phylogenetic reconstruction and Bayesian coalescent inference. A total of 68/2,060 (3.3%) subjects were positive for human alphacoronavirus; HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E were detected in 45 (2.2%) and 23 (1.1%) patients, respectively. A peak in the number of HCoV-NL63 infections was recorded between June and October 2012. Phylogenetic inference revealed that 62.8% of HCoV-NL63 infections belonged to genotype B, 37.2% was genotype C, while all HCoV-229E sequences were clustered within group 4. Molecular dating analysis indicated that the origin of HCoV-NL63 was dated to 1921, before it diverged into genotype A (1975), genotype B (1996), and genotype C (2003). The root of the HCoV-229E tree was dated to 1955, before it diverged into groups 1–4 between the 1970s and 1990s. The study described the seasonality, molecular diversity, and evolutionary dynamics of human alphacoronavirus infections in a tropical region.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.073433516,-0.044823904,-0.061582407,-0.066246283,0.206954819,-0.060514222,0.089930612,-0.043196406,0.125059801,-0.092889695,-0.067274696,0.476071857,0.369132801,0.215859451,-0.002087962,0.078026486,-0.060719554,-0.021717168,-0.077184657,0.021064958,-0.011318849,-0.044034537,0.041499036,-0.071742445,-0.00462714,-0.044606992,0.072777342,0.016972401,0.020754927,0.072416099
Human Metapneumovirus Infections Following Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: Factors Associated With Disease Progression,"Background. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a newly identified pulmonary pathogen that can cause fatal lower respiratory tract disease (LRD) in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients. Little is known about progression rates from upper respiratory tract infection (URI) to LRD and risk factors associated with progression. Methods. A total of 118 HCT recipients receiving transplantation between 2004 and 2014 who had HMPV detected in nasopharyngeal, bronchoalveolar lavage, or lung biopsy samples by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were retrospectively analyzed. Results. More than 90% of the cases were identified between December and May. Among the 118 HCT patients, 88 and 30 had URI alone and LRD, respectively. Among 30 patients with LRD, 17 patients progressed from URI to LRD after a median of 7 days (range, 2–63 days). The probability of progression to LRD within 40 days after URI was 16%. In Cox regression analysis, steroid use ≥1 mg/kg prior to URI diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR], 5.10; P = .004), low lymphocyte count (HR, 3.43; P = .011), and early onset of HMPV infection after HCT (before day 30 after HCT; HR, 3.54; P = .013) were associated with higher progression to LRD. The median viral load in nasal wash samples was 1.1 × 10(6) copies/mL (range, 3.3 × 10(2)–1.7 × 10(9)) with no correlation between the viral load and progression. Conclusions. Progression from URI to LRD occurred in up to 60% of HCT recipients with risk factors such as systemic corticosteroid use or low lymphocyte counts. Further studies are needed to define the role of viral load in the pathogenesis of progressive disease.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.08520074,-0.036103107,-0.028095544,-0.079621238,-0.033891384,-0.051808779,0.028051542,-0.00703076,-0.002655763,-0.016589312,-0.000595007,0.002729766,-0.044248315,0.028135187,-0.0281395,0.005043957,-0.0260767,0.048661885,-0.024673811,0.017674546,0.03883922,-0.025909388,-0.044813131,-0.036602533,-0.037611151,-0.039622013,-0.033874851,-0.06363261,-0.050621196,-0.016216631
Current Tools for Norovirus Drug Discovery,"INTRODUCTION: Rapid transmission of norovirus often occurs due to its low infectious dosage, high genetic diversity and its short incubation time. The viruses cause acute gastroenteritis and may lead to death. Presently, no effective vaccine or selective drugs accepted by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are available for the treatment of norovirus. Advances in the development of norovirus replicon cell lines, GII.4-Sydney HuNoV strain human B cells, and murine and gnotobiotic pig norovirus models have facilitated the discovery of effective small molecule inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. AREAS COVERED: This review gives a brief discussion of the biology and replication of norovirus before highlighting the discovery of anti-norovirus molecules. The article coverage includes: an overview of the current state of norovirus drug discovery, the targeting of the norovirus life cycle, the inhibition of structural and nonstructural proteins of norovirus such as proteases and polymerase, and the blockage of virus entry into host cells. Finally, anti-norovirus drugs in the clinical development stage are described. EXPERT OPINION: The current approach for the counteraction of norovirus focuses on the inhibition of viral RNA polymerase, norovirus 3C-like protease and the structural proteins VP1 as well as the blockade of norovirus entry. Broad-spectrum anti-norovirus molecules, based on the inhibition of 3C-like protease, have been developed. Other host factors and ways to overcome the development of resistance through mutation are also being examined. A dual approach in targeting viral and host factors may lead to an effective counteraction of norovirus infection. Current successes in developing norovirus replicon harboring cells and norovirus infected human cells, as well as murine norovirus models and other animal models such as piglets have facilitated the discovery of effective drugs and helped our understanding of its mechanism of action.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.090464112,-0.028499564,-0.002011114,-0.014187857,-0.080627777,0.079632502,0.100549771,-0.00691196,0.035924966,0.028865708,0.006947147,0.048399443,0.007984052,-0.024786323,0.021683506,-0.019909392,-0.042339094,0.078815833,0.045192094,0.054243032,0.03323626,0.049750994,-0.081096226,0.043109103,0.024453948,-0.016919801,0.038727597,-0.045159879,0.066240306,-0.001279619
Human coronavirus and severe acute respiratory infection in Southern Brazil,"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are an important cause of respiratory tract infection and are responsible for causing the common cold in the general population. Thus, adequate surveillance of HCoV is essential. This study aimed to analyze the impact of HCoV infections and their relation to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in a hospitalized population in Southern Brazil. A cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital, and assessed inpatients under investigation for SARI by the hospital epidemiology department, and all patients who had nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from January 2012 to December 2013 to detect respiratory viruses (RVs). Viral infection was detected by multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), with primers specific to the subtypes HCoV-229E/NL63 and OC43/HKU1. The overall positivity rate was 58.8% (444/755), and HCoVs were detected in 7.6% (n = 34) of positive samples. Children below two years of age were most frequently affected (62%). Comorbidities were more likely to be associated with HCoVs than with other RVs. Immunosuppression was an independent risk factor for HCoV infection (OR = 3.5, 95% CI 1.6–7.6). Dyspnea was less frequently associated with HCoV infection (p < 0.001), and HCoV accounted for 6% of the SARI cases. Three patients infected with HCoV (9%) died from respiratory infection. HCoVs are important respiratory pathogens, especially in hospitalized children under 2 years of age and in immunosuppressed patients. They may account for a small proportion of SARI diagnoses, increased need for mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, and death.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.241209186,-0.072226511,-0.119281803,-0.019439445,0.130051762,-0.104920392,0.047807006,-0.025686653,0.09652654,-0.083596581,-0.029830476,0.354740275,0.253307444,0.186651194,-0.017406463,0.096581565,-0.053172799,-0.057841389,-0.050372217,0.0580476,-0.052192501,0.018523534,0.011965448,-0.037389423,0.021506205,-0.012179236,0.01587871,-0.005686445,-0.010492075,0.023817995
Acute Otitis Media and Other Complications of Viral Respiratory Infection,"BACKGROUND: Viral upper and lower respiratory tract infections (URI, LRI) are common in infants. We determined the prevalence of viral URI and its complications, including acute otitis media (AOM) and LRI, and assessed the effect of bacterial-viral interactions, and genetic and environmental risks on AOM development. METHODS: Healthy infants were enrolled from near birth and followed to the first episode of AOM up to 12 months of age. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected at monthly intervals (months 1–6, 9) and during viral URI episodes for bacterial culture and viral polymerase chain reaction studies. Subjects were followed closely for AOM development. RESULTS: A total of 367 infants were followed for 286 child-years; 887 URI (305 infants) and 180 AOM episodes (143 infants) were documented. Prevalence of URI, LRI, and AOM in the first year was 3.2, 0.25, and 0.67 per child-year, respectively. Cumulative AOM incidence by ages 3, 6, and 12 months was 6%, 23%, and 46%. Infants with and without AOM had 4.7 and 2.3 URI episodes per child-year, respectively (P < .002). Pathogenic bacterial colonization rates by month were significantly higher in infants with AOM (P < .005). Breastfeeding reduced both URI and AOM risks (P < .05). Significant bacterial-viral interactions occurred with Moraxella catarrhalis and a variety of respiratory viruses and altered URI and AOM risks. CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of infants experienced AOM by age 1. Important AOM risk factors included frequent viral URI, pathogenic bacterial colonization, and lack of breastfeeding. Bacterial-viral interactions may play a significant role in AOM pathogenesis and deserve further investigation.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.053072201,-0.07391284,-0.037428517,-0.058388451,-0.019706087,-0.037624108,0.077761667,-0.026678558,0.025484581,0.018821313,0.004418219,-0.024602102,-0.019637704,-0.067436219,0.035762044,0.030380498,-0.000134904,-0.066233214,0.02320652,-0.035908947,-0.054893413,-0.013126428,-0.030399609,0.02768944,0.050786923,-0.016779639,0.027920079,-0.002007404,0.049547144,-0.035399394
Impact of viral infection on acute exacerbation of asthma in out-patient clinics: a prospective study,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of viral infection triggering asthma exacerbation and its impact on the symptoms and duration of exacerbation are unclear. METHODS: Asthma and healthy control subjects were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University between February 2012 and February 2013. Nasal swabs were collected, and respiratory viruses were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All patients completed questionnaires and a lung function test. Some were followed up for 4 weeks, and symptom changes were evaluated via asthma diaries. RESULTS: In total, 70 patients with acute asthma exacerbations were recruited. Among them, 34 patients (48.6%) completed the 4-week follow-up study. Another 65 patients with stable asthma and 134 healthy volunteers were also included in this study. The rate of positive viral detection via PCR in acute asthma exacerbation patients was 34.2% (24/70), which is significantly higher than that of stable asthma (12/65; 18.5%; P=0.038) and normal control patients (18/134; 13.4%; P<0.001). Among the viral-positive subjects, the number of viral copies was significantly higher in acute asthma exacerbation patients [(5.00±4.63) ×10(7) copies/L] (mean ± SD) than those in stable asthma patients [(1.24±1.44) ×10(6) copies/L; P<0.001] or in healthy controls [(1.44±0.44) ×10(6) copies/L; P<0.001], whose viral loads were not significantly different from one another (P=0.774). During the 4-week follow-up period, the cough scores on days 1 and 3 were significantly higher in the viral-positive group than in the viral-negative group (day 1: P=0.016; day 3: P=0.004). However, there were no significant differences between these two groups for other tested symptoms, such as dyspnea and total recovery time (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses may be involved in acute asthma exacerbations, inducing more prominent and persistent cough symptoms.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.173035033,-0.044396048,-0.076461614,-0.112894462,-0.050492491,-0.092178023,-0.01379337,0.042491876,-0.126853635,0.029051358,-0.021317741,-0.025008065,-0.058651575,0.084281154,-0.006863707,0.004725942,0.045884465,-0.082748138,0.069376607,-0.019510913,-0.016697543,-0.202395707,-0.096285089,0.08824965,-0.078139025,0.092576878,-0.049651142,-0.040020726,0.064281888,0.174503286
Postobstructive Pneumonia: An Underdescribed Syndrome,"Background. Postobstructive community-acquired pneumonia (PO-CAP) is relatively common in clinical practice. The clinical syndrome is poorly defined, and the role of infection as a cause of the infiltrate is uncertain. We prospectively studied patients with PO-CAP and compared them to a cohort of patients with bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (B-CAP). Methods. We prospectively studied patients hospitalized for CAP; 5.4% had PO-CAP, defined as a pulmonary infiltrate occurring distal to an obstructed bronchus. Sputum and blood cultures, viral polymerase chain reaction, urinary antigen tests, and serum procalcitonin (PCT) were done in nearly all cases. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with PO-CAP were compared to those of patients with B-CAP. Results. In a 2-year period, we identified 30 patients with PO-CAP. Compared to patients with B-CAP, patients with PO-CAP had longer duration of symptoms (median, 14 vs 5 days; P < .001). Weight loss and cavitary lesions were more common (P < .01 for both comparisons) and leukocytosis was less common (P < .01) in patients with PO-CAP. A bacterial pathogen was implicated in only 3 (10%) PO-CAP cases. PCT was <0.25 ng/mL in 19 (63.3%) patients. Although no differences were observed in disease severity or rates of intensive care unit admissions, 30-day mortality was significantly higher in PO-CAP vs B-CAP (40.0% vs 11.7%; P < .01). Conclusions. Although there is substantial overlap, PO-CAP is a clinical entity distinct from B-CAP; a bacterial cause was identified in only 10% of patients. Our study has important implications for the clinical recognition of patients with PO-CAP, the role of microorganisms as etiologic agents, and the use of antibiotic therapy.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.118997967,-0.051097396,-0.083296133,-0.125918414,-0.085042249,-0.059974788,-0.044214588,0.115934184,-0.217722772,0.082202379,-0.083757569,0.011377599,0.006269364,0.017060805,-0.112258288,-0.044515998,0.006923129,0.038408775,-0.07311949,0.119927468,0.019935062,0.076070264,0.186078423,0.067098198,0.101288546,-0.101623842,-0.00766746,0.066165659,0.139122496,0.05990834
Evaluation of epidemiological and clinical features of influenza and other respiratory viruses,"AIM: In our study, we aimed to clinically and epidemiologically evaluate respiratory tract infections the viral agents of which were detected by molecular methods and to compare influenza and other respiratory tract viruses in this context. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The records of 178 patients aged above 2 years who presented to pediatric emergency outpatient clinic with fever and respiratory tract infection findings between December 2013 and April 2014 were examined retrospectively. RESULTS: At least one respiratory tract pathogen was detected by polymerase chain reaction in 78.6% (n=140) of the patients: influenza A 33.5%, influenza B 16.4%, respiratory syncytial virus 9.2%, adenovirus 7.8%, rhinovirus 7.1%, coronavirus 7.1%, human metapneumovirus 5.7%, human bocavirus 5.7%, parainfluenza virus 3.5%, coinfection 2.8%. The mean age of the patients was 6.3±3.6 years. Sixty-nine patients (49.2%) were aged between 2 and 5 years. Seventy-one patients (50.7%) were aged 5 years and above. Upper respiratory tract infection was found with a rate of 65.7% and lower respiratory tract infection was found with a rate of 34.2%. It was observed that the distribution of respiratory tract viruses showed variance by age groups. Influenza A infection was observed with the highest rate in both age groups. Influenza B was the second leading agent (p=0.008) above the age of 5 years and respiratory syncytial virus was the second leading agent in the 2–5 year age group (p=0.003). Influenza viruses were detected in 55.9% of 118 patients who were found to be compatible with the definition of “influenza-like illness” specified in the Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and other viral agenst were detected in 44%. No difference could be found between the clinical pictures and radiological findings caused by influenza and other respiratory tract viruses. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, it was concluded that influenza and other respiratory viruses can not be differentiated definitely by clinical and radiological findings, though there are some differences.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.360684913,-0.158372544,-0.174561882,0.165698764,0.03747454,0.09944982,-0.105698626,0.013419492,-0.026565118,0.004447403,-0.000254002,-0.008638869,0.060962278,0.063779508,-0.000853323,-0.045267594,0.041104602,-0.02254582,0.044707889,0.090896551,0.063142441,-0.09516883,-0.010361145,0.016174319,0.003571878,-0.000752485,-0.094209706,0.035065566,-0.013455675,-0.073697939
Identification of a resveratrol tetramer as a potent inhibitor of hepatitis C virus helicase,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is responsible for various chronic inflammatory liver diseases. Here, we have identified a naturally occurring compound with anti‐HCV activity and have elucidated its mode of antiviral action. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Luciferase reporter and real‐time RT‐PCR assays were used to measure HCV replication. Western blot, fluorescence‐labelled HCV replicons and infectious clones were employed to quantitate expression levels of viral proteins. Resistant HCV mutant mapping, in vitro NS3 protease, helicase, NS5B polymerase and drug affinity responsive target stability assays were also used to study the antiviral mechanism. KEY RESULTS: A resveratrol tetramer, vitisin B from grapevine root extract showed high potency against HCV replication (EC(50) = 6 nM) with relatively low cytotoxicity (EC(50) >10 μM). Combined treatment of vitisin B with an NS5B polymerase inhibitor (sofosbuvir) exhibited a synergistic or at least additive antiviral activity. Analysis of a number of vitisin B‐resistant HCV variants suggested an NS3 helicase as its potential target. We confirmed a direct binding between vitisin B and a purified NS3 helicase in vitro. Vitisin B was a potent inhibitor of a HCV NS3 helicase (IC(50) = 3 nM). In vivo, Finally, we observed a preferred tissue distribution of vitisin B in the liver after i.p. injection in rats, at clinically attainable concentrations. Conclusion and Implications Vitisin B is one of the most potent HCV helicase inhibitors identified so far. Vitisin B is thus a prime candidate to be developed as the first HCV drug derived from natural products.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.116636151,-0.028203026,-0.00357112,-0.016790514,-0.153426271,0.057977462,0.078052098,-0.015328718,0.069348896,0.010100994,-0.014870539,0.107391995,0.025107079,0.07158226,-0.058730588,-0.064922409,0.042017635,0.354252911,0.405012217,-0.164126972,-0.077537334,0.001819539,0.124066369,0.087192235,-0.046349654,-0.036018329,-0.05070258,0.051870648,-0.054267622,-0.068754471
Biochemical Evaluation of the Inhibition Properties of Favipiravir and 2′-C-Methyl-Cytidine Triphosphates against Human and Mouse Norovirus RNA Polymerases,"Norovirus (NoV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that causes acute gastroenteritis and is responsible for 200,000 deaths per year worldwide. No effective vaccine or treatment is available. Recent studies have shown that the nucleoside analogs favipiravir (T-705) and 2′-C-methyl-cytidine (2CM-C) inhibit NoV replication in vitro and in animal models, but their precise mechanism of action is unknown. We evaluated the molecular interactions between nucleoside triphosphates and NoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NoVpol), the enzyme responsible for replication and transcription of NoV genomic RNA. We found that T-705 ribonucleoside triphosphate (RTP) and 2CM-C triphosphate (2CM-CTP) equally inhibited human and mouse NoVpol activities at concentrations resulting in 50% of maximum inhibition (IC(50)s) in the low micromolar range. 2CM-CTP inhibited the viral polymerases by competing directly with natural CTP during primer elongation, whereas T-705 RTP competed mostly with ATP and GTP at the initiation and elongation steps. Incorporation of 2CM-CTP into viral RNA blocked subsequent RNA synthesis, whereas T-705 RTP did not cause immediate chain termination of NoVpol. 2CM-CTP and T-705 RTP displayed low levels of enzyme selectivity, as they were both recognized as substrates by human mitochondrial RNA polymerase. The level of discrimination by the human enzyme was increased with a novel analog of T-705 RTP containing a 2′-C-methyl substitution. Collectively, our data suggest that 2CM-C inhibits replication of NoV by acting as a classic chain terminator, while T-705 may inhibit the virus by multiple mechanisms of action. Understanding the precise mechanism of action of anti-NoV compounds could provide a rational basis for optimizing their inhibition potencies and selectivities.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.13652948,-0.042184346,-0.043833139,0.046156789,-0.065508191,-0.000781528,0.061411223,0.012660107,-0.00145767,0.020616172,0.070156721,0.047979347,-0.026588084,0.01354408,0.018097613,0.00835549,-0.032921358,0.052490719,0.032519353,-0.008010194,0.014111274,0.027031825,-0.040746907,0.037557684,0.014911151,-0.040113342,-0.01303227,0.007578233,0.026367263,0.004015456
The Non-structural Protein of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Disrupts the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and Induces Apoptosis,"Viruses have developed distinct strategies to overcome the host defense system. Regulation of apoptosis in response to viral infection is important for virus survival and dissemination. Like other viruses, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is known to regulate apoptosis. This study, for the first time, suggests that the non-structural protein NSs of CCHFV, a member of the genus Nairovirus, induces apoptosis. In this report, we demonstrated the expression of CCHFV NSs, which contains 150 amino acid residues, in CCHFV-infected cells. CCHFV NSs undergoes active degradation during infection. We further demonstrated that ectopic expression of CCHFV NSs induces apoptosis, as reflected by caspase-3/7 activity and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, in different cell lines that support CCHFV replication. Using specific inhibitors, we showed that CCHFV NSs induces apoptosis via both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. The minimal active region of the CCHFV NSs protein was determined to be 93–140 amino acid residues. Using alanine scanning, we demonstrated that Leu-127 and Leu-135 are the key residues for NSs-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, CCHFV NSs co-localizes in mitochondria and also disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential. We also demonstrated that Leu-127 and Leu-135 are important residues for disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential by NSs. Therefore, these results indicate that the C terminus of CCHFV NSs triggers mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, leading to activation of caspases, which, ultimately, leads to apoptosis. Given that multiple factors contribute to apoptosis during CCHFV infection, further studies are needed to define the involvement of CCHFV NSs in regulating apoptosis in infected cells.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.076785058,-0.035171019,-0.007780533,-0.079168855,-0.056876586,0.045798816,0.034636614,-0.024401476,0.044690835,-0.018012593,-0.032735801,0.000427476,-0.015079261,0.020036581,-0.007562362,0.008360107,0.015249499,-0.022390164,-0.000291296,0.004326079,0.015598872,0.000582108,-0.006681213,-0.018962186,0.0381306,0.024978569,-0.029591663,0.020631487,-0.005979468,-0.039325054
Viral quantity and pathological changes in broilers experimentally infected by IRFIBV32 isolate of infectious bronchitis virus,"An Iranian isolate of avian infectious bronchitis virus IRFIBV32 was quantified in experimentally infected broilers using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and histopathological changes was investigated. Thirty-six 3-week-old commercial broilers were inoculated by 10(5) ELD50/0.1 ml of the virus. On the various days post inoculation (dpi) different tissues were collected. The virus strongly started the replication in trachea at 1 dpi and reached to the maximum titer at 3 dpi. The highest IBV RNA level was shown in this organ. In lung, the virus was replicated with the titer lower than that of the trachea, but it rose up more at 5 dpi. The kidneys were the tissues with the least viral genome copy number, although the duration of the virus presence was considerable. The virus replicated in testes sooner than ovaries also disappeared sooner but the maximum viral yield in the ovaries was more. The virus titer in the studied tissues had an interesting fluctuation especially in caecal tonsils. Testes and ovaries were the organs that the virus could reactivate without using any chemical. The most severe lesions were observed in tracheae but they appeared in the lungs later. Lymphocyte infiltration in the kidneys was noted from 5 dpi even sooner than the lungs. There were no lesions in the caecal tonsils, testes and ovaries in spite of the virus replication in a high titer.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.042446123,-0.033188909,0.02116384,-0.042669335,0.013269242,0.048045739,-0.033935413,-0.042482216,0.032337434,0.090023877,0.07080263,-0.044123199,-0.031922249,0.057588667,0.031344602,0.043229906,-0.012151311,-0.015196017,0.00662608,0.043596309,-0.030211627,-0.013863949,-0.004815827,-0.022164048,-0.027119294,0.030187885,0.003268997,0.000799819,-0.041936636,-0.006961593
ABCB1 polymorphisms associated with osteonecrosis of the femeral head,"Aims: This case-control study was conducted to investigate the relation of ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) C1236T and C3435T polymorphisms and non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femeral head (ONFH). Methods: We gathered 113 ONFH patients and 116 controls in the study. The polymorphisms of ABCB1 were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technology. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were adopted to analyze the correlation between ABCB1 polymorphisms and ONFH. Results: In the study, we found that the frequency of C3435T TT genotype was much lower in case group, compared with that of controls (17.7% vs. 23.3%). Moreover, OR and 95% CI values indicated that C3435T TT genotype served as a protective factor for ONFH (OR=0.34, 95% CI=0.15-0.75). Meanwhile, the risk for the T allele carriers was much lower than C allele (OR=0.60, 95% CI=0.42-0.87). However, C1236T polymorphism showed no significant effects on the pathogenesis of ONFH. In the haplotype analysis, T-T haplotype appeared to be an inhibitor for ONFH (OR=0.45, 95% CI=0.23-0.87).

The role of MBL2 gene polymorphism in sepsis incidence,"Aim: This case-control study was aimed to explore the role of mannose-binding lectin 2 (MBL2) gene rs1800450 polymorphism (codon 54 A/B, G230A) in the development of sepsis in Han Chinese. Methods: MBL2 rs1800450 polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). MBL serum level was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Associations between rs1800450 and sepsis susceptibility was detected by Chi-square test and represented by odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Correlation of rs1800450 genotypes and MBL serum level was assessed using t test. Result: Variant A allele frequency was significantly observed in cases than that in controls, indicating a significant association with the susceptibility of sepsis (OR = 1.979, 95% CI = 1.200-3.262). GA genotype also relate to the onset of sepsis (OR = 2.090, 95% CI = 1.163-3.753). MBL serum concentrations were significantly different between case and control groups (P<0.001).

Translational readthrough-promoting drugs enhance pseudoknot-mediated suppression of the stop codon at the Moloney murine leukemia virus gag–pol junction,"Translational readthrough-promoting drugs enhance the incorporation of amino acids at stop codons and can thus bypass premature termination during protein synthesis. The polymerase (Pol) proteins of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) are synthesized as a large Gag–Pol fusion protein, formed by the readthrough of a stop codon at the end of the gag ORF. The downstream pol ORF lacks its own start codon, and Pol protein synthesis is wholly dependent on translation of the upstream gag gene and the readthrough event for expression. Here, we explored the effects of readthrough-promoting drugs – aminoglycoside antibiotics and the small molecule ataluren – on the efficiency of readthrough of the stop codon in the context of the MoMLV genome. We showed that these compounds increased readthrough of the stop codon at the MoMLV gag–pol junction in vivo above the already high basal level and that the resulting elevated gag–pol readthrough had deleterious effects on virus replication. We also showed that readthrough efficiency could be driven to even higher levels in vitro, and that the combination of the small molecules and the RNA structure at the MoMLV stop codon could achieve extremely high readthrough efficiencies.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.136385393,-0.05420758,-0.023425879,-0.042353812,-0.032243841,-0.01342674,-0.030204486,0.00663343,0.018614804,-0.050210432,-0.048196803,-0.005228513,-0.000309345,-0.0423652,-0.037267509,-0.016560737,0.036817352,-0.014052367,-0.036029129,-0.016748775,-0.011468216,-0.002883169,-0.063779746,0.023203191,-0.021616958,-0.038118102,0.009569625,-0.016892914,0.049906338,-0.07632512

Evidence for an Ancestral Association of Human Coronavirus 229E with Bats,"We previously showed that close relatives of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) exist in African bats. The small sample and limited genomic characterizations have prevented further analyses so far. Here, we tested 2,087 fecal specimens from 11 bat species sampled in Ghana for HCoV-229E-related viruses by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Only hipposiderid bats tested positive. To compare the genetic diversity of bat viruses and HCoV-229E, we tested historical isolates and diagnostic specimens sampled globally over 10 years. Bat viruses were 5- and 6-fold more diversified than HCoV-229E in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and spike genes. In phylogenetic analyses, HCoV-229E strains were monophyletic and not intermixed with animal viruses. Bat viruses formed three large clades in close and more distant sister relationships. A recently described 229E-related alpaca virus occupied an intermediate phylogenetic position between bat and human viruses. According to taxonomic criteria, human, alpaca, and bat viruses form a single CoV species showing evidence for multiple recombination events. HCoV-229E and the alpaca virus showed a major deletion in the spike S1 region compared to all bat viruses. Analyses of four full genomes from 229E-related bat CoVs revealed an eighth open reading frame (ORF8) located at the genomic 3′ end. ORF8 also existed in the 229E-related alpaca virus. Reanalysis of HCoV-229E sequences showed a conserved transcription regulatory sequence preceding remnants of this ORF, suggesting its loss after acquisition of a 229E-related CoV by humans. These data suggested an evolutionary origin of 229E-related CoVs in hipposiderid bats, hypothetically with camelids as intermediate hosts preceding the establishment of HCoV-229E. IMPORTANCE The ancestral origins of major human coronaviruses (HCoVs) likely involve bat hosts. Here, we provide conclusive genetic evidence for an evolutionary origin of the common cold virus HCoV-229E in hipposiderid bats by analyzing a large sample of African bats and characterizing several bat viruses on a full-genome level. Our evolutionary analyses show that animal and human viruses are genetically closely related, can exchange genetic material, and form a single viral species. We show that the putative host switches leading to the formation of HCoV-229E were accompanied by major genomic changes, including deletions in the viral spike glycoprotein gene and loss of an open reading frame. We reanalyze a previously described genetically related alpaca virus and discuss the role of camelids as potential intermediate hosts between bat and human viruses.

Tumor suppressors and oncogenes play key roles in protein synthesis from the transcription of rRNA and ribosome biogenesis to mRNA translation initiation and protein synthesis. Major signaling pathways are altered in melanoma to modulate the protein synthetic machinery thereby promoting tumor development. However, despite the importance of this process in melanoma development, involvement of the protein synthetic machinery in this cancer type is an underdeveloped area of study. Here, we review the coupling of melanoma development to deregulation of the protein synthetic machinery. We examine existing knowledge regarding RNA Polymerase I inhibition and mRNA translation focusing on their inhibition for therapeutic applications in melanoma. Furthermore, the contribution of amino acid biosynthesis and involvement of ribosomal proteins are also reviewed as future therapeutic strategies to target deregulated protein production in melanoma.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.161545578,-0.053060577,-0.032878093,-0.041097782,-0.092424108,0.007888115,-0.011179206,-0.026126584,0.051684796,-0.019402772,-0.092904746,-0.020548904,0.025138922,-0.022247967,-0.064443994,-0.06362358,0.068427035,-0.046056461,-0.026701082,0.032822058,-0.048875779,0.035080251,-0.032484695,-0.044444,0.070177967,0.02571946,0.001957625,-0.033568826,0.040073189,0.038421033
Recent Advances in the Discovery of Norovirus Therapeutics: Miniperspective,"Noroviruses are members of the family Caliciviridae. Norovirus infections are a global health burden that impacts >20 million individuals annually in the U.S. alone. Noroviruses are associated with high morbidity among vulnerable populations, particularly immunocompromised patients. This perspective highlights recent developments related to the discovery and development of norovirus-specific small-molecule therapeutics as well as recent advances in our understanding of norovirus biology and pathogenesis. Most of the work in this area is at the early discovery stage and has been primarily focused on inhibitors of norovirus 3C-like protease and RNA dependent RNA polymerase. However, recent discoveries emanating from basic studies in norovirus research have resulted in the identification of new host-related drug targets that can be exploited.

Community Surveillance of Respiratory Viruses Among Families in the Utah Better Identification of Germs-Longitudinal Viral Epidemiology (BIG-LoVE) Study,"Background. This study: (1) describes the viral etiology of respiratory illness by prospectively collecting weekly symptom diaries and nasal swabs from families for 1 year, (2) analyzed data by reported symptoms, virus, age, and family composition, and (3) evaluated the duration of virus detection. Methods. Twenty-six households (108 individuals) provided concurrent symptom and nasal swab data for 4166 person-weeks. The FilmArray polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform (BioFire Diagnostics, LLC) was used to detect 16 respiratory viruses. Viral illnesses were defined as ≥1 consecutive weeks with the same virus detected with symptoms reported in ≥1 week. Results. Participants reported symptoms in 23% and a virus was detected in 26% of person-weeks. Children younger than 5 years reported symptoms more often and were more likely to have a virus detected than older participants (odds ratio [OR] 2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.08–2.94 and OR 3.96, 95% CI, 3.35–4.70, respectively). Compared with single person households, individuals living with children experienced 3 additional weeks of virus detection. There were 783 viral detection episodes; 440 (56%) associated with symptoms. Coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, and influenza A detections were usually symptomatic; bocavirus and rhinovirus detections were often asymptomatic. The mean duration of PCR detection was ≤2 weeks for all viruses and detections of ≥3 weeks occurred in 16% of episodes. Younger children had longer durations of PCR detection. Conclusions. Viral detection is often asymptomatic and occasionally prolonged, especially for bocavirus and rhinovirus. In clinical settings, the interpretation of positive PCR tests, particularly in young children and those who live with them, may be confounded.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.205517284,-0.076043555,-0.01499164,0.060683996,0.037156072,-0.06402026,0.035518293,-0.050887334,0.030504318,-0.023193628,0.028517859,-0.037079182,-0.020502136,-0.070656158,0.016923032,0.036523184,-0.047525377,-0.122662035,0.066939394,-0.077714469,-0.134458704,0.032655806,-0.027215179,0.03761795,0.002576963,0.038154811,0.019061268,-0.083433816,-0.014386802,-0.020255592
Disease risks associated with free-ranging wild boar in Saskatchewan,"This study investigated the disease status of Saskatchewan’s feral wild boar population. Whole carcasses, tissue samples, and/or serum from 81 hunter-killed boars from Saskatchewan were submitted to the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative (CWHC) between 2009 and 2014. Serological tests were negative for PRRS, H1N1, and H3N2 swine influenza, PCV-2, and TGE/PRCV in 22/22 boars and for Toxoplasma gondii and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae in 20/20 boars. Of 20 boars whose sera were tested 20 were positive for Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, with 7 positive for, among other strains, serotype 14; 16 were positive for Lawsonia intracellularis, 1 was positive and 6 were suspicious for Salmonella spp. Polymerase chain reaction tests were negative for PRRS and PCV2 in 58/58 boars and positive for Torque teno virus in 1/8 boars. Digestion assays were negative for Trichinella spp. in 22/22 boars.

Respiratory Viral Detection in Children and Adults: Comparing Asymptomatic Controls and Patients With Community-Acquired Pneumonia,"Background. The clinical significance of viruses detected in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is often unclear. Methods. We conducted a prospective study to identify the prevalence of 13 viruses in the upper respiratory tract of patients with CAP and concurrently enrolled asymptomatic controls with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We compared age-stratified prevalence of each virus between patients with CAP and controls and used multivariable logistic regression to calculate attributable fractions (AFs). Results. We enrolled 1024 patients with CAP and 759 controls. Detections of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus were substantially more common in patients with CAP of all ages than in controls (AFs near 1.0). Parainfluenza and coronaviruses were also more common among patients with CAP (AF, 0.5–0.75). Rhinovirus was associated with CAP among adults (AF, 0.93) but not children (AF, 0.02). Adenovirus was associated with CAP only among children <2 years old (AF, 0.77). Conclusions. The probability that a virus detected with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in patients with CAP contributed to symptomatic disease varied by age group and specific virus. Detections of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus among patients with CAP of all ages probably indicate an etiologic role, whereas detections of parainfluenza, coronaviruses, rhinovirus, and adenovirus, especially in children, require further scrutiny.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.234044258,-0.106129158,-0.117728714,-0.004472403,-0.004461173,-0.069021622,-0.039668864,0.052032955,-0.15983051,0.060003737,-0.081731486,-0.018752865,0.02656284,0.033651448,-0.107338151,-0.048038075,0.009295504,-0.012275229,-0.039775973,0.12376896,0.011077469,0.096190514,0.219400351,0.112716845,0.084344711,-0.073804309,-0.042326812,0.072000019,0.134283199,0.023751195
Molecular Mechanisms and Timing of Cortical Immune Activation in Schizophrenia,"OBJECTIVE: Immune-related abnormalities are commonly reported in schizophrenia, including higher mRNA levels for the viral restriction factor interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) in the prefrontal cortex. The authors sought to clarify whether higher IFITM mRNA levels and other immune-related disturbances in the prefrontal cortex are the consequence of an ongoing molecular cascade contributing to immune activation or the reflection of a long-lasting maladaptive response to an in utero immune-related insult. METHOD: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was employed to measure mRNA levels for immune-related cytokines and transcriptional regulators, including those reported to regulate IFITM expression, in the prefrontal cortex from 62 schizophrenia and 62 healthy subjects and from adult mice exposed prenatally to maternal immune activation or in adulthood to the immune stimulant poly(I:C). RESULTS: Schizophrenia subjects had markedly higher mRNA levels for interleukin 6 (IL-6) (+379%) and interferon-β (+29%), which induce IFITM expression; lower mRNA levels for Schnurri-2 (−10%), a transcriptional inhibitor that lowers IFITM expression; and higher mRNA levels for nuclear factor-κB (+86%), a critical transcription factor that mediates cytokine regulation of immune-related gene expression. In adult mice that received daily poly(I:C) injections, but not in offspring with prenatal exposure to maternal immune activation, frontal cortex mRNA levels were also markedly elevated for IFITM (+304%), multiple cytokines including IL-6 (+493%), and nuclear factor-κB (+151%). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that higher prefrontal cortex IFITM mRNA levels in schizophrenia may be attributable to adult, but not prenatal, activation of multiple immune markers and encourage further investigation into the potential role of these and other immune markers as therapeutic targets in schizophrenia.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.063863998,-0.03981076,-0.010069721,-0.165499704,-0.103408536,0.046923901,0.033466061,-0.037455341,0.062638518,-0.076626974,-0.084478115,-0.078979692,-0.005855276,0.111127287,-0.063732354,0.019083941,-0.006227986,-0.104526998,-0.072749494,-0.073236452,0.031640959,-0.032393984,0.015571174,0.018403695,-0.062175612,-0.10905234,0.024470354,0.027096293,0.142197708,-0.039348602
Differential Expression of miR-499 and Validation of Predicted Target Genes in the Testicular Tissue of Swine at Different Developmental Stages,"microRNAs (miRNAs) represent a newly identified class of nonprotein-coding ∼22 nt small RNA that plays important roles in multiple biological processes by degrading targeted mRNA or repressing mRNA translation. This study observed the morphology of swine testicular tissue at different developmental stages (including 1-day old, 1–7 month old) by Hematoxylin-eosin staining. We also examined the expression of miR-499 and its target genes (CYLC1, DMRT1, QKI, XRN2, ZNF313) in samples of tissue slices using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, which showed that miR-499 had a significant negative correlation with QKI gene. Then, the proteins of QKI gene expression were determined by western blot, which were consistent with results of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) detection. Therefore, the luciferase reporter gene system was used to verify correlation between miR-499 and QKI gene. Activity of luciferase was significantly lower in miR-499 co-transfected with pmiR-RB-REPORT-QKI-WT group than the miR-499 co-transfected with pmiR-RB-REPORT-QKI-mut/si groups, indicating that target sequence of miR-499 existed in 3′UTR of QKI gene. Furthermore, the expressions of miR-499 and QKI were detected in testicular cells that were transfected with miR-499, miR-499 negative control and untreated. The results showed that the diameter of convoluted seminiferous tubule growth increased with age. Significantly different expressions of miR-499 and its target genes were found in swine testicular tissue at different developmental stages (p<0.05), overexpressing miR-499 analysis, suggesting that miR-499 was negatively correlated to the expression of QKI (p<0.05). In conclusion, QKI is a target gene of miR-499.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.057191238,-0.023997295,0.021147806,-0.08848234,-0.012675908,0.018211906,-0.005642104,-0.012067911,0.016259339,-0.041915703,-0.035046276,-0.002143258,-0.021712734,0.006016109,0.003310862,0.004909584,-0.002587308,-0.009233235,-0.004929072,-0.043179697,0.006543846,-0.013020042,0.007751359,0.002782215,-0.021927066,-0.020983028,-0.015770869,0.009194819,0.032703863,-0.019080975

"Contact tracing the first Middle East respiratory syndrome case in the Philippines, February 2015","BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an illness caused by a coronavirus in which infected persons develop severe acute respiratory illness. A person can be infected through close contacts. This is an outbreak investigation report of the first confirmed MERS case in the Philippines and the subsequent contact tracing activities. METHODS: Review of patient records and interviews with health-care personnel were done. Patient and close contacts were tested for MERS-coronavirus (CoV) by real time-polymerase chain reaction. Close contacts were identified and categorized. All traced contacts were monitored daily for appearance of illness for 14 days starting from the date of last known exposure to the confirmed case. A standard log sheet was used for symptom monitoring. RESULTS: The case was a 31-year-old female who was a health-care worker in Saudi Arabia. She had mild acute respiratory illness five days before travelling to the Philippines. On 1 February, she travelled with her husband to the Philippines while she had a fever. On 2 February, she attended a health facility in the Philippines. On 8 February, respiratory samples were tested for MERS-CoV and yielded positive results. A total of 449 close contacts were identified, and 297 (66%) were traced. Of those traced, 15 developed respiratory symptoms. All of them tested negative for MERS. DISCUSSION: In this outbreak investigation, the participation of health-care personnel in conducting vigorous contact tracing may have reduced the risk of transmission. However, being overly cautious to include more contacts for the outbreak response should be further reconsidered.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.108574291,0.16151264,-0.100442788,-0.041793005,-0.012944171,0.033690224,-0.038799087,0.260502696,0.196523927,-0.028320539,0.040109196,-0.004921565,-0.040674968,-0.047288495,0.037147015,0.002935255,-0.023783098,-0.03861987,0.006150688,-0.021603393,-0.009042237,-0.008236827,-0.068213933,-0.044803235,-0.002573184,0.025720193,-0.041468388,0.040544313,-0.03260945,-0.019119027
Cross-Protection of Influenza A Virus Infection by a DNA Aptamer Targeting the PA Endonuclease Domain,"Amino acid residues in the N-terminal of the PA subunit (PA(N)) of the influenza A virus polymerase play critical roles in endonuclease activity, protein stability, and viral RNA (vRNA) promoter binding. In addition, PA(N) is highly conserved among different subtypes of influenza virus, which suggests PA(N) to be a desired target in the development of anti-influenza agents. We selected DNA aptamers targeting the intact PA protein or the PA(N) domain of an H5N1 virus strain using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). The binding affinities of selected aptamers were measured, followed by an evaluation of in vitro endonuclease inhibitory activity. Next, the antiviral effects of enriched aptamers against influenza A virus infections were examined. A total of three aptamers targeting PA and six aptamers targeting PA(N) were selected. Our data demonstrated that all three PA-selected aptamers neither inhibited endonuclease activity nor exhibited antiviral efficacy, whereas four of the six PA(N)-selected aptamers inhibited both endonuclease activity and H5N1 virus infection. Among the four effective aptamers, one exhibited cross-protection against infections of H1N1, H5N1, H7N7, and H7N9 influenza viruses, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of around 10 nM. Notably, this aptamer was identified at the 5th round but disappeared after the 10th round of selection, suggesting that the identification and evaluation of aptamers at early rounds of selection may be highly helpful for screening effective aptamers. Overall, our study provides novel insights for screening and developing effective aptamers for use as anti-influenza drugs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.044995961,-0.064054645,-0.011582414,0.036874725,-0.065906276,0.17495961,-0.013072907,-0.012196325,0.018947865,-0.045149305,-0.011907005,0.023132673,-0.009491445,0.000949804,-0.010046577,-0.003828617,0.015144866,0.003876749,0.019919837,-0.006214132,0.018130553,0.006706108,0.011444704,0.021011767,0.011260798,0.032356411,-0.008466072,0.005853436,0.034525301,0.040733256
Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome after hematopoietic cell transplantation: evidence of occult infectious etiologies,"Newer diagnostic methods may link more idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) cases to an infectious agent. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from 69 hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients with IPS diagnosed between 1992 and 2006 were tested for 28 pathogens (3 bacteria and 25 viruses) by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and for Aspergillus by galactomannan assay. Research BALs from 21 asymptomatic HCT patients served as controls. Among 69 HCT patients with IPS, 39 (56.5%) had a pathogen detected. The most frequent pathogens were human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) (N = 20 [29%]) followed by human rhinovirus (HRV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Aspergillus (N = 8 [12%] in each). HHV-6 and HRV were rarely detected in controls, whereas CMV and Aspergillus were occasionally detected with low pathogen load. Patients with pathogens had worse day-100 survival than those without (hazard ratio, 1.88; P = .03). Mortality in patients with only pathogens of “uncertain” significance in lung was similar to that in patients with pathogens of “established” significance. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing did not reveal additional significant pathogens.

Bordetella Pertussis is an Uncommon Pathogen in Children Hospitalized with Bronchiolitis During the Winter Season,"BACKGROUND: In the United States (U.S.), Bordetella pertussis incidence has increased. Cough and apnea are common findings in pertussis and also in bronchiolitis, the most common cause of hospitalization in U.S. infants. The objective was to determine the prevalence of B. pertussis infection in children hospitalized with bronchiolitis and to describe its clinical course. METHODS: Children hospitalized with bronchiolitis and age <2 years were eligible for a prospective, multicenter cohort study during three consecutive winter seasons (November to March) from 2007 to 2010. 16 sites in 12 states participated using a standardized enrollment protocol. Families were asked the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) pertussis classification questions. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained and tested by real time polymerase chain reaction for 16 viruses, Mycoplama pneumoniae and B. pertussis. RESULTS: 2068 (94%) of 2,207 children had one or more respiratory pathogens. B. pertussis was identified in 4 children (0.2%; 95% CI, 0.1–0.5%) with 3 having a viral co-infection. All 4 were younger than four months; 2 met the CDC definition of probable pertussis, and 3 had received at least one dose of an acellular pertussis vaccine. During the hospitalization, 2 had paroxysmal cough, 1 required ICU care, and the median length of stay was 13 days. CONCLUSION: Our data support that B. pertussis is an uncommon pathogen in U.S. children hospitalized with bronchiolitis in the winter. Making a diagnosis of pertussis can be challenging because the disease can be atypical, and may not meet the CDC definition of probable infection.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.120807323,-0.084339,-0.052457824,-0.061508772,0.001776612,-0.054913894,0.037985023,-0.035109972,0.039810841,-0.038433643,0.015139067,0.010036314,-0.067599754,-0.11794176,0.015736697,0.103526562,-0.001597952,-0.010887553,0.009977348,-0.015824816,-0.057454849,0.063458259,0.011387714,-0.029862855,0.009136748,-0.016263677,0.008538287,0.031032944,0.029431986,-0.046096444
"Protective Efficacy of the Conserved NP, PB1, and M1 Proteins as Immunogens in DNA- and Vaccinia Virus-Based Universal Influenza A Virus Vaccines in Mice","The conventional hemagglutinin (HA)- and neuraminidase (NA)-based influenza vaccines need to be updated most years and are ineffective if the glycoprotein HA of the vaccine strains is a mismatch with that of the epidemic strain. Universal vaccines targeting conserved viral components might provide cross-protection and thus complement and improve conventional vaccines. In this study, we generated DNA plasmids and recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the conserved proteins nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase basic 1 (PB1), and matrix 1 (M1) from influenza virus strain A/Beijing/30/95 (H3N2). BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly with a single vaccine based on NP, PB1, or M1 alone or a combination vaccine based on all three antigens and were then challenged with lethal doses of the heterologous influenza virus strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). Vaccines based on NP, PB1, and M1 provided complete or partial protection against challenge with 1.7 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) of PR8 in mice. Of the three antigens, NP-based vaccines induced protection against 5 LD(50) and 10 LD(50) and thus exhibited the greatest protective effect. Universal influenza vaccines based on the combination of NP, PB1, and M1 induced a strong immune response and thus might be an alternative approach to addressing future influenza virus pandemics.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.006904221,-0.066813475,0.022833703,0.051146611,-0.023191639,0.23956591,-0.073935698,-0.031946147,0.016785265,-0.031773969,-0.00995301,0.040251073,-0.021464981,-0.044287753,-0.003716411,-0.001027753,-0.028161441,-0.011906173,-0.014276565,0.002014014,0.021657296,0.00015125,0.047245013,0.040671915,0.011236882,-0.000798767,-0.015447411,-0.011595369,-0.027242843,0.055840455
Surveillance of Acute Respiratory Infections Using Community-Submitted Symptoms and Specimens for Molecular Diagnostic Testing,"Participatory systems for surveillance of acute respiratory infection give real-time information about infections circulating in the community, yet to-date are limited to self-reported syndromic information only and lacking methods of linking symptom reports to infection types. We developed the GoViral platform to evaluate whether a cohort of lay volunteers could, and would find it useful to, contribute self-reported symptoms online and to compare specimen types for self-collected diagnostic information of sufficient quality for respiratory infection surveillance. Volunteers were recruited, given a kit (collection materials and customized instructions), instructed to report their symptoms weekly, and when sick with cold or flu-like symptoms, requested to collect specimens (saliva and nasal swab). We compared specimen types for respiratory virus detection sensitivity (via polymerase-chain-reaction) and ease of collection. Participants were surveyed to determine receptivity to participating when sick, to receiving information on the type of pathogen causing their infection and types circulating near them. Between December 1 2013 and March 1 2014, 295 participants enrolled in the study and received a kit. Of those who reported symptoms, half (71) collected and sent specimens for analysis. Participants submitted kits on average 2.30 days (95 CI: 1.65 to 2.96) after symptoms began. We found good concordance between nasal and saliva specimens for multiple pathogens, with few discrepancies. Individuals report that saliva collection is easiest and report that receiving information about what pathogen they, and those near them, have is valued and can shape public health behaviors. Community-submitted specimens can be used for the detection of acute respiratory infection with individuals showing receptivity for participating and interest in a real-time picture of respiratory pathogens near them.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.146255415,-0.012885882,0.003719644,-0.001835814,0.002734625,-0.015179331,0.00451972,0.003400142,0.017007533,0.010273551,-0.000511381,0.016373918,0.016116639,-0.04439163,0.040302603,0.001666597,-0.040675965,-0.080979431,0.058192142,-0.072955033,-0.02039761,-0.055753569,-0.03545741,-0.068434336,0.063702712,0.011172333,-0.036498962,0.009342606,0.005884061,-0.093005142
Mutations in Coronavirus Nonstructural Protein 10 Decrease Virus Replication Fidelity,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are unique in encoding a 3′→5′ exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is required for high-fidelity replication, likely via proofreading. nsp14 associates with the CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12-RdRp), and nsp14-ExoN activity is enhanced by binding nsp10, a small nonenzymatic protein. However, it is not known whether nsp10 functions in the regulation of CoV replication fidelity. To test this, we engineered single and double alanine substitution mutations into the genome of murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) containing ExoN activity [ExoN(+)] at positions within nsp10 known to disrupt the nsp10-nsp14 interaction in vitro. We show that an nsp10 mutant, R80A/E82A-ExoN(+), was five to ten times more sensitive to treatment with the RNA mutagen 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) than wild-type (WT)-ExoN(+), suggestive of decreased replication fidelity. This decreased-fidelity phenotype was confirmed using two additional nucleoside analogs, 5-azacytidine and ribavirin. R80A/E82A-ExoN(+) reached a peak titer similar to and demonstrated RNA synthesis kinetics comparable to those seen with WT-ExoN(+). No change in 5-FU sensitivity was observed for R80A/E82A-ExoN(−) relative to MHV-ExoN(−), indicating that the decreased-fidelity phenotype of R80A/E82A-ExoN(−) is linked to the presence of ExoN activity. Our results demonstrate that nsp10 is important for CoV replication fidelity and support the hypothesis that nsp10 functions to regulate nsp14-ExoN activity during virus replication. IMPORTANCE The adaptive capacity of CoVs, as well as all other RNA viruses, is partially attributed to the presence of extensive population genetic diversity. However, decreased fidelity is detrimental to CoV replication and virulence; mutant CoVs with decreased replication fidelity are attenuated and more sensitive to inhibition by RNA mutagens. Thus, identifying the viral protein determinants of CoV fidelity is important for understanding CoV replication, pathogenesis, and virulence. In this report, we show that nsp10, a small, nonenzymatic viral protein, contributes to CoV replication fidelity. Our data support the hypothesis that CoVs have evolved multiple proteins, in addition to nsp14-ExoN, that are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the largest known RNA genomes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.169908869,0.06684718,-0.124738016,0.081579928,-0.022852574,-0.007947901,0.090004588,0.047146537,0.005029324,0.014852158,0.092673438,0.047101328,-0.10170579,0.001784789,-0.006262579,0.056845921,-0.019579445,-0.051676568,-0.068468693,-0.000196619,0.089921991,-0.081688763,0.154082507,0.090418407,0.052718056,0.135214958,-0.027019784,-0.091688862,-0.099488696,-0.117709407
Influenza A Virus Protein PA-X Contributes to Viral Growth and Suppression of the Host Antiviral and Immune Responses,"Influenza virus infection causes global inhibition of host protein synthesis in infected cells. This host shutoff is thought to allow viruses to escape from the host antiviral response, which restricts virus replication and spread. Although the mechanism of host shutoff is unclear, a novel viral protein expressed by ribosomal frameshifting, PA-X, was found to play a major role in influenza virus-induced host shutoff. However, little is known about the impact of PA-X expression on currently circulating influenza A virus pathogenicity and the host antiviral response. In this study, we rescued a recombinant influenza A virus, A/California/04/09 (H1N1, Cal), containing mutations at the frameshift motif in the polymerase PA gene (Cal PA-XFS). Cal PA-XFS expressed significantly less PA-X than Cal wild type (WT). Cal WT, but not Cal PA-XFS, induced degradation of host β-actin mRNA and suppressed host protein synthesis, supporting the idea that PA-X induces host shutoff via mRNA decay. Moreover, Cal WT inhibited beta interferon (IFN-β) expression and replicated more rapidly than Cal PA-XFS in human respiratory cells. Mice infected with Cal PA-XFS had significantly lower levels of viral growth and greater expression of IFN-β mRNA in their lungs than mice infected with Cal WT. Importantly, more antihemagglutinin and neutralizing antibodies were produced in Cal PA-XFS-infected mice than in Cal WT-infected mice, despite the lower level of virus replication in the lungs. Our data indicate that PA-X of the pandemic H1N1 virus has a strong impact on viral growth and the host innate and acquired immune responses to influenza virus. IMPORTANCE Virus-induced host protein shutoff is considered to be a major factor allowing viruses to evade innate and acquired immune recognition. We provide evidence that the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus protein PA-X plays a role in virus replication and inhibition of host antiviral response by means of its host protein synthesis shutoff activity both in vitro and in vivo. We also demonstrated that, while the growth of Cal PA-XFS was attenuated in the lungs of infected animals, this mutant induced a stronger humoral response than Cal WT. Our findings clearly highlight the importance of PA-X in counteracting the host innate and acquired immune responses to influenza virus, an important global pathogen. This work demonstrates that inhibition of PA-X expression in influenza virus vaccine strains may provide a novel way of safely attenuating viral growth while inducing a more robust immune response.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.077725932,-0.09058649,-0.042119592,0.017688127,-0.089836881,0.198118908,-0.000551469,-0.032652501,0.05236205,-0.03623981,-0.050783411,-0.062894567,0.00015307,0.111085077,-0.012061574,0.00327153,0.014243078,-0.071609805,-0.039916126,0.030523306,0.042911367,0.032258207,0.000538719,0.02156053,-0.022753295,0.005159558,0.023170734,-0.009853316,0.007176999,0.026081627
Clinical Outcomes Associated With Respiratory Virus Detection Before Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant,"Background. The management of respiratory virus infections prior to hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is difficult. We examined whether respiratory virus detection before HCT influenced the requirement for bronchoscopy, hospitalization, and overall survival following HCT. Methods. Pre-HCT and weekly post-HCT nasal washes were collected through day 100 from patients with and without symptoms. Samples were tested by multiplex polymerase chain reaction for respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses 1–4, influenza A and B, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and human rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and bocavirus. Results. Of 458 patients, 116 (25%) had respiratory viruses detected pre-HCT. Overall, patients with viruses detected pre-HCT had fewer days alive and out of the hospital and lower survival at day 100 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3–4.5; P = .007) than patients with negative samples; this risk was also present with rhinovirus alone (aHR for mortality, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2–5.5; P = .01). No difference in bronchoscopy incidence was seen in patients with and without respiratory viruses (aHR, 1.3; 95% CI, .8–2.0; P = .32). In symptomatic patients, those with respiratory viruses detected had increased overall mortality compared with patients without viruses detected (unadjusted HR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.0–12.1; P = .05); among asymptomatic patients, detection of respiratory viruses was not associated with increased mortality. Conclusions. These data support routine testing for respiratory viruses among symptomatic patients before HCT, and delay of transplant with virus detection when feasible, even for detection of rhinovirus alone. Further study is needed to address whether asymptomatic patients should undergo screening for respiratory virus detection before HCT.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.243934311,-0.074633445,-0.082188207,0.003962394,0.007718922,-0.05612104,-0.022893226,0.057149926,-0.104907528,0.032436842,-0.033181842,0.036372417,0.01030033,0.062217954,-0.029809787,0.019073692,-0.013803156,-0.086051506,0.082171637,0.029742597,-0.026603393,-0.090022793,0.000645645,0.087425751,0.011342823,-0.06297553,-0.027638906,-0.130684903,-0.121188114,-0.097031867

Antiviral Activity of Chloroquine Against Dengue Virus Type 2 Replication in Aotus Monkeys,"Dengue virus (DENV) of the Flaviviridae family is a single positive-stranded RNA virus that is transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of chloroquine (CLQ) as an antiviral drug against dengue virus in monkeys. To analyze the action of the drug in vivo, nonhuman primates groups (Aotus azarai infulatus) were inoculated with a subcutaneous injection of a virulent strain of DENV-2, treated and untreated CLQ. Blood hematological, viremia, and serum biochemical values were obtained from 16 DENV-2-inoculated, treated and untreated; four received only CLQ and one mock-infected Aotus monkeys. Monkey serum samples (day 0–10 post-inoculation) were assayed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Cytometric Bead Array for determination of viremia and inflammatory cytokines, respectively. Additionally, body temperature and activity levels were determined. In the present work, CLQ was effective on replication of DENV-2 in Aotus monkeys; a time viremia reduction was observed compared with the controls. The concentration of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma in the serum of the animals had a statistically significant reduction in the groups treated with CLQ after infection compared with the controls. A significant decrease in systemic levels of the liver enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was also observed in the animals treated with CLQ after infection compared with the controls.

"Isolation and molecular characterization of nephropathic infectious bronchitis virus isolates of Gujarat state, India","Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a common, highly contagious, acute, and economically important viral disease of chickens caused by Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, sp. Avian coronavirus). Five pooled tissue suspensions of 50 layer birds and one reference Massachusetts vaccine strain were inoculated into specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken egg for isolation of IBV. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out using post inoculated allontoic fluid to amplify the spike (S) glycoprotein of S1 subunit of IBV. All the eggs inoculated with five pooled tissue samples and vaccine sample showed dwarfing and curling of SPF embryos indicative of IBV. All the five samples and the vaccine sample produced the expected amplicons of 466 bp by RT-PCR. The sequencing of five isolates revealed that all the five sequences were 99.09–100 % similar among themselves and showed 99.10–100 % nucleotide identity with the vaccine strain. On multiple sequence alignment it was found that our isolates were more similar at S1 subunit nucleotide level with the reference Ma5 and H120 vaccine strains than the reference Mass41 strain. The sequences of Anand isolates revealed further genetic changes in the circulating IBV in comparison to previous isolate of Gujarat as well as higher differences with the strains isolated in other states showing substantial changes at genetic level in Indian IBV isolates, which may partially explain the increasing incidences of IB in the country in spite of the vaccination.

Functional and molecular evidence for expression of the renin angiotensin system and ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding in COS7 cells,"The renin angiotensin system (RAS) plays a vital role in the regulation of the cardiovascular and renal functions. COS7 is a robust and easily transfectable cell line derived from the kidney of the African green monkey, Cercopithecus aethiops.

Reverse transcription coupled to gene-specific polymerase chain reaction demonstrated expression of ACE, ACE2, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R), and renin at the transcript levels in total RNA cell extracts. Western blot and immunohistochemistry identified ACE (60 kDa), ACE2 (75 kDa), AT(1)R (43 kDa), renin (41 kDa), and ADAM17 (130 kDa) in COS7. At the functional level, a sensitive and selective mass spectrometric approach detected endogenous renin, ACE, and ACE2 activities. ANG-(1–7) formation (m/z 899) from the natural substrate ANG II (m/z 1,046) was detected in lysates and media. COS7 cells stably expressing shRNA constructs directed against endogenous ADAM17 showed reduced ACE2 shedding into the media. This is the first study demonstrating endogenous expression of the RAS and ADAM17 in the widely used COS7 cell line and its utility to study ectodomain shedding of ACE2 mediated by ADAM17 in vitro. The transfectable nature of this cell line makes it an attractive cell model for studying the molecular, functional, and pharmacological properties of the renal RAS.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.082167447,-0.024380986,0.009618661,-0.102277627,-0.051217911,0.026007224,0.007534374,-0.038527681,0.029561464,-0.04716786,-0.034121472,-0.017470583,-0.006184688,0.045050913,-0.010121864,0.006850223,0.014295719,-0.042602433,-0.010410813,-0.045770225,0.014843285,-0.013677469,0.017956652,-0.018061239,0.00551965,0.02098591,0.003625362,0.020951061,-0.001906762,-0.064409601
Clinical disease due to enterovirus D68 in adult hematologic malignancy patients and hematopoietic cell transplant recipients,"The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported over 1000 cases of severe respiratory disease in pediatric patients associated with enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) in the fall of 2014. We sought to identify and define the clinical burden of disease due to EV-D68 in adult patients with hematologic malignancy or undergoing hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for EV-D68 was performed on all respiratory samples positive for human rhinovirus (HRV) or negative for all respiratory viruses by a laboratory-developed respiratory viral PCR panel from August 11, 2014, to November 7, 2014. Presumptive cases were defined as those with an EV-D68 PCR cycle threshold (CT) at least 4 cycles lower than the HRV CT for HRV-positive samples or any EV-D68 CT value for HRV-negative samples. Sequencing of a 150-bp fragment of the 5′ noncoding region confirmed EV-D68 in 16 of 506 respiratory samples. Eight patients had a history of hematologic malignancy, and 6 of these had undergone HCT. Presentation ranged from mild upper respiratory symptoms to respiratory failure. EV-D68 can infect adult patients with hematologic malignancy and HCT recipients and may be associated with severe respiratory disease. Current commercial diagnostic assays cannot differentiate EV-D68 from other enteroviruses or HRV, and improved rapid diagnostic tools are needed.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.118703654,-0.009621864,-0.016498486,-0.043859441,-0.005698582,-0.042922973,0.005675986,0.028191342,-0.004699236,0.034103784,0.003893869,0.019389417,0.008594349,0.030313618,0.031421928,-0.011331307,0.004613029,0.005832868,0.034534794,-0.041878935,0.039818737,-0.088887904,-0.089111511,0.008991087,-0.041081764,0.058613989,-0.069656648,-0.00871669,0.051815886,0.082270481
Early Detection of Dengue Virus by Use of Reverse Transcription-Recombinase Polymerase Amplification,"A method for the rapid diagnosis of early dengue virus (DENV) infection is highly needed. Here, a prototype reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay was developed. The assay detected DENV RNA in <20 min without the need for thermocycling amplification. The assay enabled the detection of as few as 10 copies of DENV RNA. The designed RT-RPA primers and exo probe detected the DENV genome of at least 12 genotypes of DENV circulating globally without cross-reacting with other arboviruses. We assessed the diagnostic performance of the RT-RPA assay for the detection of DENV RNA in 203 serum samples of patients with clinically suspected dengue. The sera were simultaneously tested for DENV using a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and IgM- and IgG-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Acute DENV infection was confirmed in 130 samples and 61 of the samples (46.9%) were classified as viremic with qRT-PCR. The RT-RPA assay showed good concordance (κ of ≥0.723) with the RT-LAMP and qRT-PCR assays in detecting the dengue viremic samples. When used in combination with ELISA, both the RT-RPA and RT-LAMP assays increased the detection of acute DENV infection to ≥95.7% (≥45/47) in samples obtained within 5 days of illness. The results from the study suggest that the RT-RPA assay is the most rapid molecular diagnostic tool available for the detection of DENV. Hence, it is possible to use the RT-RPA assay in a laboratory to complement routine serology testing for dengue.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.043750938,0.141878699,0.355815649,0.117728955,-0.067979511,-0.108793022,0.021194131,0.024189806,-0.045830825,-0.12282641,-0.040920341,0.071351257,-0.098071227,0.071532781,-0.123027334,0.09813442,0.022615514,-0.022982939,0.081145698,0.178394997,0.020797041,-0.013054404,-0.056342988,0.043616452,0.009088969,0.112915935,0.06418613,0.00956871,0.067887842,-0.033241871
Enterovirus 71 mediates cell cycle arrest in S phase through non-structural protein 3D,"Many viruses disrupt the host cell cycle to facilitate their own growth. We assessed the mechanism and function of enterovirus 71 (EV71), a primary causative agent for recent hand, foot, and mouth disease outbreaks, in manipulating cell cycle progression. Our results suggest that EV71 infection induces S-phase arrest in diverse cell types by preventing the cell cycle transition from the S phase into the G2/M phase. Similar results were observed for an alternate picornavirus, Coxsackievirus A16. Synchronization in S phase, but not G0/G1 phase or G2/M phase, promotes viral replication. Consistent with its ability to arrest cells in S phase, the expression of cyclin A2, CDK 2, cyclin E1, and cyclin B1 was regulated by EV71 through increasing transcription of cyclin E1, promoting proteasome-mediated degradation of cyclin A2 and regulating the phosphorylation of CDK 2. Finally, a non-structural protein of EV71, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D, was demonstrated to mediate S-phase cell cycle arrest. These findings suggest that EV71 induces S-phase cell cycle arrest in infected cells via non-structural protein 3D, which may provide favorable conditions for virus production.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.097934544,-0.035535733,-0.016178278,-0.059961571,-0.088315103,0.035336133,0.04174147,-0.031971671,0.032104499,0.000174899,-0.023251164,-0.010982088,-0.022630692,0.057700372,0.000911356,0.020627107,0.005499372,-0.026343584,-0.016317113,0.005662451,0.010539272,-0.007757534,-0.011933696,-0.012270921,0.01563991,0.034133147,-0.017508,0.041216442,-0.030249054,-0.04506806
Surveillance of acute respiratory infections among outpatients: A pilot study in Isfahan city,"BACKGROUND: Considering that there was not any regional survey in Isfahan, Iran regarding the epidemiology of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) in different age groups of general population, the aim of this study was to determine the epidemiologic feature of ARTIs in Isfahan using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, patients aged <80 years with symptoms of ARTI were studied, during 2009-2010 Nasopharyngeal and dry throat swab specimens were collected and pathogens of ARTI was determined using multiplex real-time PCR. RESULTS: In this study, 455 cases with ARTI were studied. Mean age of studied population was 29.9 ± 18.5 (range: 0.2-80). Symptoms such as sore throat (86.3%), coryza (68.0%) and dry cough (54.3%) were the most common symptoms in all studied groups, whereas fever was the most clinical presentation of younger patients (<15 years old) and headache and skeletal pain were the most common symptoms of older patients (>15 years old). Rhinovirus was the most common cause of ARTI in patients aged <5 years and those aged >50 years. Influenza virus B was the most common cause of ARTI in patients aged 5-50 years. CONCLUSION: Our study provides baseline information on the epidemiologic and clinical feature of outpatients with ARTIs in Isfahan city.

Multiple Circulating Infections Can Mimic the Early Stages of Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers and Possible Human Exposure to Filoviruses in Sierra Leone Prior to the 2014 Outbreak,"Lassa fever (LF) is a severe viral hemorrhagic fever caused by Lassa virus (LASV). The LF program at the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) in Eastern Sierra Leone currently provides diagnostic services and clinical care for more than 500 suspected LF cases per year. Nearly two-thirds of suspected LF patients presenting to the LF Ward test negative for either LASV antigen or anti-LASV immunoglobulin M (IgM), and therefore are considered to have a non-Lassa febrile illness (NLFI). The NLFI patients in this study were generally severely ill, which accounts for their high case fatality rate of 36%. The current studies were aimed at determining possible causes of severe febrile illnesses in non-LF cases presenting to the KGH, including possible involvement of filoviruses. A seroprevalence survey employing commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests revealed significant IgM and IgG reactivity against dengue virus, chikungunya virus, West Nile virus (WNV), Leptospira, and typhus. A polymerase chain reaction–based survey using sera from subjects with acute LF, evidence of prior LASV exposure, or NLFI revealed widespread infection with Plasmodium falciparum malaria in febrile patients. WNV RNA was detected in a subset of patients, and a 419 nt amplicon specific to filoviral L segment RNA was detected at low levels in a single patient. However, 22% of the patients presenting at the KGH between 2011 and 2014 who were included in this survey registered anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) IgG or IgM, suggesting prior exposure to this agent. The 2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is already the deadliest and most widely dispersed outbreak of its kind on record. Serological evidence reported here for possible human exposure to filoviruses in Sierra Leone prior to the current EVD outbreak supports genetic analysis that EBOV may have been present in West Africa for some time prior to the 2014 outbreak.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.048095671,0.004714089,-0.026334521,-0.054989722,-0.055843976,0.011923573,-0.014032194,0.05380626,-0.055091419,0.031872928,0.002797658,0.013458977,0.007354185,-0.007694954,0.002514933,0.001209458,-0.016146455,0.039105426,-0.028072669,0.01091849,0.032703197,-0.026849743,-0.0595233,-0.012618603,-0.017876732,0.038569351,0.020725898,0.026748112,-0.049266879,0.001766118
Correlation between Diarrhea Severity and Oocyst Count via Quantitative PCR or Fluorescence Microscopy in Experimental Cryptosporidiosis in Calves,"Cryptosporidium is an important diarrhea-associated pathogen, however the correlation between parasite burden and diarrhea severity remains unclear. We studied this relationship in 10 experimentally infected calves using immunofluorescence microscopy and real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (N = 124 fecal samples). The qPCR data were corrected for extraction/amplification efficiency and gene copy number to generate parasite counts. The qPCR and microscopic oocyst quantities exhibited significant correlation (R(2) = 0.33, P < 0.05), however qPCR had increased sensitivity. Upon comparison with diarrhea severity scores (from 0 to 3), a PCR-based count of ≥ 2.6 × 10(5) parasites or an immunofluorescence microscopy count of ≥ 4.5 × 10(4) oocysts were discriminatory predictors of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (versus no-to-mild diarrhea), with accuracies and predictive values of 72–82%.

Recombinase polymerase amplification as a promising tool in hepatitis C virus diagnosis,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection represents a significant health problem and represents a heavy load on some countries like Egypt in which about 20% of the total population are infected. Initial infection is usually asymptomatic and result in chronic hepatitis that give rise to complications including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The management of HCV infection should not only be focus on therapy, but also to screen carrier individuals in order to prevent transmission. In the present, molecular detection and quantification of HCV genome by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) represent the gold standard in HCV diagnosis and plays a crucial role in the management of therapeutic regimens. However, real time PCR is a complicated approach and of limited distribution. On the other hand, isothermal DNA amplification techniques have been developed and offer molecular diagnosis of infectious dieses at point-of-care.

"Correlation Between Abnormal Platelet Count and Respiratory Viral Infection in Patients From Cheonan, Korea","BACKGROUND: In this study, the effects of viral infections on platelet (PLT) count have been reported. This study examined the correlation between PLT count and respiratory virus (RV) infections. METHODS: Patients who visited Dankook University Hospital between December 2006 and February 2014 with symptoms of suspected RV infection were recruited. Multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions identified the causative virus(es). PLT counts were analyzed with respect to virus, age and sex of the patient, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Of the 8,147 patients, 62.8% were RV‐positive, and 18.6% of RV‐positive patients had abnormal PLT counts. There were no differences in the rates of abnormal PLT counts between single‐infection and virus co‐infection cases. In RV infection patients, the incidence of abnormal PLT count increased with age and varied depending on the RV infection type. Patients with abnormal PLT count stayed in hospital longer than those with normal PLT count. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of thrombocytopenia was higher among the elderly; in younger patients, thrombocytosis was more prevalent than thrombocytopenia. Respiratory tract infections caused by different viruses resulted in varied PLT count changes. Further systematic research of PLT count changes related to viral infections is required.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.083732633,-0.038284352,-0.056020202,-0.077585091,-0.030191772,-0.024269741,-0.007474237,0.033255601,-0.042332597,0.015335446,-0.010205726,0.008511903,-0.013093672,0.031048902,0.00429209,0.011390262,0.023513256,0.015178712,-0.015090291,0.022858904,0.032175672,-0.060234521,-0.037063973,0.021114489,0.011241325,-0.012952952,0.017177924,0.007209719,-0.036155807,0.014500121
Perturbation in the Conserved Methyltransferase-Polymerase Interface of Flavivirus NS5 Differentially Affects Polymerase Initiation and Elongation,"The flavivirus NS5 is a natural fusion of a methyltransferase (MTase) and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). Analogous to DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, the NS5 polymerase initiates RNA synthesis through a de novo mechanism and then makes a transition to a processive elongation phase. However, whether and how the MTase affects polymerase activities through intramolecular interactions remain elusive. By solving the crystal structure of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) NS5, we recently identified an MTase-RdRP interface containing a set of six hydrophobic residues highly conserved among flaviviruses. To dissect the functional relevance of this interface, we made a series of JEV NS5 constructs with mutations of these hydrophobic residues and/or with the N-terminal first 261 residues and other residues up to the first 303 residues deleted. Compared to the wild-type (WT) NS5, full-length NS5 variants exhibited consistent up- or downregulation of the initiation activities in two types of polymerase assays. Five representative full-length NS5 constructs were then tested in an elongation assay, from which the apparent single-nucleotide incorporation rate constant was estimated. Interestingly, two constructs exhibited different elongation kinetics from the WT NS5, with an effect rather opposite to what was observed at initiation. Moreover, constructs with MTase and/or the linker region (residues 266 to 275) removed still retained polymerase activities, albeit at overall lower levels. However, further removal of the N-terminal extension (residues 276 to 303) abolished regular template-directed synthesis. Together, our data showed that the MTase-RdRP interface is relevant in both polymerase initiation and elongation, likely with different regulation mechanisms in these two major phases of RNA synthesis. IMPORTANCE The flavivirus NS5 is very unique in having a methyltransferase (MTase) placed on the immediate N terminus of its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). We recently solved the crystal structure of the full-length NS5, which revealed a conserved interface between MTase and RdRP. Building on this discovery, here we carried out in vitro polymerase assays to address the functional relevance of the interface interactions. By explicitly probing polymerase initiation and elongation activities, we found that perturbation in the MTase-RdRP interface had different impacts on different phases of synthesis, suggesting that the roles and contribution of the interface interactions may change upon phase transitions. By comparing the N-terminal-truncated enzymes with the full-length NS5, we collected data to indicate the indispensability to regular polymerase activities of a region that was functionally unclarified previously. Taken together, we provide biochemical evidence and mechanistic insights for the cross talk between the two enzyme modules of flavivirus NS5.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.169443246,-0.037778122,-0.053222237,0.055098248,-0.037611576,-0.043608222,0.053369478,0.017046329,-0.045075489,0.006460202,0.068072515,0.122748876,-0.088555635,-0.060928017,-0.056434076,-0.018986076,0.050740373,-0.044067625,-0.042456338,-0.045379673,0.032021886,-0.036194176,0.028330876,-0.057630817,0.051299014,0.068615206,-0.016621458,0.020112576,0.060832265,0.049114593
Hepatitis B Virus Polymerase Disrupts K63-Linked Ubiquitination of STING To Block Innate Cytosolic DNA-Sensing Pathways,"The cellular innate immune system recognizing pathogen infection is essential for host defense against viruses. In parallel, viruses have developed a variety of strategies to evade the innate immunity. The hepatitis B virus (HBV), a DNA virus that causes chronic hepatitis, has been shown to inhibit RNA helicase RIG-I-mediated interferon (IFN) induction. However, it is still unknown whether HBV could affect the host DNA-sensing pathways. Here we report that in transiently HBV-transfected Huh7 cells, the stably HBV-producing cell line HepAD38, and HBV-infected HepaRG cells and primary human hepatocytes, HBV markedly interfered with IFN-β induction and antiviral immunity mediated by the stimulator of interferon genes (STING), which has been identified as a central factor in foreign DNA recognition and antiviral innate immunity. Screening analysis demonstrated that the viral polymerase (Pol), but not other HBV-encoded proteins, was able to inhibit STING-stimulated interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation and IFN-β induction. Moreover, the reverse transcriptase (RT) and the RNase H (RH) domains of Pol were identified to be responsible for the inhibitory effects. Furthermore, Pol was shown to physically associate with STING and dramatically decrease the K63-linked polyubiquitination of STING via its RT domain without altering the expression level of STING. Taken together, these observations suggest that besides its inherent catalytic function, Pol has a role in suppression of IFN-β production by direct interaction with STING and subsequent disruption of its K63-linked ubiquitination, providing a new mechanism for HBV to counteract the innate DNA-sensing pathways. IMPORTANCE Although whether and how HBV infection induces the innate immune responses are still controversial, it has become increasingly clear that HBV has developed strategies to counteract the pattern recognition receptor-mediated signaling pathways. Previous studies have shown that type I IFN induction activated by the host RNA sensors could be inhibited by HBV. However, it remains unknown whether HBV as a DNA virus utilizes evasion mechanisms against foreign DNA-elicited antiviral signaling. In recent years, the cytosolic DNA sensor and key adaptor STING has been demonstrated to be essential in multiple foreign DNA-elicited innate immune signalings. Here, for the first time, we report STING as a new target of HBV to antagonize IFN induction and identify the viral polymerase responsible for the inhibitory effect, thus providing an additional molecular mechanism by which HBV evades the innate immunity; this implies that in addition to its inherent catalytic function, HBV polymerase is a multifunctional immunomodulatory protein.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.108402061,-0.038302578,0.009202189,-0.058092133,-0.128054046,0.068026248,0.084164189,-0.033792699,0.065601137,-0.009663811,-0.048392094,-0.026870411,-0.001161182,0.080949896,-0.031123178,0.019813908,-0.006362537,-0.004971992,-0.00592957,0.000955942,0.015548335,0.026935208,-0.011381137,0.052629684,-0.002326481,-0.02715477,0.009261011,0.015412724,0.015757478,-0.052997305
Duration of Rhinovirus Shedding in the Upper Respiratory Tract in the First Year of Life,"BACKGROUND: Current molecular diagnostic methods have detected rhinovirus RNA in a high proportion of asymptomatic infants and children, raising the question of the clinical significance of these findings. This study investigates the prevalence of prolonged rhinovirus RNA presence in the upper respiratory tract of infants during the first year of life. METHODS: In a longitudinal study, infants were followed from birth up to 12 months. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected monthly (months 1–6 and month 9) and during an upper respiratory infection. Rhinoviruses were detected by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Presence of repeated rhinovirus RNA was evaluated by nucleotide sequence analysis. RESULTS: A total of 2153 specimens from 362 infants were studied; 341 distinct rhinovirus infections in 216 infants were identified. Follow-up specimens were available within 30 days for 179 infections, creating the sample set to assess prolonged rhinovirus presence. Of the 179 infections, 46 involved the detection of the same rhinovirus strain in repeated specimens, including 8 events of prolonged presence of the same strain (detected in specimens collected >30 days apart), representing 4.5% of the evaluable rhinovirus infections. There were 26 events in which a rhinovirus strain was replaced by a different strain within a 30-day interval, representing 14.5% of the 179 infections. CONCLUSIONS: Although rhinovirus infections are common in healthy infants, prolonged presence of rhinovirus RNA in the respiratory tract after an upper respiratory infection was uncommon (<5%). Detection of rhinovirus RNA in an infant most likely represents an infection within a 30-day period.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.124975817,-0.082264485,-0.050591063,0.027283414,0.063212605,-0.134836931,0.051077673,-0.034050684,0.055867845,0.044134595,0.04828912,-0.03004089,0.015124013,-0.045908621,0.098430039,0.021093303,0.018320448,-0.063229084,0.101008983,-0.039823548,-0.023741871,-0.107385247,-0.074667648,0.021662671,0.088517827,-0.011771963,-0.00646502,0.050452697,0.033509127,-0.023022566
Respiratory Syncytial Virus Genomic Load and Disease Severity Among Children Hospitalized With Bronchiolitis: Multicenter Cohort Studies in the United States and Finland,"Background. We investigated whether children with a higher respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) genomic load are at a higher risk of more-severe bronchiolitis. Methods. Two multicenter prospective cohort studies in the United States and Finland used the same protocol to enroll children aged <2 years hospitalized for bronchiolitis and collect nasopharyngeal aspirates. By using real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, patients were classified into 3 genomic load status groups: low, intermediate, and high. Outcome measures were a length of hospital stay (LOS) of ≥3 days and intensive care use, defined as admission to the intensive care unit or use of mechanical ventilation. Results. Of 2615 enrolled children, 1764 (67%) had RSV bronchiolitis. Children with a low genomic load had a higher unadjusted risk of having a length of stay of ≥3 days (52%), compared with children with intermediate and those with high genomic loads (42% and 51%, respectively). In a multivariable model, the risk of having a length of stay of ≥3 days remained significantly higher in the groups with intermediate (odds ratio [OR], 1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20–1.69) and high (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.29–1.94) genomic loads. Similarly, children with a high genomic load had a higher risk of intensive care use (20%, compared with 15% and 16% in the groups with low and intermediate genomic loads, respectively). In a multivariable model, the risk remained significantly higher in the group with a high genomic load (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.03–1.99). Conclusion. Children with a higher RSV genomic load had a higher risk for more-severe bronchiolitis.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.144795398,-0.093147828,-0.070594143,-0.055783487,0.002255478,-0.108782006,0.021035855,-0.055786552,0.02139314,-0.089525316,0.008628071,-0.014297532,-0.128040423,-0.101122085,-0.076763758,0.116881053,-0.093281066,-0.00073697,0.000868981,-0.01981011,-0.135133071,0.040805388,0.013216886,0.03144512,-0.073547856,-0.077713133,0.096519554,-0.142563866,-0.095487181,0.067834217
Structural Dynamics as a Contributor to Error-prone Replication by an RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase,"RNA viruses encoding high- or low-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) are attenuated. The ability to predict residues of the RdRp required for faithful incorporation of nucleotides represents an essential step in any pipeline intended to exploit perturbed fidelity as the basis for rational design of vaccine candidates. We used x-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, NMR spectroscopy, and pre-steady-state kinetics to compare a mutator (H273R) RdRp from poliovirus to the wild-type (WT) enzyme. We show that the nucleotide-binding site toggles between the nucleotide binding-occluded and nucleotide binding-competent states. The conformational dynamics between these states were enhanced by binding to primed template RNA. For the WT, the occluded conformation was favored; for H273R, the competent conformation was favored. The resonance for Met-187 in our NMR spectra reported on the ability of the enzyme to check the correctness of the bound nucleotide. Kinetic experiments were consistent with the conformational dynamics contributing to the established pre-incorporation conformational change and fidelity checkpoint. For H273R, residues comprising the active site spent more time in the catalytically competent conformation and were more positively correlated than the WT. We propose that by linking the equilibrium between the binding-occluded and binding-competent conformations of the nucleotide-binding pocket and other active-site dynamics to the correctness of the bound nucleotide, faithful nucleotide incorporation is achieved. These studies underscore the need to apply multiple biophysical and biochemical approaches to the elucidation of the physical basis for polymerase fidelity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.156390056,-0.034500955,-0.046028262,0.043975585,-0.039359264,-0.015496146,0.060810614,0.01657569,-0.040771952,0.027241317,0.095066732,0.157353694,-0.106428909,-0.093954475,-0.036628298,-0.004369291,0.002226617,-0.050114679,-0.089645529,-0.085679822,0.125432602,-0.088577959,0.094703964,0.037081081,0.006377746,0.057501436,0.016799374,0.000339752,-0.001577018,-0.053917446
Utilization of Viral Molecular Diagnostics Among Children Hospitalized With Community Acquired Pneumonia,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether results of a polymerase chain reaction–based respiratory viral panel (RVP) are associated with changes in antibiotic use or differential clinical outcomes among children hospitalized with pneumonia. METHODS: We retrospectively identified otherwise healthy children hospitalized over a 3-year period at a single institution with community-acquired pneumonia who had an RVP performed within 24 hours of admission. We examined associations between RVP results and clinical outcomes as well as management decisions including initiation and duration of intravenous antibiotics. RESULTS: Among 202 children, a positive RVP (n = 127, 63%) was associated with a more complicated clinical course, although this was due largely to more severe disease seen in younger children and those with respiratory syncytial virus (n = 38, 30% of positive detections). Detection of a virus did not influence antibiotic therapy. Included children were younger and had more severe illness than children hospitalized with pneumonia at the same institution without an RVP obtained. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, only respiratory syncytial virus was associated with a more severe clinical course compared with RVP-negative children. Regardless of the virus detected, RVP positivity did not influence antibiotic usage. However, RVP use focused primarily on children with severe pneumonia. Whether similar testing influences management decisions among children with less severe illness deserves further study.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.182704507,-0.08430907,-0.077943002,-0.021392838,-0.012077417,-0.107673838,0.040313083,-0.038743382,0.023673229,0.004023965,-0.004695821,-0.026477407,-0.029712362,-0.067388955,-0.018086082,0.020796975,-0.027805158,0.028366521,-0.028577854,0.016056624,-0.03020827,0.112146527,0.028966979,-0.022789754,-0.03208934,0.054386443,-0.035409186,-0.046570271,0.02000959,1.47E-06
Faecal virome of cats in an animal shelter,"We describe the metagenomics-derived feline enteric virome in the faeces of 25 cats from a single shelter in California. More than 90 % of the recognizable viral reads were related to mammalian viruses and the rest to bacterial viruses. Eight viral families were detected: Astroviridae, Coronaviridae, Parvoviridae, Circoviridae, Herpesviridae, Anelloviridae, Caliciviridae and Picobirnaviridae. Six previously known viruses were also identified: feline coronavirus type 1, felid herpes 1, feline calicivirus, feline norovirus, feline panleukopenia virus and picobirnavirus. Novel species of astroviruses and bocaviruses, and the first genome of a cyclovirus in a feline were characterized. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region from four highly divergent partial viral genomes in the order Picornavirales were sequenced. The detection of such a diverse collection of viruses shed within a single shelter suggested that such animals experience robust viral exposures.

Methyltransferase-Defective Avian Metapneumovirus Vaccines Provide Complete Protection against Challenge with the Homologous Colorado Strain and the Heterologous Minnesota Strain,"Avian metapneumovirus (aMPV), also known as avian pneumovirus or turkey rhinotracheitis virus, is the causative agent of turkey rhinotracheitis and is associated with swollen head syndrome in chickens. Since its discovery in the 1970s, aMPV has been recognized as an economically important pathogen in the poultry industry worldwide. The conserved region VI (CR VI) of the large (L) polymerase proteins of paramyxoviruses catalyzes methyltransferase (MTase) activities that typically methylate viral mRNAs at guanine N-7 (G-N-7) and ribose 2′-O positions. In this study, we generated a panel of recombinant aMPV (raMPV) Colorado strains carrying mutations in the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) binding site in the CR VI of L protein. These recombinant viruses were specifically defective in ribose 2′-O, but not G-N-7 methylation and were genetically stable and highly attenuated in cell culture and viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) young turkeys. Importantly, turkeys vaccinated with these MTase-defective raMPVs triggered a high level of neutralizing antibody and were completely protected from challenge with homologous aMPV Colorado strain and heterologous aMPV Minnesota strain. Collectively, our results indicate (i) that aMPV lacking 2′-O methylation is highly attenuated in vitro and in vivo and (ii) that inhibition of mRNA cap MTase can serve as a novel target to rationally design live attenuated vaccines for aMPV and perhaps other paramyxoviruses. IMPORTANCE Paramyxoviruses include many economically and agriculturally important viruses such as avian metapneumovirus (aMPV), and Newcastle disease virus (NDV), human pathogens such as human respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, human parainfluenza virus type 3, and measles virus, and highly lethal emerging pathogens such as Nipah virus and Hendra virus. For many of them, there is no effective vaccine or antiviral drug. These viruses share common strategies for viral gene expression and replication. During transcription, paramyxoviruses produce capped, methylated, and polyadenylated mRNAs. Using aMPV as a model, we found that viral ribose 2′-O methyltransferase (MTase) is a novel approach to rationally attenuate the virus for vaccine purpose. Recombinant aMPV (raMPV) lacking 2′-O MTase were not only highly attenuated in turkeys but also provided complete protection against the challenge of homologous and heterologous aMPV strains. This novel approach can be applicable to other animal and human paramyxoviruses for rationally designing live attenuated vaccines.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.052040757,-0.055043713,-0.01298109,-0.002463482,0.003303623,0.057678632,0.026709809,-0.033026187,0.046827028,0.061053569,-0.020464831,-0.004698243,0.001236969,-0.004502639,-0.005808352,-0.027939489,-0.007492209,-0.008760604,-0.039205162,0.058000404,0.063350223,0.013286233,0.033804732,0.060016123,0.051459151,0.020389789,-0.021202098,-0.015704871,0.027311706,-0.033581849
Influenza A Virus Polymerase Is a Site for Adaptive Changes during Experimental Evolution in Bat Cells,"The recent identification of highly divergent influenza A viruses in bats revealed a new, geographically dispersed viral reservoir. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of host-restricted viral tropism and the potential for transmission of viruses between humans and bats, we exposed a panel of cell lines from bats of diverse species to a prototypical human-origin influenza A virus. All of the tested bat cell lines were susceptible to influenza A virus infection. Experimental evolution of human and avian-like viruses in bat cells resulted in efficient replication and created highly cytopathic variants. Deep sequencing of adapted human influenza A virus revealed a mutation in the PA polymerase subunit not previously described, M285K. Recombinant virus with the PA M285K mutation completely phenocopied the adapted virus. Adaptation of an avian virus-like virus resulted in the canonical PB2 E627K mutation that is required for efficient replication in other mammals. None of the adaptive mutations occurred in the gene for viral hemagglutinin, a gene that frequently acquires changes to recognize host-specific variations in sialic acid receptors. We showed that human influenza A virus uses canonical sialic acid receptors to infect bat cells, even though bat influenza A viruses do not appear to use these receptors for virus entry. Our results demonstrate that bats are unique hosts that select for both a novel mutation and a well-known adaptive mutation in the viral polymerase to support replication. IMPORTANCE Bats constitute well-known reservoirs for viruses that may be transferred into human populations, sometimes with fatal consequences. Influenza A viruses have recently been identified in bats, dramatically expanding the known host range of this virus. Here we investigated the replication of human influenza A virus in bat cell lines and the barriers that the virus faces in this new host. Human influenza A and B viruses infected cells from geographically and evolutionarily diverse New and Old World bats. Viruses mutated during infections in bat cells, resulting in increased replication and cytopathic effects. These mutations were mapped to the viral polymerase and shown to be solely responsible for adaptation to bat cells. Our data suggest that replication of human influenza A viruses in a nonnative host drives the evolution of new variants and may be an important source of genetic diversity.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.05525126,-0.073540207,-0.083263415,0.203886981,0.202950382,0.367958408,0.193919746,0.03239462,-0.08880265,-0.030708551,-0.10869546,-0.181629719,0.018023693,0.169303784,-0.011647309,0.054540124,0.003352022,-0.011659437,-0.010785377,0.07180661,0.020276107,0.007845601,0.027704837,0.016961728,-0.044408881,0.048789762,0.008609411,-0.01323396,-0.106568727,-0.023730247
Interactome Analysis of the Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus RNA Polymerase Complex Identifies Protein Chaperones as Important Cofactors That Promote L-Protein Stability and RNA Synthesis,"The human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) core viral RNA polymerase comprises the large polymerase protein (L) and its cofactor, the phosphoprotein (P), which associate with the viral ribonucleoprotein complex to replicate the genome and, together with the M2-1 protein, transcribe viral mRNAs. While cellular proteins have long been proposed to be involved in the synthesis of HRSV RNA by associating with the polymerase complex, their characterization has been hindered by the difficulty of purifying the viral polymerase from mammalian cell culture. In this study, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged L- and P-protein expression was coupled with high-affinity anti-GFP antibody-based immunoprecipitation and quantitative proteomics to identify cellular proteins that interacted with either the L- or the P-proteins when expressed as part of a biologically active viral RNP. Several core groups of cellular proteins were identified that interacted with each viral protein including, in both cases, protein chaperones. Ablation of chaperone activity by using small-molecule inhibitors confirmed previously reported studies which suggested that this class of proteins acted as positive viral factors. Inhibition of HSP90 chaperone function in the current study showed that HSP90 is critical for L-protein function and stability, whether in the presence or absence of the P-protein. Inhibition studies suggested that HSP70 also disrupts virus biology and might help the polymerase remodel the nucleocapsid to allow RNA synthesis to occur efficiently. This indicated a proviral role for protein chaperones in HRSV replication and demonstrates that the function of cellular proteins can be targeted as potential therapeutics to disrupt virus replication. IMPORTANCE Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) represents a major health care and economic burden, being the main cause of severe respiratory infections in infants worldwide. No vaccine or effective therapy is available. This study focused on identifying those cellular proteins that potentially interact specifically with the viral proteins that are central to virus replication and transcription, with a view to providing potential targets for the development of a specific, transient therapeutic which disrupts virus biology but prevents the emergence of resistance, while maintaining cell viability. In particular, protein chaperones (heat shock proteins 70 and 90), which aid protein folding and function, were identified. The mechanism by which these chaperones contribute to virus biology was tested, and this study demonstrates to the field that cellular protein chaperones may be required for maintaining the correct folding and therefore functionality of specific proteins within the virus replication complex.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.148370307,-0.085851748,-0.09412561,0.070260628,-0.11041815,0.00121047,0.031039115,-0.051576291,0.086578825,0.04339002,-0.059195447,-0.064239927,0.041276976,0.058379742,-0.023602537,-0.102951811,0.099399221,-0.057095308,0.015287676,0.115859381,-0.066444894,0.073406616,-0.048974402,-0.051835041,0.098102097,0.078851956,0.030530556,-0.056250204,-0.047535927,0.046596027
"An Observational, Laboratory-Based Study of Outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in Jeddah and Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 2014","Background. In spring 2014, a sudden rise in the number of notified Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections occurred across Saudi Arabia with a focus in Jeddah. Hypotheses to explain the outbreak pattern include increased surveillance, increased zoonotic transmission, nosocomial transmission, and changes in viral transmissibility, as well as diagnostic laboratory artifacts. Methods. Diagnostic results from Jeddah Regional Laboratory were analyzed. Viruses from the Jeddah outbreak and viruses occurring during the same time in Riyadh, Al-Kharj, and Madinah were fully or partially sequenced. A set of 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms distinctive to the Jeddah outbreak were determined from additional viruses. Viruses from Riyadh and Jeddah were isolated and studied in cell culture. Results. Up to 481 samples were received per day for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. A laboratory proficiency assessment suggested positive and negative results to be reliable. Forty-nine percent of 168 positive-testing samples during the Jeddah outbreak stemmed from King Fahd Hospital. All viruses from Jeddah were monophyletic and similar, whereas viruses from Riyadh were paraphyletic and diverse. A hospital-associated transmission cluster, to which cases in Indiana (United States) and the Netherlands belonged, was discovered in Riyadh. One Jeddah-type virus was found in Riyadh, with matching travel history to Jeddah. Virus isolates representing outbreaks in Jeddah and Riyadh were not different from MERS-CoV EMC/2012 in replication, escape of interferon response, or serum neutralization. Conclusions. Virus shedding and virus functions did not change significantly during the outbreak in Jeddah. These results suggest the outbreaks to have been caused by biologically unchanged viruses in connection with nosocomial transmission.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.030011227,0.063360806,-0.021177055,-0.014066239,0.011858278,0.039899328,0.003797289,0.112627427,0.067259019,0.010059754,0.025705538,-0.005006885,-0.01162367,-0.011142319,0.0451522,-0.011171305,-0.006653079,-0.030809089,-0.022175223,-0.016348038,0.018697613,0.01873449,-0.031317293,0.026162776,-0.033724214,0.019057742,-0.001786096,0.015510317,-0.044060022,-0.039228957
Rational Design of Human Metapneumovirus Live Attenuated Vaccine Candidates by Inhibiting Viral mRNA Cap Methyltransferase,"The paramyxoviruses human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hPIV3) are responsible for the majority of pediatric respiratory diseases and inflict significant economic loss, health care costs, and emotional burdens. Despite major efforts, there are no vaccines available for these viruses. The conserved region VI (CR VI) of the large (L) polymerase proteins of paramyxoviruses catalyzes methyltransferase (MTase) activities that typically methylate viral mRNAs at positions guanine N-7 (G-N-7) and ribose 2′-O. In this study, we generated a panel of recombinant hMPVs carrying mutations in the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site in CR VI of L protein. These recombinant viruses were specifically defective in ribose 2′-O methylation but not G-N-7 methylation and were genetically stable and highly attenuated in cell culture and viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of cotton rats. Importantly, vaccination of cotton rats with these recombinant hMPVs (rhMPVs) with defective MTases triggered a high level of neutralizing antibody, and the rats were completely protected from challenge with wild-type rhMPV. Collectively, our results indicate that (i) amino acid residues in the SAM binding site in the hMPV L protein are essential for 2′-O methylation and (ii) inhibition of mRNA cap MTase can serve as a novel target to rationally design live attenuated vaccines for hMPV and perhaps other paramyxoviruses, such as hRSV and hPIV3. IMPORTANCE Human paramyxoviruses, including hRSV, hMPV, and hPIV3, cause the majority of acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in humans, particularly in infants, children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Currently, there is no licensed vaccine available. A formalin-inactivated vaccine is not suitable for these viruses because it causes enhanced lung damage upon reinfection with the same virus. A live attenuated vaccine is the most promising vaccine strategy for human paramyxoviruses. However, it remains a challenge to identify an attenuated virus strain that has an optimal balance between attenuation and immunogenicity. Using reverse genetics, we generated a panel of recombinant hMPVs that were specifically defective in ribose 2′-O methyltransferase (MTase) but not G-N-7 MTase. These MTase-defective hMPVs were genetically stable and sufficiently attenuated but retained high immunogenicity. This work highlights a critical role of 2′-O MTase in paramyxovirus replication and pathogenesis and a new avenue for the development of safe and efficacious live attenuated vaccines for hMPV and other human paramyxoviruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.009732217,-0.08032919,-0.04973189,0.032906411,-0.001105642,0.001665806,0.060258951,-0.07648618,0.116645491,0.018376796,-0.028857442,-0.009464985,-0.038340048,-0.016160826,-0.050978224,-0.063573074,-0.01745017,0.072578308,-0.113152308,0.085508518,0.14252658,0.006040484,0.0565066,0.006162233,0.035044687,0.056673553,-0.12019014,-0.084077648,0.035139576,-0.068373591
Sterile and Microbial-associated Intra-amniotic Inflammation in Preterm Prelabor Rupture of Membranes,"OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to: 1) determine the amniotic fluid (AF) microbiology of patients with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM); and 2) examine the relationship between intra-amniotic inflammation with and without microorganisms (sterile inflammation) and adverse pregnancy outcomes in patients with preterm PROM. METHODS: AF samples obtained from 59 women with preterm PROM were analyzed using cultivation techniques (for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria as well as genital mycoplasmas) and with broad-range polymerase chain reaction coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). AF concentration of interleukin-6 (IL-6) was determined using ELISA. Results of both tests were correlated with AF IL-6 concentrations, and the occurrence of adverse obstetrical/perinatal outcomes. RESULTS: 1) PCR/ESI-MS, AF culture, and the combination of these two tests, each identified microorganisms in 36% (21/59), 24% (14/59) and 41% (24/59) of women with preterm PROM, respectively; 2) the most frequent microorganisms found in the amniotic cavity were Sneathia species and Ureaplasma urealyticum; 3) the frequency of microbial-associated and sterile intra-amniotic inflammation was overall similar [ 29% (17/59)]: - however, the prevalence of each differed according to the gestational age when PROM occurred ; 4) the earlier the gestational age at preterm PROM, the higher the frequency of both microbial-associated and sterile intra-amniotic inflammation; 5) the intensity of the intra-amniotic inflammatory response against microorganisms is stronger when preterm PROM occurs early in pregnancy; and 6) the frequency of acute placental inflammation (histologic chorioamnionitis and/or funisitis) was significantly higher in patients with microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation than in those without intra-amniotic inflammation [93.3% (14/15) vs. 38% (6/16); p=0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: 1) The frequency of microorganisms in preterm PROM is 40% using both cultivation and PCR/ESI-MS; 2) PCR/ESI-MS identified microorganisms in the AF of 50% more women with preterm PROM than did AF culture; and 3) sterile intra-amniotic inflammation was present in 29% of these patients, and it was as or more common than microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation among those presenting after, but not before, 24 weeks of gestation.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.036385729,-0.0229533,0.004015402,-0.116284161,-0.034345747,-0.006038264,0.009243972,0.011144646,-0.050716191,-0.009038185,-0.005470481,0.010347613,-0.026812135,-0.006117312,-0.003737908,0.033640442,0.015930916,-0.004907994,-0.002996314,-0.079862851,0.008300233,-0.038331224,0.018756988,-0.024748583,-0.00230534,-0.023668935,0.02297472,-0.015960601,0.00924823,-0.017191757
Sterile Intra-amniotic Inflammation in Asymptomatic Patients with a Sonographic Short Cervix: Prevalence and Clinical Significance,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and clinical significance of sterile- and microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation in asymptomatic patients with a sonographic short cervix. METHODS: Amniotic fluid (AF) samples obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis from 231 asymptomatic women with a sonographic short cervix [cervical length (CL) ≤25 mm] were analyzed using cultivation techniques (for aerobic and anaerobic as well as genital mycoplasmas) and broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). The frequency and magnitude of intra-amniotic inflammation [defined as an AF interleukin (IL)-6 concentration ≥2.6 ng/mL], acute histologic placental inflammation, spontaneous preterm delivery, and the amniocentesis-to-delivery interval were examined according to the results of AF cultures, PCR/ESI-MS and AF IL-6 concentrations. RESULTS: Ten percent (24/231) of patients with a sonographic short cervix had sterile intra-amniotic inflammation (an elevated AF IL-6 concentration without evidence of microorganisms using cultivation and molecular methods). Sterile intra-amniotic inflammation was significantly more frequent than microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation [10.4% (24/231) vs. 2.2% (5/231); p<0.001]. Patients with sterile intra-amniotic inflammation had a significantly higher rate of spontaneous preterm delivery <34 weeks of gestation [70.8% (17/24) vs. 31.6% (55/174); p<0.001] and a significantly shorter amniocentesis-to-delivery interval than patients without intra-amniotic inflammation [median 35, (IQR: 10 – 70) vs. median 71, (IQR: 47 – 98) days, (p<0.0001)]. CONCLUSION: Sterile intra-amniotic inflammation is more common than microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation in asymptomatic women with a sonographic short cervix, and is associated with increased risk of spontaneous preterm delivery (<34 weeks). Further investigation is required to determine the causes of sterile intra-amniotic inflammation and the mechanisms whereby this condition is associated with a short cervix and spontaneous preterm delivery.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.02764667,-0.023857247,-0.001562999,-0.12356931,-0.043543634,-0.006476195,0.008646975,0.011194438,-0.043739563,-0.017613968,-0.003182132,0.014664968,-0.034140077,-0.00042177,-0.008050917,0.038366355,0.001929021,-0.010850041,-0.001216621,-0.075014223,0.003922454,-0.047894014,0.005535465,-0.021952117,-0.016444207,-0.026456466,0.023666819,-0.014827287,0.002641731,-0.019778342
The Role of Multiplex PCR in Respiratory Tract Infections in Children,"BACKGROUND: Infants, toddlers, and children of primary-school age without any special risk factors generally have three to ten febrile respiratory infections per year. Most such infections are of viral origin and self-limiting, but viral infection is often hard to distinguish from bacterial infection. The use of a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect viruses in respiratory secretions is potentially beneficial, as it might help physicians avoid giving antibiotics unnecessarily. METHODS: This article is based on a selective review of the literature and on the findings of the authors‘ own investigations. RESULTS: Multiplex PCR is a highly sensitive, highly specific test for the detection of viral nucleic acids in respiratory secretions. If PCR reveals the presence of RNA derived from respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, or influenza virus, then an acute infection caused by the corresponding pathogen is probably present, and further treatment can be given accordingly. On the other hand, the nucleic acids of adeno-, boca-, rhino- or coronaviruses can be found in relatively trivial infections as well as in asymptomatic persons, probably reflecting either a prior infection or a current subclinical one. For children in particular, upper respiratory infections are so common in the winter months that acute and prior infections with these pathogens cannot be distinguished by multiplex PCR. The use of multiplex PCR in children has not been shown to shorten hospital stays or to lessen antibiotic consumption or overall cost. CONCLUSION: The detectability of viral nucleic acids is an important contribution to the diagnostic assessment of children with severe respiratory infection. For these highly sensitive diagnostic tests to be used optimally, primary viral infections must be distinguished from bacterial superinfections.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.231315342,-0.074195274,-0.010130905,0.143904145,-0.011938999,-0.096301949,0.085020008,-0.053341972,0.078396078,0.130023787,-0.004412735,-0.116555806,0.123792782,-0.06059448,0.065457576,-0.053981484,0.021190226,-0.018055559,0.002922123,-0.02361285,-0.057413156,0.000945373,0.004683536,-0.045687479,0.036669165,0.026811282,-0.016546576,-0.068569828,0.034628179,0.012963631
"RNA Virus Population Diversity, an Optimum for Maximal Fitness and Virulence","The ability of an RNA virus to exist as a population of genetically distinct variants permits the virus to overcome events during infections that would otherwise limit virus multiplication or drive the population to extinction. Viral genetic diversity is created by the ribonucleotide misincorporation frequency of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We have identified a poliovirus (PV) RdRp derivative (H273R) possessing a mutator phenotype. GMP misincorporation efficiency for H273R RdRp in vitro was increased by 2–3-fold that manifested in a 2–3-fold increase in the diversity of the H273R PV population in cells. Circular sequencing analysis indicated that some mutations were RdRp-independent. Consistent with the population genetics theory, H273R PV was driven to extinction more easily than WT in cell culture. Furthermore, we observed a substantial reduction in H273R PV virulence, measured as the ability to cause paralysis in the cPVR mouse model. Reduced virulence correlated with the inability of H273R PV to sustain replication in tissues/organs in which WT persists. Despite the attenuated phenotype, H273R PV was capable of replicating in mice to levels sufficient to induce a protective immune response, even when the infecting dose used was insufficient to elicit any visual signs of infection. We conclude that optimal RdRp fidelity is a virulence determinant that can be targeted for viral attenuation or antiviral therapies, and we suggest that the RdRp may not be the only source of mutations in a RNA virus genome.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.129980421,-0.04504309,-0.050585482,0.030415096,-0.038760896,0.011981647,0.081109245,0.005016162,-0.033975011,0.044307698,0.096519317,0.08290437,-0.082327483,-0.015964663,0.003290789,0.008401217,-0.011605608,-0.044798694,-0.063340966,-0.044806936,0.104693501,-0.069762742,0.078529251,0.030577744,-0.020904289,0.051139987,0.048999179,-0.008619588,-0.021364536,-0.006499607
Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Respiratory Viral Infections in the First Year of Life: Association With Acute Otitis Media Development,"Background. Sensitive diagnostic assays have increased the detection of viruses in asymptomatic individuals. The clinical significance of asymptomatic respiratory viral infection in infants is unknown. Methods. High-throughput, quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect 13 common respiratory viruses from nasopharyngeal specimens collected during 2028 visits from 362 infants followed from near birth up to 12 months of age. Specimens were collected at monthly interval (months 1–6 and month 9) and during upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) episodes. Subjects were followed closely for acute otitis media (AOM) development. Results. Viruses were detected in 76% of 394 URTI specimens and 27% of asymptomatic monthly specimens. Rhinovirus was detected most often; multiple viruses were detected in 29% of the specimens. Generalized mixed-model analyses associated symptoms with increasing age and female sex; detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, and adenovirus was highly associated with symptoms. Increasing age was also associated with multiple virus detection. Overall, 403 asymptomatic viral infections in 237 infants were identified. Viral load was significantly higher in URTI specimens than asymptomatic specimens but did not differentiate cases of URTI with and without AOM complication. The rate of AOM complicating URTI was 27%; no AOM occurred following asymptomatic viral infections. AOM development was associated with increasing age and infection with RSV, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, and bocavirus. Conclusions. Compared to symptomatic infection, asymptomatic viral infection in infants is associated with young age, male sex, low viral load, specific viruses, and single virus detection. Asymptomatic viral infection did not result in AOM.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.184037645,-0.088587256,-0.04272453,0.050196196,0.013102298,-0.085509698,0.089703192,-0.051989837,0.073347132,0.037380626,0.022513502,-0.075609469,0.007605078,-0.044739556,0.048151634,-0.006322105,-0.021004808,-0.086559081,0.053021621,-0.036048685,-0.042790877,-0.040498568,-0.056609178,0.037443936,0.056711873,-0.034707339,0.070130819,0.01793029,-0.012090995,-0.034702238
One severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus protein complex integrates processive RNA polymerase and exonuclease activities,"In addition to members causing milder human infections, the Coronaviridae family includes potentially lethal zoonotic agents causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the recently emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome. The ∼30-kb positive-stranded RNA genome of coronaviruses encodes a replication/transcription machinery that is unusually complex and composed of 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). SARS-CoV nsp12, the canonical RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), exhibits poorly processive RNA synthesis in vitro, at odds with the efficient replication of a very large RNA genome in vivo. Here, we report that SARS-CoV nsp7 and nsp8 activate and confer processivity to the RNA-synthesizing activity of nsp12. Using biochemical assays and reverse genetics, the importance of conserved nsp7 and nsp8 residues was probed. Whereas several nsp7 mutations affected virus replication to a limited extent, the replacement of two nsp8 residues (P183 and R190) essential for interaction with nsp12 and a third (K58) critical for the interaction of the polymerase complex with RNA were all lethal to the virus. Without a loss of processivity, the nsp7/nsp8/nsp12 complex can associate with nsp14, a bifunctional enzyme bearing 3′-5′ exoribonuclease and RNA cap N7-guanine methyltransferase activities involved in replication fidelity and 5′-RNA capping, respectively. The identification of this tripartite polymerase complex that in turn associates with the nsp14 proofreading enzyme sheds light on how coronaviruses assemble an RNA-synthesizing machinery to replicate the largest known RNA genomes. This protein complex is a fascinating example of the functional integration of RNA polymerase, capping, and proofreading activities.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.214780024,0.114440845,-0.198552696,0.198007849,-0.029095888,-0.107673911,0.021578783,-0.015085128,-0.055971894,0.038015489,0.11767642,0.063142579,-0.03801323,0.005767054,-0.018522407,0.003253928,0.044550181,-0.075104908,-0.01732872,0.04478499,-0.027680591,0.002042633,0.050244488,-0.058590895,0.026686286,-0.011390352,-0.087213876,0.025951147,0.000653088,-0.018461795
Association of Interleukin-8 and Neutrophils with Nasal Symptom Severity During Acute Respiratory Infection,"Using a large data set (n = 811), the relationship between acute respiratory infection illness severity and inflammatory biomarkers was investigated to determine whether certain symptoms are correlated more closely than others with the inflammatory biomarkers, interleukin-8 (IL-8) and nasal neutrophils. Participants with community acquired acute respiratory infection underwent nasal lavage for IL-8 and neutrophil testing, in addition to multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods for the detection and identification of respiratory viruses. Information about symptoms was obtained throughout the duration of the illness episode using the well-validated Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-21). Global symptom severity was calculated by the area under the curve (AUC) plotting duration versus WURSS total. Of the specimens tested, 56% were positively identified for one or more of nine different respiratory viruses. During acute respiratory infection illness, both IL-8 and neutrophils positively correlate with AUC (r(s) = 0.082, P = 0.022; r(s) = 0.080, P = 0.030). IL-8 and neutrophils correlate with nasal symptom severity: runny nose (r = 0.13, P = <0.00001; r = 0.18, P = <0.003), plugged nose (r = 0.045, P = 0.003; r = 0.14, P = 0.058), and sneezing (r = −0.02, P = <0.0001; r = −0.0055, P = 0.31). Neutrophils correlate with some quality of life measures such as sleeping well (r = 0.15, P = 0.026). Thus, the study demonstrates that IL-8 and neutrophils are correlated with severity of nasal symptoms during acute respiratory infection. Further research is necessary to determine if the concentration of these or other biomarkers can predict the overall duration and severity of acute respiratory infection illness.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.127852401,-0.036679353,-0.047818121,-0.047586979,-0.009321168,-0.031273393,0.031782242,-0.025753189,0.048833317,-0.012053942,-0.006147653,-0.03140732,0.000104667,0.019406834,0.021113461,0.006051351,-0.002404077,-0.08028578,0.036646897,-0.064030719,0.015540819,-0.11948332,-0.035878307,-0.027463624,0.024370265,-0.004478234,-0.020370274,0.012087587,0.050515315,-0.081568698
Clinical and Laboratory Findings of the First Imported Case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus to the United States,"Background. The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was discovered September 2012 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The first US case of MERS-CoV was confirmed on 2 May 2014. Methods. We summarize the clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory and radiologic findings, and MERS-CoV–specific tests. Results. The patient is a 65-year-old physician who worked in a hospital in KSA where MERS-CoV patients were treated. His illness onset included malaise, myalgias, and low-grade fever. He flew to the United States on day of illness (DOI) 7. His first respiratory symptom, a dry cough, developed on DOI 10. On DOI 11, he presented to an Indiana hospital as dyspneic, hypoxic, and with a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest radiography. On DOI 12, his serum tested positive by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for MERS-CoV and showed high MERS-CoV antibody titers, whereas his nasopharyngeal swab was rRT-PCR negative. Expectorated sputum was rRT-PCR positive the following day, with a high viral load (5.31 × 10(6) copies/mL). He was treated with antibiotics, intravenous immunoglobulin, and oxygen by nasal cannula. He was discharged on DOI 22. The genome sequence was similar (>99%) to other known MERS-CoV sequences, clustering with those from KSA from June to July 2013. Conclusions. This patient had a prolonged nonspecific prodromal illness before developing respiratory symptoms. Both sera and sputum were rRT-PCR positive when nasopharyngeal specimens were negative. US clinicians must be vigilant for MERS-CoV in patients with febrile and/or respiratory illness with recent travel to the Arabian Peninsula, especially among healthcare workers.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.157202327,0.32610997,-0.14272928,-0.020879842,-0.000191218,-0.020476656,-0.080399532,0.398139477,0.288891003,-0.011052672,0.054839002,-0.029534278,-0.059002748,0.00289787,0.008483163,-0.036428781,0.011134024,-0.058519115,0.00218066,-0.048914117,-0.010921519,0.010439571,0.048184436,-0.001410695,-0.031949744,-0.014683574,-0.01898049,-0.015873902,-0.015006208,0.035664404
Severity of Rhinovirus Infection in Hospitalized Adults Is Unrelated to Genotype,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether rhinovirus (RV) species is associated with more severe clinical illness in adults. METHODS: Seventy-two RV-positive viral respiratory samples from adult patients were sequenced and analyzed phylogenetically after reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of the region spanning the VP4 gene and 5′ terminus of the VP2 gene. The clinical features and severity of illness associated with the different RV species were compared. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis identified three distinct clusters as RV-A (54%), B (11%), or C (35%) species. In an unadjusted model, patients with RV-B infection were significantly more likely to have the composite outcome variable of death or intensive care unit admission (P = .03), but this effect diminished when controlling for patient sex. A logistic model of the relationship between RV species and adverse outcomes produced nonsignificant odds ratios when controlling for patient sex. CONCLUSIONS: Infection with RV-A or RV-B was associated with greater severity of illness in our adult population; however, the association disappeared after controlling for confounders.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.07887308,-0.01933355,-0.052101769,-0.099235827,0.031035736,-0.024342415,0.016223937,0.018428847,-0.041645381,-0.017570524,-0.042358241,-0.007896233,-0.030411851,0.007067073,-0.034480956,0.013299194,0.005590915,0.018736765,-0.016531584,0.001247052,0.0285043,-0.085153004,-0.040384918,0.041176644,0.009740538,-0.037631809,0.028306087,0.006235028,-0.048238917,0.083114136
Respiratory Syncytial Virus Increases the Virulence of Streptococcus pneumoniae by Binding to Penicillin Binding Protein 1a. A New Paradigm in Respiratory Infection,"Rationale: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Streptococcus pneumoniae are major respiratory pathogens. Coinfection with RSV and S. pneumoniae is associated with severe and often fatal pneumonia but the molecular basis for this remains unclear. Objectives: To determine if interaction between RSV and pneumococci enhances pneumococcal virulence. Methods: We used confocal microscopy and Western blot to identify the receptors involved in direct binding of RSV and pneumococci, the effects of which were studied in both in vivo and in vitro models of infection. Human ciliated respiratory epithelial cell cultures were infected with RSV for 72 hours and then challenged with pneumococci. Pneumococci were collected after 2 hours exposure and changes in gene expression determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Measurements and Main Results: Following incubation with RSV or purified G protein, pneumococci demonstrated a significant increase in the inflammatory response and bacterial adherence to human ciliated epithelial cultures and markedly increased virulence in a pneumonia model in mice. This was associated with extensive changes in the pneumococcal transcriptome and significant up-regulation in the expression of key pneumococcal virulence genes, including the gene for the pneumococcal toxin, pneumolysin. We show that mechanistically this is caused by RSV G glycoprotein binding penicillin binding protein 1a.

Dengue Virus in Bats from Southeastern Mexico,"To identify the relationship between landscape use and dengue virus (DENV) occurrence in bats, we investigated the presence of DENV from anthropogenically changed and unaltered landscapes in two Biosphere Reserves: Calakmul (Campeche) and Montes Azules (Chiapas) in southern Mexico. Spleen samples of 146 bats, belonging to 16 species, were tested for four DENV serotypes with standard reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocols. Six bats (4.1%) tested positive for DENV-2: four bats in Calakmul (two Glossophaga soricina, one Artibeus jamaicensis, and one A. lituratus) and two bats in Montes Azules (both A. lituratus). No effect of anthropogenic disturbance on the occurrence of DENV was detected; however, all three RT-PCR–positive bat species are considered abundant species in the Neotropics and well-adapted to disturbed habitats. To our knowledge, this study is the first study conducted in southeastern Mexico to identify DENV-2 in bats by a widely accepted RT-PCR protocol. The role that bats play on DENV's ecology remains undetermined.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.010130711,0.05586249,0.0731166,-0.018894638,0.19424943,0.082326754,0.199521001,0.056476716,-0.117107113,-0.096348334,-0.064380408,-0.077836437,-0.090186419,0.105435246,-0.049230079,0.08328298,0.059310898,0.050380859,0.012957757,-0.040821048,-0.039209623,0.004164674,-0.011678693,-0.079420185,0.079997175,0.092742484,0.014349304,-0.021386093,0.041048889,0.010998762
Frequency of Acute Respiratory Illnesses and Circulation of Respiratory Viruses in Households With Children Over 3 Surveillance Seasons,"Background. The household has traditionally been the site for studying acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs). Most studies were conducted many years ago, and more broadly sensitive laboratory methods to determine ARI etiology are now available. Methods. We recruited and followed households with children over 3 annual surveillance periods and collected respiratory tract specimens from subjects with reported ARI. Virus etiology was determined by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Results. Individuals in larger households (defined as households with >4 members) and those in households with children aged <5 years had significantly higher ARI frequencies than others. ARI frequency generally declined with increasing age. Virus etiology was most likely to be determined in young children, who were also most likely to have virus coinfection. Overall, 16% of ARIs with 1 virus identified had ≥1 coinfecting virus. Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses were the most frequently identified agents of ARI in all age categories. Influenza virus and adenovirus were less frequently identified but were most likely to cause ARI that required medical attention. Conclusions. Longitudinal studies in families remain a valuable way to study respiratory infections. RT-PCR has increased the sensitivity of virus detection, including coinfecting viruses, and expanded our ability to detect viruses now known to cause ARI.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.162694956,-0.078133003,-0.002562521,0.09468796,0.056732448,-0.035813295,0.02669028,-0.056183329,0.04307146,-0.010770312,0.015962397,-0.031579071,0.013918004,-0.034571611,0.033849379,0.002972186,0.001898371,-0.079914944,0.018268443,-0.042604929,-0.061599922,0.034007766,-0.002517596,0.061690174,0.017051548,0.064302067,0.039512341,0.004649046,0.03793679,-0.065475706
Severe Neutropenia in Dengue Patients: Prevalence and Significance,"Studies on severe neutropenia in dengue are scarce, and its clinical significance is uncertain. We analyzed a cohort of 1,921 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed adult dengue patients admitted to the Communicable Disease Center in Singapore between 2005 and 2008. Time trend analyses for daily absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) were done using Bayesian hierarchical and Markov models. We found that severe neutropenia, defined as ANC ≤ 0.5 × 10(9)/L, was found in 11.8% with a median duration of 1 day. ANC nadir occurred on illness day 5. Severe neutropenia was not predictive of more severe disease and not associated with secondary bacterial infections, prolonged hospital stay, prolonged fever, or fatal outcome. We concluded that prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated in patients with severe neutropenia without indication for bacterial infection.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.083263489,-0.000855573,-0.052427324,-0.10732822,-0.051127847,-0.016044647,-0.003330395,0.030652693,-0.061956427,0.011272381,-0.01745568,0.015751682,-0.018083205,-0.001203873,-0.015073112,0.015708615,-0.020442733,0.044773494,-0.019536267,0.021403949,0.013852904,-0.022196644,-0.048746915,-0.023079026,0.010848114,-0.0008388,0.001684767,0.008560989,-0.001894833,0.010276947
"Preclinical Characterization of BMS-791325, an Allosteric Inhibitor of Hepatitis C Virus NS5B Polymerase","BMS-791325 is an allosteric inhibitor that binds to thumb site 1 of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. BMS-791325 inhibits recombinant NS5B proteins from HCV genotypes 1, 3, 4, and 5 at 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) below 28 nM. In cell culture, BMS-791325 inhibited replication of HCV subgenomic replicons representing genotypes 1a and 1b at 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) of 3 nM and 6 nM, respectively, with similar (3 to 18 nM) values for genotypes 3a, 4a, and 5a. Potency against genotype 6a showed more variability (9 to 125 nM), and activity was weaker against genotype 2 (EC(50), 87 to 925 nM). Specificity was demonstrated by the absence of activity (EC(50)s of >4 μM) against a panel of mammalian viruses, and cytotoxic concentrations (50%) were >3,000-fold above the HCV EC(50). Resistance substitutions selected by BMS-791325 in genotype 1 replicons mostly mapped to a single site, NS5B amino acid 495 (P495A/S/L/T). Additive or synergistic activity was observed in combination studies using BMS-791325 with alfa interferon plus ribavirin, inhibitors of NS3 protease or NS5A, and other classes of NS5B inhibitor (palm site 2-binding or nucleoside analogs). Plasma and liver exposures in vivo in several animal species indicated that BMS-791325 has a hepatotropic disposition (liver-to-plasma ratios ranging from 1.6- to 60-fold across species). Twenty-four hours postdose, liver exposures across all species tested were ≥10-fold above the inhibitor EC(50)s observed with HCV genotype 1 replicons. These findings support the evaluation of BMS-791325 in combination regimens for the treatment of HCV.

Identification of Diverse Alphacoronaviruses and Genomic Characterization of a Novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Like Coronavirus from Bats in China,"Although many severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses (SARS-like CoVs) have been identified in bats in China, Europe, and Africa, most have a genetic organization significantly distinct from human/civet SARS CoVs in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which mediates receptor binding and determines the host spectrum, resulting in their failure to cause human infections and making them unlikely progenitors of human/civet SARS CoVs. Here, a viral metagenomic analysis of 268 bat rectal swabs collected from four counties in Yunnan Province has identified hundreds of sequences relating to alpha- and betacoronaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis based on a conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene revealed that alphacoronaviruses had diversities with some obvious differences from those reported previously. Full genomic analysis of a new SARS-like CoV from Baoshan (LYRa11) showed that it was 29,805 nucleotides (nt) in length with 13 open reading frames (ORFs), sharing 91% nucleotide identity with human/civet SARS CoVs and the most recently reported SARS-like CoV Rs3367, while sharing 89% with other bat SARS-like CoVs. Notably, it showed the highest sequence identity with the S gene of SARS CoVs and Rs3367, especially in the RBD region. Antigenic analysis showed that the S1 domain of LYRa11 could be efficiently recognized by SARS-convalescent human serum, indicating that LYRa11 is a novel virus antigenically close to SARS CoV. Recombination analyses indicate that LYRa11 is likely a recombinant descended from parental lineages that had evolved into a number of bat SARS-like CoVs. IMPORTANCE Although many severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses (SARS-like CoVs) have been discovered in bats worldwide, there are significant different genic structures, particularly in the S1 domain, which are responsible for host tropism determination, between bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS CoVs, indicating that most reported bat SARS-like CoVs are not the progenitors of human SARS CoV. We have identified diverse alphacoronaviruses and a close relative (LYRa11) to SARS CoV in bats collected in Yunnan, China. Further analysis showed that alpha- and betacoronaviruses have different circulation and transmission dynamics in bat populations. Notably, full genomic sequencing and antigenic study demonstrated that LYRa11 is phylogenetically and antigenically closely related to SARS CoV. Recombination analyses indicate that LYRa11 is a recombinant from certain bat SARS-like CoVs circulating in Yunnan Province.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.074918662,0.442023833,-0.260226079,0.028837121,0.264019915,0.108484441,0.129754846,-0.208443026,-0.141247758,-0.058417515,-0.121372641,-0.093329828,-0.015514889,-0.023500024,-0.039027207,0.053228671,-0.004888346,0.047958384,0.017033219,0.022650282,-0.008102806,-0.032617085,0.04993809,-0.011191699,0.011045652,0.007875854,-0.045099592,0.013680908,0.029586574,-0.011957736
Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Host-virus Interactions Reveals a Role for Golgi Brefeldin A Resistance Factor 1 (GBF1) in Dengue Infection,"Dengue virus is considered to be the most important mosquito-borne virus worldwide and poses formidable economic and health care burdens on many tropical and subtropical countries. Dengue infection induces drastic rearrangement of host endoplasmic reticulum membranes into complex membranous structures housing replication complexes; the contribution(s) of host proteins and pathways to this process is poorly understood but is likely to be mediated by protein-protein interactions. We have developed an approach for obtaining high confidence protein-protein interaction data by employing affinity tags and quantitative proteomics, in the context of viral infection, followed by robust statistical analysis. Using this approach, we identified high confidence interactors of NS5, the viral polymerase, and NS3, the helicase/protease. Quantitative proteomics allowed us to exclude a large number of presumably nonspecific interactors from our data sets and imparted a high level of confidence to our resulting data sets. We identified 53 host proteins reproducibly associated with NS5 and 41 with NS3, with 13 of these candidates present in both data sets. The host factors identified have diverse functions, including retrograde Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum transport, biosynthesis of long-chain fatty-acyl-coenzyme As, and in the unfolded protein response. We selected GBF1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor responsible for ARF activation, from the NS5 data set for follow up and functional validation. We show that GBF1 plays a critical role early in dengue infection that is independent of its role in the maintenance of Golgi structure. Importantly, the approach described here can be applied to virtually any organism/system as a tool for better understanding its molecular interactions.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.103361873,-0.045455217,-0.040069601,-0.00757668,-0.077655815,0.032272231,0.06110428,-0.013657585,0.034160984,0.010608973,-0.051834425,-0.008139278,-0.00198211,0.006013832,-0.062818134,-0.038280239,0.05383476,-0.059933361,-0.027832929,0.04799553,-0.06282516,0.047954318,-0.072841101,-0.025678415,0.059808268,0.039193843,0.042456423,-0.047311598,-0.048759624,0.032412132
"Hospital-Associated Outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus: A Serologic, Epidemiologic, and Clinical Description","BACKGROUND: In April 2012, the Jordan Ministry of Health investigated an outbreak of lower respiratory illnesses at a hospital in Jordan; 2 fatal cases were retrospectively confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to be the first detected cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). METHODS: Epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of selected potential cases were assessed through serum blood specimens, medical record reviews, and interviews with surviving outbreak members, household contacts, and healthcare personnel. Cases of MERS-CoV infection were identified using 3 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention serologic tests for detection of anti–MERS-CoV antibodies. RESULTS: Specimens and interviews were obtained from 124 subjects. Seven previously unconfirmed individuals tested positive for anti–MERS-CoV antibodies by at least 2 of 3 serologic tests, in addition to 2 fatal cases identified by rRT-PCR. The case-fatality rate among the 9 total cases was 22%. Six subjects were healthcare workers at the outbreak hospital, yielding an attack rate of 10% among potentially exposed outbreak hospital personnel. There was no evidence of MERS-CoV transmission at 2 transfer hospitals having acceptable infection control practices. CONCLUSIONS: Novel serologic tests allowed for the detection of otherwise unrecognized cases of MERS-CoV infection among contacts in a Jordanian hospital-associated respiratory illness outbreak in April 2012, resulting in a total of 9 test-positive cases. Serologic results suggest that further spread of this outbreak to transfer hospitals did not occur. Most subjects had no major, underlying medical conditions; none were on hemodialysis. Our observed case-fatality rate was lower than has been reported from outbreaks elsewhere.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.147285743,0.257829067,-0.118639322,-0.03896434,-0.021098578,0.027311489,-0.053197777,0.30591275,0.225844856,-0.02192956,0.04800179,-0.010288927,-0.043637927,-0.059455302,0.023466355,-0.011065592,-0.022553065,-0.047581586,-0.023569183,-0.050486872,-0.013783502,0.046848501,-0.020439764,-0.016877486,-0.018874416,0.043675784,0.00193261,0.064358839,-0.042822231,0.025265287
Development and evaluation of a one step reverse transcription-loop mediated isothermal amplification assay (RT-LAMP) for rapid detection of foot and mouth disease virus in India,"A simple, rapid and sensitive diagnostic assay for Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is required for deployment in the field. In this study, development of Reverse Transcription-Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) assay based on the 3D polymerase gene for specific and rapid detection FMD virus (FMDV) was carried out. The assay was optimised with viral RNA extracted from serotype O, A and Asia 1 FMDV vaccine strains, which resulted a reliable amplification at 65 °C for 60 min. The amplified RT-LAMP products were identified by agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining or observation by naked eye for the presence of turbidity and colour change following the addition of hydroxyl naphthol blue (HNB). The specificity of the assay was demonstrated by the absence of amplification of genome extracted from other viruses or cellular origin. With respect to analytical sensitivity the developed RT-LAMP assay was found more sensitive than routinely used multiplex PCR (mPCR). Further, the assay was evaluated with RNA extracted from cell cultured isolates (n = 50), tongue epithelial samples (n = 150) and semen samples from infected bulls (n = 13). In conclusion, RT-LAMP with HNB dye was shown to be simple, specific and sensitive assay for rapid diagnosis of FMDV infection. Further, the assay has the potential for field deployment and use for rapid FMDV surveillance in India.

Lower Respiratory Tract Virus Findings in Mechanically Ventilated Patients With Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia,"Background. The role of viral infections in the etiology of severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) was prospectively evaluated from 2008 to 2012 at a university-level intensive care unit. Methods. Clinical data and microbiological tests were assessed: blood cultures, urine pneumococcal and legionella antigens, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae antibodies from paired serums, and respiratory virus detection by multiplex, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs and lower tracheal specimens via intubation tube. Results. Of 49 mechanically ventilated SCAP patients (21 men and 28 women; median age, 54 years), the etiology was identified in 45 cases (92%). There were 21 pure bacterial infections (43%), 5 probably pure viral infections (10%), and 19 mixed bacterial–viral infections (39%), resulting in viral etiology in 24 patients (49%). Of 26 viruses, 21 (81%) were detected from bronchial specimens and 5 (19%) from nasopharyngeal swabs. Rhinovirus (15 cases, 58%) and adenovirus (4 cases, 15%) were the most common viral findings. The bacterial–viral etiology group had the highest peak C-reactive protein levels (median, 356 [25th–75th percentiles, 294–416], P = .05), whereas patients with probably viral etiology had the lowest peak procalcitonin levels (1.7 [25th–75th percentiles, 1.6–1.7]). The clinical characteristics of pure bacterial and mixed bacterial–viral etiologies were comparable. Hospital stay was longest among the bacterial group (17 vs 14 days; P = .02). Conclusions. Viral findings were demonstrated in almost half of the SCAP patients. Clinical characteristics were similar between the pure bacterial and mixed bacterial–viral infections groups. The frequency of viral detection depends on the availability of PCR techniques and lower respiratory specimens.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.212741162,-0.072425237,-0.069863357,-0.050959179,-0.06991226,-0.107012112,0.00891731,0.059454315,-0.143559009,0.125135174,-0.038884427,-0.061354796,0.027482692,0.021265037,-0.012022044,-0.060289809,0.026914285,-0.008432636,0.006463467,0.017275876,-0.053522198,0.076337997,0.034843651,0.008107109,0.031230869,0.022016296,0.073080123,0.001262133,0.016657659,0.038423423
Prevalence and Molecular Characterization of Human Metapneumovirus in Influenza A Negative Sample in Thailand,"BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) causes respiratory tract infection in influenza‐like illness. The role of hMPV infections in all age groups in Thailand has not yet been investigated. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine prevalence of hMPV infection in all age groups in Thailand during 2011. METHODS: A total of 1,184 nasopharyngeal washes were collected from hospitalized patients and sent to the Department of Microbiology, Siriraj Hospital, for influenza A virus detection. Real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect hMPV infection. Partially, F gene from hMPV positive samples were sequenced and used for genotyping by phylogenetic tree analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of hMPV for all age groups was 6.3%. The highest prevalence of hMPV infection was in children aged <2 years. Of 71 hMPV‐positive patients, three (4.2%) were coinfected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), two with rhinovirus (2.8%), one with coronavirus (1.4%), and one with RSV and adenovirus (1.4%). Phylogenetic analysis of F gene revealed that 96.8% of hMPV detected was subgenotype B1, 1.6% was sublineage A2a, and 1.6% was A2b. Genetic variation of F gene was much conserved. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the prevalence of hMPV subgenotype B1 circulating in Thailand during 2011.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.202725509,-0.11236208,-0.052156877,0.064553708,0.107163392,-0.085771099,0.001768643,-0.130063866,0.17322516,-0.116969286,0.016064419,-0.06966639,-0.142489712,0.02837623,-0.164030836,-0.075921638,-0.019340735,0.278080197,-0.183425266,0.078849966,0.220057774,0.04697716,0.035959573,-0.160332658,-0.092922674,-0.014094364,-0.219973222,-0.135518136,-0.021457384,-0.019808156
The Role of Influenza and Parainfluenza Infections in Nasopharyngeal Pneumococcal Acquisition Among Young Children,"Background. Animal models suggest that influenza infection favors nasopharyngeal acquisition of pneumococci. We assessed this relationship with influenza and other respiratory viruses in young children. Methods. A case-control study was nested within a prospective cohort study of acute respiratory illness (ARI) in Andean children <3 years of age (RESPIRA-PERU study). Weekly household visits were made to identify ARI and obtain nasal swabs for viral detection using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Monthly nasopharyngeal (NP) samples were obtained to assess pneumococcal colonization. We determined whether specific respiratory viral ARI episodes occurring within the interval between NP samples increased the risk of NP acquisition of new pneumococcal serotypes. Results. A total of 729 children contributed 2128 episodes of observation, including 681 pneumococcal acquisition episodes (new serotype, not detected in prior sample), 1029 nonacquisition episodes (no colonization or persistent colonization with the same serotype as the prior sample), and 418 indeterminate episodes. The risk of pneumococcal acquisition increased following influenza-ARI (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02–4.69) and parainfluenza-ARI (AOR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.15–3.01), when compared with episodes without ARI. Other viral infections (respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, and adenovirus) were not associated with acquisition. Conclusions. Influenza and parainfluenza ARIs appeared to facilitate pneumococcal acquisition among young children. As acquisition increases the risk of pneumococcal diseases, these observations are pivotal in our attempts to prevent pneumococcal disease.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.160574137,-0.104571684,-0.049615537,0.035796954,0.016524616,0.015399866,0.014805679,-0.054092141,0.045670845,-0.060117501,0.009263235,-0.005322927,-0.040857836,-0.071758775,0.003784491,0.052581927,-0.054922143,-0.102694988,0.044685259,-0.055068981,-0.120096828,0.034239229,-0.008152313,0.05048156,0.022864328,0.014815028,-0.001938775,-0.070462222,0.004843246,-0.044193451
Comparison of Viral Load in Individuals with and without Asthma during Infections with Rhinovirus,"Rationale: Most virus-induced attacks of asthma are caused by rhinoviruses (RVs). Objectives: To determine whether people with asthma are susceptible to an increased viral load during RV infection. Methods: Seventy-four children (4–18 yr old) were enrolled; 28 with wheezing, 32 with acute rhinitis, and 14 without respiratory tract symptoms. Nasal washes were evaluated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction for RV to judge viral load along with gene sequencing to identify strains of RV. Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, IFN-λ(1), and eosinophil cationic protein in nasal washes, along with blood eosinophil counts and total and allergen-specific IgE in sera, were also evaluated. Similar assessments were done in 24 young adults (16 with asthma, 8 without) who participated in an experimental challenge with RV (serotype 16). Measurements and Main Results: Fifty-seven percent of wheezing children and 56% with acute rhinitis had nasal washes testing positive for RV. The geometric mean of viral loads by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in washes from wheezing children was 2.8-fold lower, but did not differ significantly from children with rhinitis (7,718 and 21,612 copies of viral RNA per microliter nasal wash, respectively; P = 0.48). The odds for wheezing were increased if children who tested positive for RV were sensitized to one or more allergens (odds ratio, 3.9; P = 0.02). Similarly, neither peak nor cumulative viral loads differed significantly in washes from adults with asthma compared with those without asthma during the experimental RV challenge. Conclusions: During acute symptoms, children infected with RV enrolled for wheezing or acute rhinitis had similar viral loads in their nasal washes, as did adults with and without asthma infected with RV-16 experimentally.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.093386915,-0.074693281,-0.050959017,-0.059985654,-0.013442964,-0.086761385,0.04670446,-0.064414284,0.032705654,-0.018415751,-0.002769744,-0.044997069,-0.065439705,-0.010870353,-6.69E-05,0.017208853,-0.003493632,-0.060986581,0.016076968,-0.03485672,-0.044487729,-0.055189968,-0.02890248,0.075417561,-0.023175145,0.057276002,0.003304861,-0.020935864,0.013102835,0.122780269
Incidence and Etiology of Acute Lower Respiratory Tract Infections in Hospitalized Children Younger Than 5 Years in Rural Thailand,"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia remains a leading cause of under-five morbidity and mortality globally. Comprehensive incidence, epidemiologic and etiologic data are needed to update prevention and control strategies. METHODS: We conducted active, population-based surveillance for hospitalized cases of acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI) among children <5 years of age in rural thailand. ALRI cases were systematically sampled for an etiology study that tested nasopharyngeal specimens by polymerase chain reaction; children without ALRI were enrolled as controls from outpatient clinics. RESULTS: We identified 28,543 hospitalized ALRI cases from 2005 to 2010. Among the 49% with chest radiographs, 63% had findings consistent with pneumonia as identified by 2 study radiologists. The hospitalized ALRI incidence rate was 5772 per 100,000 child-years (95% confidence interval: 5707, 5837) and was higher in boys versus girls (incidence rate ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval: 1.35–1.41) and in children 6–23 months of age versus other age groups (incidence rate ratio 1.76, 95% confidence interval: 1.69–1.84). Viruses most commonly detected in ALRI cases were respiratory syncytial virus (19.5%), rhinoviruses (18.7%), bocavirus (12.8%) and influenza viruses (8%). Compared with controls, ALRI cases were more likely to test positive for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3 (P ≤ 0.01 for all). Bloodstream infections, most commonly Streptococcus pneumoniae and nontyphoidal Salmonella, accounted for 1.8% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the high burden of hospitalization for ALRI and the importance of viral pathogens among children in Thailand. Interventions targeting viral pathogens coupled with improved diagnostic approaches, especially for bacteria, are critical for better understanding of ALRI etiology, prevention and control.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.187583139,-0.106358223,-0.081438184,0.00875762,0.015247416,-0.01546118,0.015116087,-0.01426708,-0.000523362,-0.031671839,0.003054239,0.016717785,-0.041615897,-0.093574216,-0.024933413,0.037142199,-0.052773754,-0.038628423,0.002709999,-0.010549291,-0.095911266,0.111047688,0.032045623,0.038205567,0.013730813,0.040045688,0.004062546,-0.009385862,0.009898054,-0.048688212
A Novel Molecular Microbiologic Technique for the Rapid Diagnosis of Microbial Invasion of the Amniotic Cavity and Intra-Amniotic Infection in Preterm Labor with Intact Membranes,"OBJECTIVE: The major challenges in using amniotic fluid (AF) cultivation techniques to diagnose microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC) are: 1) several days are typically required to obtain results, and 2) many organisms implicated in the pathogenesis of human disease are difficult to culture. Here, we compare the performance of AF culture with a novel technique for the diagnosis of MIAC that can provide results within eight hours by combining broad-range real-time polymerase chain reaction with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) to identify and quantify genomic material from bacteria and viruses in AF. METHODS: AF samples obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis from 142 women with preterm labor (PTL) and intact membranes were analyzed using cultivation techniques (aerobic, anaerobic and genital mycoplasmas) as well as PCR/ESI-MS. The prevalence and relative magnitude of intra-amniotic inflammation [AF Interleukin 6 (IL-6) concentration ≥ 2.6 ng/mL], acute histologic chorioamnionitis, spontaneous preterm delivery, and perinatal mortality were examined according to the results of these two tests. RESULTS: 1) The prevalence of MIAC in patients with preterm labor and intact membranes was 7% using standard cultivation techniques and 12% using PCR/ESI-MS; 2) seven of ten patients with positive AF culture also had positive PCR/ESI-MS [≥17 genome equivalents per PCR reaction well (GE/well)] 3) patients with positive PCR/ESI-MS (≥17 GE/well) and negative AF cultures had significantly higher rates of intra-amniotic inflammation and histologic acute chorioamnionitis, shorter intervals to delivery [median (interquartile range-IQR)], and offspring at higher risk of perinatal mortality, than women with both tests negative [90% (9/10) vs. 32% (39/122); (p<0.001); 70% (7/10) vs. 35% (39/112); (p=0.04); 1 (IQR: <1 – 2) days vs. 25 (IQR: 5 – 51) days; (p=0.002); OR: 5.6; 95% CI: 1.4 – 22, respectively]; 5) there were no significant differences in these factors between patients with positive PCR/ESI-MS (≥17 GE/well) who had negative AF cultures compared to those with positive AF cultures; and 6) PCR/ESI-MS detected genomic material from viruses in two patients (1.4%). CONCLUSION: 1) Rapid diagnosis of intra-amniotic infection is possible using PCR/ESI-MS, which can provide results within 8 hours; 2) the combined use of biomarkers of inflammation and PCR/ESI-MS allows for the rapid identification of specific bacteria and viruses in women with preterm labor and intra-amniotic infection; and 3) this approach may allow for administration of timely and specific interventions to reduce morbidity attributed to infection-induced preterm birth.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.071944656,-0.000970247,0.050477063,-0.075045545,-0.033960459,-0.02037902,-0.005352029,0.032673787,-0.075925457,0.018972387,0.004262174,0.001143077,0.00015693,0.029847071,0.000327788,0.01783052,0.019668226,-0.005850232,0.004255622,-0.101207793,-0.005609028,-0.015089778,0.033383591,-0.052790303,-0.034549948,-0.027053115,0.021879887,-0.057333999,-0.018956414,-0.017518168
Reverse Transcription Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Assay for the Detection of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,"The emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the eastern Mediterranean and imported cases to Europe has alerted public health authorities. Currently, detection of MERS-CoV in patient samples is done by real-time RT-PCR. Samples collected from suspected cases are sent to highly-equipped centralized laboratories for screening. A rapid point-of-care test is needed to allow more widespread mobile detection of the virus directly from patient material. In this study, we describe the development of a reverse transcription isothermal Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RT-RPA) assay for the identification of MERS-CoV. A partial nucleocapsid gene RNA molecular standard of MERS-coronavirus was used to determine the assay sensitivity. The isothermal (42°C) MERS-CoV RT-RPA was as sensitive as real-time RT-PCR (10 RNA molecules), rapid (3-7 minutes) and mobile (using tubescanner weighing 1kg). The MERS-CoV RT-RPA showed cross-detection neither of any of the RNAs of several coronaviruses and respiratory viruses affecting humans nor of the human genome. The developed isothermal real-time RT-RPA is ideal for rapid mobile molecular MERS-CoV monitoring in acute patients and may also facilitate the search for the animal reservoir of MERS-CoV.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.086093301,0.446537572,0.118273582,0.15817004,-0.013790069,-0.066545392,-0.017937541,0.404791389,0.294689548,-0.056370379,-0.013520068,-0.005948757,-0.061779594,-0.00845792,-0.07076245,0.048122727,-0.010335688,-0.099481478,0.097637242,0.173632638,0.051881354,0.036924824,0.033451543,0.055243624,-0.054134192,0.026580211,0.054200954,0.012532951,0.054511565,-0.008391407
Molecular detection and genetic characterization of kobuviruses and astroviruses in asymptomatic local pigs in East Africa,"In this study, swine fecal specimens (n = 251) collected from nursing and weaned piglets raised under smallholder production systems were screened for the presence of kobuviruses by RT-PCR. Porcine kobuviruses were detected in 13.1 % (33/251) of the samples. We demonstrated that porcine kobuvirus infections exist in indigenous pigs in Kenya and Uganda and that the prevalence was higher in young piglets than older pigs: nursing piglets (15 %), post-weaning (3-month-old) pigs (17 %), 4-month-old pigs (10 %). Genetic analysis of the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region (690 nt) revealed that kobuviruses circulating in East Africa are diverse, sharing nucleotide sequence identities ranging from 89.7 to 99.1 % and 88 to 92.3 % among them and with known porcine kobuviruses, respectively. The nucleotide sequence identities between our kobuvirus strains and those of human, bovine and canine kobuviruses were 69.4-70.7 %, 73.1-74.4 % and 67-70.7 %, respectively. Additionally, upon sequencing selected samples that showed consistent 720-bp RT-PCR bands while using the same primer set, we detected porcine astroviruses in our samples belonging to type 2 and type 3 mamastroviruses. To our knowledge, this study reports the first detection and molecular analysis of both porcine kobuviruses and astroviruses in an African region. Further studies are required to determine the role of these viruses in gastrointestinal infections of pigs in this region and to determine the genetic diversity of the circulating strains to develop accurate diagnostic tools and implement appropriate control strategies.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.025526623,0.002198538,0.109812312,-0.032354459,0.153831798,-0.009913733,-0.002099511,-0.000330395,-0.032137033,-0.009480738,0.064714005,0.08146881,-0.094506405,0.009947275,0.140750652,-0.144339102,-0.006295567,-0.001128777,-0.008974399,0.010825299,-0.000584359,0.013557042,0.017731209,0.027722994,0.022145028,-0.043674046,-0.00693059,-0.018556418,0.032887806,0.007774075
"A One‐Step RT‐PCR Array for Detection and Differentiation of Zoonotic Influenza Viruses H5N1, H9N2, and H1N1","BACKGROUND: Rapid and comprehensive pathogen identification is crucial in zoonotic influenza diagnosis. METHODS: By optimizing the design of primers and probes and reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) conditions, we achieved simultaneous detection of multiple influenza and zoonotic influenza viruses, including H1N1, H5N1, and H9N2 strains, in a one‐step, quantitative real‐time RT‐PCR array (rRT‐PCR array) of RNA from multiple influenza strains utilizing a single set of conditions for RT‐PCR amplification. The target sequences from all targeted zoonotic influenza viruses were cloned into recombinant RNA virus particles, which were used to evaluate sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of the zoonotic influenza viruses RT‐PCR array. RESULTS: The detection limit of the array was shown to be between 10(0) and 10(1) copies per reaction, and the standard curve demonstrated a linear range from 10 to 10(6) copies. Thus, the analytical sensitivity of this zoonotic influenza viruses RT‐PCR array is 10–100 times higher than conventional RT‐PCR. Specificity of the one‐step zoonotic influenza viruses RT‐PCR array was verified by comparison of results obtained with retroviral‐like particles (RVPs), which contained RNA from isolates of seasonal influenza viruses, zoonotic influenza viruses, and other pathogens known to cause acute respiratory disease. CONCLUSION: The high sensitivity, rapidity, reproducibility, and specificity of this zoonotic influenza viruses rRT‐PCR array has been verified as being sufficient to detect the presence of multiple zoonotic influenza viruses in a single assay. The zoonotic influenza viruses RT‐PCR array might provide rapid identification of emergent zoonotic influenza viruses strains during influenza outbreaks and disease surveillance initiatives.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.110836309,-0.005256245,0.173801005,0.286034367,0.038084671,0.219394833,-0.112834688,0.019307419,-0.068221904,-0.073940907,0.021375805,-0.008710606,0.00083605,0.078291923,-0.005533885,-0.017064382,0.046960246,-0.02349199,-0.017158907,-0.072186873,0.015487353,0.043149081,0.022584101,0.051592937,-0.037833103,-0.013768606,0.012659936,-0.021652385,0.034014685,0.000148368
Apnea in Children Hospitalized With Bronchiolitis,"OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for inpatient apnea among children hospitalized with bronchiolitis. METHODS: We enrolled 2207 children, aged <2 years, hospitalized with bronchiolitis at 16 sites during the winters of 2007 to 2010. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were obtained on all subjects, and real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to test NPA samples for 16 viruses. Inpatient apnea was ascertained by daily chart review, with outcome data in 2156 children (98%). Age was corrected for birth <37 weeks. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify independent risk factors for inpatient apnea. RESULTS: Inpatient apnea was identified in 108 children (5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4%–6%). Statistically significant, independent predictors of inpatient apnea included: corrected ages of <2 weeks (odds ratio [OR] 9.67) and 2 to 8 weeks (OR 4.72), compared with age ≥6 months; birth weight <2.3 kg (5 pounds; OR 2.15), compared with ≥3.2 kg (7 pounds); caretaker report of previous apnea during this bronchiolitis episode (OR 3.63); preadmission respiratory rates of <30 (OR 4.05), 30 to 39 (OR 2.35) and >70 (OR 2.26), compared with 40 to 49; and having a preadmission room air oxygen saturation <90% (OR 1.60). Apnea risk was similar across the major viral pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective, multicenter study of children hospitalized with bronchiolitis, inpatient apnea was associated with younger corrected age, lower birth weight, history of apnea, and preadmission clinical factors including low or high respiratory rates and low room air oxygen saturation. Several bronchiolitis pathogens were associated with apnea, with similar apnea risk across the major viral pathogens.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.089513132,-0.072330866,-0.040840178,-0.058202671,0.000871479,-0.051756065,0.044797976,-0.038161516,0.028514848,-0.043006111,0.006871045,0.01248285,-0.064818914,-0.077780378,-0.017858371,0.064881784,-0.033563814,-0.038080115,0.005385347,-0.023227602,-0.07449267,0.052955945,0.000363292,0.022473305,-0.018226803,-0.003344071,0.001864407,-0.06620923,-0.001259612,-0.003853123
Epidemiology and Clinical Presentation of Parainfluenza Type 4 in Children: A 3-Year Comparative Study to Parainfluenza Types 1–3,"Background. Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are among the most common causes of respiratory tract infections in children. Little is known about the epidemiology and clinical presentation of HPIV type 4. Methods. A retrospective chart review and comparison of patients positive for HPIV types 1–4 by multiplex polymerase chain reaction between 2009 and 2012 at Children's Hospital Colorado was performed. Patients who had only direct fluorescent antibody testing performed or concurrent viral infections were excluded. Results. Of 11 533 samples, 752 (6.5%) were positive for HPIV. After exclusion criteria, 316 samples were included in the study. HPIV-4 had year-round prevalence with biennial peaks in odd-numbered years. HPIV-4 and HPIV-3 had similar clinical presentations. 50.8% and 51.5% of patients with HPIV-3–4 had hypoxia compared to 20.3% and 33.3% of patients with HPIV-1–2 (P < .01). HPIV-1 (23.6%) and HPIV-2 (24.2%) were more associated with stridor than HPIV-3 (6.6%) and HPIV-4 (0%) (P < .01). No patients with HPIV-4 had croup. Patients with HPIV-4 had similar lengths of stay and mortality as those with HPIV-1–3. Conclusions. This is the first large-scale analysis of HPIV-4 clinical and epidemiologic features. HPIV-4 was most similar to HPIV-3 in clinical presentation. HPIV-4 had year-round prevalence with peaks in the autumn of odd-numbered years. HPIV-4 is a common respiratory pathogen capable of causing significant morbidity in children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.080484707,-0.047019835,-0.037990077,-0.065655131,-0.013466536,-0.031015844,0.010565694,0.013796802,-0.01633247,-0.004665717,-0.013941858,0.028214221,-0.017332088,-0.013725363,-0.004644613,0.012272474,-0.003182552,0.018498207,-0.009978736,0.010190534,0.022960237,0.002284521,-0.017178061,-0.006260984,-0.01279343,0.013003258,-0.050399272,0.007421398,-0.006128559,-0.011300836
Role of Human Bocavirus in Upper Respiratory Tract Infections and Acute Otitis Media,"BACKGROUND: Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a newly described parvovirus. HBoV1 has been associated with respiratory infections, including acute otitis media (AOM), but the knowledge on the significance of HBoV1 in upper respiratory tract infections (URI) and AOM in relation to other respiratory viruses is limited. The objective of this study was to compare the rate of detection of HBoV1 to that of other respiratory viruses in specimens from children with URI, with and without AOM complication. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) were collected during URI from healthy children (6–35 months) followed prospectively for 1 year; specimens have been previously analyzed for broad spectrum of respiratory viruses. Archived NPS were analyzed for HBoV1 using a high-throughput, quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. RESULTS: Seven hundred and seven NPS samples collected during URI episodes from 201 children were studied for HBoV1. A total of 94 (47%) children tested positive for HBoV1 DNA during 172 (24%) URI episodes; HBoV1 was present as the only virus in 44 (6%) URI episodes. Overall, 37% of URI episodes were complicated by AOM. Of URI associated with single virus (n = 303), the rate of AOM complicating URI associated with HBoV1 only was 52% (23 of 44); this was a higher AOM rate, compared to that of other respiratory viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Among URI associated with single respiratory virus, HBoV1-URI was commonly associated with AOM complication. The important role of HBoV1 on AOM pathogenesis needs to be studied further.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.086012923,-0.065834536,-0.024252201,-0.023557708,0.023751516,-0.056500293,0.074421614,-0.044509375,0.04656381,0.009024801,0.005355249,-0.016296021,-0.00944143,-0.052700594,0.039500328,0.006241987,-0.024229563,-0.072558863,0.030296879,-0.043610287,-0.026162711,0.020638546,-0.023900654,0.033027672,-0.009568095,0.028820448,-0.042343887,-0.008061601,0.025027946,-0.054528615
Vaccine-derived Mutation in Motif D of Poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase Lowers Nucleotide Incorporation Fidelity,"All viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) have a conserved structural element termed motif D. Studies of the RdRp from poliovirus (PV) have shown that a conformational change of motif D leads to efficient and faithful nucleotide addition by bringing Lys-359 into the active site where it serves as a general acid. The RdRp of the Sabin I vaccine strain has Thr-362 changed to Ile. Such a drastic change so close to Lys-359 might alter RdRp function and contribute in some way to the attenuated phenotype of Sabin type I. Here we present our characterization of the T362I RdRp. We find that the T362I RdRp exhibits a mutator phenotype in biochemical experiments in vitro. Using NMR, we show that this change in nucleotide incorporation fidelity correlates with a change in the structural dynamics of motif D. A recombinant PV expressing the T362I RdRp exhibits normal growth properties in cell culture but expresses a mutator phenotype in cells. For example, the T362I-containing PV is more sensitive to the mutagenic activity of ribavirin than wild-type PV. Interestingly, the T362I change was sufficient to cause a statistically significant reduction in viral virulence. Collectively, these studies suggest that residues of motif D can be targeted when changes in nucleotide incorporation fidelity are desired. Given the observation that fidelity mutants can serve as vaccine candidates, it may be possible to use engineering of motif D for this purpose.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.170558193,-0.040210155,-0.060701778,0.045370606,-0.051337861,-0.007716116,0.077959289,0.003770127,-0.052256858,0.050733761,0.118738925,0.184995013,-0.132315516,-0.095077278,-0.046866638,-0.024589653,0.017401525,-0.06432177,-0.100921388,-0.085981306,0.16648732,-0.112355212,0.12492771,0.040062541,0.00585622,0.106045504,0.03951559,-0.001785667,-0.022159516,-0.033214971
"Respiratory Syncytial Virus Lower Respiratory Disease in Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients: Viral RNA Detection in Blood, Antiviral Treatment, and Clinical Outcomes","Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is associated with severe morbidity. Although RSV RNA has been detected in serum from patients with RSV lower respiratory disease (LRD) after HCT, the association with clinical outcomes has not been well established in multivariable models. Additionally, the role of antiviral treatment in HCT recipients has not been previously analyzed in multivariable models. Methods. We retrospectively identified HCT recipients with virologically confirmed RSV LRD and tested stored plasma/serum samples by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for RSV RNA. Risk factors for RSV RNA detection and the impact of RSV RNA in serum and antiviral therapy on outcomes were analyzed using multivariable Cox models. Results. RSV RNA was detected in plasma or serum from 28 of 92 (30%) patients at a median of 24.5 days following HCT and 2 days following LRD. In multivariable models, neutropenia, monocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and mechanical ventilation increased the risk of plasma/serum RSV RNA detection; lymphopenia and steroid use did not. RSV RNA detection increased the risk of overall mortality in multivariable models (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.09 [P = .02]), whereas treatment with aerosolized ribavirin decreased the risk of overall mortality and pulmonary death (aHR, 0.33 [P = .001] and aHR 0.31 [P = .003], respectively). Conclusions. RSV RNA detection in plasma or serum may be a marker for lung injury and poor outcomes in HCT recipients with RSV LRD. Treatment with aerosolized ribavirin appeared to be protective against overall and pulmonary mortality.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.077469895,-0.079777753,-0.064488594,0.017671477,-0.042357035,-0.087602549,0.024304962,-0.0235274,0.034915543,-0.051868163,0.045339578,-0.048327949,-0.131142055,-0.002514232,-0.085350628,0.016850393,-0.052074608,0.089366564,-0.000916567,-0.005192177,0.005820025,-0.147658032,0.009593381,-0.065339399,0.078916278,-0.203642693,0.222859088,0.041589228,-0.097022205,0.068495106
Viral Pathogens and Acute Lung Injury: Investigations Inspired by the SARS Epidemic and the 2009 H1N1 Influenza Pandemic,"Acute viral pneumonia is an important cause of acute lung injury (ALI), although not enough is known about the exact incidence of viral infection in ALI. Polymerase chain reaction-based assays, direct fluorescent antigen (DFA) assays, and viral cultures can detect viruses in samples from the human respiratory tract, but the presence of the virus does not prove it to be a pathogen, nor does it give information regarding the interaction of viruses with the host immune response and bacterial flora of the respiratory tract. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic provided a better understanding of how viral pathogens mediate lung injury. Although the viruses initially infect the respiratory epithelium, the relative role of epithelial damage and endothelial dysfunction has not been well defined. The inflammatory host immune response to H1N1 infection is a major contributor to lung injury. The SARS coronavirus causes lung injury and inflammation in part through actions on the nonclassical renin angiotensin pathway. The lessons learned from the pandemic outbreaks of SARS coronavirus and H1N1 capture key principles of virally mediated ALI. There are pathogen-specific pathways underlying virally mediated ALI that converge onto a common end pathway resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. In terms of therapy, lung protective ventilation is the cornerstone of supportive care. There is little evidence that corticosteroids are beneficial, and they might be harmful. Future therapeutic strategies may be targeted to specific pathogens, the pathogenetic pathways in the host immune response, or enhancing repair and regeneration of tissue damage.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.058929339,0.055113557,-0.086198538,0.015346039,-0.073413359,0.08936705,0.01924179,-0.103497866,-0.012376704,0.03543291,-0.04251926,-0.047091692,0.062308732,0.03459707,0.036235713,-0.017488456,-0.018339268,-0.044260657,-0.04976424,0.022578665,0.027604155,-0.016441815,-0.044940548,-0.00116788,-0.02254985,-0.027034578,-0.051026195,0.026898128,0.037527537,-0.070848303
Clinical Impact of Human Coronaviruses 229E and OC43 Infection in Diverse Adult Populations,"Background. The incidence and clinical impact of coronavirus (CoV) infection in elderly persons and those with underlying cardiopulmonary disease over a long duration is not well described. We determined the incidence and clinical impact of 229E and OC43 CoV in this population during 4 consecutive winters, and compared illnesses to influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus. Methods. CoV 229E and OC43 were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and serology in 4 adult populations under surveillance for acute respiratory illness during the winters of 1999–2003. Cohorts included healthy young adults, healthy elderly adults, high-risk adults with underlying cardiopulmonary disease, and a hospitalized group. Results. Three hundred ninety-eight CoV infections were identified, with annual infection rates ranging from 2.8% to 26% in prospective cohorts, and prevalence ranging from 3.3% to 11.1% in the hospitalized cohort. The incidence of infections with each strain was similar, although asymptomatic infection and viral coinfection was significantly more common with 229E than OC43 infection. Although the incidence and clinical manifestations were similar for each strain, OC43-infected subjects tended to seek more medical care, as OC43 was twice as common as 229E among the hospitalized cohort. Conclusions. CoV infections in the elderly are frequent, likely causing substantial medical disease burden.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.15086356,0.062866424,-0.139489863,-0.000603934,0.065663502,-0.005899916,0.020605418,0.005474604,0.140547659,-0.034703776,0.000542319,0.070000233,0.092462317,-0.004750955,-0.005949806,0.017543224,-0.015136966,0.012697901,0.001229167,0.0294368,0.012205189,-0.08121595,0.031387688,0.034804791,0.068349098,-0.057548577,-0.009330598,0.037459174,0.001256244,0.048863564
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Gene Expression in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"Although most cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occur in smokers, only a fraction of smokers develop the disease. We hypothesized distinct molecular signatures for COPD and emphysema in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of current and former smokers. To test this hypothesis, we identified and validated PBMC gene expression profiles in smokers with and without COPD. We generated expression data on 136 subjects from the COPDGene study, using Affymetrix U133 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Multiple linear regression with adjustment for covariates (gender, age, body mass index, family history, smoking status, and pack-years) was used to identify candidate genes, and ingenuity pathway analysis was used to identify candidate pathways. Candidate genes were validated in 149 subjects according to multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, which included 75 subjects not previously profiled. Pathways that were differentially expressed in subjects with COPD and emphysema included those that play a role in the immune system, inflammatory responses, and sphingolipid (ceramide) metabolism. Twenty-six of the 46 candidate genes (e.g., FOXP1, TCF7, and ASAH1) were validated in the independent cohort. Plasma metabolomics was used to identify a novel glycoceramide (galabiosylceramide) as a biomarker of emphysema, supporting the genomic association between acid ceramidase (ASAH1) and emphysema. COPD is a systemic disease whose gene expression signatures in PBMCs could serve as novel diagnostic or therapeutic targets.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.015335174,-0.019324646,0.018342359,-0.125331526,-0.051949947,0.033881193,0.014664847,-0.020612944,0.027105713,-0.017565292,-0.081356312,-0.047577011,0.027602223,0.013963325,-0.03512571,-0.013134329,-0.019586981,-0.04021224,-0.037080504,-0.068600665,0.044586779,-0.048485552,0.004749571,0.016229487,-0.056562086,-0.025604185,0.044958314,0.021144203,0.046494588,0.028392359
The Endosomal Pathway and the Golgi Complex Are Involved in the Infectious Bursal Disease Virus Life Cycle,"Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), a double-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Birnaviridae family, causes immunosuppression in chickens. In this study, we defined the localization of IBDV replication complexes based on colocalization analysis of VP3, the major protein component of IBDV ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). Our results indicate that VP3 localizes to vesicular structures bearing features of early and late endocytic compartments located in the juxtanuclear region. Interfering with the endocytic pathway with a dominant negative version of Rab5 after the internalization step leads to a reduction in virus titer. Triple-immunostaining studies between VP3, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase VP1, and viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) showed a well-defined colocalization, indicating that the three critical components of the RNPs colocalize in the same structure, likely representing replication complexes. Interestingly, recombinant expressed VP3 also localizes to endosomes. Employing Golgi markers, we found that VP3-containing vesicles were closely associated with this organelle. Depolymerization of microtubules with nocodazole caused a profound change in VP3 localization, showing a punctate distribution scattered throughout the cytoplasm. However, these VP3-positive structures remained associated with Golgi ministacks. Similarly, brefeldin A (BFA) treatment led to a punctate distribution of VP3, scattered throughout the cytoplasm of infected cells. In addition, analysis of intra- and extracellular viral infective particles after BFA treatment of avian cells suggested a role for the Golgi complex in viral assembly. These results constitute the first study elucidating the localization of IBDV replication complexes (i.e., in endocytic compartments) and establishing a role for the Golgi apparatus in the assembly step of a birnavirus.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.117402773,-0.049041277,-0.033586318,-0.003236999,-0.048655809,-0.003968574,0.015058682,-0.004068256,0.003361344,0.018686703,0.021921248,-0.014467391,-0.018538092,0.045662685,0.013474501,0.016228189,-0.002889058,-0.024876787,-0.015612812,0.025030278,-0.022481435,0.032988499,-0.038722832,-0.035837605,0.005973649,0.002712915,-0.006728209,-0.002211559,-0.037819554,0.026244786
Genetic Characterization of Betacoronavirus Lineage C Viruses in Bats Reveals Marked Sequence Divergence in the Spike Protein of Pipistrellus Bat Coronavirus HKU5 in Japanese Pipistrelle: Implications for the Origin of the Novel Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,"While the novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is closely related to Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV HKU4) and Pipistrellus bat CoV HKU5 (Pi-BatCoV HKU5) in bats from Hong Kong, and other potential lineage C betacoronaviruses in bats from Africa, Europe, and America, its animal origin remains obscure. To better understand the role of bats in its origin, we examined the molecular epidemiology and evolution of lineage C betacoronaviruses among bats. Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5 were detected in 29% and 25% of alimentary samples from lesser bamboo bat (Tylonycteris pachypus) and Japanese pipistrelle (Pipistrellus abramus), respectively. Sequencing of their RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes revealed that MERS-CoV is more closely related to Pi-BatCoV HKU5 in RdRp (92.1% to 92.3% amino acid [aa] identity) but is more closely related to Ty-BatCoV HKU4 in S (66.8% to 67.4% aa identity) and N (71.9% to 72.3% aa identity). Although both viruses were under purifying selection, the S of Pi-BatCoV HKU5 displayed marked sequence polymorphisms and more positively selected sites than that of Ty-BatCoV HKU4, suggesting that Pi-BatCoV HKU5 may generate variants to occupy new ecological niches along with its host in diverse habitats. Molecular clock analysis showed that they diverged from a common ancestor with MERS-CoV at least several centuries ago. Although MERS-CoV may have diverged from potential lineage C betacoronaviruses in European bats more recently, these bat viruses were unlikely to be the direct ancestor of MERS-CoV. Intensive surveillance for lineage C betaCoVs in Pipistrellus and related bats with diverse habitats and other animals in the Middle East may fill the evolutionary gap.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.050148629,0.15740647,-0.081006899,-0.03250101,0.18225054,0.09109744,0.151029407,0.183004934,0.05708732,-0.049073989,-0.052181352,-0.043960071,-0.05698162,-0.005694575,-0.034416806,0.026698232,0.018273553,-0.004235016,-0.007509867,-0.020533277,-0.003484578,-0.012426672,0.053860512,-0.016914359,0.033887971,0.00682495,-0.011267798,-0.003052993,-0.001198538,0.034015798
Rapid detection of human rotavirus using NSP4 gene specific reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay,"The seasonal outbreaks of human rotavirus (RV) infection occur every winter. Most patients are diagnosed clinically by a rapid latex agglutination detection kit or polymerase chain reaction assays for RV from stool samples, but some problems have been reported on the specificity and sensitivity of such rapid detection assays. To ratify these issues, a sensitive, specific, simple, and rapid nucleic acid based diagnostic method is expected to be introduced and the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was developed to detect the RV in human stool samples by incubation at 60 °C for 1 h and amplification was confirmed by electrophoretic laddering, restriction enzyme digestion, and hydroxynapthol blue discoloration. The assay established in this study was found to detect only the RVs and no cross-reaction with other viruses, demonstrating its high specificity. By using serial samples dilution as template, the detection limit of LAMP was 10 times more than that of PCR.

Home Self-Collection of Nasal Swabs for Diagnosis of Acute Respiratory Virus Infections in Children With Cystic Fibrosis,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the importance of respiratory viruses in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) has been limited because of challenges using clinic- or hospital-based diagnostic testing. We conducted a pilot study to assess feasibility of home self- (or parent-) collection of nasal swabs (NS). METHODS: Cystic fibrosis patients aged 6–18 years with new respiratory illness participated. In clinic, a deep nasal flocked swab was collected by research staff and compared with an anterior foam NS obtained after instillation of saline spray. At home, up to 2 self-collections of paired foam NS (with and without saline) were collected and mailed for real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. RESULTS: Paired swabs were collected from 28 patients: 18 sets in clinic (deep nasal vs saline foam NS) and 43 sets at home (saline vs dry foam NS) with 9 (50%) and 35 (81%) virus detections, respectively. Home-collected NS were obtained closer to illness onset, with a mean difference in symptom days of −2.3 between home and clinic collections (95% confidence interval [CI] −3.5, −1.2; P < .001). Rhinovirus comprised 73% of virus detections; the difference in mean PCR cycle threshold values for rhinovirus between swabs collected at home versus clinic was −3.8 (95% CI −6.8, −0.9; P = .014), indicating significantly higher viral load for home-collected swabs. CONCLUSIONS: Home-collected foam NS had a higher positivity rate compared with clinic-collected swabs, likely because collection was closer to illness onset. Home self-collection is feasible and well tolerated for timely respiratory virus diagnosis and provides a novel approach for clinical diagnostics and surveillance of respiratory virus infections among CF patients.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.126085805,-0.03791274,-0.024139867,-0.040380404,-0.004270344,-0.018993654,-0.009808672,0.01066032,-0.038451866,-0.01148886,0.006620877,0.018796104,-0.03643641,-0.021291273,0.010358404,0.032355084,-0.021316626,-0.067531907,0.061679306,-0.072299218,-0.065542037,-0.036104472,-0.03410557,-0.018315331,0.025572429,0.022481171,-0.010019823,-0.055829273,-0.027715211,-0.051475485
Prevention of influenza at Hajj: applications for mass gatherings,"Outbreaks of infectious diseases that spread via respiratory route, e.g. influenza, are common amongst Hajj congregation in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Arabian authority successfully organized the Hajj 2009 amidst fear of pandemic influenza. While severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was rare, the true burden of pandemic influenza at Hajj that year remains speculative. In this article we review the latest evidence on influenza control and discuss our experience of influenza and its prevention at Hajj and possible application to other mass gatherings. Depending on study design the attack rate of seasonal influenza at Hajj has ranged from 6% in polymerase chain reaction or culture confirmed studies to 38% in serological surveillance. No significant effect of influenza vaccine or the use of personal protective measures against influenza has been established from observational studies, although the uptake of the vaccine and adherence to face masks and hand hygiene has been low. In all, there is a relatively poor evidence base for control of influenza. Until better evidence is obtained, vaccination coupled with rapid antiviral treatment of symptomatic individuals remains the mainstay of prevention at Hajj and other mass gatherings. Hajj pilgrimage provides a unique opportunity to test the effectiveness of various preventive measures that require a large sample size, such as testing the efficacy of plain surgical masks against laboratory-confirmed influenza. After successful completion of a pilot trial conducted among Australian pilgrims at the 2011 Hajj, a large multinational cluster randomized controlled trial is being planned.

The Unexpected Roles of Eukaryotic Translation Elongation Factors in RNA Virus Replication and Pathogenesis,"SUMMARY: The prokaryotic translation elongation factors were identified as essential cofactors for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of the bacteriophage Qβ more than 40 years ago. A growing body of evidence now shows that eukaryotic translation elongation factors (eEFs), predominantly eEF1A, acting in partially characterized complexes sometimes involving additional eEFs, facilitate virus replication. The functions of eEF1A as a protein chaperone and an RNA- and actin-binding protein enable its “moonlighting” roles as a virus replication cofactor. A diverse group of viruses, from human immunodeficiency type 1 and West Nile virus to tomato bushy stunt virus, have adapted to use eEFs as cofactors for viral transcription, translation, assembly, and pathogenesis.

Low Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Level and Risk of Upper Respiratory Tract Infection in Children and Adolescents,"Background. Vitamin D may be important for immune function. Studies to date have shown an inconsistent association between vitamin D and infection with respiratory viruses. The purpose of this study was to determine if serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) was associated with laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children. Methods. Serum 25(OH)D levels were measured at baseline and children from Canadian Hutterite communities were followed prospectively during the respiratory virus season. Nasopharyngeal specimens were obtained if symptoms developed and infections were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction. The association between serum 25(OH)D and time to laboratory-confirmed viral RTI was evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results. Seven hundred forty-three children aged 3–15 years were followed between 22 December 2008 and 23 June 2009. The median serum 25(OH)D level was 62.0 nmol/L (interquartile range, 51.0–74.0). A total of 229 participants (31%) developed at least 1 laboratory-confirmed viral RTI. Younger age and lower serum 25(OH)D levels were associated with increased risk of viral RTI. Serum 25(OH)D levels <75 nmol/L increased the risk of viral RTI by 50% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10–2.07, P = .011) and levels <50 nmol/L increased the risk by 70% (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.16–2.40, P = .006). Conclusions. Lower serum 25(OH)D levels were associated with increased risk of laboratory-confirmed viral RTI in children from Canadian Hutterite communities. Interventional studies evaluating the role of vitamin D supplementation to reduce the burden of viral RTIs are warranted.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.108838861,-0.069055023,-0.05380898,-0.062496917,-0.028714271,-0.041534967,0.036483956,-0.028850295,0.023168141,-0.04067679,0.011932339,0.005194046,-0.050819056,-0.013098993,-0.025367795,0.044948675,-0.040883883,-0.053833164,0.014761325,-0.033341573,-0.084165841,0.039139275,-0.001054918,0.033251817,-0.040950093,-0.002068408,0.001877982,-0.116890964,-0.029759815,-0.0086998
"1918 Influenza Virus Hemagglutinin (HA) and the Viral RNA Polymerase Complex Enhance Viral Pathogenicity, but Only HA Induces Aberrant Host Responses in Mice","The 1918 pandemic influenza virus was the most devastating infectious agent in human history, causing fatal pneumonia and an estimated 20 to 50 million deaths worldwide. Previous studies indicated a prominent role of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene in efficient replication and high virulence of the 1918 virus in mice. It is, however, still unclear whether the high replication ability or the 1918 influenza virus HA gene is required for 1918 virus to exhibit high virulence in mice. Here, we examined the biological properties of reassortant viruses between the 1918 virus and a contemporary human H1N1 virus (A/Kawasaki/173/2001 [K173]) in a mouse model. In addition to the 1918 influenza virus HA, we demonstrated the role of the viral RNA replication complex in efficient replication of viruses in mouse lungs, whereas only the HA gene is responsible for lethality in mice. Global gene expression profiling of infected mouse lungs revealed that the 1918 influenza virus HA was sufficient to induce transcriptional changes similar to those induced by the 1918 virus, despite difference in lymphocyte gene expression. Increased expression of genes associated with the acute-phase response and the protein ubiquitination pathway were enriched during infections with the 1918 and 1918HA/K173 viruses, whereas reassortant viruses bearing the 1918 viral RNA polymerase complex induced transcriptional changes similar to those seen with the K173 virus. Taken together, these data suggest that HA and the viral RNA polymerase complex are critical determinants of Spanish influenza pathogenesis, but only HA, and not the viral RNA polymerase complex and NP, is responsible for extreme host responses observed in mice infected with the 1918 influenza virus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.061546442,-0.09381994,-0.038504228,0.084121116,-0.03438701,0.157150281,-0.05119555,-0.025117496,0.010432747,-0.022857228,-0.017027399,-0.044879912,0.002142609,0.063177948,0.010352849,0.016536563,0.00257523,-0.058392539,-0.033656204,0.033072708,0.037554472,0.007275118,0.010833721,0.046732292,-0.037190627,0.002968127,0.003744503,-0.009171277,-0.02672951,-0.012083123
The PA-Gene-Mediated Lethal Dissemination and Excessive Innate Immune Response Contribute to the High Virulence of H5N1 Avian Influenza Virus in Mice,"Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus remains a substantial threat to public health. To understand the molecular basis and host mechanism for the high virulence of H5N1 viruses in mammals, we compared two H5N1 isolates which have similar genetic backgrounds but greatly differ in their virulence in mice. A/Chicken/Jiangsu/k0402/2010 (CK10) is highly pathogenic, whereas A/Goose/Jiangsu/k0403/2010 (GS10) is nonpathogenic. We first showed that CK10 elicited a more potent innate immune response than did GS10 in mouse lungs by increasing the number and expression levels of activated genes. We then generated a series of reassortants between the two viruses and evaluated their virulence in mice. Inclusion of the CK10 PA gene in the GS10 background resulted in a dramatic increase in virulence. Conversely, expression of the GS10 PA gene in the CK10 background significantly attenuated the virulence. These results demonstrated that the PA gene mainly determines the pathogenicity discrepancy between CK10 and GS10 in mice. We further determined that arginine (R) at position 353 of the PA gene contributes to the high virulence of CK10 in mice. The reciprocal substitution at position 353 in PA or the exchange of the entire PA gene largely caused the transfer of viral phenotypes, including virus replication, polymerase activity, and manipulation of the innate response, between CK10 and GS10. We therefore defined a novel molecular marker associated with the high virulence of H5N1 influenza viruses, providing further insights into the pathogenesis of H5N1 viruses in mammals.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.059503791,-0.060917327,-0.002292324,-0.012600181,-0.014056085,0.166154928,-0.005304419,-0.025474533,0.04181961,-0.005791434,-0.047176001,-0.033585013,-0.008857237,0.040573363,-0.013427744,-0.009529227,-0.021189991,-0.057839809,-0.049220473,-0.00423617,0.072587279,-0.003831987,0.023610104,0.086509138,-0.065748842,0.00013825,0.051203314,-0.008128761,-0.00145766,-0.039310278
Evaluation of the FilmArray(®) Respiratory Panel for Clinical Use in a Large Children's Hospital,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory pathogens are a leading cause of hospital admission and traditional detection methods are time consuming and insensitive. Multiplex molecular detection methods have recently been investigated in hope of replacing these traditional techniques with rapid panel‐based testing. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the FilmArray(®) Respiratory Panel ([FARP], Idaho Technology Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) as a replacement for direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing in a pediatric hospital. METHODS: Eleven of the 21 FARP analytes (Adenovirus, Bordetella pertussis, human Metapneumovirus, Influenza A, Influenza A H1N1 2009, Influenza B, Parainfluenza [1, 2, & 3], Respiratory Syncytial Virus, and rhinovirus) were evaluated using nasopharyngeal specimens. Positive samples were pooled in groups of 5. Samples identified by reference methods as positive for respiratory pathogens were used for the majority of positive samples. DFA was the reference method for ten analytes; Luminex(TM) xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) was the reference method for rhinovirus. Discrepant results were resolved by positive culture and fluorescent antibody stain and/or laboratory‐developed real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays (LDT). RESULTS: The agreement for most analytes was in concordance with the established reference methods with the exception of Adenovirus. Additionally, the FARP detected several pathogens not previously detected by DFA, and most were confirmed by LDT. Several DFA‐positive analytes were confirmed as true‐negatives by the FARP and LDT. CONCLUSION: FARP overall performed better than DFA with the exception of Adenovirus, making the FARP an attractive alternative to laboratories looking to replace DFA with a rapid, user‐friendly, multiplex molecular assay.

An investigation into the association between cpb2-encoding Clostridium perfringens type A and diarrhea in neonatal piglets,"To investigate the possible role of cpb2-positive type A Clostridium perfringens in neonatal diarrheal illness in pigs, the jejunum and colon of matched normal and diarrheic piglets from 10 farms with a history of neonatal diarrhea were examined grossly and by histopathology, and tested for C. perfringens, for C. perfringens beta2 (CPB2) toxin, as well as for Clostridium difficile toxins, Salmonella, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, rotavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus, and coccidia. Clostridium perfringens isolates were tested using a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine the presence of cpa, consensus and atypical cpb2, and other virulence-associated genes. The numbers of C. perfringens in the intestinal contents were lower in diarrheic piglets (log(10) 5.4 CFU/g) compared with normal piglets (log(10) 6.5 CFU/g) (P < 0.05). The consensus cpb2 was present in 93% of isolates in each group, but atypical cpb2 was less common (56% healthy, 32% diarrheic piglets isolates, respectively, P < 0.05). The presence of CPB2 toxin in the intestinal contents of normal and diarrheic piglets did not differ significantly. Clostridium difficile toxins and rotavirus were each detected in 7 of the 21 (33%) diarrheic piglets. Rotavirus, C. difficile toxins, Salmonella, or enterotoxigenic E. coli were concurrently recovered in different combinations in 4 diarrheic piglets. The cause of diarrhea in 8 of the 21 (38%) piglets on 6 farms remained unknown. The etiological diagnosis of diarrhea could not be determined in any of the piglets on 2 of the farms. This study demonstrated that the number of cpb2-positive type A C. perfringens in the intestinal contents was not a useful approach for making a diagnosis of type A C. perfringens enteritis in piglets. Further work is required to confirm whether cpb2-carrying type A C. perfringens have a pathogenic role in enteric infection in neonatal swine.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.005806062,-0.015832747,0.056285113,-0.119038436,0.020296559,0.025494855,0.007761603,-0.016963103,-0.01289827,-0.017503225,0.025476068,0.048678932,-0.077721535,-0.010290741,0.103658724,-0.055761064,-0.016943293,-0.005819035,-0.000730937,-0.007914771,0.000478438,0.007178832,-0.006304308,-0.003149984,0.024652923,-0.048798842,-0.036287955,-0.023603132,0.006958836,-0.023798927
ADP Ribosylation Factor 1 Plays an Essential Role in the Replication of a Plant RNA Virus,"Eukaryotic positive-strand RNA viruses replicate using the membrane-bound replicase complexes, which contain multiple viral and host components. Virus infection induces the remodeling of intracellular membranes. Virus-induced membrane structures are thought to increase the local concentration of the components that are required for replication and provide a scaffold for tethering the replicase complexes. However, the mechanisms underlying virus-induced membrane remodeling are poorly understood. RNA replication of red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV), a positive-strand RNA plant virus, is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, and ER morphology is perturbed in RCNMV-infected cells. Here, we identified ADP ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) in the affinity-purified RCNMV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase fraction. Arf1 is a highly conserved, ubiquitous, small GTPase that is implicated in the formation of the coat protein complex I (COPI) vesicles on Golgi membranes. Using in vitro pulldown and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses, we showed that Arf1 interacted with the viral p27 replication protein within the virus-induced large punctate structures of the ER membrane. We found that inhibition of the nucleotide exchange activity of Arf1 using the inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA) disrupted the assembly of the viral replicase complex and p27-mediated ER remodeling. We also showed that BFA treatment and the expression of dominant negative Arf1 mutants compromised RCNMV RNA replication in protoplasts. Interestingly, the expression of a dominant negative mutant of Sar1, a key regulator of the biogenesis of COPII vesicles at ER exit sites, also compromised RCNMV RNA replication. These results suggest that the replication of RCNMV depends on the host membrane traffic machinery.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.18887722,-0.07201181,-0.078093408,0.064409689,-0.084749606,-0.032649459,0.022639151,0.007799844,0.003082532,0.004406137,0.032739674,-0.021502604,-0.037072956,0.125702236,0.000912873,0.014667416,0.041007234,-0.073131937,0.005588741,0.048773909,-0.055097252,0.047762105,-0.056867577,-0.076916467,0.022517157,-0.009840649,-0.040308472,0.009072931,-0.070011775,-0.002865291
Antivirals in seasonal and pandemic influenza—future perspectives,"Please cite this paper as: Wathen et al. (2012) Antivirals in seasonal and pandemic influenza—future perspectives. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 7(Suppl. 1), 76–80. Antiviral drugs continue to be an important option for the treatment of influenza disease and will likely be the only option during the early phases of pandemic. However, the limited number of drug classes licensed for treatment of influenza raises several issues, particularly in the face of drug resistance. Two classes of drugs are presently licensed for treatment of influenza, M2 and neuraminidase inhibitors. M2 inhibitors are currently not recommended for treatment of influenza because of widespread resistance and resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has been observed during the past influenza seasonal outbreaks. Additional antiviral drugs with novel mechanisms of action are clearly needed for the treatment of influenza. Fortunately, the landscape of drugs in early and advanced development has dramatically increased over the last 5 years. Drugs targeting viral functions such as attachment, entry/fusion, transcription, and polymerase and drugs targeting host factors affecting viral replication are currently in clinical trials. Examples of these novel antiviral drugs and the challenges for influenza antiviral drug development are discussed in this article.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.02716617,-0.088167257,-0.06143958,0.177002886,-0.153526889,0.385872327,-0.011773301,0.005228834,0.030807416,-0.023674826,0.015270322,0.046161588,0.06524969,-0.031033473,-0.002442924,-0.002981748,-0.039661319,0.170928531,0.048682622,0.045624909,-0.012744581,0.044270731,-0.076540568,0.076372845,0.037922153,-0.0016146,0.045261857,-0.084362702,0.178211581,0.057750744
Targeting virulence mechanisms for the prevention and therapy of arenaviral hemorrhagic fever,"A number of arenaviruses are pathogenic for humans, but they differ significantly in virulence. Lassa virus, found in West Afri ca, causes severe hemorrhagic fever (HF), while the other principal Old World arenavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, causes mild illness in persons with normal immune function, and poses a threat only to immunocompromised individuals. The New World agents, including Junin, Machupo and Sabia virus, are highly pathogenic for humans. Arenaviral HF is characterized by high viremia and general immune suppression, the mechanism of which is unknown. Studies using viral reverse genetics, cell-based assays, animal models and human genome-wide association analysis have revealed potential mechanisms by which arenaviruses cause severe disease in humans. Each of the four viral gene products (GPC, L polymerase, NP, and Z matrix protein) and several host-cell factors (e.g., α-dystroglycan) are responsible for mediating viral entry, genome replication, and the inhibition of apoptosis, translation and interferon-beta (IFNβ) production. This review summarizes current knowledge of the role of each viral protein and host factor in the pathogenesis of arenaviral HF.

Comparison of the Etiology of Viral Respiratory Illnesses in Inner-City and Suburban Infants,"Background. The risk of developing childhood asthma has been linked to the severity and etiology of viral respiratory illnesses in early childhood. Since inner-city infants have unique environmental exposures, we hypothesized that patterns of respiratory viral infections would also be distinct. Methods. We compared the viral etiology of respiratory illnesses in 2 groups: a cohort of 515 infants from 4 inner-city areas and a cohort of 285 infants from mainly suburban Madison, Wisconsin. Nasal secretions were sampled during periods of respiratory illness and at 1 year of age and were analyzed for viral pathogens by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Results. Overall, inner-city infants had lower rates of viral detection. Considering specific viruses, sick urban infants had lower rates of detectable rhinovirus or respiratory syncytial virus infection and higher rates of adenovirus infection. Every urban site had a higher proportion of adenovirus-positive samples associated with illnesses (10%–21%), compared with Madison (6%). Conclusions. These findings provide evidence that inner-city babies have different patterns of viral respiratory illnesses than babies who grow up in a more suburban location. These findings raise important questions about the etiology of virus-negative illnesses in urban infants and the possibility of long-term consequences of early life infections with adenovirus in this population.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.129552343,-0.083611177,-0.056384633,0.005035436,0.010213556,-0.061932924,0.072928573,-0.029750859,0.036190513,0.035342655,0.012909241,-0.050780541,0.006204526,-0.032336847,0.073572494,0.012006228,0.016917259,-0.077876949,0.054538725,-0.010835553,-0.031246128,-0.086623439,-0.079124156,0.0304374,0.061126468,-0.02340207,0.015161599,0.021000409,-0.002037985,-0.040677767
p33-Independent Activation of a Truncated p92 RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase of Tomato Bushy Stunt Virus in Yeast Cell-Free Extract,"Plus-stranded RNA viruses replicate in membrane-bound structures containing the viral replicase complex (VRC). A key component of the VRC is the virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which should be activated and incorporated into the VRC after its translation. To study the activation of the RdRp of Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV), a small tombusvirus of plants, we used N-terminal truncated recombinant RdRp, which supported RNA synthesis in a cell-free yeast extract-based assay. The truncated RdRp required a cis-acting RNA replication element and soluble host factors, while unlike the full-length TBSV RdRp, the truncated RdRp did not need the viral p33 replication cofactor or cellular membranes for RNA synthesis. Interestingly, the truncated RdRp used 3′-terminal extension for initiation and terminated prematurely at an internal cis-acting element. However, the truncated RdRp could perform de novo initiation on a TBSV plus-strand RNA template in the presence of the p33 replication cofactor, cellular membranes, and soluble host proteins. Altogether, the data obtained with the truncated RdRp indicate that this RdRp still requires activation, but with the participation of fewer components than with the full-length RdRp, making it suitable for future studies on dissection of the RdRp activation mechanism.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.248077925,-0.047648977,-0.110768691,0.157405038,-0.069563357,-0.091307885,0.079070016,0.029058618,-0.081593255,0.041847736,0.142333418,0.146278593,-0.131910755,0.000294715,-0.057705372,-0.006735953,0.070822211,-0.085277372,-0.029537631,-0.058285314,0.038943303,-0.023361695,0.058963602,-0.106477098,0.015548309,0.031945646,-0.00261196,0.044415577,0.053516369,0.078942889
Inclusion Bodies Are a Site of Ebolavirus Replication,"Inclusion bodies are a characteristic feature of ebolavirus infections in cells. They contain large numbers of preformed nucleocapsids, but their biological significance has been debated, and they have been suggested to be aggregates of viral proteins without any further biological function. However, recent data for other viruses that produce similar structures have suggested that inclusion bodies might be involved in genome replication and transcription. In order to study filovirus inclusion bodies, we fused mCherry to the ebolavirus polymerase L, which is found in inclusion bodies. The resulting L-mCherry fusion protein was functional in minigenome assays and incorporated into virus-like particles. Importantly, L-mCherry fluorescence in transfected cells was readily detectable and distributed in a punctate pattern characteristic for inclusion bodies. A recombinant ebolavirus encoding L-mCherry instead of L was rescued and showed virtually identical growth kinetics and endpoint titers to those for wild-type virus. Using this virus, we showed that the onset of inclusion body formation corresponds to the onset of viral genome replication, but that viral transcription occurs prior to inclusion body formation. Live-cell imaging further showed that inclusion bodies are highly dynamic structures and that they can undergo dramatic reorganization during cell division. Finally, by labeling nascent RNAs using click technology we showed that inclusion bodies are indeed the site of viral RNA synthesis. Based on these data we conclude that, rather than being inert aggregates of nucleocapsids, ebolavirus inclusion bodies are in fact complex and dynamic structures and an important site at which viral RNA replication takes place.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.10739303,-0.049852394,-0.01959288,-0.001663725,-0.046728471,-0.000460935,0.011681239,-0.008671241,0.012283023,0.004708142,-0.006536175,-0.023578031,0.003152258,0.026785972,0.020663035,0.008797627,-0.000913403,-0.030291564,-0.018637042,0.016020132,-0.002863418,0.018976606,-0.024299784,-0.017748747,0.014840188,0.005801126,-0.000921345,0.007040457,-0.040086014,-0.001578471
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Replication Inhibitor That Interferes with the Nucleic Acid Unwinding of the Viral Helicase,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious disease, caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), for which there are no approved treatments. We report the discovery of a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV that blocks replication by inhibiting the unwinding activity of the SARS-CoV helicase (nsp13). We used a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based helicase assay to screen the Maybridge Hitfinder chemical library. We identified and validated a compound (SSYA10-001) that specifically blocks the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and dsDNA unwinding activities of nsp13, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) of 5.70 and 5.30 μM, respectively. This compound also has inhibitory activity (50% effective concentration [EC(50)] = 8.95 μM) in a SARS-CoV replicon assay, with low cytotoxicity (50% cytotoxic concentration [CC(50)] = >250 μM), suggesting that the helicase plays a still unidentified critical role in the SARS-CoV life cycle. Enzyme kinetic studies on the mechanism of nsp13 inhibition revealed that SSYA10-001 acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of nsp13 with respect to nucleic acid and ATP substrates. Moreover, SSYA10-001 does not affect ATP hydrolysis or nsp13 binding to the nucleic acid substrate. SSYA10-001 did not inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) helicase, other bacterial and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, or reverse transcriptase. These results suggest that SSYA10-001 specifically blocks nsp13 through a novel mechanism and is less likely to interfere with the functions of cellular enzymes that process nucleic acids or ATP. Hence, it is possible that SSYA10-001 inhibits unwinding by nsp13 by affecting conformational changes during the course of the reaction or translocation on the nucleic acid. SSYA10-001 will be a valuable tool for studying the specific role of nsp13 in the SARS-CoV life cycle, which could be a model for other nidoviruses and also a candidate for further development as a SARS antiviral target.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.077539279,0.297603433,-0.168838093,0.032408685,-0.105798414,0.017755736,0.014755583,-0.165327749,-0.014240164,0.007733536,0.009542643,0.034840206,-0.015133194,-0.052264723,-0.021293061,0.016097718,-0.009878932,0.050194448,0.094701859,-0.011500361,-0.053257233,-0.013048571,0.056619169,0.007871599,0.005712555,-0.009499969,-0.063928005,0.016845995,0.00257343,0.0093377
Prospective Multicenter Study of Children With Bronchiolitis Requiring Mechanical Ventilation,"OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and/or intubation for children with bronchiolitis. METHODS: We performed a 16-center, prospective cohort study of hospitalized children aged <2 years with bronchiolitis. For 3 consecutive years from November 1 until March 31, beginning in 2007, researchers collected clinical data and a nasopharyngeal aspirate from study participants. We oversampled children from the ICU. Samples of nasopharyngeal aspirate were tested by polymerase chain reaction for 18 pathogens. RESULTS: There were 161 children who required CPAP and/or intubation. The median age of the overall cohort was 4 months; 59% were male; 61% white, 24% black, and 36% Hispanic. In the multivariable model predicting CPAP/intubation, the significant factors were: age <2 months (odds ratio [OR] 4.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7–11.5), maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1–1.9), birth weight <5 pounds (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.0–2.6), breathing difficulty began <1 day before admission (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2–2.1), presence of apnea (OR 4.8; 95% CI 2.5–8.5), inadequate oral intake (OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.3–4.3), severe retractions (OR 11.1; 95% CI 2.4–33.0), and room air oxygen saturation <85% (OR 3.3; 95% CI 2.0–4.8). The optimism-corrected c-statistic for the final model was 0.80. CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter study of children hospitalized with bronchiolitis, we identified several demographic, historical, and clinical factors that predicted the use of CPAP and/or intubation, including children born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy. We also identified a novel subgroup of children who required mechanical respiratory support <1 day after respiratory symptoms began.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.192559884,-0.110964709,-0.097923909,-0.075875975,0.026051901,-0.086398929,0.022209825,-0.072065042,0.020199622,-0.138391317,0.016325145,0.074969944,-0.132814327,-0.131658358,-0.09750393,0.16293931,-0.117091079,-0.102492098,0.055418399,-0.048673608,-0.260555128,0.169677058,0.043039182,0.087696598,-0.025694254,-0.029519224,-0.015060292,-0.28555868,-0.069476035,-0.034074438
The potential anticancer activity of extracts derived from the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis on human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells,"Various herb products derived from plants have potent biological effects including anticancer activity. In the present study, the antitumor activity of a herbal product derived from the Scutellaria baicalensis (S. baicalensis) was examined, using in vitro assays in a human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell line. Results showed that S. baicalensis root extract at the concentration of 100 μg/ml inhibited monolayer- and anchorage-independent growth in human OSCC cell lines, while not affecting the adhering abilities of cells. This suggested that it did not alter the expression of any of the adhesion receptors that mediate cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. The S. baicalensis root extract demonstrated potent cytostatic and apoptotic effects due to the downregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 expression and its partner cyclin D1, resulting in G1 arrest and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Additionally, the S. baicalensis root extract was found to have blocked vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced migration and tube formation in human endothelial cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that as a herbal product, the S. baicalensis root extract is a potential inhibitor of tumori- and angiogenesis and may be valuable in the development of pharmaceutical medications for the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.098173397,-0.033117189,-0.003710746,-0.091722279,-0.104119497,0.066300482,0.049817703,-0.052707309,0.078819314,-0.032964906,-0.066151891,-0.016595405,-0.003741859,0.094799098,-0.012582427,0.005879949,0.008009196,-0.014356659,0.028141862,-0.041850946,0.031899346,-0.007013288,0.048134974,-0.001373977,0.001975195,0.041709,-0.029690645,0.057642555,-0.001444409,-0.059815733
"Respiratory virus laboratory pandemic planning and surveillance in central Viet Nam, 2008–2010","INTRODUCTION: Laboratory capacity is needed in central Viet Nam to provide early warning to public health authorities of respiratory outbreaks of importance to human health, for example the outbreak of influenza A(H1N1) pandemic in 2009. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedures established as part of a capacity-building process were used to conduct prospective respiratory surveillance in a region where few previous studies have been undertaken. METHODS: Between October 2008 and September 2010, nose and throat swabs from adults and children (approximately 20 per week) presenting with an acute respiratory illness to the Ninh Hoa General Hospital were collected. Same-day PCR testing and result reporting for 13 respiratory viruses were carried out by locally trained scientists. RESULTS: Of 2144 surveillance samples tested, 1235 (57.6%) were positive for at least one virus. The most common were influenza A strains (17.9%), with pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 and seasonal H3N2 strain accounting for 52% and 43% of these, respectively. Other virus detections included: rhinovirus (12.4%), enterovirus (8.9%), influenza B (8.3%), adenovirus (5.3%), parainfluenza (4.7%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (3.9%), human coronavirus (3.0%) and human metapneumovirus (0.3%). The detection rate was greatest in the 0–5 year age group. Viral co-infections were identified in 148 (6.9%) cases. DISCUSSION: The outbreak in 2009 of the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic strain provided a practical test of the laboratory’s pandemic plan. This study shows that the availability of appropriate equipment and molecular-based testing can contribute to important individual and public health outcomes in geographical locations susceptible to emerging infections.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.244929019,-0.08586092,-0.039792962,0.206431099,0.050610758,0.210645732,-0.115024464,-0.008673891,0.019277487,-0.052657639,0.014807877,0.00233951,0.039609377,-0.06398278,0.048338365,-0.031830604,-0.008093386,-0.013235196,-0.006446305,-0.059812199,0.029665986,-0.024749935,-0.04210565,-0.053002678,-0.014122689,0.041780693,-0.020127031,0.081222752,0.00359982,0.021865137
S1 gene sequence analysis of new variant isolates of avian infectious bronchitis virus in Tunisia,"PURPOSE: Tissue samples were collected from suspected broiler flocks showing respiratory signs to identify infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), characterize emerging field strains, and study their relationships with the Massachusetts H120 strain, the only IB vaccine used in Tunisia. SAMPLES AND METHODS: Several IBV isolates were identified from field samples collected from flocks located in different regions in the northeast of Tunisia. The IBV isolates were characterized and compared to commonly used vaccine strains (including 793B, D274, and H120 types), other reference IBV strains from Europe, and the recently characterized Tunisian field variants TN20/00, TN200/01, and TN335/01. Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing analyses of the hypervariable regions of the S1 gene were carried out. RESULTS: Four new IBV variants were isolated during the period 2007–10 and were designated TN295/07, TN296/07, TN556/07, and TN557/07. The amino acid sequence data showed 100% similarity between TN295/07 and TN296/07, suggesting that these two isolates are identical and belong to the same genotype. Similar results were demonstrated for TN556/07 and TN557/07. Sequence identity values indicated that TN296/07 and TN556/07 share 55% amino acid homologies between each other, but are very different from the reference IBV serotypes, in particular the H120 strain. It was also shown that they have 50%–77% similarities with the Tunisian virus isolated between 2000 and 2001. Phylogenetic clustering allowed classification of these Tunisian isolates as new genotypes that are closer to TN200/01, TN335/01 Tunisian field variants, and Italy02 variant than MassH120 vaccine strain. CONCLUSION: S1 sequence analyses confirmed the cocirculation of H120 vaccine strain with novel IBV variants isolated from Tunisian field.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.052141922,-0.020066209,0.091556444,-0.137739732,0.199686066,0.092243516,-0.145611275,-0.081313837,0.079188056,0.254752041,0.055027515,0.083629877,-0.094110403,-0.03785577,-0.091758046,0.064575445,-0.033449123,0.014799516,0.022072511,0.033933705,0.010063052,-0.008402748,0.013839323,0.017975809,0.014932459,-0.012131914,-0.002091752,0.018572422,0.005534395,0.030656824
Cyclophilin Involvement in the Replication of Hepatitis C Virus and Other Viruses,"In recent months there has been a wealth of promising clinical data suggesting that a more effective treatment regimen, and potentially a cure, for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is close at hand. Leading this push are direct acting antivirals (DAAs), currently comprised of inhibitors that target the HCV protease NS3, viral polymerase NS5B and the nonstructural protein NS5A. In combination with one another, along with the traditional standard of care ribavirin and PEGylated-IFNα, these compounds have proven to afford tremendous efficacy to treatment-naïve patients, as well as to prior non-responders. Nevertheless, by targeting viral components the possibility of selecting for breakthrough and treatment-resistant virus strains remains a concern. Host-targeting antivirals (HTAs) are a distinct class of anti-HCV compounds that is emerging as a complementary set of tools to combat the disease. Cyclophilin (Cyp) inhibitors are one such group in this category. In contrast to DAAs, Cyp inhibitors target a host protein, CypA, and have also demonstrated remarkable antiviral efficiency in clinical trials, without the generation of viral escape mutants. This review serves to summarize the current literature on cyclophilins and their relationship to the HCV viral life cycle, as well as other viruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.074113734,-0.04846721,-0.050723316,0.007036241,-0.15859943,0.092234532,0.109364956,0.014407943,0.045567772,0.082568362,-0.01693452,0.054044031,0.069573042,0.027645983,-0.032111401,-0.079104841,0.00883798,0.315788366,0.274068467,-0.015911207,-0.068566232,0.019327072,-0.003763471,0.110303997,-0.004700331,-0.054068118,0.035724193,-0.036144702,-0.01441443,0.007047149
Large-scale sequencing and the natural history of model human RNA viruses,"RNA virus exploration within the field of medical virology has greatly benefited from technological developments in genomics, deepening our understanding of viral dynamics and emergence. Large-scale first-generation technology sequencing projects have expedited molecular epidemiology studies at an unprecedented scale for two pathogenic RNA viruses chosen as models: influenza A virus and dengue. Next-generation sequencing approaches are now leading to a more in-depth analysis of virus genetic diversity, which is greater for RNA than DNA viruses because of high replication rates and the absence of proofreading activity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.

Development of a Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay for Rapid Detection of Capripoxviruses,"Sheep pox (SP), goat pox (GP), and lumpy skin disease (LSD), caused by capripoxviruses (CaPVs), are economically important diseases of sheep, goats, and cattle, respectively. Here, we report the development of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for rapid detection of CaPVs. LAMP primers were designed to target a conserved gene encoding the poly(A) polymerase small subunit (VP39) of CaPVs. Hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) was incorporated to monitor assay progress by color change from violet when negative to sky blue when positive, and results were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The LAMP assay was shown to be highly specific for CaPVs, with no apparent cross-reactivity to other related viruses (near neighbors) or viruses that cause similar clinical signs (look-a-like viruses). The performance of LAMP was compared to that of a highly sensitive quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay. LAMP and qPCR exhibited similar analytical sensitivities, with limits of detection of 3 and 8 viral genome copies, respectively. Diagnostic specificity was assessed on 36 negative specimens, including swabs and EDTA blood from control sheep, goats, and cattle. Diagnostic sensitivity was assessed on 275 specimens, including EDTA blood, swabs, and tissues from experimentally infected sheep, goats, and cattle. Overall agreement on diagnostic test results between the two assays was 90 to 95% for specificity and 89 to 100% for sensitivity. The LAMP assay described in this report is simple to use, inexpensive, highly sensitive, and particularly well suited for the diagnosis of capripox in less well equipped laboratories and in rural settings where resources are limited.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.029813895,0.085569994,0.276265191,0.077993652,-0.062103458,-0.053037194,0.030325941,0.002617321,-0.007973437,-0.056315555,-0.054155441,0.026059501,-0.017266503,0.004457336,-0.093731915,0.030487212,0.01905015,0.023677371,-0.094682167,0.018615333,-0.113235406,-0.064066398,-0.045120113,0.160888428,0.080066722,0.022345377,-0.087174489,0.052930415,-0.077049708,-0.044924262
"Isolation and Characterization of a Novel Betacoronavirus Subgroup A Coronavirus, Rabbit Coronavirus HKU14, from Domestic Rabbits","We describe the isolation and characterization of a novel Betacoronavirus subgroup A coronavirus, rabbit coronavirus HKU14 (RbCoV HKU14), from domestic rabbits. The virus was detected in 11 (8.1%) of 136 rabbit fecal samples by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), with a viral load of up to 10(8) copies/ml. RbCoV HKU14 was able to replicate in HRT-18G and RK13 cells with cytopathic effects. Northern blotting confirmed the production of subgenomic mRNAs coding for the HE, S, NS5a, E, M, and N proteins. Subgenomic mRNA analysis revealed a transcription regulatory sequence, 5′-UCUAAAC-3′. Phylogenetic analysis showed that RbCoV HKU14 formed a distinct branch among Betacoronavirus subgroup A coronaviruses, being most closely related to but separate from the species Betacoronavirus 1. A comparison of the conserved replicase domains showed that RbCoV HKU14 possessed <90% amino acid identities to most members of Betacoronavirus 1 in ADP-ribose 1″-phosphatase (ADRP) and nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU), indicating that RbCoV HKU14 should represent a separate species. RbCoV HKU14 also possessed genomic features distinct from those of other Betacoronavirus subgroup A coronaviruses, including a unique NS2a region with a variable number of small open reading frames (ORFs). Recombination analysis revealed possible recombination events during the evolution of RbCoV HKU14 and members of Betacoronavirus 1, which may have occurred during cross-species transmission. Molecular clock analysis using RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes dated the most recent common ancestor of RbCoV HKU14 to around 2002, suggesting that this virus has emerged relatively recently. Antibody against RbCoV was detected in 20 (67%) of 30 rabbit sera tested by an N-protein-based Western blot assay, whereas neutralizing antibody was detected in 1 of these 20 rabbits.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.088037244,0.003987508,0.017168472,-0.028936021,0.096759775,-0.001046816,0.02246032,0.009587888,-0.019089427,-0.038203656,-0.025777183,-0.000776074,-0.00354176,-0.004050817,-0.014990119,-0.022649619,0.023979692,0.005070393,-0.006253349,-0.010157408,0.006642861,-0.002670775,-0.006288942,-0.009396028,0.000129533,0.01505445,0.023531113,0.010963024,-0.009136671,0.009630611
Visualizing Coronavirus RNA Synthesis in Time by Using Click Chemistry,"Coronaviruses induce in infected cells the formation of replicative structures, consisting of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes, where viral RNA synthesis supposedly takes place and to which the nonstructural proteins (nsp's) localize. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), the presumed intermediate in RNA synthesis, is localized to the DMV interior. However, as pores connecting the DMV interior with the cytoplasm have not been detected, it is unclear whether RNA synthesis occurs at these same sites. Here, we studied coronavirus RNA synthesis by feeding cells with a uridine analogue, after which nascent RNAs were detected using click chemistry. Early in infection, nascent viral RNA and nsp's colocalized with or occurred adjacent to dsRNA foci. Late in infection, the correlation between dsRNA dots, then found dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, and nsp's and nascent RNAs was less obvious. However, foci of nascent RNAs were always found to colocalize with the nsp12-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. These results demonstrate the feasibility of detecting viral RNA synthesis by using click chemistry and indicate that dsRNA dots do not necessarily correspond with sites of active viral RNA synthesis. Rather, late in infection many DMVs may harbor dsRNA molecules that are no longer functioning as intermediates in RNA synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.211393489,-0.05469078,-0.09389467,0.117205991,-0.036520343,-0.128163205,-0.007549472,0.04529374,-0.045233201,0.005395292,0.086192044,-0.029986385,-0.019156942,0.097723129,0.042611062,0.065319438,-0.014627831,-0.03371315,0.009499933,0.025927006,-0.066298757,0.049869948,-0.04641678,-0.089730504,0.022501427,-0.042408721,-0.044190531,0.025283123,-0.031901437,0.069895275
"Clinical Features and Outcome of 65 Laboratory Confirmed Cases of H1N1 in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman","OBJECTIVES: Responding to Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) virus alert in 2009, Ministry of Health (MoH), Sultanate Of Oman arranged task force to deal with the emergency. MOH published articles in newspapers, prepared guidelines and hospitals were assigned to admit patients of H1N1. All the patients suspected of H1N1 were admitted and isolated as per the guidelines. This report describes clinical features and outcomes of 65 laboratory confirmed cases of H1N1 in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. METHODS: From July to October 2009, 101 cases suspected of suffering from Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) virus were admitted and isolated in Al Nahdha Hospital in Muscat. All the patients on admission were tested for H1N1, by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Immediately on admission, all of them were treated with Oseltamivir and antibiotics. RESULTS: Of the 65 confirmed cases of H1N1, 53.84% were males. Age of patients varied from 14 to 60 years, while 53.7% were aged between 31 to 55 years. Results showed that 70.8% had underlying co-morbidity; among which diabetes mellitus and respiratory illness were common. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (95%) and cough (94%). Also, 20% of the patients had leucopenia and 10.8% leucocytosis. Deranged LFT was observed in 26 (42.6%) of cases while 14 (21.5%) had hypokalemia. One patient (0.01%) with underlying severe co-morbidity died. Two patients (3.1%) had ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome); both recovered. Radiological infiltration was documented in 84.6% of cases, with lower zone involvement as the common finding. Hospital stay was between 1 to 12 days, 49.2% of patients were discharged within 3 days. CONCLUSION: Mainly adult population was affected during this epidemic. H1N1 infection can lead to severe illness. Incidence of H1N1 was higher in patients with underlying co-morbidity. Timely intervention and administration of Oseltamivir may need to be modified.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.23897557,-0.024773661,-0.094992872,-0.006858535,-0.066838349,0.113451854,-0.185605817,0.117905777,-0.142530036,-0.058942531,-0.006686682,0.078706707,-0.026998423,0.043729112,-0.03417976,0.030164667,0.019100824,0.065659626,-0.037161736,0.002948424,0.034274073,-0.028501297,-0.094539782,-0.063980914,-0.08075738,0.05877671,-0.033666812,0.036704624,-0.029567719,0.060813163
A Preliminary Study of Pneumonia Etiology Among Hospitalized Children in Kenya,"Background. Pneumonia is the leading cause of childhood death in the developing world. Higher-quality etiological data are required to reduce this mortality burden. Methods. We conducted a case-control study of pneumonia etiology among children aged 1–59 months in rural Kenya. Case patients were hospitalized with World Health Organization–defined severe pneumonia (SP) or very severe pneumonia (VSP); controls were outpatient children without pneumonia. We collected blood for culture, induced sputum for culture and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and obtained oropharyngeal swab specimens for multiplex PCR from case patients, and serum for serology and nasopharyngeal swab specimens for multiplex PCR from case patients and controls. Results. Of 984 eligible case patients, 810 (84%) were enrolled in the study; 232 (29%) had VSP. Blood cultures were positive in 52 of 749 case patients (7%). A predominant potential pathogen was identified in sputum culture in 70 of 417 case patients (17%). A respiratory virus was detected by PCR from nasopharyngeal swab specimens in 486 of 805 case patients (60%) and 172 of 369 controls (47%). Only respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) showed a statistically significant association between virus detection in the nasopharynx and pneumonia hospitalization (odds ratio, 12.5; 95% confidence interval, 3.1–51.5). Among 257 case patients in whom all specimens (excluding serum specimens) were collected, bacteria were identified in 24 (9%), viruses in 137 (53%), mixed viral and bacterial infection in 39 (15%), and no pathogen in 57 (22%); bacterial causes outnumbered viral causes when the results of the case-control analysis were considered. Conclusions. A potential etiology was detected in >75% of children admitted with SP or VSP. Except for RSV, the case-control analysis did not detect an association between viral detection in the nasopharynx and hospitalization for pneumonia.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.277579512,-0.053640698,-0.086564782,-0.064466678,-0.038271171,-0.106897295,-0.057098995,0.070398278,-0.1381854,0.04645295,-0.015476405,-0.024353719,-0.03356803,0.024327482,-0.072866227,-0.026209422,-0.00306773,0.023347724,-0.029170098,-0.004688409,-0.041035235,0.1220172,0.090303598,-0.012589467,0.017605536,0.018109661,0.072190018,-0.014641063,-0.045654749,-0.015386491
Nonstructural Proteins 7 and 8 of Feline Coronavirus Form a 2:1 Heterotrimer That Exhibits Primer-Independent RNA Polymerase Activity,"Nonstructural proteins 7 and 8 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have previously been shown by X-ray crystallography to form an 8:8 hexadecamer. In addition, it has been demonstrated that N-terminally His(6)-tagged SARS-CoV Nsp8 is a primase able to synthesize RNA oligonucleotides with a length of up to 6 nucleotides. We present here the 2.6-Å crystal structure of the feline coronavirus (FCoV) Nsp7:Nsp8 complex, which is a 2:1 heterotrimer containing two copies of the α-helical Nsp7 with conformational differences between them, and one copy of Nsp8 that consists of an α/β domain and a long-α-helix domain. The same stoichiometry is found for the Nsp7:Nsp8 complex in solution, as demonstrated by chemical cross-linking, size exclusion chromatography, and small-angle X-ray scattering. Furthermore, we show that FCoV Nsp8, like its SARS-CoV counterpart, is able to synthesize short oligoribonucleotides of up to 6 nucleotides in length when carrying an N-terminal His(6) tag. Remarkably, the same protein harboring the sequence GPLG instead of the His(6) tag at its N terminus exhibits a substantially increased, primer-independent RNA polymerase activity. Upon addition of Nsp7, the RNA polymerase activity is further enhanced so that RNA up to template length (67 nucleotides) can be synthesized. Further, we show that the unprocessed intermediate polyprotein Nsp7-10 of human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E is also capable of synthesizing oligoribonucleotides up to a chain length of six. These results indicate that in case of FCoV as well as of HCoV 229E, the formation of a hexadecameric Nsp7:Nsp8 complex is not necessary for RNA polymerase activity. Further, the FCoV Nsp7:Nsp8 complex functions as a noncanonical RNA polymerase capable of synthesizing RNA of up to template length.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.142010909,0.121742455,-0.128463178,0.051911587,0.009511636,-0.082601147,-0.020614373,-0.045821076,-0.001093252,-0.07366227,0.112509388,0.101297226,0.089284359,-0.005042576,-0.039438235,0.016043138,0.034999179,-0.041661801,-0.002612543,0.033176529,-0.044547102,-0.007423319,0.054251535,-0.065846958,0.02478121,0.000711777,-0.050979219,0.04584546,0.012140339,0.027810108
Presence of Viral Nucleic Acids in the Middle Ear: Acute Otitis Media Pathogen or Bystander?,"Viruses play an important role in acute otitis media (AOM) pathogenesis and live viruses may cause AOM in absence of pathogenic bacteria. Detection of AOM pathogens generally relies on bacterial culture of middle ear fluid. When viral culture is used and live viruses are detected in the middle ear fluid of children with AOM, the viruses are generally accepted as AOM pathogens. Because viral culture is not sensitive and does not detect the comprehensive spectrum of respiratory viruses, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are commonly used to detect viral nucleic acids in the middle ear fluid. While PCR assays have greatly increased the viral detection rate, new questions arise on the significance of viral nucleic acids detected in the middle ear because nucleic acids of multiple viruses are detected simultaneously, and nucleic acids of specific viruses are detected repeatedly and in a high proportion of asymptomatic children. This article first reviews the role of live viruses in AOM and presents the point-counter point arguments on whether viral nucleic acids in the middle ear represent an AOM pathogen or a bystander status. While there is evidence to support both directions, helpful information for interpretation of the data and future research direction are outlined.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.047251765,-0.038595891,0.031998228,0.029795593,-0.010365222,-0.026343634,0.094138498,7.14E-05,0.016267315,0.100099941,-0.030421245,-0.053951945,0.051329341,-0.076463381,0.039963448,-0.035109453,-0.028821449,-0.070170917,-0.020392616,-0.034800038,-0.0409809,0.052687991,0.025440231,0.026096244,-0.014614458,0.026729957,-0.002639932,-0.036665818,0.009186031,-0.03074699
Detection of Infectious Influenza Virus in Cough Aerosols Generated in a Simulated Patient Examination Room,"BACKGROUND: The potential for aerosol transmission of infectious influenza virus (ie, in healthcare facilities) is controversial. We constructed a simulated patient examination room that contained coughing and breathing manikins to determine whether coughed influenza was infectious and assessed the effectiveness of an N95 respirator and surgical mask in blocking transmission. METHODS: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health aerosol samplers collected size-fractionated aerosols for 60 minutes at the mouth of the breathing manikin, beside the mouth, and at 3 other locations in the room. Total recovered virus was quantitated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and infectivity was determined by the viral plaque assay and an enhanced infectivity assay. RESULTS: Infectious influenza was recovered in all aerosol fractions (5.0% in >4 µm aerodynamic diameter, 75.5% in 1–4 µm, and 19.5% in <1 µm; n = 5). Tightly sealing a mask to the face blocked entry of 94.5% of total virus and 94.8% of infectious virus (n = 3). A tightly sealed respirator blocked 99.8% of total virus and 99.6% of infectious virus (n = 3). A poorly fitted respirator blocked 64.5% of total virus and 66.5% of infectious virus (n = 3). A mask documented to be loosely fitting by a PortaCount fit tester, to simulate how masks are worn by healthcare workers, blocked entry of 68.5% of total virus and 56.6% of infectious virus (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: These results support a role for aerosol transmission and represent the first reported laboratory study of the efficacy of masks and respirators in blocking inhalation of influenza in aerosols. The results indicate that a poorly fitted respirator performs no better than a loosely fitting mask.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.025587053,-0.038090522,0.021451258,0.025467126,-0.018672427,0.151612473,-0.05376796,0.008455525,0.012443992,-0.002754459,0.02850627,-0.028912133,-0.008850049,-0.010365883,0.040275104,0.035497588,-0.011071707,-0.015595521,0.012177848,0.010190869,-0.020087592,-0.013824898,0.010774104,-0.025501497,-0.006595219,0.04765898,0.008325201,0.010961295,-0.049537447,0.006160997
In vitro Transcription and Capping of Gaussia Luciferase mRNA Followed by HeLa Cell Transfection,"In vitro transcription is the synthesis of RNA transcripts by RNA polymerase from a linear DNA template containing the corresponding promoter sequence (T7, T3, SP6) and the gene to be transcribed (Figure 1A). A typical transcription reaction consists of the template DNA, RNA polymerase, ribonucleotide triphosphates, RNase inhibitor and buffer containing Mg(2+) ions. Large amounts of high quality RNA are often required for a variety of applications. Use of in vitro transcription has been reported for RNA structure and function studies such as splicing(1), RNAi experiments in mammalian cells(2), antisense RNA amplification by the ""Eberwine method""(3), microarray analysis(4) and for RNA vaccine studies(5). The technique can also be used for producing radiolabeled and dye labeled probes(6). Warren, et al. recently reported reprogramming of human cells by transfection with in vitro transcribed capped RNA(7). The T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit from New England Biolabs has been designed to synthesize up to 180 μg RNA per 20 μl reaction. RNA of length up to 10kb has been successfully transcribed using this kit. Linearized plasmid DNA, PCR products and synthetic DNA oligonucleotides can be used as templates for transcription as long as they have the T7 promoter sequence upstream of the gene to be transcribed. Addition of a 5' end cap structure to the RNA is an important process in eukaryotes. It is essential for RNA stability(8), efficient translation(9), nuclear transport(10) and splicing(11). The process involves addition of a 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5' triphosphate end of the RNA. RNA capping can be carried out post-transcriptionally using capping enzymes or co-transcriptionally using cap analogs. In the enzymatic method, the mRNA is capped using the Vaccinia virus capping enzyme(12,13). The enzyme adds on a 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5' end of the RNA using GTP and S-adenosyl methionine as donors (cap 0 structure). Both methods yield functionally active capped RNA suitable for transfection or other applications(14) such as generating viral genomic RNA for reverse-genetic systems(15) and crystallographic studies of cap binding proteins such as eIF4E(16). In the method described below, the T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit from NEB is used to synthesize capped and uncapped RNA transcripts of Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) and Cypridina luciferase (CLuc). A portion of the uncapped GLuc RNA is capped using the Vaccinia Capping System (NEB). A linearized plasmid containing the GLuc or CLuc gene and T7 promoter is used as the template DNA. The transcribed RNA is transfected into HeLa cells and cell culture supernatants are assayed for luciferase activity. Capped CLuc RNA is used as the internal control to normalize GLuc expression.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.237517663,-0.050512334,-0.014730107,0.140794808,-0.04344659,-0.150405255,-0.067831273,0.056681096,-0.082591588,0.024652789,0.008580893,-0.043838133,0.00838305,0.050448231,-0.022149028,0.044554926,-0.04868322,-0.020106617,-0.017611924,0.001360636,-0.053649049,0.062304736,0.10859507,-0.024359419,-0.011674219,-0.136423042,-0.065509682,0.082445904,0.074048422,0.079604024
"Natural Occurrence and Characterization of Two Internal Ribosome Entry Site Elements in a Novel Virus, Canine Picodicistrovirus, in the Picornavirus-Like Superfamily","Dicistroviridae and Picornaviridae are two phylogenetically related families of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses in the picornavirus-like superfamily with similar gene contents but different genome organizations and hosts. In a surveillance study involving 1,472 samples from 368 dogs over a 22-month period, we identified a novel picornavirus-like virus from 47 fecal and urine samples by the use of reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of three complete genomes revealed that, although it seemed that the virus was most closely related to other picornaviruses, P1, P2, and P3 of the virus possessed very low amino acid identities of <30% to those of all other known picornaviruses and that the amino acid identities between the 3D(pol) and 2C of the virus and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and helicases of all other picornaviruses were <35%. Distinct from other picornaviruses, the genomes of the virus contain two putative internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) and two open reading frames, encoding two polyprotein precursors (844 and 1,406 amino acids), separated by an intergenic region (IGR) of 588 bases. A dual-luciferase activity assay using DNA and RNA transfection revealed that both IRESs were functional. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that numbers of viral RNAs ranged from 7.55 × 10(6) to 1.26 × 10(9) copies/ml of urine and 1.82 × 10(6) to 4.97 × 10(10) copies/ml of fecal sample. This is the first report of the natural occurrence of two functional IRESs in nondicistroviruses. Based on our results, we have proposed a novel species, canine picodicistrovirus (CPDV), to describe this novel member of the picornavirus-like superfamily, which could represent a novel family of viruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.104493617,-0.002129932,0.075257332,0.065021089,0.122138694,-0.040797229,-0.017395679,0.02384174,-0.048992336,-0.024508456,-0.001309312,-0.009171843,-0.027889992,0.001225739,-0.000374261,-0.082290985,0.031574492,-0.006755759,0.039891783,-0.015341097,0.02711798,0.048836778,-0.061813012,0.019091779,-0.041494081,-0.03111529,0.04179489,0.001072584,-0.046013647,0.011304526
Transcriptional and Posttranscriptional Regulation of HIV-1 Gene Expression,"Control of HIV-1 gene expression depends on two viral regulatory proteins, Tat and Rev. Tat stimulates transcription elongation by directing the cellular transcriptional elongation factor P-TEFb to nascent RNA polymerases. Rev is required for the transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of the unspliced and incompletely spliced mRNAs that encode the structural proteins of the virus. Molecular studies of both proteins have revealed how they interact with the cellular machinery to control transcription from the viral LTR and regulate the levels of spliced and unspliced mRNAs. The regulatory feedback mechanisms driven by HIV-1 Tat and Rev ensure that HIV-1 transcription proceeds through distinct phases. In cells that are not fully activated, limiting levels of Tat and Rev act as potent blocks to premature virus production.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.135922999,-0.060451022,-0.032829946,-0.027954682,-0.088129478,0.019262522,0.017731122,-0.026225903,0.041156023,-0.010017231,-0.043635915,-0.041669476,-0.000117877,0.06850773,-0.014773468,0.008311626,0.023927901,-0.058278556,-0.040872977,0.024103102,-0.043920373,0.034481558,-0.038072075,-0.003393895,0.006020442,-0.039456099,0.017112774,-0.014663208,0.03081883,0.01215274

Arterivirus and Nairovirus Ovarian Tumor Domain-Containing Deubiquitinases Target Activated RIG-I To Control Innate Immune Signaling,"The innate immune response constitutes the first line of defense against viral infection and is extensively regulated through ubiquitination. The removal of ubiquitin from innate immunity signaling factors by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) therefore provides a potential opportunity for viruses to evade this host defense system. It was previously found that specific proteases encoded by the unrelated arteri- and nairoviruses resemble the ovarian tumor domain-containing (OTU) family of DUBs. In arteriviruses, this domain has been characterized before as a papain-like protease (PLP2) that is also involved in replicase polyprotein processing. In nairoviruses, the DUB resides in the polymerase protein but is not essential for RNA replication. Using both in vitro and cell-based assays, we now show that PLP2 DUB activity is conserved in all members of the arterivirus family and that both arteri- and nairovirus DUBs inhibit RIG-I-mediated innate immune signaling when overexpressed. The potential relevance of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling for the innate immune response against arterivirus infection is supported by our finding that in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the production of beta interferon primarily depends on the recognition of arterivirus RNA by the pattern-recognition receptor MDA5. Interestingly, we also found that both arteri- and nairovirus DUBs inhibit RIG-I ubiquitination upon overexpression, suggesting that both MDA5 and RIG-I have a role in countering infection by arteriviruses. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that arteri- and nairoviruses employ their deubiquitinating potential to inactivate cellular proteins involved in RLR-mediated innate immune signaling, as exemplified by the deubiquitination of RIG-I.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.119756109,-0.037051901,-0.033185671,-0.035029171,-0.076626122,0.033804694,0.052052529,-0.018424522,0.047672654,-0.011143742,-0.037595842,-0.011401917,0.001699995,0.045555437,-0.02836172,-0.014401821,0.039378692,-0.048366184,-0.025304709,0.007587492,-0.003596669,0.021529278,-0.024831614,-0.036604667,0.025082479,0.016641236,-0.006094673,0.003638634,0.00142521,-0.045146387
A viral deubiquitylating enzyme targets viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and affects viral infectivity,"Selective protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays an essential role in many major cellular processes, including host–pathogen interactions. We previously reported that the tightly regulated viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the positive-strand RNA virus Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) is degraded by the UPS in infected cells, a process that affects viral infectivity. Here, we show that the TYMV 98K replication protein can counteract this degradation process thanks to its proteinase domain. In-vitro assays revealed that the recombinant proteinase domain is a functional ovarian tumour (OTU)-like deubiquitylating enzyme (DUB), as is the 98K produced during viral infection. We also demonstrate that 98K mediates in-vivo deubiquitylation of TYMV RdRp protein—its binding partner within replication complexes—leading to its stabilization. Finally, we show that this DUB activity contributes to viral infectivity in plant cells. The identification of viral RdRp as a specific substrate of the viral DUB enzyme thus reveals the intricate interplay between ubiquitylation, deubiquitylation and the interaction between viral proteins in controlling levels of RdRp and viral infectivity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.228116686,-0.075801705,-0.110202834,0.115980943,-0.127997774,-0.044191059,0.084151391,-0.013729865,-0.00634976,0.067064443,0.056275683,0.029102611,-0.053409276,0.077876891,-0.044425441,-0.067828467,0.084657874,-0.087166038,-0.026322339,0.022686328,-0.017950017,0.044929658,0.010189142,-0.078824773,0.035630043,0.073368664,0.048428225,-0.002777955,-0.013902647,0.093304192
VP-1 Quasispecies in Human Infection with Polyomavirus BK,"Polyomavirus BK is a recognized cause of nephropathy and hemorrhagic cystitis in kidney or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. This study explored a role of genetic variations in capsid protein VP-1 gene as a factor in viral pathogenesis. VP-1 was amplified from 7 healthy subjects with viruria, 7 transplant patients with viruria, and 11 patients with viremia or nephropathy. PCR products were cloned and a total of 558 clonal sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analysis using standard methods. VP-1 quasispecies were found in 25/25 and coinfection with different genotypes in 12/ 25 subjects. Genotype II was found as an unexpected minority species in 5/25 individuals. Recombinant strains of uncertain biologic significance, which frequently contained genotype II and IV sequences were identified in 9/25 subjects. Viremia/nephropathy group was characterized by (a) greater sequence complexity in whole VP-1 versus BC loop and BC loop compared to the HI loop, (b) greater intra-strain genetic diversity in the BC loop compared to whole VP-1 protein and HI loop, (c) more non-synonymous substitutions (dN) in the BC loop compared to whole VP-1 and HI loop, (e) fewer synonymous substitutions (dS) compared to healthy-viruria group, and (f) selection pressure (dN/dS >1.0) exerted on VP-1. In conclusion, this study documents frequent occurrence of quasispecies in a host DNA polymerase dependent virus which is theoretically expected to show high replication fidelity. Quasispecies occur even in healthy subjects with viruria, but evolutionary selection pressure directed at the viral capsid protein VP-1 is seen only in patients with viremia.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.039866191,-0.039006038,-0.002683074,-0.089779503,0.021238565,-0.010806026,0.000346069,0.016878848,-0.046533458,-0.006122513,-0.031475642,0.02874625,-0.012312553,0.010118064,-0.047287438,-0.005693408,0.010106376,-0.000317461,-0.042220874,-0.001226588,0.018753591,-0.05395364,-0.027618598,0.085391388,-0.02305638,-0.031284188,-0.003186998,-0.012977094,-0.044891364,0.024889841
Replication of the Rotavirus Genome Requires an Active Ubiquitin-Proteasome System,"Here we show that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is required for the efficient replication of rotavirus RRV in MA104 cells. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 decreased the yield of infectious virus under conditions where it severely reduces the synthesis of not only viral but also cellular proteins. Addition of nonessential amino acids to the cell medium restored both viral protein synthesis and cellular protein synthesis, but the production of progeny viruses was still inhibited. In medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids, we showed that MG132 does not affect rotavirus entry but inhibits the replication of the viral genome. It was also shown that it prevents the efficient incorporation into viroplasms of viral polymerase VP1 and the capsid proteins VP2 and VP6, which could explain the inhibitory effect of MG132 on genome replication and infectious virus yield. We also showed that ubiquitination is relevant for rotavirus replication since the yield of rotavirus progeny in cells carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme was reduced at the restrictive temperature. In addition, overexpression of ubiquitin in MG132-treated MA104 cells partially reversed the effect of the inhibitor on virus yield. Altogether, these data suggest that the ubiquitin-proteasome (UP) system has a very complex interaction with the rotavirus life cycle, with both the ubiquitination and proteolytic activities of the system being relevant for virus replication.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.15194947,-0.074393666,-0.033721585,-0.00092914,-0.100279701,0.018896524,0.021287722,-0.031374096,0.040024916,0.030637017,-0.002464487,-0.031689909,-0.019013327,0.084954269,0.020785351,-0.019057029,0.023131924,-0.053440481,0.011204087,0.056303339,-0.032787732,0.058922722,-0.029060272,-0.025115094,0.05720829,0.045001036,-0.008183709,-0.045221218,-0.092344233,0.031971584
Mechanism of Glycyrrhizic Acid Inhibition of Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus: Disruption of CTCF-Cohesin-Mediated RNA Polymerase II Pausing and Sister Chromatid Cohesion,"Glycyrrhizic acid (GA), a derivative of licorice, selectively inhibits the growth of lymphocytes latently infected with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. The mechanism involves the deregulation of the multicistronic latency transcript, including the failure to generate the mature forms of viral mRNA encoding LANA. We show here that GA disrupts an RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complex that accumulates at the CTCF-cohesin binding site within the first intron of the latency transcript. GA altered the enrichment of the RNAPII pausing complex, along with pausing factors SPT5 and NELF-A, at the intragenic CTCF-cohesin binding sites. GA blocked the interaction of cohesin subunit SMC3 with another cohesin subunit, RAD21, and reduced SPT5 interaction with RNAPII. Covalent coupling of GA to a solid support revealed that GA interacts with several cellular proteins, including SMC3 and SPT5, but not their respective interaction partners RAD21 and RNAPII. GA treatment also inhibited the transcription of some cellular genes, like c-myc, which contain a similar CTCF-cohesin binding site within the first intron. We also found that GA leads to a more general loss of sister chromatid cohesion for cellular chromosomes. These findings suggest that RNAPII pauses at intragenic CTCF-cohesin binding sites and that abrogation of this pausing by GA leads to loss of proper mRNA production and defects in sister chromatid cohesion, a process important for both viral and cellular chromosome stability.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.102818703,-0.041846589,-0.022852437,-0.055900557,-0.061307343,0.025744132,0.015256701,-0.010659538,0.028175723,-0.024748707,-0.024772857,0.003597976,-0.016829476,0.012174607,-0.016703634,0.015257563,0.013783931,-0.039425597,-0.046541595,0.001378736,-0.014757488,0.014229479,-0.018116995,-0.032812078,0.022281428,-0.02986811,-0.0265254,0.015042445,0.039223706,-0.006012995
Molecular Epidemiology of Human Coronavirus OC43 Reveals Evolution of Different Genotypes over Time and Recent Emergence of a Novel Genotype due to Natural Recombination,"Although human coronavirus OC43-OC43 (HCoV-OC43) is the coronavirus most commonly associated with human infections, little is known about its molecular epidemiology and evolution. We conducted a molecular epidemiology study to investigate different genotypes and potential recombination in HCoV-OC43. Twenty-nine HCoV-OC43 strains from nasopharyngeal aspirates, collected from 2004 to 2011, were subjected to RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike, and nucleocapsid gene analysis. Phylogenetic analysis showed at least three distinct clusters of HCoV-OC43, although 10 unusual strains displayed incongruent phylogenetic positions between RdRp and spike genes. This suggested the presence of four HCoV-OC43 genotypes (A to D), with genotype D most likely arising from recombination. The complete genome sequencing of two genotype C and D strains and bootscan analysis showed recombination events between genotypes B and C in the generation of genotype D. Of the 29 strains, none belonged to the more ancient genotype A, 5 from 2004 belonged to genotype B, 15 from 2004 to 2006 belonged to genotype C, and 1 from 2004 and all 8 from 2008 to 2011 belonged to the recombinant genotype D. Molecular clock analysis using spike and nucleocapsid genes dated the most recent common ancestor of all genotypes to the 1950s, genotype B and C to the 1980s, genotype B to the 1990s, and genotype C to the late 1990s to early 2000s, while the recombinant genotype D strains were detected as early as 2004. This represents the first study to describe natural recombination in HCoV-OC43 and the evolution of different genotypes over time, leading to the emergence of novel genotype D, which is associated with pneumonia in our elderly population.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.038043793,-0.022055843,-0.023352842,-0.068440672,0.191227279,-0.01059466,0.054137175,-0.042418941,0.061601721,-0.024188836,-0.010167705,0.339707813,0.169145437,0.084741203,0.000533076,0.03464043,-0.083840871,0.009493143,-0.044544051,-0.008872801,0.054025065,-0.006584399,0.061013445,0.038287838,-0.02090523,-0.050295582,0.092388725,0.003876095,-0.021893202,0.079275996
Detection of Adeno-Associated Virus Viremia in Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is widely considered to be nonpathogenic, but the clinical epidemiology of this virus is limited. By use of polymerase chain reaction assays, we investigated the incidence and clinical significance of AAV viremia in a population of consecutive recipients of a hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Four (2.8%) of 145 patients developed AAV viremia after HCT. Viremia was low level and transient in all patients. Two patients were admitted to the hospital and died in proximity to AAV viremia (<7 weeks between diagnosis and death); however, AAV was not detected in tissue specimens obtained at autopsy.

Coronavirus Infection Induces DNA Replication Stress Partly through Interaction of Its Nonstructural Protein 13 with the p125 Subunit of DNA Polymerase δ,"Perturbation of cell cycle regulation is a characteristic feature of infection by many DNA and RNA viruses, including Coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). IBV infection was shown to induce cell cycle arrest at both S and G(2)/M phases for the enhancement of viral replication and progeny production. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well explored. In this study we show that activation of cellular DNA damage response is one of the mechanisms exploited by Coronavirus to induce cell cycle arrest. An ATR-dependent cellular DNA damage response was shown to be activated by IBV infection. Suppression of the ATR kinase activity by chemical inhibitors and siRNA-mediated knockdown of ATR reduced the IBV-induced ATR signaling and inhibited the replication of IBV. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid screens and subsequent biochemical and functional studies demonstrated that interaction between Coronavirus nsp13 and DNA polymerase δ induced DNA replication stress in IBV-infected cells. These findings indicate that the ATR signaling activated by IBV replication contributes to the IBV-induced S-phase arrest and is required for efficient IBV replication and progeny production.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.141223787,-0.040986234,0.023874975,-0.090861166,0.015028628,0.083763757,-0.098487689,-0.115691186,0.160007452,0.336693139,0.075404634,-0.025295762,-0.069243893,0.146280608,-0.160119643,0.212215094,0.004099244,-0.032050832,0.041231518,0.066474601,-0.074438382,0.007853288,-0.006393244,-0.091919057,0.017995654,0.004257841,-0.077563806,0.077238437,0.024607406,-0.041674099
Function of nonstructural 5A protein of genotype 2a in replication and infection of HCV with gene substitution,"AIM: To explore the function of Nonstructural 5A (NS5A) protein of genotype 2a (JFH1) in the replication and infection of hepatitis C virus (HCV). METHODS: Intergenotypic chimera FL-J6JFH/J4NS5A was constructed by inserting NS5A gene from 1b stain HC-J4 by the overlapping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and the restriction enzyme reaction. In vitro RNA transcripts of chimera, prototype J6JFH and negative control J6JFH1 (GND) were prepared and transfected into Huh-7.5 cells with liposomes. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA), fluorescence quantitative PCR and infection assay were performed to determine the protein expression and gene replication in Huh-7.5 cells. RESULTS: The HCV RNA levels in FL-J6JFH/J4NS5A chimera RNA transfected cells were significantly lower than the wild type at any indicated time point (2.58 ± 5.97 × 10(6) vs 4.27 ± 1.72 × 10(4), P = 0.032). The maximal level of HCV RNA in chimera was 5.6 ± 1.8 × 10(4) GE/μg RNA at day 34 after transfection, while the wild type reached a peak level at day 13 which was 126 folds higher (70.65 ± 14.11 × 10(5) vs 0.56 ± 0.90 × 10(5), P = 0.028). HCV proteins could also be detected by IFA in chimera-transfected cells with an obviously low level. Infection assay showed that FL-J6JFH/J4NS5A chimera could produce infectious virus particles, ranging from 10 ± 5 ffu/mL to 78.3 ± 23.6 ffu/mL, while that of FL-J6JFH1 ranged from 5.8 ± 1.5 × 10(2) ffu/mL to 2.5 ± 1.4 × 10(4) ffu/mL.

Molecular characterization of a new species in the genus Alphacoronavirus associated with mink epizootic catarrhal gastroenteritis,"A coronavirus (CoV) previously shown to be associated with catarrhal gastroenteritis in mink (Mustela vison) was identified by electron microscopy in mink faeces from two fur farms in Wisconsin and Minnesota in 1998. A pan-coronavirus and a genus-specific RT-PCR assay were used initially to demonstrate that the newly discovered mink CoVs (MCoVs) were members of the genus Alphacoronavirus. Subsequently, using a random RT-PCR approach, full-genomic sequences were generated that further confirmed that, phylogenetically, the MCoVs belonged to the genus Alphacoronavirus, with closest relatedness to the recently identified but only partially sequenced (fragments of the polymerase, and full-length spike, 3c, envelope, nucleoprotein, membrane, 3x and 7b genes) ferret enteric coronavirus (FRECV) and ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV). The molecular data presented in this study provide the first genetic evidence for a new coronavirus associated with epizootic catarrhal gastroenteritis outbreaks in mink and demonstrate that MCoVs possess high genomic variability and relatively low overall nucleotide sequence identities (91.7 %) between contemporary strains. Additionally, the new MCoVs appeared to be phylogenetically distant from human (229E and NL63) and other alphacoronaviruses and did not belong to the species Alphacoronavirus 1. It is proposed that, together with the partially sequenced FRECV and FRSCV, they comprise a new species within the genus Alphacoronavirus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.058668791,0.077571391,0.034574751,-0.03441515,0.149945487,0.02374553,0.034982014,0.009775666,0.000498368,-0.038150481,-0.030845383,0.023689498,0.040571328,-0.007414748,-0.005774874,-0.015133801,0.017337758,0.035804534,-0.023954322,-0.005782068,0.025455878,0.018370541,-0.01902537,0.033474369,0.024461064,-0.002014043,0.026373829,-0.026171551,0.004172121,0.018696462
Human Mitochondrial RNA Polymerase: Evaluation of the Single-Nucleotide-Addition Cycle on Synthetic RNA/DNA Scaffolds,"The human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (h-mtRNAP) serves as both the transcriptase for expression and the primase for replication of mitochondrial DNA. As such, the enzyme is of fundamental importance to cellular energy metabolism, and defects in its function may be related to human disease states. Here we describe in vitro analysis of the h-mtRNAP kinetic mechanism for single, correct nucleotide incorporation. This was made possible by the development of efficient methods for expression and purification of h-mtRNAP using a bacterial system and by utilization of assays that rely on simple, synthetic RNA/DNA scaffolds without the need for mitochondrial transcription accessory proteins. We find that h-mtRNAP accomplishes single-nucleotide incorporation by using the same core steps, including conformational change steps before and after chemistry, that are prototypical for most types of nucleic acid polymerases. The polymerase binds to scaffolds via a two-step mechanism consisting of a fast initial-encounter step followed by a much slower isomerization that leads to catalytic competence. A substantial solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effect was observed for the forward reaction, but none was detectable for the reverse reaction, suggesting that chemistry is at least partially rate-limiting in the forward direction but not in the reverse. h-mtRNAP appears to exercise much more stringent surveillance over base than over sugar in determining the correctness of a nucleotide. The utility of developing the robust in vitro assays described here and of establishing a baseline of kinetic performance for the wild-type enzyme is that biological questions concerning h-mtRNAP may now begin to be addressed.

Assembly of Alphavirus Replication Complexes from RNA and Protein Components in a Novel trans-Replication System in Mammalian Cells,"For positive-strand RNA viruses, the viral genomic RNA also acts as an mRNA directing the translation of the replicase proteins of the virus. Replication takes place in association with cytoplasmic membranes, which are heavily modified to create specific replication compartments. Here we have expressed by plasmid DNA transfection the large replicase polyprotein of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) in mammalian cells from a nonreplicating mRNA and provided a separate RNA containing the replication signals. The replicase proteins were able to efficiently and specifically replicate the template in trans, leading to accumulation of RNA and marker gene products expressed from the template RNA. The replicase proteins and double-stranded RNA replication intermediates localized to structures similar to those seen in SFV-infected cells. Using correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) with fluorescent marker proteins to relocate those transfected cells, in which active replication was ongoing, abundant membrane modifications, representing the replication complex spherules, were observed both at the plasma membrane and in intracellular endolysosomes. Thus, replication complexes are faithfully assembled and localized in the trans-replication system. We demonstrated, using CLEM, that the replication proteins alone or a polymerase-negative polyprotein mutant together with the template did not give rise to spherule formation. Thus, the trans-replication system is suitable for cell biological dissection and examination in a mammalian cell environment, and similar systems may be possible for other positive-strand RNA viruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.260772026,-0.086090338,-0.084798227,0.108417289,-0.099120608,-0.078516554,-0.014315423,0.008412299,0.000377309,-0.009131434,0.040660298,-0.050941339,-0.016958293,0.16069072,0.014985455,0.039538288,0.025770074,-0.091046927,0.03527845,0.057765806,-0.067831669,0.082030432,-0.043301461,-0.108123691,0.019665624,-0.022337342,-0.091386757,0.022484087,-0.113485746,-0.002988444
"Development and Initial Results of a Low Cost, Disposable, Point-of-Care Testing Device for Pathogen Detection","Development of small footprint, disposable, fast, and inexpensive devices for pathogen detection in the field and clinic would benefit human and veterinary medicine by allowing evidence-based responses to future out breaks. We designed and tested an integrated nucleic acid extraction and amplification device employing a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) or reverse transcriptase-LAMP assay. Our system provides a screening tool with polymerase-chain-reaction-level sensitivity and specificity for outbreak detection, response, and recovery. Time to result is ~90 min. The device utilizes a swab that collects sample and then transfers it to a disc of cellulose-based nucleic acid binding paper. The disc is positioned within a disposable containment tube with a manual loading port. In order to test for the presence of target pathogens, LAMP reagents are loaded through the tube’s port into contact with the sample containing cellulose disc. The reagents then are isothermally heated to 63°C for ~1 h to achieve sequence-specific target nucleic acid amplification. Due to the presence of a colorimetric dye, amplification induces visible color change in the reagents from purple to blue.

Viral Infection in Acute Exacerbation of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,"Rationale: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive, uniformly fatal interstitial lung disease. An acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is an episode of acute respiratory worsening without an identifiable etiology. Occult viral infection has been proposed as a possible cause of acute exacerbation. Objectives: To use unbiased genomics-based discovery methods to define the role of viruses in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Methods: Bronchoalveolar lavage and serum from patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, stable disease, and acute lung injury were tested for viral nucleic acid using multiplex polymerase chain reaction, pan-viral microarray, and high-throughput cDNA sequencing. Measurements and Main Results: Four of forty-three patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis had evidence of common respiratory viral infection (parainfluenza [n = 1], rhinovirus [n = 2], coronavirus [n = 1]); no viruses were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage from stable patients. Pan-viral microarrays revealed additional evidence of viral infection (herpes simplex virus [n = 1], Epstein-Barr virus [n = 2], and torque teno virus [TTV] [n = 12]) in patients with acute exacerbation. TTV infection was significantly more common in patients with acute exacerbation than stable controls (P = 0.0003), but present in a similar percentage of acute lung injury controls. Deep sequencing of a subset of acute exacerbation cases confirmed the presence of TTV but did not identify additional viruses. Conclusions: Viral infection was not detected in most cases of acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. TTV was present in a significant minority of cases, and cases of acute lung injury; the clinical significance of this finding remains to be determined.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.094580555,-0.027126683,-0.071357013,-0.077202896,-0.047668429,-0.02897016,0.013835136,0.017521185,-0.068321219,0.066387504,-0.031490661,-0.030237291,0.041867075,0.027064535,0.019482555,-0.009936193,0.016192938,-0.025723221,-0.003713654,0.018895884,0.035430621,-0.086749513,-0.064416745,0.035328561,-0.008428563,0.040363025,-0.043270317,0.011427989,-8.70E-05,0.04271642
Functional Analysis of Two Cavities in Flavivirus NS5 Polymerase,"Flavivirus NS5 protein encodes methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activities. Structural analysis of flavivirus RdRp domains uncovered two conserved cavities (A and B). Both cavities are located in the thumb subdomains and represent potential targets for development of allosteric inhibitors. In this study, we used dengue virus as a model to analyze the function of the two RdRp cavities. Amino acids from both cavities were subjected to mutagenesis analysis in the context of genome-length RNA and recombinant NS5 protein; residues critical for viral replication were subjected to revertant analysis. For cavity A, we found that only one (Lys-756) of the seven selected amino acids is critical for viral replication. Alanine substitution of Lys-756 did not affect the RdRp activity, suggesting that this residue functions through a nonenzymatic mechanism. For cavity B, all four selected amino acids (Leu-328, Lys-330, Trp-859, and Ile-863) are critical for viral replication. Biochemical and revertant analyses showed that three of the four mutated residues (Leu-328, Trp-859, and Ile-863) function at the step of initiation of RNA synthesis, whereas the fourth residue (Lys-330) functions by interacting with the viral NS3 helicase domain. Collectively, our results have provided direct evidence for the hypothesis that cavity B, but not cavity A, from dengue virus NS5 polymerase could be a target for rational drug design.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.207052182,-0.054248942,-0.080836176,0.078662241,-0.055721683,-0.029847498,0.051422162,0.003590564,-0.032766506,0.034728932,0.049680049,0.10870924,-0.06229327,-0.058149521,-0.069485553,-0.081154604,0.079634064,-0.025988206,-0.019417987,-0.004291145,-0.003084147,-0.006527369,0.015027644,-0.0462011,0.047729734,0.111907026,0.038216779,-0.019430987,0.014766704,0.076988031
Viral Etiology of Acute Febrile Respiratory Illnesses in Hospitalized Children Younger Than 24 Months,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory infections are a leading cause of pediatric hospitalizations. This study investigated whether virus–virus or virus–Bordetella co-infections are more frequent or more severe than previously recognized. METHODS: This is a 3-year prospective study of children younger than 24 months hospitalized with a febrile respiratory illness. Viral pathogens were detected using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunoassays, and/or viral cultures from nasopharyngeal samples. Bordetella infections were detected by PCR. RESULTS: A total of 201 patients were enrolled. Respiratory viruses were detected in 187 (93%) patients, with 52 (28%) multipathogen infections. The most common viruses detected were respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus/enterovirus. There were no differences in illness severity when comparing patients infected with one pathogen and those with multipathogen infection.

Rotavirus Replication Requires a Functional Proteasome for Effective Assembly of Viroplasms,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system has been shown to play an important role in the replication cycle of different viruses. In this study, we describe a strong impairment of rotavirus replication upon inhibition of proteasomal activity. The effect was evidenced at the level of accumulation of viral proteins, viral RNA, and yield of infective particles. Kinetic studies revealed that the early steps of the replicative cycle following attachment, entry, and uncoating were clearly more sensitive to proteasome inhibition. We ruled out a direct inhibition of the viral polymerase activities and stability of viral proteins and found that the crucial step that was impaired by blocking proteasome activity was the assembly of new viroplasms. This was demonstrated by using chemical inhibitors of proteasome and by gene silencing using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific for different proteasomal subunits and for the ubiquitin precursor RPS27A. In addition, we show that the effect of proteasome inhibition on virus infection is not due to increased levels of beta interferon (IFN-β).",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.120829035,-0.054761579,-0.029104015,0.005069465,-0.102289052,0.032597719,0.063476465,-0.019291524,0.037604563,0.026472474,0.001737807,-0.025013334,-0.01551409,0.084871623,0.015627396,0.006168317,-0.003506798,-0.012121649,0.018122415,0.025943756,-0.025274462,0.044107152,-0.019113268,-0.001823467,0.033869028,0.009110587,0.009517445,-0.037903908,-0.005484686,0.029371698
Outpatient Upper Respiratory Tract Viral Infections in Children with Malaria Symptoms in Western Kenya,"A cross-sectional study was performed in children 5 through 10 years of age presenting to outpatient clinics in Nyanza Province, Kenya, in which nasal swab and blood specimens were collected during the high malaria transmission season. Patients presenting with malaria-like symptoms within 4 days of fever onset were enrolled in the study. Plasmodium parasitemia was determined by blood smear microscopy. Nasal swabs were screened for a panel of respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction. Influenza A, rhinoviruses, and other respiratory viruses were detected in 18%, 26%, and 12% of 197 specimens, respectively. Four of 36 patients with influenza A had a positive malaria blood slide, compared with 20 of 52 patients with rhinovirus.

Long range interaction networks in the function and fidelity of poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase studied by nuclear magnetic resonance,"The fidelity of the poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3D(pol)) plays a direct role in the genomic evolution and pathogenesis of the virus. A single site mutation (Gly64Ser) that is remote from the catalytic center results in a higher fidelity polymerase. NMR studies with [methyl-(13)C]methionine-labeled protein were used to compare the solution structure and dynamics of wild-type and Gly64Ser 3D(pol). The chemical shifts for the Met6 resonance were significantly different between wild-type and Gly64Ser 3D(pol) when bound in ternary complexes with RNA and incorrect, but not with correct, nucleotide, suggesting that the Gly64Ser mutation induces structural changes in the N-terminal β-strand when the enzyme is bound to incorrect, but not correct nucleotide. We also observe changes in the transverse relaxation times for methionines near regions important for nucleotide and RNA binding, and catalysis. Our strategy to assign the [methyl-(13)C]methionine resonances involved separately mutating each of the seventeen methionines. Several substitutions produced additional resonances for both Met6 and Met187, a reporter for RNA binding and conformational changes in the highly conserved motif B loop, even though these methionines are greater than 20 Å apart. The results for Gly64Ser and the other mutants are intriguing considering that they can result in structural and/or dynamic changes to methionines distant from the site of mutation. We propose that there is a long-distance network operating throughout 3D(pol) that coordinates ligand binding, conformational changes and catalysis. Mutation of Gly64 results in structural and/or dynamic changes to the network that may affect polymerase fidelity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.1749785,-0.047862843,-0.047242536,0.041523268,-0.034645802,-0.029003762,0.030560348,0.015410933,-0.044536687,0.010204358,0.059072169,0.086788264,-0.081290186,-0.047682041,-0.038488978,0.009938875,0.003699452,-0.065894346,-0.108124663,-0.052434036,0.087599325,-0.062584463,0.02400839,0.07223294,-0.026938754,0.007728075,0.005835956,-0.009368449,-0.031816823,-0.100356589
PNRC accumulates in the nucleolus by interaction with B23/nucleophosmin via its nucleolar localization sequence,"PNRC (proline-rich nuclear receptor coregulatory protein) was primarily identified as a coactivator of nuclear receptors (NRs) by our laboratory, which enhances NR-mediated transcription by RNA polymerase II. Recent study has shown that PNRC also stimulates RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription through interaction with the subunit RPC39 of RNA polymerase III. Here, we report that PNRC accumulates in the nucleolus and its depletion by small interfering RNA (siRNA) impairs pre-rRNA transcription by RNA polymerase I. We identified the sequence at position 94–101 ((94)PKKRRKKK(101)) of PNRC as its nucleolar localization sequence (NoLS). Fusion of this sequence to GFP directed GFP to the nucleolus. Characterization of the NoLS revealed that the stretches of six successive basic residues are sufficient to function as a NoLS. Through co-immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrated that the NoLS is necessary and sufficient to mediate the association of PNRC with B23/nucleophosmin. Moreover, B23 depletion by siRNA disrupted the accumulation of PNRC in the nucleolus. Together, our study indicates that PNRC is a novel nucleolar protein that might be involved in regulation of pre-rRNA synthesis, and it localizes to the nucleolus by interaction with B23 via its NoLS. Our study also suggests that the stretches of six successive basic residues (lysine and/or arginine) function as NoLS.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.158510843,-0.041034392,-0.027435023,0.005362272,-0.021157268,-0.040636354,-0.022473731,0.016079789,-0.005742787,-0.035926162,-0.012358925,0.010748738,-0.020894031,0.001230647,-0.013415015,-0.001655409,0.019878811,-0.024085965,-0.041621449,-0.018503319,-0.019281303,0.013395316,-0.036816,-0.033558115,0.020536887,-0.022855046,-0.016835343,0.022436332,0.044319539,-0.008750765
Nuclear Import of Cytoplasmic Poly(A) Binding Protein Restricts Gene Expression via Hyperadenylation and Nuclear Retention of mRNA,"Poly(A) tail length is emerging as an important marker of mRNA fate, where deviations from the canonical length can signal degradation or nuclear retention of transcripts. Pathways regulating polyadenylation thus have the potential to broadly influence gene expression. Here we demonstrate that accumulation of cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein (PABPC) in the nucleus, which can occur during viral infection or other forms of cellular stress, causes mRNA hyperadenylation and nuclear accumulation of poly(A) RNA. This inhibits gene expression but does not affect mRNA stability. Unexpectedly, PABPC-induced hyperadenylation can occur independently of mRNA 3′-end processing yet requires the canonical mRNA poly(A) polymerase II. We find that nuclear PABPC-induced hyperadenylation is triggered by multiple divergent viral factors, suggesting that altering the subcellular localization of PABPC may be a commonly used mechanism to regulate cellular gene expression in a polyadenylation-linked manner.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.147048594,-0.059657814,-0.028349218,-0.086639154,-0.076377578,0.001539827,-0.019416984,-0.03353256,0.057677805,-0.055252783,-0.095322634,-0.073031086,0.01353838,0.068638101,-0.04527509,0.01437859,0.013500546,-0.090192283,-0.077473371,-0.025720574,0.011935876,0.031676249,-0.01040803,-0.008103261,0.003569388,-0.108126418,-0.029890536,0.02674119,0.140979461,-0.005853059
The Ubiquitin-Proteasome System Regulates the Accumulation of Turnip yellow mosaic virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase during Viral Infection([W]),"Replication of positive-strand RNA viruses, the largest group of plant viruses, is initiated by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Given its essential function in viral replication, understanding the regulation of RdRp is of great importance. Here, we show that Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) RdRp (termed 66K) is degraded by the proteasome at late time points during viral infection and that the accumulation level of 66K affects viral RNA replication in infected Arabidopsis thaliana cells. We mapped the cis-determinants responsible for 66K degradation within its N-terminal noncatalytic domain, but we conclude that 66K is not a natural N-end rule substrate. Instead, we show that a proposed PEST sequence within 66K functions as a transferable degradation motif. In addition, several Lys residues that constitute target sites for ubiquitylation were mapped; mutation of these Lys residues leads to stabilization of 66K. Altogether, these results demonstrate that TYMV RdRp is a target of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in plant cells and support the idea that proteasomal degradation may constitute yet another fundamental level of regulation of viral replication.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.208799157,-0.068832316,-0.097421715,0.117978005,-0.074542304,-0.062809279,0.071044631,0.017489394,-0.052746258,0.048629145,0.090524391,0.057256743,-0.080582923,0.043075128,-0.020719779,-0.010348877,0.030173526,-0.071578779,-0.027516557,0.000597753,0.018896053,0.006659127,-0.001603446,-0.051353698,-0.01164309,0.025594176,0.016346479,0.006957784,0.014056282,0.032626439
Membrane-shaping host reticulon proteins play crucial roles in viral RNA replication compartment formation and function,"Positive-strand RNA viruses replicate their genomes on membranes with virus-induced rearrangements such as single- or double-membrane vesicles, but the mechanisms of such rearrangements, including the role of host proteins, are poorly understood. Brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNA synthesis occurs in ≈70 nm, negatively curved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane invaginations induced by multifunctional BMV protein 1a. We show that BMV RNA replication is inhibited 80–90% by deleting the reticulon homology proteins (RHPs), a family of membrane-shaping proteins that normally induce and stabilize positively curved peripheral ER membrane tubules. In RHP-depleted cells, 1a localized normally to perinuclear ER membranes and recruited the BMV 2a(pol) polymerase. However, 1a failed to induce ER replication compartments or to recruit viral RNA templates. Partial RHP depletion allowed formation of functional replication vesicles but reduced their diameter by 30–50%. RHPs coimmunoprecipitated with 1a and 1a expression redirected >50% of RHPs from peripheral ER tubules to the interior of BMV-induced RNA replication compartments on perinuclear ER. Moreover, RHP-GFP fusions retained 1a interaction but shifted 1a-induced membrane rearrangements from normal vesicles to double membrane layers, a phenotype also induced by excess 1a-interacting 2a(pol). Thus, RHPs interact with 1a, are incorporated into RNA replication compartments, and are required for multiple 1a functions in replication compartment formation and function. The results suggest possible RHP roles in the bodies and necks of replication vesicles.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.175785709,-0.067801828,-0.066949673,0.024028483,-0.087180868,-0.043913129,0.009985358,0.01605369,0.00534784,-0.017482396,0.031692658,-0.009835902,-0.052979989,0.109635066,-0.007949467,0.037941552,0.043076954,-0.076623792,0.016979544,0.020090669,-0.065538488,0.044036497,-0.072480043,-0.094816321,0.023525755,-0.054053794,-0.087594277,0.027035985,-0.057366416,-0.040369366
MTA1 Coregulator Regulates LPS Response via MyD88-dependent Signaling,"Although metastasis tumor antigen 1 (MTA1) contributes to the responsiveness of macrophages to LPS, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we investigated the role of MTA1 in the regulation of expression and function of MyD88, a proximal component of NF-κB signaling. We discovered that MTA1 targets MyD88 and that MyD88 is a NF-κB-responsive gene in LPS-stimulated macrophages. We found that MTA1 is required for MyD88-dependent stimulation of NF-κB signaling and expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, MIP2, and TNF-α as MTA1 depletion leads to a substantial reduction in the expression of NF-κB target genes. In addition, LPS-mediated stimulation of MyD88 transcription was accompanied by an enhanced recruitment of MTA1, RNA polymerase II, and p65RelA complex to the NF-κB consensus sites in the MyD88 promoter. Interestingly, the recruitment of both MTA1 and MyD88 expression is effectively blocked by NF-κB inhibitor parthenolide. Selective knockdown of MyD88 by a dominant negative mutant of MyD88 or selective siRNA also impairs the ability of LPS to stimulate the NF-κB target genes. These findings reveal an inherent coregulatory role of MTA1 upon the expression of MyD88 and suggest that MTA1 regulation of MyD88 may constitute at least one of the mechanisms by which MTA1 stimulates LPS-induced NF-κB signaling in stimulated macrophages.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.070688399,-0.029555883,0.002354821,-0.106075938,-0.055641725,0.038835651,0.024435849,-0.022104337,0.036894965,-0.053842072,-0.040018232,0.003764601,-0.023026118,0.044064134,-0.010512969,0.031219687,-0.000918378,-0.041555132,-0.036154694,-0.048356104,0.030850303,-0.030351543,0.014648875,-0.008857674,-0.017364577,-0.024425206,-0.008776927,0.033141332,0.055307422,-0.055383166
Coexistence of Different Genotypes in the Same Bat and Serological Characterization of Rousettus Bat Coronavirus HKU9 Belonging to a Novel Betacoronavirus Subgroup,"Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9 (Ro-BatCoV HKU9), a recently identified coronavirus of novel Betacoronavirus subgroup D, from Leschenault's rousette, was previously found to display marked sequence polymorphism among genomes of four strains. Among 10 bats with complete RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes sequenced, three and two sequence clades for all three genes were codetected in two and five bats, respectively, suggesting the coexistence of two or three distinct genotypes of Ro-BatCoV HKU9 in the same bat. Complete genome sequencing of the distinct genotypes from two bats, using degenerate/genome-specific primers with overlapping sequences confirmed by specific PCR, supported the coexistence of at least two distinct genomes in each bat. Recombination analysis using eight Ro-BatCoV HKU9 genomes showed possible recombination events between strains from different bat individuals, which may have allowed for the generation of different genotypes. Western blot assays using recombinant N proteins of Ro-BatCoV HKU9, Betacoronavirus subgroup A (HCoV-HKU1), subgroup B (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV), and subgroup C (Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5) coronaviruses were subgroup specific, supporting their classification as separate subgroups under Betacoronavirus. Antibodies were detected in 75 (43%) of 175 and 224 (64%) of 350 tested serum samples from Leschenault's rousette bats by Ro-BatCoV HKU9 N-protein-based Western blot and enzyme immunoassays, respectively. This is the first report describing coinfection of different coronavirus genotypes in bats and coronavirus genotypes of diverse nucleotide variation in the same host. Such unique phenomena, and the unusual instability of ORF7a, are likely due to recombination which may have been facilitated by the dense roosting behavior and long foraging range of Leschenault's rousette.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.099674576,0.031292763,-0.006968205,-0.038425576,0.24581364,0.061681068,0.136516848,0.045313978,-0.073407439,-0.050822126,-0.069188798,-0.003070142,-0.001308336,0.041110303,-0.041362053,0.047059113,-0.000456609,0.030940532,-0.011641546,-0.03516028,0.000305502,-0.022843525,0.031174109,-0.040411121,0.018391075,0.007321929,0.040921559,-0.010195368,-0.028137383,0.048841679
"Rift Valley Fever Virus Epidemic in Kenya, 2006/2007: The Entomologic Investigations","In December 2006, Rift Valley fever (RVF) was diagnosed in humans in Garissa Hospital, Kenya and an outbreak reported affecting 11 districts. Entomologic surveillance was performed in four districts to determine the epidemic/epizootic vectors of RVF virus (RVFV). Approximately 297,000 mosquitoes were collected, 164,626 identified to species, 72,058 sorted into 3,003 pools and tested for RVFV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Seventy-seven pools representing 10 species tested positive for RVFV, including Aedes mcintoshi/circumluteolus (26 pools), Aedes ochraceus (23 pools), Mansonia uniformis (15 pools); Culex poicilipes, Culex bitaeniorhynchus (3 pools each); Anopheles squamosus, Mansonia africana (2 pools each); Culex quinquefasciatus, Culex univittatus, Aedes pembaensis (1 pool each). Positive Ae. pembaensis, Cx. univittatus, and Cx. bitaeniorhynchus was a first time observation. Species composition, densities, and infection varied among districts supporting hypothesis that different mosquito species serve as epizootic/epidemic vectors of RVFV in diverse ecologies, creating a complex epidemiologic pattern in East Africa.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.005406324,-0.003831429,0.003770469,-0.059640616,0.04524005,0.030287573,0.041257256,0.036554412,-0.016893272,-0.043554517,-0.004872474,0.010276686,-0.034723843,-0.00722316,0.031597834,0.021401416,-0.018827824,0.006003805,-0.009961827,-0.006601442,-0.008904168,0.002324151,-0.023019849,-0.023894852,-0.003127558,0.021903647,-0.002798256,0.046861331,0.000165719,0.000135684
Genomic Characterization of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus in European Bats and Classification of Coronaviruses Based on Partial RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Gene Sequences,"Bats may host emerging viruses, including coronaviruses (CoV). We conducted an evaluation of CoV in rhinolophid and vespertilionid bat species common in Europe. Rhinolophids carried severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related CoV at high frequencies and concentrations (26% of animals are positive; up to 2.4 × 10(8) copies per gram of feces), as well as two Alphacoronavirus clades, one novel and one related to the HKU2 clade. All three clades present in Miniopterus bats in China (HKU7, HKU8, and 1A related) were also present in European Miniopterus bats. An additional novel Alphacoronavirus clade (bat CoV [BtCoV]/BNM98-30) was detected in Nyctalus leisleri. A CoV grouping criterion was developed by comparing amino acid identities across an 816-bp fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) of all accepted mammalian CoV species (RdRp-based grouping units [RGU]). Criteria for defining separate RGU in mammalian CoV were a >4.8% amino acid distance for alphacoronaviruses and a >6.3% distance for betacoronaviruses. All the above-mentioned novel clades represented independent RGU. Strict associations between CoV RGU and host bat genera were confirmed for six independent RGU represented simultaneously in China and Europe. A SARS-related virus (BtCoV/BM48-31/Bulgaria/2008) from a Rhinolophus blasii (Rhi bla) bat was fully sequenced. It is predicted that proteins 3b and 6 were highly divergent from those proteins in all known SARS-related CoV. Open reading frame 8 (ORF8) was surprisingly absent. Surface expression of spike and staining with sera of SARS survivors suggested low antigenic overlap with SARS CoV. However, the receptor binding domain of SARS CoV showed higher similarity with that of BtCoV/BM48-31/Bulgaria/2008 than with that of any Chinese bat-borne CoV. Critical spike domains 472 and 487 were identical and similar, respectively.

Persistence of Adenovirus Nucleic Acids in Nasopharyngeal Secretions: A Diagnostic Conundrum,"BACKGROUND: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays increase the rate of viral detection in clinical specimens, compared with conventional virologic methods. Studies suggest that PCR may detect virus nucleic acid (NA) that persists in the respiratory tract. METHODS: We analyzed virologic data from children having frequent upper respiratory infections (URI) who were followed in a longitudinal study. Nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) were collected at URI onset and when acute otitis media (AOM) was diagnosed; virus studies were performed using conventional diagnostics and PCR. Repeated presence of adenovirus by PCR was further studied by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Of 581 URI episodes in 76 children, 510 viruses were detected. Of the viruses detected by PCR, 15% were those detected previously; repeated positives occurred most frequently with adenovirus. Sequencing results were available in 13 children with repeated adenovirus detection; four patterns of infection were identified (16 instances): 1) adenovirus of the same serotype and strain detected continuously (n=8 instances), 2) adenovirus of different serotypes detected during sequential URI episodes (n=3), 3) adenovirus of the same serotype but different strains detected during sequential URI episodes (n=3) and 4) adenovirus of the same serotype and strain detected intermittently (n=2). CONCLUSIONS: Among children with frequent URIs, repeated positive PCR results for adenovirus NA may represent a new serotype/strain, or persistence of viral NA. Results must be interpreted with caution; clinical correlation and presence of other viruses are important. Further longitudinal studies of children during and after infection are required for better understanding of the clinical significance of positive PCR tests for adenovirus NA in the respiratory tract .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.158810504,-0.058857953,0.039753431,0.026439961,0.084776835,-0.087180149,0.065381503,-0.061637712,0.035233906,0.063450031,0.006102355,-0.045606231,0.017696636,-0.035450235,0.064604341,-0.044855428,-0.010309339,-0.06593879,0.034146506,-0.111953345,-0.001498986,0.102615949,0.017628598,0.021761953,-0.029067879,0.050932305,0.000925002,0.027719162,-0.009017715,-0.01312241
Sequence-Function Analysis of the Sendai virus L protein domain VI,"The large (about 2200 amino acids) L polymerase protein of nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses (order Mononegavirales) has six conserved sequence regions (“domains”) postulated to constitute the specific enzymatic activities involved in viral mRNA synthesis, 5′-end capping, cap methylation, 3′ polyadenylation, and genomic RNA replication. Previous studies with vesicular stomatitis virus identified amino acid residues within the L protein domain VI required for mRNA cap methylation. In our recent study we analyzed four amino acid residues within domain VI of the Sendai virus L protein and our data indicated that there could be differences in L protein sequence requirements for cap methylation in two different families of Mononegavirales - rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses. In this study, we conducted a more comprehensive mutational analysis by targeting the entire SeV L protein domain VI, creating twenty-four L mutants, and testing these mutations for their effects on viral mRNA synthesis, cap methylation, viral genome replication and virus growth kinetics. Our analysis identified several residues required for successful cap methylation and virus replication and clearly showed the importance of the K-D-K-E tetrad and glycine-rich motif in the SeV cap methylation. This study is the first extensive sequence analysis of the L protein domain VI in the family Paramyxoviridae, and it confirms structural and functional similarity of this domain across different families of the order Mononegavirales.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.160076983,-0.084557082,-0.069460591,0.012268807,-0.012738506,-0.049376297,-0.041938314,0.020557686,-0.064858131,0.028130835,-0.087442831,-0.006097716,0.023257938,-0.052943072,-0.091117718,-0.110867792,0.065682916,-0.048004778,-0.072012082,0.099084973,-0.014144038,0.085848072,0.121637877,0.027066803,0.115670523,-0.019146723,-0.009774805,0.025525282,0.117872996,0.043832257
Evaluation of reference genes for quantitative reverse‐transcription polymerase chain reaction normalization in infected tomato plants,"The quantification of messenger RNA expression levels by real‐time reverse‐transcription polymerase chain reaction requires the availability of reference genes that are stably expressed regardless of the experimental conditions under study. We examined the expression variations of a set of eight candidate reference genes in tomato leaf and root tissues subjected to the infection of five taxonomically and molecularly different plant viruses and a viroid, inducing diverse pathogenic effects on inoculated plants. Parallel analyses by three commonly used dedicated algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper, showed that different viral infections and tissues of origin influenced, to some extent, the expression levels of these genes. However, all algorithms showed high levels of stability for glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate dehydrogenase and ubiquitin, indicated as the most suitable endogenous transcripts for normalization in both tissue types. Actin and uridylate kinase were also stably expressed throughout the infected tissues, whereas cyclophilin showed tissue‐specific expression stability only in root samples. By contrast, two widely employed reference genes, 18S ribosomal RNA and elongation factor 1α, demonstrated highly variable expression levels that should discourage their use for normalization. In addition, expression level analysis of ascorbate peroxidase and superoxide dismutase showed the modulation of the two genes in virus‐infected tomato leaves and roots. The relative quantification of the two genes varied according to the reference genes selected, thus highlighting the importance of the choice of the correct normalization method in such experiments.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.090863239,-0.021770989,0.048005347,-0.095714261,-0.022045643,0.031075975,0.006898468,-0.045466688,0.046004031,-0.029539212,-0.076323055,-0.058985142,0.00176618,0.105721282,-0.007065473,-0.032620317,-0.015702911,-0.078617677,-0.046848188,-0.077506695,0.041709424,-0.017480923,0.022319704,0.03701912,-0.138237735,-0.069184266,0.03334705,0.063436173,0.058336086,-0.038385322
Construction and characterization of calreticulin-HBsAg fusion gene recombinant adenovirus expression vector,"AIM: To generate recombinant adenoviral vector containing calreticulin (CRT)-hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) fusion gene for developing a safe, effective and HBsAg-specific therapeutic vaccine. METHODS: CRT and HBsAg gene were fused using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), endonuclease digestion and ligation methods. The fusion gene was cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO transfer vector after the base pairs of DNA (CACC) sequence was added to the 5′ end. Adenoviral expression vector containing CRT-HBsAg fusion gene was constructed by homologous recombinantion. The human embryo kidney (HEK) 293A cells were transfected with linearized DNA plasmid of the recombinant adenoviral vector to package and amplify recombinant adenovirus. The recombinant adenovirus titer was characterized using the end-dilution assay. The expression of the CRT/HBsAg fusion protein in Ad-CRT/HBsAg infected 293A cells was detected by Western blotting. RESULTS: The CRT-HBsAg fusion gene was characterized by PCR and sequencing and its length and sequence were confirmed to be accurate. The CRT-HBsAg fusion gene recombinant pENTR/D-TOPO transfer vector was constructed. The recombinant adenoviral vector, Ad-CRT/HBsAg, was generated successfully. The titer of Ad-CRT/HBsAg was characterized as 3.9 × 10(11) pfu/mL. The CRT-HBsAg fusion protein was expressed by HEK 293A cells correctly.

Lifestyles of plant viruses,"The vast majority of well-characterized eukaryotic viruses are those that cause acute or chronic infections in humans and domestic plants and animals. However, asymptomatic persistent viruses have been described in animals, and are thought to be sources for emerging acute viruses. Although not previously described in these terms, there are also many viruses of plants that maintain a persistent lifestyle. They have been largely ignored because they do not generally cause disease. The persistent viruses in plants belong to the family Partitiviridae or the genus Endornavirus. These groups also have members that infect fungi. Phylogenetic analysis of the partitivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes suggests that these viruses have been transmitted between plants and fungi. Additional families of viruses traditionally thought to be fungal viruses are also found frequently in plants, and may represent a similar scenario of persistent lifestyles, and some acute or chronic viruses of crop plants may maintain a persistent lifestyle in wild plants. Persistent, chronic and acute lifestyles of plant viruses are contrasted from both a functional and evolutionary perspective, and the potential role of these lifestyles in host evolution is discussed.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.038849463,-0.048911836,-0.030405527,0.031506786,0.057688616,0.022464284,0.094757131,0.019595038,-0.04230017,0.047486475,0.002987842,-0.017694654,0.027028189,-0.007621656,0.043723277,-0.018894625,-0.015128777,-0.031020855,-0.010082615,0.010078683,0.033737221,-0.020689304,-0.083713883,0.082434822,-0.065293625,-0.025646302,-0.007536292,-0.016384775,0.014218433,-0.077980224
Subgenomic messenger RNA amplification in coronaviruses,"Coronaviruses possess the largest known RNA genome, a 27- to 32-kb (+)-strand molecule that replicates in the cytoplasm. During virus replication, a 3′ coterminal nested set of five to eight subgenomic (sg) mRNAs are made that are also 5′ coterminal with the genome, because they carry the genomic leader as the result of discontinuous transcription at intergenic donor signals during (−)-strand synthesis when templates for sgmRNA synthesis are made. An unanswered question is whether the sgmRNAs, which appear rapidly and abundantly, undergo posttranscriptional amplification. Here, using RT-PCR and sequence analyses of head-to-tail–ligated (−) strands, we show that after transfection of an in vitro–generated marked sgmRNA into virus-infected cells, the sgmRNA, like the genome, can function as a template for (−)-strand synthesis. Furthermore, when the transfected sgmRNA contains an internally placed RNA-dependent RNA polymerase template-switching donor signal, discontinuous transcription occurs at this site, and a shorter, 3′ terminally nested leader-containing sgmRNA is made, as evidenced by its leader–body junction and by the expression of a GFP gene. Thus, in principle, the longer-nested sgmRNAs in a natural infection, all of which contain potential internal template-switching donor signals, can function to increase the number of the shorter 3′-nested sgmRNAs. One predicted advantage of this behavior for coronavirus survivability is an increased chance of maintaining genome fitness in the 3′ one-third of the genome via a homologous recombination between the (now independently abundant) WT sgmRNA and a defective genome.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.167035414,-0.036001603,-0.007160524,0.035515046,0.031196272,-0.092886113,-0.080348787,0.035471751,-0.024360756,-0.052489164,-0.003436095,-0.036009746,0.016921622,0.018742603,0.046253843,0.07867,-0.042201199,0.018571793,-0.022860064,-0.019249155,-0.007588753,-0.006117933,-0.034580691,-0.019227609,-0.006462135,-0.070920813,-0.04152528,0.026865417,0.066915671,-0.01529231

Viral shedding and clinical illness in naturally acquired influenza virus infections,"BACKGROUND: Volunteer challenge studies have provided detailed data on viral shedding from the respiratory tract before and through the course of experimental influenza virus infection. There are no comparable quantitative data on naturally-acquired infections. METHODS: In a community-based study in Hong Kong in 2008, we followed up initially well individuals to quantify trends in viral shedding based on culture and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) through the course of illness associated with seasonal influenza A and B virus infection. RESULTS: Trends in symptom scores more closely matched changes in molecular viral loads measured by RT-PCR for influenza A than influenza B. For influenza A virus infections, replicating viral loads measured by culture declined to undetectable levels earlier after illness onset than molecular viral loads. Most viral shedding occurred during the first 2–3 days after illness onset and we estimated that 1–8% of infectiousness occurs prior to illness onset. Only 14% of infections with detectable shedding by RT-PCR were asymptomatic, and viral shedding was low in these cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that ‘silent spreaders’ (i.e. individuals who are infectious while asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic) may be less important in the spread of influenza epidemics than previously thought.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.137479499,-0.050449553,0.005883648,0.121108396,-0.044021579,0.14656457,-0.063803837,-0.021378069,-0.006446162,-0.046489372,0.069463112,-0.060617881,0.039525071,0.05033223,0.006839106,-0.009293193,0.007774407,-0.01292904,-0.042187926,-0.026149025,-0.051354899,0.008205255,-0.062283929,0.018915776,-0.001839261,-0.00104011,0.051321718,-0.049732824,0.04565235,0.052042245
Different profiles of cytokine expression during mild and severe acute pancreatitis,"AIM: To study secretion patterns of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and activation of various cellular subsets of leukocytes in peripheral blood. METHODS: We have conducted a prospective observational study. One hundred and eight patients with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and onset of the disease within last 72 h were included in this study. The mRNA expression of 25 different types of cytokines in white blood cells was determined by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. Levels of 8 different cytokines in blood serum were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Clinical data and cytokine expression results were subjected to statistical analysis. RESULTS: Severe and necrotizing acute pancreatitis (AP) is characterized by the significant depletion of circulating lymphocytes. Severe acute pancreatitis is associated with a typical systemic inflammatory response syndrome and over-expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)]. Serum IL-6 and MIF concentrations are the best discriminators of severe and necrotizing AP as well as possible fatal outcome during the early course of the disease. CONCLUSION: Deregulation of cellular immune system is a key event leading to severe and necrotizing AP.

"Effects of oseltamivir treatment on duration of clinical illness and viral shedding, and household transmission of influenza virus","BACKGROUND: Large clinical trials have demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of oseltamivir against influenza. Here we assessed its indirect effectiveness in reducing household secondary transmission in an incident cohort of influenza index cases and their household members. METHODS: We recruited index outpatients whose rapid tests for influenza were positive in 2007 and 2008. Household contacts were followed for 7–10 days during 3–4 home visits to monitor symptoms. Nose and throat swabs were collected and tested for influenza by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or viral culture. RESULTS: We followed 384 index cases and their household contacts. Index cases who took oseltamivir within 24 hours of symptom onset halved the time to symptom alleviation (adjusted acceleration factor (AF) 0.56; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.76). Oseltamivir treatment was not associated with statistically significant reduction in the duration of viral shedding. Household contacts of index cases who had taken oseltamivir within 24 hours of onset had a non-statistically significant lower risk of developing laboratory-confirmed infection (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.54; 95% CI: 0.11, 2.57) and a marginally statistically significant lower risk of clinical illness (adjusted OR 0.52; 95% CI: 0.25, 1.08) compared to contacts of index cases who did not take oseltamivir.

The Diagnosis of Viral Respiratory Disease in Older Adults,"Viral respiratory disease in older adults has been increasingly recognized as a significant cause of hospitalizations and death. Unfortunately, the recognition and diagnosis of infection due to many viral respiratory pathogens in older adults can be elusive due to atypical clinical presentations and the insensitivity of current laboratory diagnostic tests in this population. For influenza diagnosis, rapid antigen tests followed by viral culture if negative, can be useful in older adults as long as clinicians are mindful of test limitations. Although specific, rapid antigen tests are insensitive in this population. Erroneous negative results may lead to delays in timely administration of antiviral treatment and institution of appropriate isolation precautions. The increasing availability of new rapid and sensitive molecular diagnostics such as polymerase chain reaction testing, should provide more accurate and timely diagnoses of viral respiratory infections in older adults in the near future.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.113683032,-0.022093931,0.020740804,0.045524477,-0.092129044,0.039964319,0.032287017,0.025275966,0.014696764,0.066112079,-0.015183919,-0.017336136,0.095466779,-0.063245977,0.01595338,-0.016151213,-0.026594846,0.047544315,-0.057123493,-0.000525389,-0.013196601,-0.062563297,0.004639962,-0.088154421,0.036278796,-0.025467783,-0.010372662,-0.053392041,0.008479696,0.04495789
Application of the Ibis-T5000 Pan-Orthopoxvirus Assay to Quantitatively Detect Monkeypox Viral Loads in Clinical Specimens from Macaques Experimentally Infected with Aerosolized Monkeypox Virus,"Monkeypox virus (MPXV), a member of the family Poxviridae and genus Orthopoxvirus, causes a smallpox-like disease in humans. A previously described pan-Orthopoxvirus assay, based on a broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS), was evaluated for its ability to detect MPXV from spiked human and aerosol-infected cynomolgous macaque (Macaca fascicularis) samples. Detection of MPXV DNA from macaque tissue, blood, and spiked human blood by the PCR/ESI-MS pan-Orthopoxvirus assay was comparable, albeit at slightly higher levels, to the current gold standard method of real-time PCR with the pan-Orthopoxvirus assay and had a limit of detection of 200 plaque-forming units. Furthermore, the platform was able to distinguish MPXV and vaccinia viruses that were spiked into macaque blood samples at various concentrations. This platform provides a new tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of orthopoxviral loads during vaccine or antiviral studies, but also could provide rapid identification during natural outbreaks or bioterrorism attacks.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.021086515,0.055966665,0.180916403,0.02826644,-0.029023585,0.01163498,0.06432663,-0.007460864,-0.007505394,0.02449914,-0.002339545,-0.0235693,0.035579862,0.014088203,0.007558671,-0.022282363,-0.002512811,-0.0030852,0.022122275,-0.079031051,0.040994377,0.028104555,0.050342278,-0.014292717,-0.05239103,-0.008021499,0.011553752,-0.025222751,0.001626795,-0.010394799
"Distributions of HLA-A and -B alleles and haplotypes in the Yi ethnic minority of Yunnan, China: relationship to other populations","Objective: To investigate the distributions of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A and -B alleles and HLA-A-B haplotypes in the Yi ethnic minority of the Yunnan Province, situated in southwestern China. Methods: DNA typing for HLA-A and -B loci was performed using the polymerase chain reaction-sequence-based typing (PCR-SBT) method on 114 randomly selected healthy individuals of the Yi population. The allelic frequencies of HLA-A and -B loci were calculated by direct counting and HLA-A-B haplotypes were estimated using the expectation maximization algorithm. Results: A total of 17 HLA-A and 38 HLA-B alleles were found in the Yi population. The most frequent alleles were A*2402 (32.46%), A*1101 (26.32%), and A*0203 (10.09%) at the HLA-A locus and B*4601 (12.28%), B*1525 (10.09%), B*4001 (8.77%), and B*3802 (7.89%) at the HLA-B locus. The predominant HLA-A-B haplotypes were A*2402-B*1525 (7.86%) and A*0203-B*3802 (5.64%), followed by A*1101-B*4001 (4.69%). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the Yi population in the Honghe, Yunnan Province of China basically belongs to groups of southeastern Asian origin, but shares some characteristics with northeastern Asian groups. Conclusion: The present study may add to the understanding of HLA polymorphism in the Yi ethnic group that was poorly defined previously, and provide useful information for bone marrow transplantation, anthropological research, and forensic sciences as well as for disease-association studies.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.01148105,-0.018221589,0.019923034,-0.080043509,0.00851822,0.020494281,0.020484714,-0.005109603,-0.012376928,-0.022718868,-0.008587671,0.027162858,-0.019341598,-0.032786384,0.008993355,0.021800808,-0.020089661,-0.002458757,-0.010891927,-0.031853998,-0.000152627,-0.016645358,-0.008122961,-0.00182714,-0.01482934,-0.008377516,-0.009407244,0.012643496,-0.000581109,-0.005738128
Enzymatic and nonenzymatic functions of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases within oligomeric arrays,"Few antivirals are effective against positive-strand RNA viruses, primarily because the high error rate during replication of these viruses leads to the rapid development of drug resistance. One of the favored current targets for the development of antiviral compounds is the active site of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. However, like many subcellular processes, replication of the genomes of all positive-strand RNA viruses occurs in highly oligomeric complexes on the cytosolic surfaces of the intracellular membranes of infected host cells. In this study, catalytically inactive polymerases were shown to participate productively in functional oligomer formation and catalysis, as assayed by RNA template elongation. Direct protein transduction to introduce either active or inactive polymerases into cells infected with mutant virus confirmed the structural role for polymerase molecules during infection. Therefore, we suggest that targeting the active sites of polymerase molecules is not likely to be the best antiviral strategy, as inactivated polymerases do not inhibit replication of other viruses in the same cell and can, in fact, be useful in RNA replication complexes. On the other hand, polymerases that could not participate in functional RNA replication complexes were those that contained mutations in the amino terminus, leading to altered contacts in the folded polymerase and mutations in a known polymerase–polymerase interaction in the two-dimensional protein lattice. Thus, the functional nature of multimeric arrays of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase supplies a novel target for antiviral compounds and provides a new appreciation for enzymatic catalysis on membranous surfaces within cells.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.253903555,-0.073711858,-0.100938622,0.176116615,-0.109718045,-0.017346586,0.069339213,0.039182695,-0.012681943,0.063974888,0.086338938,0.019099055,-0.022244155,0.087184011,0.022055101,0.001224253,-0.017176746,0.027108686,0.044505001,0.045990941,-0.035473698,0.046107367,-0.048990273,-0.001615608,-0.009415094,-0.003816441,0.015024842,-0.019226297,-0.033610616,-0.010330352
NTPase and 5′ to 3′ RNA Duplex-Unwinding Activities of the Hepatitis E Virus Helicase Domain,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a causative agent of acute hepatitis, and it is the sole member of the genus Hepevirus in the family Hepeviridae. The open reading frame 1 (ORF1) protein of HEV encodes nonstructural polyprotein with putative domains for methyltransferase, cysteine protease, helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. It is not yet known whether ORF1 functions as a single protein with multiple domains or is processed to form separate functional units. On the basis of amino acid conserved motifs, HEV helicase has been grouped into helicase superfamily 1 (SF-1). In order to examine the RNA helicase activity of the NTPase/helicase domain of HEV, the region (amino acids 960 to 1204) was cloned and expressed as histidine-tagged protein in Escherichia coli (HEV Hel) and purified. HEV Hel exhibited NTPase and RNA unwinding activities. Enzyme hydrolyzed all rNTPs efficiently, dATP and dCTP with moderate efficiency, while it showed less hydrolysis of dGTP and dTTP. Enzyme showed unwinding of only RNA duplexes with 5′ overhangs showing 5′-to-3′ polarity. We also expressed and purified two HEV Hel mutants. Helicase mutant I, with substitution in the nucleotide-binding motif I (GKS to GAS), showed 30% ATPase activity. Helicase mutant II, with substitutions in the Mg(2+) binding motif II (DEAP to AAAP), showed 50% ATPase activity. Both mutants completely lost ability to unwind RNA duplexes with 5′ overhangs.

Nucleotide Analogues as Probes for DNA and RNA Polymerases,"Nucleotide analogues represent a major class of anti-cancer and anti-viral drugs, and provide an extremely powerful tool for dissecting the mechanisms of DNA and RNA polymerases. While the basic assays themselves are relatively straight-forward, a key issue is to appropriately design the studies to answer the mechanistic question of interest.

An Improved Reverse Genetics System for Mammalian Orthoreoviruses,"Mammalian orthoreoviruses (reoviruses) are highly useful models for studies of double-stranded RNA virus replication and pathogenesis. We previously developed a strategy to recover prototype reovirus strain T3D from cloned cDNAs transfected into murine L929 fibroblast cells. Here, we report the development of a second-generation reovirus reverse genetics system featuring several major improvements: (1) the capacity to rescue prototype reovirus strain T1L, (2) reduction of required plasmids from ten to four, and (3) isolation of recombinant viruses following transfection of baby hamster kidney cells engineered to express bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. The efficiency of virus rescue using the 4-plasmid strategy was substantially increased in comparison to the original 10-plasmid system. We observed full compatibility of T1L and T3D rescue vectors when intermixed to produce a panel of T1L × T3D monoreassortant viruses.

An N-Terminal Region of Lassa Virus L Protein Plays a Critical Role in Transcription but Not Replication of the Virus Genome,"The central domain of the 200-kDa Lassa virus L protein is a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. N- and C-terminal domains may harbor enzymatic functions important for viral mRNA synthesis, including capping enzymes or cap-snatching endoribonucleases. In the present study, we have employed a large-scale mutagenesis approach to map functionally relevant residues in these regions. The main targets were acidic (Asp and Glu) and basic residues (Lys and Arg) known to form catalytic and binding sites of capping enzymes and endoribonucleases. A total of 149 different mutants were generated and tested in the Lassa virus replicon system. Nearly 25% of evolutionarily highly conserved acidic and basic side chains were dispensable for function of L protein in the replicon context. The vast majority of the remaining mutants had defects in both transcription and replication. Seven residues (Asp-89, Glu-102, Asp-119, Lys-122, Asp-129, Glu-180, and Arg-185) were selectively important for mRNA synthesis. The phenotype was particularly pronounced for Asp-89, Glu-102, and Asp-129, which were indispensable for transcription but could be replaced by a variety of amino acid residues without affecting genome replication. Bioinformatics disclosed the remote similarity of this region to type IIs endonucleases. The mutagenesis was complemented by experiments with the RNA polymerase II inhibitor α-amanitin, demonstrating dependence of viral transcription from the cellular mRNA pool. In conclusion, this paper describes an N-terminal region in L protein being important for mRNA, but not genome synthesis. Bioinformatics and cell biological experiments lend support to the hypothesis that this region could be part of a cap-snatching enzyme.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.164238059,-0.059783936,-0.048888523,0.013169842,-0.036465547,-0.040453128,-0.022103216,0.010648188,-0.017700596,-0.013046142,-0.028707839,0.015133035,-0.002579646,-0.031485722,-0.057808381,-0.047597047,0.054373934,-0.039647892,-0.042892883,0.021022223,-0.016832819,0.027326546,0.032465941,-0.016760381,0.072162982,-0.013714083,-0.025706236,0.020895537,0.060755865,0.014102308
Human parainfluenza virus type 2 V protein inhibits interferon production and signaling and is required for replication in non-human primates,"In wild-type human parainfluenza virus type 2 (WT HPIV2), one gene (the P/V gene) encodes both the polymerase-associated phosphoprotein (P) and the accessory V protein. We generated a HPIV2 virus (rHPIV2-V(ko)) in which the P/V gene encodes only the P protein to examine the role of V in replication in vivo and as a potential live attenuated virus vaccine. Preventing expression of V protein severely impaired virus recovery from cDNA and growth in vitro, particularly in IFN-competent cells. rHPIV2-V(ko), unlike WT HPIV2, strongly induced IFN-β and permitted IFN signaling, leading to establishment of a robust antiviral state. rHPIV2-V(ko) infection induced extensive syncytia and cytopathicity that was due to both apoptosis and necrosis. Replication of rHPIV2-V(ko) was highly restricted in the respiratory tract of African green monkeys and in differentiated primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, suggesting that V protein is essential for efficient replication of HPIV2 in organized epithelial cells and that rHPIV2-V(ko) is over-attenuated for use as a live attenuated vaccine.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.118033066,-0.076116573,-0.038822247,-0.049450045,-0.071191948,0.060777012,-0.000195336,-0.071655627,0.114028587,-0.000702915,-0.06139242,-0.051227293,-0.012483238,0.089688867,-0.024033797,-0.033137867,0.014054013,-0.067324715,-6.76E-05,0.053813207,0.095929512,-0.017892382,0.067729243,0.051415287,0.043107937,0.070350705,0.015199379,-0.020364692,-0.070071647,-0.049316603
"Anatomical distribution of avian bornavirus in parrots, its occurrence in clinically healthy birds and ABV-antibody detection","Proventricular dilatation disease (PDD) is a fatal infectious disease of birds that primarily affects psittacine birds. Although a causative agent has not been formally demonstrated, the leading candidate is a novel avian bornavirus (ABV) detected in post-mortem tissue samples of psittacids with PDD from the USA, Israel and, recently, Germany. Here we describe the presence of ABV in a parrot with PDD as well as in clinically normal birds exposed to birds with PDD. In two ABV-positive post-mortem cases, the tissue distribution of ABV was investigated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Viraemia was observed in a PDD-affected bird whereas a restriction of ABV to nerve tissue was found in the non- PDD-affected bird. Healthy birds from the same aviary as the affected birds were also found to harbour the virus; 19/59 (32.2%) birds tested positive for ABV RNA in cloacal swabs, providing the first evidence of ABV in clinically healthy birds. In contrast, 39 birds from the same geographic area, but from two different aviaries without PDD cases in recent years, had negative cloacal swabs. ABV RNA-positive, clinically healthy birds demonstrated the same serological response as the animal with confirmed PDD. These results indicate that ABV infection may occur without clinical evidence of PDD and suggest that cloacal swabs can enable the non-invasive detection of ABV infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.010724011,-0.009908238,0.021809236,-0.071231182,0.003995976,0.028642476,0.010558737,0.009407347,-0.011728185,-0.002593264,0.040346976,0.006482538,-0.017631134,-0.005419515,0.017823314,0.027549335,-0.015059707,-0.006753062,-0.00260256,-0.02216107,-0.009396475,0.012561808,-0.040819104,-0.023159807,-0.002328756,0.00236974,-0.023261224,0.018625817,0.005670558,-0.037950666
Broadly reactive pan-paramyxovirus reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis for the detection of Canine distemper virus in a case of canine meningoencephalitis of unknown etiology,"Despite the immunologic protection associated with routine vaccination protocols, Canine distemper virus (CDV) remains an important pathogen of dogs. Antemortem diagnosis of systemic CDV infection may be made by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or immunohistochemical testing for CDV antigen; central nervous system infection often requires postmortem confirmation via histopathology and immunohistochemistry. An 8-month-old intact male French Bulldog previously vaccinated for CDV presented with multifocal neurologic signs. Based on clinical and postmortem findings, the dog’s disease was categorized as a meningoencephalitis of unknown etiology. Broadly reactive, pan-paramyxovirus RT-PCR using consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primers, combined with sequence analysis, identified CDV amplicons in the dog’s brain. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of CDV antigens, and a specific CDV RT-PCR based on the phosphoprotein gene identified a wild-type versus vaccinal virus strain. This case illustrates the utility of broadly reactive PCR and sequence analysis for the identification of pathogens in diseases with unknown etiology.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.014765512,0.03032311,0.139149065,-0.0540787,0.034224171,0.007464373,-0.024095215,0.003299485,-0.018213717,-0.008361772,0.030288609,0.018717579,-0.013910832,-0.005499111,0.037068726,-0.030686328,0.007341268,-0.004753432,0.016031795,-0.025690791,0.184771494,0.109820278,-0.075524356,-0.001396395,0.18434451,-0.085665682,-0.027633771,-0.044667759,-0.000179844,0.061467256
Serum IP-10 as a Biomarker of Human Rhinovirus Infection at Exacerbation of COPD,"BACKGROUND: Human rhinovirus (HRV) is the most frequent virus associated with COPD exacerbations. Viral infections increase exacerbation severity and likelihood of hospitalization. As ease of sampling blood makes serum a more practical marker than sputum, we investigated whether changes in serum interferon-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) from baseline to exacerbation were higher in airway HRV-positive exacerbations and whether IP-10 levels related to HRV load. METHODS: One hundred thirty-six patients with COPD and 70 controls were included over 2 years and 72 exacerbations sampled. HRV positivity and load were determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in nasopharyngeal swabs and/or sputum at baseline and exacerbation. IP-10 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum and compared with HRV load. RESULTS: At baseline, serum IP-10 was higher in patients with COPD than controls; medians were 149.4 pg/mL (103-215) and 111.7 pg/mL (82-178), P = .02. The presence of HRV at baseline did not increase IP-10: patients with COPD, 166.9 pg/mL (110-240) and 149.4 pg/mL (103-215), P = .30; controls, 136.4 pg/mL (77-204) and 111.7 pg/mL (82-178), P = .53. IP-10 increased significantly from baseline to exacerbation in HRV-positive exacerbations: 154.9 pg/mL (114.0-195.1) to 207.5 pg/mL (142.1-333.5), P = .009. There was no change in IP-10 between baseline and exacerbation in HRV-negative exacerbations: 168.3 pg/mL (94.3-249.8) and 175.6 pg/mL (107.2-290.4), P = .49. At exacerbation, IP-10 correlated with sputum viral load: rho = 0.48; P = .02. In receiver operating characteristics analysis, the combination of IP-10 and coryzal symptoms gave an area under the curve of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.74-0.90). CONCLUSIONS: IP-10 increases from baseline to exacerbation in HRV-positive exacerbations and correlates with sputum HRV load. Serum IP-10 may be useful as a novel marker for these events.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.047806479,-0.04648323,-0.013540958,-0.121480085,-0.041253914,-0.046109151,0.031382467,-0.001158237,-0.042440544,-0.021156553,-0.015937702,-0.01264833,-0.071055216,0.025488279,-0.003483786,0.011914908,-0.001527797,-0.039967037,0.060927082,-0.05629142,-0.028488618,-0.118975496,-0.034846238,0.095802384,-0.122068323,0.105057848,-0.062308121,-0.022966933,0.062855032,0.250054934
The 3′ end of Turnip crinkle virus contains a highly interactive structure including a translational enhancer that is disrupted by binding to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,"Precise temporal control is needed for RNA viral genomes to translate sufficient replication-required products before clearing ribosomes and initiating replication. A 3′ translational enhancer in Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) overlaps an internal T-shaped structure (TSS) that binds to 60S ribosomal subunits. The higher-order structure in the region was examined through alteration of critical sequences revealing novel interactions between an H-type pseudoknot and upstream residues, and between the TSS and internal and terminal loops of an upstream hairpin. Our results suggest that the TSS forms a stable scaffold that allows for simultaneous interactions with external sequences through base pairings on both sides of its large internal symmetrical loop. Binding of TCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to the region potentiates a widespread conformational shift with substantial rearrangement of the TSS region, including the element required for efficient ribosome binding. Degrading the RdRp caused the RNA to resume its original conformation, suggesting that the initial conformation is thermodynamically favored. These results suggest that the 3′ end of TCV folds into a compact, highly interactive structure allowing RdRp access to multiple elements including the 3′ end, which causes structural changes that potentiate the shift between translation and replication.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.205968258,-0.051446653,-0.066390533,0.07815573,-0.011265547,-0.073060542,-0.012371151,0.038818066,-0.050413102,0.008540876,0.048372616,0.079692891,-0.058570358,-0.063614294,-0.055542687,-0.008971225,0.030752866,-0.028001294,-0.050159835,-0.058947143,0.013972601,-0.031704327,-0.014204164,-0.019756656,-0.028399988,-0.054976592,-0.015748284,0.046882831,0.099943562,-0.0079258
Detection of Four Human Coronaviruses in Respiratory Infections in Children: A One-Year Study in Colorado,"Lower respiratory tract infections are the leading cause of death in children worldwide. Studies on the epidemiology and clinical associations of the four human non-SARS human coronaviruses (HCoVs) using sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are needed to evaluate the clinical significance of HCoV infections worldwide. Pediatric respiratory specimens (1,683) submitted to a diagnostic virology laboratory over a 1-year period (December 2004–November 2005) that were negative for seven respiratory viruses by conventional methods were tested for RNA of four HCoVs using sensitive RT-PCR assays. Coronavirus RNAs were detected in 84 (5.0%) specimens: HCoV-NL63 in 37 specimens, HCoV-OC43 in 34, HCoV-229E in 11, and HCoV-HKU1 in 2. The majority of HCoV infections occurred during winter months, and over 62% were in previously healthy children. Twenty-six (41%) coronavirus positive patients had evidence of a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), 17 (26%) presented with vomiting and/or diarrhea, and 5 (8%) presented with meningoencephalitis or seizures. Respiratory specimens from one immunocompromised patient were persistently positive for HCoV-229E RNA for 3 months. HCoV-NL63-positive patients were nearly twice as likely to be hospitalized (P = 0.02) and to have a LRTI (P = 0.04) than HCoV-OC43-positive patients. HCoVs are associated with a small, but significant number (at least 2.4% of total samples submitted), of both upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses in children in Colorado. Our data raise the possibility that HCoV may play a role in gastrointestinal and CNS disease. Additional studies are needed to investigate the potential roles of HCoVs in these diseases.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.196367034,-0.015264892,-0.090679072,0.023160486,0.16275333,-0.165348184,0.081128281,-0.072372552,0.134273364,-0.07590992,-0.020248354,0.423507649,0.365514049,0.229737544,0.029479027,0.069837176,-0.054838245,-0.028858005,-0.069912579,0.012767368,-0.031100285,-0.020710103,0.028040133,-0.101565542,0.008311022,-0.020971818,0.047976258,-0.030008128,0.046059916,0.035014747
Genetic Heterogeneity and Recombination in Canine Noroviruses,"Alphatronlike (genogroup IV [GIV]) noroviruses (NoVs) have been recently identified in carnivores. By screening a collection of 183 fecal samples collected during 2007 from dogs with enteric signs, the overall NoV prevalence was found to be 2.2% (4/183). A unique strain, Bari/91/07/ITA, resembled GIV.2 NoVs in its ORF1 (polymerase complex), while it was genetically unrelated in its full-length ORF2 (capsid gene) to GIV animal and human NoVs (54.0 to 54.4% amino acid identity) and to any other NoV genogroup (<54.7% amino acid identity). It displayed the highest identity (58.1% amino acid identity) to unclassified human strain Chiba/040502/04/Jp. Interestingly, the very 5′ end of ORF2 of the canine virus matched short noroviral sequences (88.9% nucleotide identity and 98.9% amino acid identity) identified from oysters in Japan, indicating that similar viruses may be common environmental contaminants.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.055770381,-0.031762924,0.035245535,-0.087979706,0.098436467,0.032027442,-0.012678413,-0.006150575,-0.00862398,-0.016464194,-0.000809733,0.073472752,-0.012635896,-0.121651897,0.015022619,-0.08025578,-0.00159294,-0.001755173,0.023123625,-0.007476745,0.096302037,0.027036407,-0.050564596,0.029385359,0.071745192,-0.031301083,-0.031838175,-0.023258147,-0.055698449,0.043326625
"Turnip Mosaic Virus RNA Replication Complex Vesicles Are Mobile, Align with Microfilaments, and Are Each Derived from a Single Viral Genome","Nicotiana benthamiana plants were agroinoculated with an infectious cDNA clone of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) that was engineered to express a fluorescent protein (green fluorescent protein [GFP] or mCherry) fused to the viral 6K(2) protein known to induce vesicle formation. Cytoplasmic fluorescent discrete protein structures were observed in infected cells, corresponding to the vesicles containing the viral RNA replication complex. The vesicles were motile and aligned with microfilaments. Intracellular movement of the vesicles was inhibited when cells were infiltrated with latrunculin B, an inhibitor of microfilament polymerization. It was also observed that viral accumulation in the presence of this drug was reduced. These data indicate that microfilaments are used for vesicle movement and are necessary for virus production. Biogenesis of the vesicles was further investigated by infecting cells with two recombinant TuMV strains: one expressed 6K(2)GFP and the other expressed 6K(2)mCherry. Green- and red-only vesicles were observed within the same cell, suggesting that each vesicle originated from a single viral genome. There were also vesicles that exhibited sectors of green, red, or yellow fluorescence, an indication that fusion among individual vesicles is possible. Protoplasts derived from TuMV-infected N. benthamiana leaves were isolated. Using immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy, viral RNA synthesis sites were visualized as punctate structures distributed throughout the cytoplasm. The viral proteins VPg-Pro, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and cytoplasmic inclusion protein (helicase) and host translation factors were found to be associated with these structures. A single-genome origin and presence of protein synthetic machinery components suggest that translation of viral RNA is taking place within the vesicle.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.190691811,-0.068734943,-0.0522138,0.031680429,-0.070145475,-0.037296509,-0.010532707,-0.030061187,0.027032256,0.009304726,-0.019490149,-0.069515322,0.011288059,0.088771638,0.000182383,-0.028033717,0.037839564,-0.05821153,0.008773935,0.057110967,-0.055305402,0.072783761,-0.042694354,-0.040154877,0.021560437,0.018487433,0.018728618,-0.020673903,-0.068580285,0.083904217
Nosocomial Contamination of Laryngoscope Handles: Challenging Current Guidelines,"BACKGROUND: Laryngoscope blades are often cleaned between cases according to well-defined protocols. However, despite evidence that laryngoscope handles could be a source of nosocomial infection, neither our institution nor the American Society of Anesthesiologists has any specific guidelines for handle disinfection. We hypothesized that laryngoscope handles may be sufficiently contaminated with bacteria and viruses to justify the implementation of new handle-cleaning protocols. METHODS: Sixty laryngoscope handles from the adult operating rooms were sampled with premoistened sterile swabs. Collection was performed between cases, in operating rooms hosting a broad variety of subspecialty procedures, after the room and equipment had been thoroughly cleaned for the subsequent case. Samples from 40 handles were sent for aerobic bacterial culture, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for significant isolates. Samples from 20 handles were examined for viral contamination using a polymerase chain reaction assay that detects 17 respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Of the 40 samples sent for culture, 30 (75%) were positive for bacterial contamination. Of these positive cultures, 25 (62.5%) yielded coagulase-negative staphylococci, seven (17.5%) Bacillus spp. not anthracis, three (7.5%) α-hemolytic Streptococcus spp., and one each (2.5%) of Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Corynebacterium spp. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, or Gram-negative rods were detected. All viral tests were negative. CONCLUSION: We found a high incidence of bacterial contamination of laryngoscope handles despite low-level disinfection. However, no vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Gram-negative rods, or respiratory viruses were detected. Our results support adoption of guidelines that include, at a minimum, mandatory low-level disinfection of laryngoscope handles after each patient use.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.072346693,-0.017014984,0.024363964,-0.058311606,-0.018334904,0.003587685,0.026066001,0.050285089,-0.061005945,0.03754401,0.007685652,0.005918342,-0.014283488,-0.030586925,0.045560874,-0.018305316,-0.02733193,-0.029850725,0.019410402,-0.025692051,-0.010041166,0.04645809,0.021612398,-0.02494796,0.007957345,0.009792435,-0.007181002,0.002385962,0.002248169,-0.047277225
Multiple diagnostic tests to identify cattle with Bovine viral diarrhea virus and duration of positive test results in persistently infected cattle,"Several tests for Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) were applied to samples collected monthly from December 20, 2005, through November 27, 2006 (day 0 to day 342) from 12 persistently infected (PI) cattle with BVDV subtypes found in US cattle: BVDV-1a, BVDV-1b, and BVDV-2a. The samples included clotted blood for serum, nasal swabs, and fresh and formalin-fixed ear notches. The tests were as follows: titration of infectious virus in serum and nasal swabs; antigen-capture (AC) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or ACE, on serum, nasal swabs, and fresh ear notches; gel-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of serum, nasal swabs, and fresh ear notches; immunohistochemical (IHC) testing of formalin-fixed ear notches; and serologic testing for BVDV antibodies in serum. Of the 12 animals starting the study, 3 died with mucosal disease. The ACE and IHC tests on ear notches had positive results throughout the study, as did the ACE and PCR tests on serum. There was detectable virus in nasal swabs from all the cattle throughout the study except for a few samples that were toxic to cell cultures. The serum had a virus titer ≥ log(10) 1.60 in all samples from all the cattle except for 3 collections from 1 animal. Although there were several equivocal results, the PCR test most often had positive results. The BVDV antibodies were due to vaccination or exposure to heterologous strains and did not appear to interfere with any BVDV test. These findings illustrate that PI cattle may be identified by several tests, but differentiation of PI cattle from cattle with acute BVDV infection requires additional testing, especially of blood samples and nasal swabs positive on initial testing. Also, calves PI with BVDV are continual shedders of infectious virus, as shown by the infectivity of nasal swabs over the 11-mo study.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.034909011,0.003238683,0.066019998,-0.093163394,-0.003234034,0.011035931,0.00124846,-0.003836328,-0.013775727,-0.01691864,0.048606504,0.004190841,-0.026788145,0.001494061,0.063930088,-0.014745519,0.001722042,-0.034202506,0.036077808,-0.083316614,-0.013517737,-0.0134079,-0.009918456,-0.064291436,0.052009811,0.020132167,0.005389397,-0.059414209,-0.000560398,-0.036478132
The Role of the Charged Residues of the GP2 Helical Regions in Ebola Entry(),"The glycoprotein (GP) of Ebola is the sole structural protein that forms the spikes on the viral envelope. The GP contains two subunits, GP1 and GP2, linked by a disulfide bond, which are responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively. In this study, the full length of GP gene of Ebola Zaire species, 2028 base pairs in length, was synthesized using 38 overlapping oligonucleotides by multiple rounds of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The synthesized GP gene was shown to be efficiently expressed in mammalian cells. Furthermore, an efficient HIV-based pseudotyping system was developed using the synthetic GP gene, providing a safe approach to dissecting the entry mechanism of Ebola viruses. Using this pseudotyping system and mutational analysis, the role of the charged residues in the GP2 helical regions was examined. It was found that substitutions of the most charged residues in the regions did not adversely affect GP expression, processing, or viral incorporation, however, most of the mutations greatly impaired the ability of GP to mediate efficient viral infection. These results demonstrate that these charged residues of GP2 play an important role in GP-mediated Ebola entry into its host cells. We propose that these charged residues are involved in forming the intermediate conformation(s) of GP in membrane fusion and Ebola entry.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.093430189,-0.030559488,0.005819254,-0.048184635,-0.028102216,0.021467633,0.011872324,-0.01371935,0.022098638,-0.018146677,-0.043575893,-0.004903335,-0.003719585,-0.005407724,-0.020523485,-0.010793978,0.014292363,-0.031876626,-0.034522788,-0.023536331,0.006936315,0.00203135,-0.006442949,0.008441383,0.012014981,0.009756363,0.009078883,-0.016995019,0.003454246,0.009706751
Biochemical Characterization of Arterivirus Nonstructural Protein 11 Reveals the Nidovirus-Wide Conservation of a Replicative Endoribonuclease,"Nidoviruses (arteriviruses, coronaviruses, and roniviruses) are a phylogenetically compact but diverse group of positive-strand RNA viruses that includes important human and animal pathogens. Nidovirus RNA synthesis is mediated by a cytoplasmic membrane-associated replication/transcription complex that includes up to 16 viral nonstructural proteins (nsps), which carry common enzymatic activities, like the viral RNA polymerase, but also unusual and poorly understood RNA-processing functions. Of these, a conserved endoribonuclease (NendoU) is a major genetic marker that is unique to nidoviruses. NendoU activity was previously verified in vitro for the coronavirus nsp15, but not for any of its distantly related orthologs from other nidovirus lineages, like the arterivirus nsp11. Here, we show that the bacterially expressed nsp11 proteins of two arteriviruses, equine arteritis virus and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus, possess pyrimidine-specific endoribonuclease activity. RNA cleavage was independent of divalent cations in vitro and was greatly reduced by replacement of residues previously implicated in catalysis. Comparative characterization of the NendoU activity in arteriviruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus revealed common and distinct features of their substrate requirements and reaction mechanism. Our data provide the first biochemical evidence of endoribonuclease activity associated with arterivirus nsp11 and support the conclusion that this remarkable RNA-processing enzyme, whose substrate in the infected cell remains to be identified, distinguishes nidoviruses from all other RNA viruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.159345382,-0.037596492,-0.11070099,0.126770242,0.001909539,-0.074638697,0.034204859,0.00963976,-0.021770027,0.021548199,0.041336267,0.016071597,0.00664512,0.04116426,-0.005526371,-0.043407725,0.061881245,-0.055191842,0.01421348,0.045528462,-0.048060715,-0.006881429,-0.024004182,-0.073212274,0.038614493,0.010845347,-0.081268855,0.027550368,-0.032646299,-0.049205657
Infectious bronchitis virus in Jordanian chickens: Seroprevalence and detection,"Infectious bronchitis (IB) is one of the most important viral diseases of poultry; it causes major economic losses to the poultry industry. This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in commercial chicken flocks in Jordan. Serum samples from 70 commercial chicken flocks (40 broilers, 18 layers, and 12 broiler breeders) free from respiratory disease were collected and screened for the presence of Massachusetts-41 (M-41), D274, and 4/91 strain antigens of IBV by using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. In addition, 51 commercial chicken flocks (25 broilers, 15 layers, and 11 broiler breeders) suffering from respiratory disease were tested for the presence of IBV, using the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Overall, 92.9% of the flocks free from respiratory disease were seropositive for antibodies to the M-41 strain, whereas 90% and 61.4% of the flocks were seropositive for antibodies to the 4/91 and D274 strains, respectively. Infectious bronchitis virus nucleic acid was detected in 16 broiler (64%), 8 layer (53%), and 6 broiler breeder (54.54%) flocks affected with respiratory disease. This study clearly demonstrates that several strains of IBV are present in poultry flocks in Jordan. Future work should include the isolation and serotyping of IBV in the region, so that a suitable vaccination program, using the common field serotypes as vaccines, can be adopted to protect against IBV-caused disease. Furthermore, farmers need to be educated about the clinical signs of IB and the importance of IBV.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.015945078,-0.028592595,0.091416991,-0.119854004,0.175119932,0.091488996,-0.157338752,-0.10340842,0.138002882,0.395400777,0.116328834,0.027317638,-0.076323198,0.020438184,-0.140651443,0.169107958,0.000858021,-0.003298082,0.055920924,0.047687516,-0.073100127,-0.028016479,-0.02157024,-0.086211004,0.057596549,0.018829557,-0.053894405,0.013429967,0.046302491,-0.028540537
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Triggers Apoptosis via Protein Kinase R but Is Resistant to Its Antiviral Activity,"In this study, infection of 293/ACE2 cells with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) activated several apoptosis-associated events, namely, cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-8, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP), and chromatin condensation and the phosphorylation and hence inactivation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). In addition, two of the three cellular eIF2α kinases known to be virus induced, protein kinase R (PKR) and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), were activated by SARS-CoV. The third kinase, general control nonderepressible-2 kinase (GCN2), was not activated, but late in infection the level of GCN2 protein was significantly reduced. Reverse transcription-PCR analyses revealed that the reduction of GCN2 protein was not due to decreased transcription or stability of GCN2 mRNA. The specific reduction of PKR protein expression by antisense peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers strongly reduced cleavage of PARP in infected cells. Surprisingly, the knockdown of PKR neither enhanced SARS-CoV replication nor abrogated SARS-CoV-induced eIF2α phosphorylation. Pretreatment of cells with beta interferon prior to SARS-CoV infection led to a significant decrease in PERK activation, eIF2α phosphorylation, and SARS-CoV replication. The various effects of beta interferon treatment were found to function independently on the expression of PKR. Our results show that SARS-CoV infection activates PKR and PERK, leading to sustained eIF2α phosphorylation. However, virus replication was not impaired by these events, suggesting that SARS-CoV possesses a mechanism to overcome the inhibitory effects of phosphorylated eIF2α on viral mRNA translation. Furthermore, our data suggest that viral activation of PKR can lead to apoptosis via a pathway that is independent of eIF2α phosphorylation.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.085245674,0.291762767,-0.202844867,-0.049801255,-0.103188619,0.04143678,-0.025057681,-0.16492898,0.077136374,-0.039016642,-0.05622798,-0.072517893,-0.001564123,0.063461486,-0.008646368,0.018908914,0.02010536,-0.082677464,-0.00088018,0.028391741,0.001561858,0.027965904,0.030452424,0.011904643,0.035640845,-0.008798096,-0.030844546,0.023872418,0.027878751,-0.013789676
Another Piece of the Puzzle: Human Metapneumovirus Infections in Adults,"BACKGROUND: Each winter respiratory viruses account for a significant proportion of serious respiratory illness, including hospitalization, in older adults and those with underlying medical conditions. We describe the incidence and clinical impact of human Metapneumovirus (hMPV), a newly identified virus, in adults. METHODS: hMPV infection was identified in three prospectively enrolled adult cohorts (young persons age 19-40, healthy adults ≥ 65 years, and high-risk adults) and a hospitalized cohort over 4 consecutive winters. The incidence and clinical impact was compared to influenza A and Respiratory Syncytial Virus infection in the same groups. RESULTS: Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serology hMPV infection was identified in 2.2-10.5% of the three prospectively followed outpatient cohorts annually. Asymptomatic infection was common, accounting for at least 40% of infections in each of the cohorts. Symptoms, when they did occur, were typical of an upper respiratory illness although a few high-risk persons required hospitalization. Among 1386 hospitalized subjects, hMPV was identified in 8.5%, ranging from 4.3% to 13.2% depending upon the year. Dual viral infection was identified in 22.9%. Wheezing was frequent (80%) and more common than with influenza. Twelve percent required intensive care unit admission and 11% ventilatory support, rates similar to influenza and RSV infection. CONCLUSION: hMPV is a common infection in adults of all ages, and although often asymptomatic, can result in serious infection requiring hospitalization. Like influenza A and RSV, hMPV is also a major contributor to the burden of winter-time respiratory illnesses in older adults.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.257706387,-0.129027532,-0.099379042,0.104302559,0.025401017,-0.017587152,-0.014636581,-0.075907028,0.143377555,-0.101570372,0.025198373,-0.05532077,-0.089259991,0.000529434,-0.114219776,-0.029128028,-0.01227071,0.181806001,-0.12364489,0.079326185,0.119810749,-0.043439094,-0.01370603,-0.093339966,0.00352413,-0.040249133,-0.103351597,-0.057766609,0.009580995,0.009692217
Comparative Analysis of Complete Genome Sequences of Three Avian Coronaviruses Reveals a Novel Group 3c Coronavirus,"In this territory-wide molecular epidemiology study of coronaviruses (CoVs) in Hong Kong involving 1,541 dead wild birds, three novel CoVs were identified in three different bird families (bulbul CoV HKU11 [BuCoV HKU11], thrush CoV HKU12 [ThCoV HKU12], and munia CoV HKU13 [MuCoV HKU13]). Four complete genomes of the three novel CoVs were sequenced. Their genomes (26,396 to 26,552 bases) represent the smallest known CoV genomes. In phylogenetic trees constructed using chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL(pro)), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol), helicase, spike, and nucleocapsid proteins, BuCoV HKU11, ThCoV HKU12, and MuCoV HKU13 formed a cluster distantly related to infectious bronchitis virus and turkey CoV (group 3a CoVs). For helicase, spike, and nucleocapsid, they were also clustered with a CoV recently discovered in Asian leopard cats, for which the complete genome sequence was not available. The 3CL(pro), Pol, helicase, and nucleocapsid of the three CoVs possessed higher amino acid identities to those of group 3a CoVs than to those of group 1 and group 2 CoVs. Unique genomic features distinguishing them from other group 3 CoVs include a distinct transcription regulatory sequence and coding potential for small open reading frames. Based on these results, we propose a novel CoV subgroup, group 3c, to describe this distinct subgroup of CoVs under the group 3 CoVs. Avian CoVs are genetically more diverse than previously thought and may be closely related to some newly identified mammalian CoVs. Further studies would be important to delineate whether the Asian leopard cat CoV was a result of interspecies jumping from birds, a situation analogous to that of bat and civet severe acute respiratory syndrome CoVs.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.093127691,0.199440004,-0.120277861,-0.01429315,0.23822757,0.069351699,0.145018784,0.081989552,-0.014542155,-0.047757142,-0.037658115,-0.084780716,-0.04291432,-0.013445992,-0.078346261,0.024702304,0.026554545,0.045748817,0.006054489,0.034429099,-0.052003741,-0.056150335,0.055470205,-0.001859381,0.027282083,0.000927182,-0.046296455,-0.041722796,0.018341596,-0.020607143

"Overexpression of NANOG in Gestational Trophoblastic Diseases : Effect on Apoptosis, Cell Invasion, and Clinical Outcome","Gestational trophoblastic disease includes choriocarcinoma, a frankly malignant tumor, and hydatidiform mole (HM), which often leads to the development of persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia and requires chemotherapy. NANOG is an important transcription factor that is crucial for maintaining embryonic stem cell self-renewal and pluripotency. We postulated that NANOG is involved in the pathogenesis of gestational trophoblastic disease. In this study, significantly higher NANOG mRNA and protein expression levels, by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting, respectively, were demonstrated in HMs, particularly those that developed persistent disease, when compared with normal placentas. In addition, significantly increased nuclear NANOG immunoreactivity was found by immunohistochemistry in HMs (P < 0.001) and choriocarcinoma (P = 0.002). Higher NANOG expression levels were demonstrated in HMs that developed persistent disease, as compared with those that regressed (P = 0.025). Nuclear localization of NANOG was confirmed by confocal microscopy and immunoblotting in choriocarcinoma cell lines. There was a significant inverse correlation between NANOG immunoreactivity and apoptotic index assessed by M30 CytoDeath antibody (P = 0.012). After stable knockdown of NANOG in the choriocarcinoma cell line JEG-3 by an shRNA approach, increased apoptosis was observed in relation to with enhanced caspases and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activities. NANOG knockdown was also associated with decreased mobility and invasion of JEG-3 and down-regulation of matrix metalloproteases 2 and 9. These findings suggest that NANOG is involved in the pathogenesis and clinical progress of gestational trophoblastic disease, likely through its effect on apoptosis, cell migration, and invasion.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.044462203,-0.0243619,0.008653731,-0.1101361,-0.07136351,0.035220945,0.025137495,-0.027971088,0.032584705,-0.032854341,-0.03470658,-0.011532155,-0.017122258,0.025380537,-0.00593303,0.020925623,0.003647826,-0.029133398,-0.028410009,-0.033849776,0.017198925,-0.02513541,-0.007316487,-0.014233966,0.005210385,0.000877994,-0.017114802,0.003531435,0.03195395,-0.04172996
Molecular targets for flavivirus drug discovery,"Flaviviruses are a major cause of infectious disease in humans. Dengue virus causes an estimated 50 million cases of febrile illness each year, including an increasing number of cases of hemorrhagic fever. West Nile virus, which recently spread from the Mediterranean basin to the Western Hemisphere, now causes thousands of sporadic cases of encephalitis annually. Despite the existence of licensed vaccines, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and tick-borne encephalitis also claim many thousands of victims each year across their vast endemic areas. Antiviral therapy could potentially reduce morbidity and mortality from flavivirus infections, but no effective drugs are currently available. This article introduces a collection of papers in Antiviral Research on molecular targets for flavivirus antiviral drug design and murine models of dengue virus disease that aims to encourage drug development efforts. After reviewing the flavivirus replication cycle, we discuss the envelope glycoprotein, NS3 protease, NS3 helicase, NS5 methyltransferase and NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase as potential drug targets, with special attention being given to the viral protease.

DNA Polymerases as Therapeutic Targets,"Numerous pathological states including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and viral/bacterial infections are often attributed to uncontrollable DNA replication. Inhibiting this essential biological process provides an obvious therapeutic target against these diseases. A logical target is the DNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the addition of mononucleotides into a growing polymer using a DNA or RNA template as a guide for directing each incorporation event. This review provides a summary of therapeutic agents that target polymerase activity. A discussion of the biological function and mechanism of polymerases is first provided to illustrate the strategy for therapeutic intervention as well as the rational design of various nucleoside analogs that inhibit various polymerases associated with viral infections and cancer. The development of nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors as anti-viral agents is discussed with particular emphasis on their mechanism of action, structure-activity relationships, toxicity, and mechanism of resistance. In addition, commonly used anti-cancer agents are described to illustrate the similarities and differences associated with various nucleoside analogs as therapeutic agents.

Primers were designed from the conserved motifs of the polymerase pol gene sequences to detect members of the Paramyxovirinae or Pneumovirinae subfamily or groups of genera within the Paramyxovirinae subfamily. The consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primer design and seminested or nested PCR assay design were used to enhance the breadth of reactivity and sensitivity of the respective assays. Using expressed RNA and 10-fold dilution series of virus-infected tissue culture isolates from different members of the family or genera, these assays were able to detect on average between 100 and 500 copies of template RNA. The assays were specific to the respective group of genera or subfamily viruses. This set of primers enhances our ability to look for novel viruses in outbreaks and diseases of unknown etiology.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.045044881,0.040533686,0.130434381,0.069562678,0.044788971,-0.037121484,0.018256463,0.001665678,-0.034208734,0.014065625,-0.018965119,-0.008714068,-0.001833109,0.031719626,0.003354303,-0.028652622,0.017421597,0.001159263,-0.005823863,-0.068096959,0.026242284,0.031217654,0.005430163,0.020424868,-0.04787975,-0.035076228,0.016520383,-0.014307031,-0.013526015,-0.01104719
Emodin is a novel alkaline nuclease inhibitor that suppresses herpes simplex virus type 1 yields in cell cultures,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Most antiviral therapies directed against herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are limited to a small group of nucleoside analogues that target the viral polymerase. Extensive clinical use of these drugs has led to the emergence of resistant viral strains, mainly in immunocompromised patients. This highlights the need for the development of new anti-herpesviral drugs with novel targets. Herein the effects of a plant anthraquinone, emodin, on the HSV-1 alkaline nuclease activity and virus yields were investigated. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: HSV-1 alkaline nuclease activity was examined by nuclease activity assay. Inhibition of virus yields was measured by plaque reduction assay and immunohistochemical staining. Interaction between emodin and alkaline nuclease was analysed by docking technology. KEY RESULTS: Emodin specifically inhibited the nuclease activity of HSV-1 UL12 alkaline nuclease in a biochemical assay. Plaque reduction assay revealed that emodin reduced the plaque formation with an EC(50) of 21.5±4.4 μM. Immunohistochemical staining using the anti-nucleocapsid protein antibody demonstrated that emodin induced the accumulation of viral nucleocapsids in the nucleus in a dose-dependent manner. Docking analysis further suggested that the inhibitory effect of emodin on the UL12 activity may result from the interaction between emodin and critical catalytic amino acid residues of UL12. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings suggest that emodin is a potent anti-HSV agent that inhibits the yields of HSV-1 via the suppression of a novel target, UL12.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.064232227,-0.019926448,0.004879046,-0.037052112,-0.096718429,0.060123356,0.062479008,-0.019322016,0.022917922,0.001446002,-0.01349041,0.040462846,-0.0157817,0.015719519,-0.019759439,-0.020075914,0.009982528,0.059112023,0.052583319,0.011677805,0.01908098,-0.005922354,0.005035596,0.022941549,0.027001629,0.034973804,0.021127755,-0.011800123,0.026431877,0.017173206
Functional Characterization of the Cleavage Specificity of the Sapovirus Chymotrypsin-Like Protease,"Sapovirus is a positive-stranded RNA virus with a translational strategy based on processing of a polyprotein precursor by a chymotrypsin-like protease. So far, the molecular mechanisms regulating cleavage specificity of the viral protease are poorly understood. In this study, the catalytic activities and substrate specificities of the predicted forms of the viral protease, the 3C-like protease (NS6) and the 3CD-like protease-polymerase (NS6-7), were examined in vitro. The purified NS6 and NS6-7 were able to cleave synthetic peptides (15 to 17 residues) displaying the cleavage sites of the sapovirus polyprotein, both NS6 and NS6-7 proteins being active forms of the viral protease. High-performance liquid chromatography and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis of digested products showed a specific trans cleavage of peptides bearing Gln-Gly, Gln-Ala, Glu-Gly, Glu-Pro, or Glu-Lys at the scissile bond. In contrast, peptides bearing Glu-Ala or Gln-Asp at the scissile bond (NS4-NS5 and NS5-NS6, or NS6-NS7 junctions, respectively) were resistant to trans cleavage by NS6 or NS6-7 proteins, whereas cis cleavage of the Glu-Ala scissile bond of the NS5-NS6 junction was evidenced. Interestingly, the presence of a Phe at position P4 overruled the resistance to trans cleavage of the Glu-Ala junction (NS5-NS6), whereas substitutions at the P1 and P2′ positions altered the cleavage efficiency. The differential cleavage observed is supported by a model of the substrate-binding site of the sapovirus protease, indicating that the P4, P1, and P2′ positions in the substrate modulate the cleavage specificity and efficiency of the sapovirus chymotrypsin-like protease.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.087359106,-0.035474964,-0.005373181,-0.048360068,-0.029259975,0.016850822,0.00175745,-0.007004878,0.01538537,-0.031457463,-0.028157102,0.039186855,-0.009136327,-0.058222527,-0.0276216,-0.021828964,0.044358848,0.001524417,0.012578878,-0.013848683,-0.015198413,-0.001323629,-0.01869587,-0.031962056,0.059958022,0.060260269,-0.019998977,-0.011142616,-0.003241703,-0.029565757
The role of programmed-1 ribosomal frameshifting in coronavirus propagation,"Coronaviruses have the potential to cause significant economic, agricultural and health problems. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus outbreak in late 2002, early 2003 called attention to the potential damage that coronaviruses could cause in the human population. The ensuing research has enlightened many to the molecular biology of coronaviruses. A programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift is required by coronaviruses for the production of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase which in turn is essential for viral replication. The frameshifting signal encoded in the viral genome has additional features that are not essential for frameshifting. Elucidation of the differences between coronavirus frameshift signals and signals from other viruses may help our understanding of these features. Here we summarize current knowledge and add additional insight regarding the function of the programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift signal in the coronavirus lifecycle.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.08490054,0.059152614,-0.111492363,0.042617242,0.048894082,-0.028208164,0.020019861,-0.043673709,-0.020034433,0.012740169,-0.033358588,-0.011166697,0.084776758,-0.052439919,-0.004199406,-0.016789121,0.012392379,0.009726419,-0.008036171,0.035670765,-0.030008541,-0.028329298,-0.094524361,-0.005417454,-0.020802009,-0.055039699,-0.039425264,0.011633562,0.053971297,-0.122558643
Molecular Targets for Diagnostics and Therapeutics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV),"PURPOSE: The large number of deaths in a short period of time due to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infection led to the unparalleled collaborative efforts world wide to determine and characterize the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The full genome sequence was determined within weeks of the first outbreak by the Canadian group with international collaboration. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), the continual lack of a rapid laboratory test to aid the early diagnosis of suspected cases of SARS makes this area a priority for future research. To prevent deaths in the future, early diagnosis and therapy of this infectious disease is of paramount importance. METHODS: This review describes the specific molecular targets for diagnostics and therapeutics of viral infection. RESULTS: The three major diagnostic methods available for SARS includes viral RNA detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), virus induced antibodies by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) or by enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) of nucleocapsid protein (NP). The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S1 region of the spike glycoprotein contains multiple conformational epitopes that induces highly potent neutralizing antibodies. The genetically engineered attenuated form of the virus or viral vector vaccine encoding for the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein has been shown to elicit protective immunity in vaccinated animals. CONCLUSION: NP is the preferred target for routine detection of SARS-CoV infection by ELISA which is an economical method compared to other methods. The RBD of the spike glycoprotein is both a functional domain for cell receptor binding and also a major neutralizing determinant of SARS-CoV. The progress in evaluating a therapeutic or vaccine would depend on the availability of clinically relevant animal model.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.011926137,0.401317795,-0.121029186,0.03660741,-0.054032611,0.026891474,-0.038923109,-0.204433157,0.015417261,0.040672972,-0.021144976,-0.034075967,0.048816222,-0.077768131,0.00986592,-0.030398971,-0.008838105,-0.005999532,-0.024241876,0.044773091,-0.008045164,-0.014527472,0.019053225,0.01236282,0.019999254,-0.005703543,0.032482935,-0.027351835,-0.022268896,0.032500989
Effect of dexamethasone administration on bulls with a localized testicular infection with bovine viral diarrhea virus,"The objective of this research was to evaluate reactivation of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) following dexamethasone treatment in 4 bulls that had previously been inoculated with BVDV, 3 of which had been demonstrated to have a localized testicular infection. Bulls were housed in an isolated pasture with in-contact steers. Beginning on day 0 of this study, all bulls received a daily dose of 0.1 mg/kg body weight (BW) of dexamethasone intravenously for 5 consecutive days. Blood was collected from the in-contact steers and semen, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid were collected from the bulls during and following dexamethasone treatment. Samples were assayed for BVDV using virus isolation and reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR). Serum was assayed for antibody using standard virus isolation. Virus was not isolated from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or semen from any of the 4 bulls during the study period. One of the bulls was positive for BVDV in semen by RT-nPCR throughout the study period. The BVDV was not recovered from any in-contact control steers during the 28-day study period, nor did any of the in-contact control steers seroconvert to BVDV. Raw semen from 1 bull that was RT-nPCR positive was intravenously inoculated into 7 seronegative steers based upon the Cornell Semen Test. The BVDV could not be recovered from the steers and none of them seroconverted to BVDV. The results indicated that reactivation of BVDV in bulls with a localized testicular infection is unlikely; however, further research is necessary to determine the full potential for BVDV transmission from bulls with a localized testicular infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.000564658,0.000812476,0.049475263,-0.077465943,-0.018191008,0.024193512,0.00172668,0.003056207,0.001609974,-0.020525545,0.036427206,0.009453089,-0.034817202,0.017614278,0.049149893,0.007663963,0.008760901,0.00998083,-0.00550023,-0.025549514,-0.018963194,-0.007662052,-0.033716348,-0.008033268,0.035856212,0.022697395,0.008531495,-0.032756754,0.009067608,-0.012454593
Uncoupling RNA virus replication from transcription via the polymerase: functional and evolutionary insights,"Many eukaryotic positive-strand RNA viruses transcribe subgenomic (sg) mRNAs that are virus-derived messages that template the translation of a subset of viral proteins. Currently, the premature termination (PT) mechanism of sg mRNA transcription, a process thought to operate in a variety of viruses, is best understood in tombusviruses. The viral RNA elements involved in regulating this mechanism have been well characterized in several systems; however, no corresponding protein factors have been identified yet. Here we show that tombusvirus genome replication can be effectively uncoupled from sg mRNA transcription in vivo by C-terminal modifications in its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Systematic analysis of the PT transcriptional pathway using viral genomes harboring mutant RdRps revealed that the C-terminus functions primarily at an early step in this mechanism by mediating both efficient and accurate production of minus-strand templates for sg mRNA transcription. Our results also suggest a simple evolutionary scheme by which the virus could gain or enhance its transcriptional activity, and define global folding of the viral RNA genome as a previously unappreciated determinant of RdRp evolution.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.217240259,-0.069839992,-0.073135072,0.120682316,-0.035154149,-0.086474964,0.0031771,0.033445228,-0.044844728,0.014879548,0.043421113,-0.002617512,-0.0103438,0.045408031,-0.010499186,0.009126229,0.015784858,-0.071041955,-0.058941671,-0.009504646,-0.028775216,0.023322323,-0.050845104,-0.020745905,-0.036628816,-0.102184313,-0.012682045,0.037426453,0.090168388,0.02115472
Amiloride Derivatives Inhibit Coxsackievirus B3 RNA Replication,"Amiloride derivatives are known blockers of the cellular Na(+)/H(+) exchanger and the epithelial Na(+) channel. More recent studies demonstrate that they also inhibit ion channels formed by a number of viral proteins. We previously reported that 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA) modestly inhibits intracellular replication and, to a larger extent, release of human rhinovirus 2 (HRV2) (E. V. Gazina, D. N. Harrison, M. Jefferies, H. Tan, D. Williams, D. A. Anderson and S. Petrou, Antiviral Res. 67:98-106, 2005). Here, we demonstrate that amiloride and EIPA strongly inhibit coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) RNA replication and do not inhibit CVB3 release, in contrast to our previous findings on HRV2. Passaging of plasmid-derived CVB3 in the presence of amiloride generated mutant viruses with amino acid substitutions in position 299 or 372 of the CVB3 polymerase. Introduction of either of these mutations into the CVB3 plasmid produced resistance to amiloride and EIPA, suggesting that they act as inhibitors of CVB3 polymerase, a novel mechanism of antiviral activity for these compounds.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.091242769,-0.04483276,-0.021908547,-0.016179321,-0.066907172,0.051299746,0.055060522,-0.004873767,0.023654527,0.004804742,0.002218554,0.028604347,-0.007267815,-0.008121861,0.00962089,0.005894824,-0.008064386,0.031233292,0.013331009,-0.004940386,0.012639746,0.00627381,-0.000530675,0.028668467,0.031146175,0.040874959,0.008305742,-0.018076346,0.008483738,-0.011484992
A Highly Divergent Picornavirus in a Marine Mammal,"Nucleic acids from an unidentified virus from ringed seals (Phoca hispida) were amplified using sequence-independent PCR, subcloned, and then sequenced. The full genome of a novel RNA virus was derived, identifying the first sequence-confirmed picornavirus in a marine mammal. The phylogenetic position of the tentatively named seal picornavirus 1 (SePV-1) as an outlier to the grouping of parechoviruses was found consistently in alignable regions of the genome. A mean protein sequence identity of only 19.3 to 30.0% was found between the 3D polymerase gene sequence of SePV-1 and those of other picornaviruses. The predicted secondary structure of the short 506-base 5′-untranslated region showed some attributes of a type IVB internal ribosome entry site, and the polyprotein lacked an apparent L peptide, both properties associated with the Parechovirus genus. The presence of two SePV-1 2A genes and of the canonical sequence required for cotranslational cleavage resembled the genetic organization of Ljungan virus. Minor genetic variants were detected in culture supernatants derived from 8 of 108 (7.4%) seals collected in 2000 to 2002, indicating a high prevalence of SePV-1 in this hunted seal population. The high level of genetic divergence of SePV-1 compared to other picornaviruses and its mix of characteristics relative to its closest relatives support the provisional classification of SePV-1 as the prototype for a new genus in the family Picornaviridae.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.122004809,-0.04020945,0.009005421,-0.024556813,0.127893334,-0.022558571,-0.067907025,0.012162369,-0.026996394,-0.017361842,-0.053562425,0.001400972,0.031756473,-0.100187446,-0.019257083,-0.067513016,0.009138326,0.013113522,-0.023826319,-0.032697389,0.039278395,-0.001256896,-0.031574223,0.044330735,-0.053697179,0.006129062,0.041992974,0.005515997,-0.02543958,-0.000476679
Influenza Virus mRNA Translation Revisited: Is the eIF4E Cap-Binding Factor Required for Viral mRNA Translation?,"Influenza virus mRNAs bear a short capped oligonucleotide sequence at their 5′ ends derived from the host cell pre-mRNAs by a “cap-snatching” mechanism, followed immediately by a common viral sequence. At their 3′ ends, they contain a poly(A) tail. Although cellular and viral mRNAs are structurally similar, influenza virus promotes the selective translation of its mRNAs despite the inhibition of host cell protein synthesis. The viral polymerase performs the cap snatching and binds selectively to the 5′ common viral sequence. As viral mRNAs are recognized by their own cap-binding complex, we tested whether viral mRNA translation occurs without the contribution of the eIF4E protein, the cellular factor required for cap-dependent translation. Here, we show that influenza virus infection proceeds normally in different situations of functional impairment of the eIF4E factor. In addition, influenza virus polymerase binds to translation preinitiation complexes, and furthermore, under conditions of decreased eIF4GI association to cap structures, an increase in eIF4GI binding to these structures was found upon influenza virus infection. This is the first report providing evidence that influenza virus mRNA translation proceeds independently of a fully active translation initiation factor (eIF4E). The data reported are in agreement with a role of viral polymerase as a substitute for the eIF4E factor for viral mRNA translation.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.075932383,-0.147798988,-0.092116571,0.090317774,-0.077869703,0.111654666,-0.104743761,0.014080979,-0.040414728,-0.033213547,-0.097522314,-0.103881503,0.05950113,0.047594291,-0.07730222,-0.046366814,0.0426055,-0.078969226,-0.071396413,0.113157703,-0.051658196,0.123964207,0.05186002,0.04656497,0.076326439,-0.144769495,-0.018559615,0.025653462,0.171805552,0.099943572
The clinical and public health value of non-culture methods in the investigation of a cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases,"During 2003, a cluster of initially unexplained pneumonia cases (two fatal) occurred in patients aged <50 years in a British city. Routine culture tests were inconclusive, however, pneumococcal infection was suspected and the putative outbreak was investigated using non-culture methods. Clinical samples from ten patients were tested by pneumococcal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), or Binax NOW(®) pneumococcal urine antigen test and serotype-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Lung samples from the deceased patients were PCR positive and yielded different MLST types. Two patients in one family group were serotype 1 pneumococcal antigen positive. Two further patients were serotype 1 antigen positive, and one serotype 4 positive. Two antigen-positive cases were also serum PCR positive. Non-culture methods confirmed the disease aetiology in six cases. Serotype and MLST results showed no single outbreak, but a family cluster of cases in a high background of pneumococcal pneumonia, providing important epidemiological data that would not otherwise have been available.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.125959175,0.023906208,0.004481362,-0.112639908,-0.023413561,-0.031334605,-0.067117606,0.079234025,-0.127822944,0.016991726,0.00106766,0.019758425,-0.02077429,0.024956685,-0.016488545,-0.049039929,0.022540966,0.046335118,-0.031203117,-0.059653724,0.020841247,0.061095732,-0.008080293,-0.063494302,-0.039929916,0.039439182,0.021424006,0.017363173,-0.055389918,-0.010064586
Role of Law Enforcement Response and Microbial Forensics in Investigation of Bioterrorism,"The risk and threat of bioterrorism and biocrime have become a large concern and challenge for governments and society to enhance biosecurity. Law enforcement plays an important role in assessing and investigating activities involved in an event of bioterrorism or biocrime. Key to a successful biosecurity program is increased awareness and early detection of threats facilitated by an integrated network of responsibilities and capabilities from government, academic, private, and public assets. To support an investigation, microbial forensic sciences are employed to analyze and characterize forensic evidence with the goal of attribution or crime scene reconstruction. Two different molecular biology-based assays – real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and repetitive element PCR – are described and demonstrate how molecular biology tools may be utilized to aid in the investigative process. Technologies relied on by microbial forensic scientists need to be properly validated so that the methods used are understood and so that interpretation of results is carried out within the limitations of the assays. The three types of validation are preliminary, developmental, and internal. The first is necessary for rapid response when a threat is imminent or an attack has recently occurred.

Real-Time PCR: Revolutionizing Detection and Expression Analysis of Genes,"Invention of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology by Kary Mullis in 1984 gave birth to real-time PCR. Real-time PCR — detection and expression analysis of gene(s) in real-time — has revolutionized the 21(st) century biological science due to its tremendous application in quantitative genotyping, genetic variation of inter and intra organisms, early diagnosis of disease, forensic, to name a few.

De Novo Initiation of RNA Synthesis by the Arterivirus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase,"All plus-strand RNA viruses encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that functions as the catalytic subunit of the viral replication/transcription complex, directing viral RNA synthesis in concert with other viral proteins and, sometimes, host proteins. RNA synthesis essentially can be initiated by two different mechanisms, de novo initiation and primer-dependent initiation. Most viral RdRps have been identified solely on the basis of comparative sequence analysis, and for many viruses the mechanism of initiation is unknown. In this study, using the family prototype equine arteritis virus (EAV), we address the mechanism of initiation of RNA synthesis in arteriviruses. The RdRp domains of the members of the arterivirus family, which are part of replicase subunit nsp9, were compared to coronavirus RdRps that belong to the same order of Nidovirales, as well as to other RdRps with known initiation mechanisms and three-dimensional structures. We report here the first successful expression and purification of an arterivirus RdRp that is catalytically active in the absence of other viral or cellular proteins. The EAV nsp9/RdRp initiates RNA synthesis by a de novo mechanism on homopolymeric templates in a template-specific manner. In addition, the requirements for initiation of RNA synthesis from the 3′ end of the viral genome were studied in vivo using a reverse genetics approach. These studies suggest that the 3′-terminal nucleotides of the EAV genome play a critical role in viral RNA synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.276934643,-0.072072862,-0.125220699,0.191052956,-0.039543129,-0.132246197,0.026356217,0.044158441,-0.080233907,0.045574607,0.091260404,0.055642906,-0.048878738,0.022886193,-0.033701442,-0.036730138,0.072757038,-0.077696967,-0.026883908,-0.006139718,-0.043423777,0.036965516,-0.033842172,-0.088630485,-0.001711797,-0.019378475,-0.014385717,0.022576296,0.02600464,0.078288758
Adaptation of Borna Disease Virus to New Host Species Attributed to Altered Regulation of Viral Polymerase Activity,"Borna disease virus (BDV) can persistently infect the central nervous system of a broad range of mammalian species. Mice are resistant to infections with primary BDV isolates, but certain laboratory strains can be adapted to replicate in mice. We determined the molecular basis of adaptation by studying mutations acquired by a cDNA-derived BDV strain during one brain passage in rats and three passages in mice. The adapted virus propagated efficiently in mouse brains and induced neurological disease. Its genome contained seven point mutations, three of which caused amino acid changes in the L polymerase (L1116R and N1398D) and in the polymerase cofactor P (R66K). Recombinant BDV carrying these mutations either alone or in combination all showed enhanced multiplication speed in Vero cells, indicating improved intrinsic viral polymerase activity rather than adaptation to a mouse-specific factor. Mutations R66K and L1116R, but not N1398D, conferred replication competence of recombinant BDV in mice if introduced individually. Virus propagation in mouse brains was substantially enhanced if both L mutations were present simultaneously, but infection remained mostly nonsymptomatic. Only if all three amino acid substitutions were combined did BDV replicate vigorously and induce early disease in mice. Interestingly, the virulence-enhancing effect of the R66K mutation in P could be attributed to reduced negative regulation of polymerase activity by the viral X protein. Our data demonstrate that BDV replication competence in mice is mediated by the polymerase complex rather than the viral envelope and suggest that altered regulation of viral gene expression can favor adaptation to new host species.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.124440811,-0.048339452,-0.014708834,-0.037786753,-0.034721597,0.078555836,0.023040223,-0.032301842,0.037393838,0.036652897,-0.030756159,-0.039944736,0.008478454,0.025620781,0.012285479,-0.008915255,-0.042014859,-0.012856586,-0.048636477,0.039133927,0.063576753,-0.026700071,0.036309908,0.065712395,0.003241602,0.0502263,0.042043073,-0.024611512,-0.081380601,0.010125333
Detection of a Novel and Highly Divergent Coronavirus from Asian Leopard Cats and Chinese Ferret Badgers in Southern China,"Since an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was averted in 2004, many novel coronaviruses have been recognized from different species, including humans. Bats have provided the most diverse assemblages of coronaviruses, suggesting that they may be the natural reservoir. Continued virological surveillance has proven to be the best way to avert this infectious disease at the source. Here we provide the first description of a previously unidentified coronavirus lineage detected from wild Asian leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis) and Chinese ferret badgers (Melogale moschata) during virological surveillance in southern China. Partial genome analysis revealed a typical coronavirus genome but with a unique putative accessory gene organization. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the envelope, membrane, and nucleoprotein structural proteins and the two conserved replicase domains, putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA helicase, of these novel coronaviruses were most closely related to those of group 3 coronaviruses identified from birds, while the spike protein gene was most closely related to that of group 1 coronaviruses from mammals. However, these viruses always fell into an outgroup phylogenetic relationship with respect to other coronaviruses and had low amino acid similarity to all known coronavirus groups, indicating that they diverged early in the evolutionary history of coronaviruses. These results suggest that these viruses may represent a previously unrecognized evolutionary pathway, or possibly an unidentified coronavirus group.

Strong and Selective Inhibitors of Hepatitis B Virus Replication among Novel N(4)-Hydroxy- and 5-Methyl-β-l-Deoxycytidine Analogues,"Novel N(4)-hydroxy- and 5-methyl-modified β-l-deoxycytidine analogues were synthesized and evaluated as anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) agents. Their in vitro efficiencies were investigated in HepG2.2.15 cells stably transfected with HBV. β-l-2′,3′-Didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxy-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (β-l-Hyd4C) was most effective in reducing secreted HBV DNA (50% effective concentration [EC(50)], 0.03 μM), followed by β-l-2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thia-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (EC(50), 0.51 μM), β-l-2′,3′-dideoxy-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (EC(50), 0.55 μM), and β-l-5-methyl-2′-deoxycytidine (EC(50), 0.9 μM). The inhibition of the presumed target, the HBV DNA polymerase, by the triphosphates of some of the β-l-cytidine derivatives was also assessed. In accordance with the cell culture data, β-l-Hyd4C triphosphate was the most active inhibitor, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.21 μM. The cytotoxicities of some of the 4-NHOH-modified β-l-nucleosides were dramatically lower than those of the corresponding cytidine analogues with the unmodified 4-NH(2) group. The 50% cytotoxic concentrations for β-l-Hyd4C in HepG2 and HL-60 cells were 2,500 μM and 3,500 μM, respectively. In summary, our results demonstrate that at least β-l-Hyd4C can be recommended as a highly efficient and extremely selective inhibitor of HBV replication for further investigations.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.062364407,-0.029781927,0.00574914,-0.079763992,-0.099721797,0.063313644,0.047229906,-0.021858559,0.034099207,-0.020282357,-0.011215723,0.031188285,-0.036535918,0.026216678,-0.000648777,0.033459982,-0.018685102,0.094017576,0.114023512,-0.056508768,-0.013989169,-0.010974386,0.044859566,0.048914353,0.007015346,0.007792604,-0.015740647,0.009395671,-0.002937535,-0.016917138
"Structure-Function Relationships of the Viral RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase: FIDELITY, REPLICATION SPEED, AND INITIATION MECHANISM DETERMINED BY A RESIDUE IN THE RIBOSE-BINDING POCKET","Studies of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from poliovirus (PV), 3Dpol, have shown that Asn-297 permits this enzyme to distinguish ribose from 2′-deoxyribose. All animal RNA viruses have Asn at the structurally homologous position of their polymerases, suggesting a conserved function for this residue. However, all prokaryotic RNA viruses have Glu at this position. In the presence of Mg(2+), the apparent affinity of Glu-297 3Dpol for 2′-deoxyribonucleotides was decreased by 6-fold relative to wild type without a substantial difference in the fidelity of 2′-dNMP incorporation. The fidelity of ribonucleotide misincorporation for Glu-297 3Dpol was reduced by 14-fold relative to wild type. A 4- to 11-fold reduction in the rate of ribonucleotide incorporation was observed. Glu-297 PV was unable to grow in HeLa cells due to a replication defect equivalent to that observed for a mutant PV encoding an inactive polymerase. Evaluation of the protein-(VPg)-primed initiation reaction showed that only half of the Glu-297 3Dpol initiation complexes were capable of producing VPg-pUpU product and that the overall yield of uridylylated VPg products was reduced by 20-fold relative to wild-type enzyme, a circumstance attributable to a reduced affinity for UTP. These studies identify the first RdRp derivative with a mutator phenotype and provide a mechanistic basis for the elevated mutation frequency of RNA phage relative to animal RNA viruses observed in culture. Although protein-primed initiation and RNA-primed elongation complexes employ the same polymerase active site, the functional differences reported here imply significant structural differences between these complexes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.15390627,-0.052374356,-0.050640987,0.053564641,-0.038069867,-0.031936191,0.038614477,0.015856603,-0.044070229,0.015742117,0.07480277,0.083064359,-0.078721865,-0.020211125,-0.015177101,-0.005674285,0.013303663,-0.055788868,-0.037598135,-0.04481743,0.066276745,-0.03427906,0.045149886,0.012736731,0.001568822,0.045868087,-0.012542504,0.000475586,-0.03746071,-0.035492591
Long-distance RNA–RNA interactions between terminal elements and the same subset of internal elements on the potato virus X genome mediate minus- and plus-strand RNA synthesis,"Potexvirus genomes contain conserved terminal elements that are complementary to multiple internal octanucleotide elements. Both local sequences and structures at the 5′ terminus and long-distance interactions between this region and internal elements are important for accumulation of potato virus X (PVX) plus-strand RNA in vivo. In this study, the role of the conserved hexanucleotide motif within SL3 of the 3′ NTR and internal conserved octanucleotide elements in minus-strand RNA synthesis was analyzed using both a template-dependent, PVX RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) extract and a protoplast replication system. Template analyses in vitro indicated that 3′ terminal templates of 850 nucleotides (nt), but not 200 nt, supported efficient, minus-strand RNA synthesis. Mutational analyses of the longer templates indicated that optimal transcription requires the hexanucleotide motif in SL3 within the 3′ NTR and the complementary CP octanucleotide element 747 nt upstream. Additional experiments to disrupt interactions between one or more internal conserved elements and the 3′ hexanucleotide element showed that long-distance interactions were necessary for minus-strand RNA synthesis both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, multiple internal octanucleotide elements could serve as pairing partners with the hexanucleotide element in vivo. These cis-acting elements and interactions correlate in several ways to those previously observed for plus-strand RNA accumulation in vivo, suggesting that dynamic interactions between elements at both termini and the same subset of internal octanucleotide elements are required for both minus- and plus-strand RNA synthesis and potentially other aspects of PVX replication.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.216932297,-0.066942333,-0.062116306,0.086961157,-0.003456514,-0.116456959,-0.032244971,0.062108221,-0.069209643,-0.024923702,0.061184383,0.042173084,-0.047012782,-0.010311511,-0.003708226,0.051016625,0.003270731,-0.005688769,-0.00986889,-0.073172324,-0.026154758,-0.007882461,-0.04549669,-0.069753261,-0.056843662,-0.121029973,-0.091211526,0.066326052,0.107632379,-0.005350143
Antiviral Activity and RNA Polymerase Degradation Following Hsp90 Inhibition in a Range of Negative Strand Viruses,"We have analyzed the effectiveness of Hsp90 inhibitors in blocking the replication of negative-strand RNA viruses. In cells infected with the prototype negative strand virus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), inhibiting Hsp90 activity reduced viral replication in cells infected at both high and low multiplicities of infection. This inhibition was observed using two Hsp90 inhibitors geldanamycin and radicicol. Silencing of Hsp90 expression using siRNA also reduced viral replication. Hsp90 inhibition changed the half-life of newly synthesized L protein (the large subunit of the VSV polymerase) from >1 hour to less than 15 minutes without affecting the stability of other VSV proteins. Both the inhibition of viral replication and the destabilization of the viral L protein were seen when either geldanamycin or radicicol was added to cells infected with paramyxoviruses SV5, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, or SV41, or to cells infected with the La Crosse bunyavirus.

The Glycoprotein Cytoplasmic Tail of Uukuniemi Virus (Bunyaviridae) Interacts with Ribonucleoproteins and Is Critical for Genome Packaging,"We have analyzed the importance of specific amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail of the glycoprotein G(N) for packaging of ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) into virus-like particles (VLPs) of Uukuniemi virus (UUK virus), a member of the Bunyaviridae family. In order to study packaging, we added the G(N)/G(C) glycoprotein precursor (p110) to a polymerase I-driven minigenome rescue system to generate VLPs that are released into the supernatant. These particles can infect new cells, and reporter gene expression can be detected. To determine the role of UUK virus glycoproteins in RNP packaging, we performed an alanine scan of the glycoprotein G(N) cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 1 to 81). First, we discovered three regions in the tail (amino acids 21 to 25, 46 to 50, and 71 to 81) which are important for minigenome transfer by VLPs. Further mutational analysis identified four amino acids that were important for RNP packaging. These amino acids are essential for the binding of nucleoproteins and RNPs to the glycoprotein without affecting the morphology of the particles. No segment-specific interactions between the RNA and the cytoplasmic tail could be observed. We propose that VLP systems are useful tools for analyzing protein-protein interactions important for packaging of viral genome segments, assembly, and budding of other members of the Bunyaviridae family.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.108156749,-0.052362907,-0.00400303,-0.043687309,0.007769426,0.012023662,-0.031080466,-0.013197245,0.027834825,-0.01043362,-0.060254975,-0.016519361,0.007579482,-0.04224831,0.013795862,-0.047686461,0.02895016,-0.020452381,-0.010664261,0.015904351,-0.003885973,-0.00042136,0.00558928,-0.005265203,0.024845156,0.055275347,0.025462552,-0.025814044,-0.048981527,0.023827454
Comparative Analysis of Twelve Genomes of Three Novel Group 2c and Group 2d Coronaviruses Reveals Unique Group and Subgroup Features,"Twelve complete genomes of three novel coronaviruses—bat coronavirus HKU4 (bat-CoV HKU4), bat-CoV HKU5 (putative group 2c), and bat-CoV HKU9 (putative group 2d)—were sequenced. Comparative genome analysis showed that the various open reading frames (ORFs) of the genomes of the three coronaviruses had significantly higher amino acid identities to those of other group 2 coronaviruses than group 1 and 3 coronaviruses. Phylogenetic trees constructed using chymotrypsin-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, spike, and nucleocapsid all showed that the group 2a and 2b and putative group 2c and 2d coronaviruses are more closely related to each other than to group 1 and 3 coronaviruses. Unique genomic features distinguishing between these four subgroups, including the number of papain-like proteases, the presence or absence of hemagglutinin esterase, small ORFs between the membrane and nucleocapsid genes and ORFs (NS7a and NS7b), bulged stem-loop and pseudoknot structures downstream of the nucleocapsid gene, transcription regulatory sequence, and ribosomal recognition signal for the envelope gene, were also observed. This is the first time that NS7a and NS7b downstream of the nucleocapsid gene has been found in a group 2 coronavirus. The high Ka/Ks ratio of NS7a and NS7b in bat-CoV HKU9 implies that these two group 2d-specific genes are under high selective pressure and hence are rapidly evolving. The four subgroups of group 2 coronaviruses probably originated from a common ancestor. Further molecular epidemiological studies on coronaviruses in the bats of other countries, as well as in other animals, and complete genome sequencing will shed more light on coronavirus diversity and their evolutionary histories.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.126152802,0.130995206,-0.092827681,-0.033140629,0.299814297,0.035910771,0.087726594,0.071266788,-0.045743459,-0.086349803,-0.121019537,-0.086800339,6.00E-05,-0.022309449,-0.093728084,-0.023852027,0.05463534,0.051062104,0.024947947,0.034390903,-0.070247338,-0.074091669,-0.034642097,-0.017485899,-0.022572383,-0.042946137,-0.00760725,-0.03040946,-0.038770079,-0.039294507
An Outbreak of Human Coronavirus OC43 Infection and Serological Cross-reactivity with SARS Coronavirus,"BACKGROUND: In summer 2003, a respiratory outbreak was investigated in British Columbia, during which nucleic acid tests and serology unexpectedly indicated reactivity for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). METHODS: Cases at a care facility were epidemiologically characterized and sequentially investigated for conventional agents of respiratory infection, SARS-CoV and other human CoVs. Serological cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and human CoV-OC43 (HCoV-OC43) was investigated by peptide spot assay. RESULTS: Ninety-five of 142 residents (67%) and 53 of 160 staff members (33%) experienced symptoms of respiratory infection. Symptomatic residents experienced cough (66%), fever (21%) and pneumonia (12%). Eight residents died, six with pneumonia. No staff members developed pneumonia. Findings on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays for SARS-CoV at a national reference laboratory were suspected to represent false positives, but this was confounded by concurrent identification of antibody to N protein on serology. Subsequent testing by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction confirmed HCoV-OC43 infection. Convalescent serology ruled out SARS. Notably, sera demonstrated cross-reactivity against nucleocapsid peptide sequences common to HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the virulence of human CoV-OC43 in elderly populations and confirm that cross-reactivity to antibody against nucleocapsid proteins from these viruses must be considered when interpreting serological tests for SARS-CoV.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.092503682,0.406511935,-0.212372155,0.005698262,0.045719703,-0.008443218,-0.009005981,-0.129802196,0.072646776,-0.039375647,-0.04827275,0.118292918,0.157432706,0.006270644,0.011520912,0.014711204,-0.030307807,-0.028123347,-0.017961552,0.050102601,0.00289016,0.006941221,0.074991155,-0.005636912,0.031118834,0.005863763,0.00254392,0.034436809,-0.014287365,0.007502097
"A second, non-canonical RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in SARS Coronavirus","In (+) RNA coronaviruses, replication and transcription of the giant ∼30 kb genome to produce genome- and subgenome-size RNAs of both polarities are mediated by a cognate membrane-bound enzymatic complex. Its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity appears to be supplied by non-structural protein 12 (nsp12) that includes an RdRp domain conserved in all RNA viruses. Using SARS coronavirus, we now show that coronaviruses uniquely encode a second RdRp residing in nsp8. This protein strongly prefers the internal 5′-(G/U)CC-3′ trinucleotides on RNA templates to initiate the synthesis of complementary oligonucleotides of <6 residues in a reaction whose fidelity is relatively low. Distant structural homology between the C-terminal domain of nsp8 and the catalytic palm subdomain of RdRps of RNA viruses suggests a common origin of the two coronavirus RdRps, which however may have evolved different sets of catalytic residues. A parallel between the nsp8 RdRp and cellular DNA-dependent RNA primases is drawn to propose that the nsp8 RdRp produces primers utilized by the primer-dependent nsp12 RdRp.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.274490012,0.02447619,-0.148566671,0.204118062,0.002916062,-0.127938255,0.046135449,-0.002634713,-0.117368926,0.034369345,0.156507614,0.176495009,-0.09287099,-0.059629011,-0.075960842,-0.032733058,0.104526221,-0.095060822,-0.038700961,-0.046854942,0.027554721,-0.041880345,0.080871201,-0.08153148,0.03565726,0.063727267,-0.029347641,0.05986199,0.024872456,0.043638987
Characterization of White Bream Virus Reveals a Novel Genetic Cluster of Nidoviruses,"The order Nidovirales comprises viruses from the families Coronaviridae (genera Coronavirus and Torovirus), Roniviridae (genus Okavirus), and Arteriviridae (genus Arterivirus). In this study, we characterized White bream virus (WBV), a bacilliform plus-strand RNA virus isolated from fish. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence, organization, and expression of the 26.6-kb genome provided conclusive evidence for a phylogenetic relationship between WBV and nidoviruses. The polycistronic genome of WBV contains five open reading frames (ORFs), called ORF1a, -1b, -2, -3, and -4. In WBV-infected cells, three subgenomic RNAs expressing the structural proteins S, M, and N were identified. The subgenomic RNAs were revealed to share a 42-nucleotide, 5′ leader sequence that is identical to the 5′-terminal genome sequence. The data suggest that a conserved nonanucleotide sequence, CA(G/A)CACUAC, located downstream of the leader and upstream of the structural protein genes acts as the core transcription-regulating sequence element in WBV. Like other nidoviruses with large genomes (>26 kb), WBV encodes in its ORF1b an extensive set of enzymes, including putative polymerase, helicase, ribose methyltransferase, exoribonuclease, and endoribonuclease activities. ORF1a encodes several membrane domains, a putative ADP-ribose 1""-phosphatase, and a chymotrypsin-like serine protease whose activity was established in this study. Comparative sequence analysis revealed that WBV represents a separate cluster of nidoviruses that significantly diverged from toroviruses and, even more, from coronaviruses, roniviruses, and arteriviruses. The study adds to the amazing diversity of nidoviruses and appeals for a more extensive characterization of nonmammalian nidoviruses to better understand the evolution of these largest known RNA viruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.203959969,-0.054425926,-0.060751703,0.023371729,0.137162783,-0.06579952,-0.095594304,0.031167741,-0.016778461,-0.045730415,-0.080609685,-0.009384916,0.056432273,-0.091103158,-0.027476155,-0.066774157,0.052391892,0.001207797,-0.000486151,0.016915523,-0.00311283,-0.011648254,-0.047956164,-0.009987234,-0.037953147,0.005793726,-0.000683525,0.021337491,0.024409292,-0.085990402
Structural and Functional Basis for ADP-Ribose and Poly(ADP-Ribose) Binding by Viral Macro Domains,"Macro domains constitute a protein module family found associated with specific histones and proteins involved in chromatin metabolism. In addition, a small number of animal RNA viruses, such as corona- and toroviruses, alphaviruses, and hepatitis E virus, encode macro domains for which, however, structural and functional information is extremely limited. Here, we characterized the macro domains from hepatitis E virus, Semliki Forest virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV macro domain was determined at 1.8-Å resolution in complex with ADP-ribose. Information derived from structural, mutational, and sequence analyses suggests a close phylogenetic and, most probably, functional relationship between viral and cellular macro domain homologs. The data revealed that viral macro domains have relatively poor ADP-ribose 1""-phosphohydrolase activities (which were previously proposed to be their biologically relevant function) but bind efficiently free and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1-bound poly(ADP-ribose) in vitro. Collectively, these results suggest to further evaluate the role of viral macro domains in host response to viral infection.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.102511469,0.06516051,-0.106930983,-0.004606347,-0.028063314,0.016043975,0.023424127,-0.059014522,0.027825645,0.004143368,-0.042029119,0.003171812,0.019290689,-0.048635752,-0.028370906,-0.035181515,0.064648832,-0.047852548,-0.029598929,0.048600565,-0.028314379,0.01620178,-0.036381771,-0.037230017,0.059536664,0.041003893,-0.034956557,0.017846534,0.024946182,-0.065342856
Generation and Analysis of Infectious Virus-Like Particles of Uukuniemi Virus (Bunyaviridae): a Useful System for Studying Bunyaviral Packaging and Budding,"In the present report we describe an infectious virus-like particle (VLP) system for the Uukuniemi (UUK) virus, a member of the Bunyaviridae family. It utilizes our recently developed reverse genetic system based on the RNA polymerase I minigenome system for UUK virus used to study replication, encapsidation, and transcription by monitoring reporter gene expression. Here, we have added the glycoprotein precursor expression plasmid together with the minigenome, nucleoprotein, and polymerase to generate VLPs, which incorporate the minigenome and are released into the supernatant. The particles are able to infect new cells, and reporter gene expression can be monitored if the trans-acting viral proteins (RNA polymerase and nucleoprotein) are also expressed in these cells. No minigenome transfer occurred in the absence of glycoproteins, demonstrating that the glycoproteins are absolutely required for the generation of infectious particles. Moreover, expression of glycoproteins alone was sufficient to produce and release VLPs. We show that the ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) are incorporated into VLPs but are not required for the generation of particles. Morphological analysis of the particles by electron microscopy revealed that VLPs, either with or without minigenomes, display a surface morphology indistinguishable from that of the authentic UUK virus and that they bud into Golgi vesicles in the same way as UUK virus does. This infectious VLP system will be very useful for studying the bunyaviral structural components required for budding and packaging of RNPs and receptor binding and may also be useful for the development of new vaccines for the human pathogens from this family.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.120529866,-0.041858991,0.006434668,-0.022435516,-0.030146529,0.033170742,-0.010900466,-0.024344223,0.037779562,0.010552665,-0.041645607,-0.057578813,0.019021175,0.039509548,0.036633824,0.004551077,-0.011608696,-0.018038824,-0.018628948,0.001512539,0.015382291,0.006590616,0.014128748,-0.015273764,-0.004262811,0.021922075,0.024504336,0.013358865,-0.045568932,0.001434841
Prevalence and Genetic Diversity of Coronaviruses in Bats from China,"Coronaviruses can infect a variety of animals including poultry, livestock, and humans and are currently classified into three groups. The interspecies transmissions of coronaviruses between different hosts form a complex ecosystem of which little is known. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the recent identification of new coronaviruses have highlighted the necessity for further investigation of coronavirus ecology, in particular the role of bats and other wild animals. In this study, we sampled bat populations in 15 provinces of China and reveal that approximately 6.5% of the bats, from diverse species distributed throughout the region, harbor coronaviruses. Full genomes of four coronavirues from bats were sequenced and analyzed. Phylogenetic analyses of the spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleoprotein structural proteins and the two conserved replicase domains, putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA helicase, revealed that bat coronaviruses cluster in three different groups: group 1, another group that includes all SARS and SARS-like coronaviruses (putative group 4), and an independent bat coronavirus group (putative group 5). Further genetic analyses showed that different species of bats maintain coronaviruses from different groups and that a single bat species from different geographic locations supports similar coronaviruses. Thus, the findings of this study suggest that bats may play an integral role in the ecology and evolution of coronaviruses.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.110720333,0.15704357,-0.136788082,0.003140223,0.364451151,0.098564176,0.249396718,-0.012523388,-0.199305423,-0.05967555,-0.108685024,-0.111249121,-0.024944264,0.0353013,-0.067958039,0.046205199,0.04307363,0.06659322,0.035017001,0.048314365,-0.069054117,-0.066207688,-0.042345788,-0.098309111,0.037191462,0.003327164,-0.037453665,0.002164016,-0.030650542,-0.032304302
A cis-replication element functions in both orientations to enhance replication of Turnip crinkle virus,"Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) (family Tombusviridae, genus Carmovirus) is a positive-sense RNA virus containing a 4054-base genome. Previous results indicated that insertion of Hairpin 4 (H4) into a TCV-associated satellite RNA enhanced replication 6-fold in vivo (P. Nagy, J. Pogany, and A. E. Simon, EMBO J. 18:5653–5665, 1999). A detailed structural and functional analysis of H4 has now been performed to investigate its role in TCV replication. RNA structural probing of H4 in full-length TCV supported the sequence forming hairpin structures in both orientations in vitro. Deletion and mutational analyses determined that H4 is important for efficient accumulation of TCV in protoplasts, with a 98% reduction of genomic RNA levels when H4 was deleted. In vitro transcription using p88 [the TCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase] demonstrated that H4 in its plus-sense orientation [H4(+)] caused a nearly 2-fold increase in RNA synthesis from a core hairpin promoter located on TCV plus-strands. H4 in its minus-sense orientation [H4(−)] stimulated RNA synthesis by 100-fold from a linear minus-strand promoter. Gel mobility shift assays indicated that p88 binds H4(+) and H4(−) with equal affinity, which was substantially greater than the binding affinity to the core promoters. These results support roles for H4(+) and H4(−) in TCV replication by enhancing syntheses of both strands through attracting the RdRp to the template.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.123389085,-0.035991266,-0.025705715,0.009160708,-0.020940793,-0.040344582,-0.000563608,0.020330838,-0.025915033,-0.021660682,0.032838271,0.032641272,-0.041957625,-0.002934313,0.003728402,0.037127009,0.001361608,-0.008639818,-0.010016266,-0.032649046,-0.00713615,-0.003066713,-0.011925206,-0.032527935,-0.017387365,-0.036655618,-0.039709207,0.016892849,0.032220938,-0.005234902
Nuclear Localization of Flavivirus RNA Synthesis in Infected Cells,"Flaviviral replication is believed to be exclusively cytoplasmic, occurring within virus-induced membrane-bound replication complexes in the host cytoplasm. Here we show that a significant proportion (20%) of the total RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity from cells infected with West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and dengue virus is resident within the nucleus. Consistent with this, the major replicase proteins NS3 and NS5 of JEV also localized within the nucleus. NS5 was found distributed throughout the nucleoplasm, but NS3 was present at sites of active flaviviral RNA synthesis, colocalizing with NS5, and visible as distinct foci along the inner periphery of the nucleus by confocal and immunoelectron microscopy. Both these viral replicase proteins were also present in the nuclear matrix, colocalizing with the peripheral lamina, and revealed a well-entrenched nuclear location for the viral replication complex. In keeping with this observation, antibodies to either NS3 or NS5 coimmunoprecipitated the other protein from isolated nuclei along with newly synthesized viral RNA. Taken together these data suggest an absolute requirement for both of the replicase proteins for nucleus-localized synthesis of flavivirus RNA. Thus, we conclusively demonstrate for the first time that the host cell nucleus functions as an additional site for the presence of functionally active flaviviral replicase complex.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.202464499,-0.074337427,-0.084791962,0.076668138,-0.093736347,-0.029632274,0.043788847,0.000831878,-0.001488486,0.011813035,0.044409217,0.007285483,-0.043282481,0.094546761,-0.011726622,0.007345955,0.059282841,-0.068158044,0.00972409,0.05134343,-0.049342492,0.055269496,-0.042073271,-0.09828827,0.074989746,0.05721316,-0.015644256,0.00085938,-0.066163477,0.057160411
Restoration in vivo of defective hepatitis delta virus RNA genomes,"The 1679-nt single-stranded RNA genome of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is circular in conformation. It is able to fold into an unbranched rodlike structure via intramolecular base-pairing. This RNA is replicated by host RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Such transcription is unique, because Pol II is known only for its ability to act on DNA templates. The present study addressed the ability of the HDV RNA replication to tolerate insertions of up to 1000 nt of non-HDV sequence either at an end of the rodlike RNA structure or at a site embedded within the rod. The insertions did not interfere with the ability of primary transcripts to be processed in vivo by ribozyme cleavage and ligation. The insertions greatly reduced the ability of genomes to replicate. However, when total RNA from such transfected cells was used to transfect new recipient cells, replicating HDV RNAs could be detected by Northern analyses. The size of the emerged RNAs was consistent with loss of the inserted sequences. RT-PCR, cloning, and sequencing showed that recovery involved removal of inserted sequences with or without small deletions of adjacent RNA sequences. Such restoration of the RNA genome is consistent with a model requiring intramolecular template-switching (RNA recombination) during RNA-directed transcription, in combination with biological selection for maintenance of the rodlike structure of the template.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.257659784,-0.049233172,-0.036748729,0.122305823,0.027790186,-0.127637383,-0.064775738,0.054009308,-0.055777552,-0.007736862,0.049277168,-0.029383531,-0.008109399,0.053886658,0.042720649,0.068819428,-0.061171175,0.005398268,-0.051669088,-0.034969488,0.009932922,0.022336978,-0.040880122,0.010656118,-0.060377918,-0.102385479,-0.005277715,0.047544044,0.039268205,-0.023720176
Rapid Detection of Norovirus from Fecal Specimens by Real-Time Reverse Transcription-Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay,"In this study, we developed a one-step, single-tube genogroup-specific reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the detection of norovirus (NoV) genomes targeting from the C terminus of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene to the capsid N-terminal/shell domain region. This is the first report on the development of an RT-LAMP assay for the detection of NoV genomes. Because of the diversity of NoV genotypes, we used 9 and 13 specially designed primers containing mixed bases for genogroup I (GI) and II (GII), respectively. The RT-LAMP assay had the advantages of rapidity, simplicity, specificity, and selectively and could obtain results within 90 min, generally even within 60 min, under isothermal conditions at 62°C. The detection limits for NoV genomes were between 10(2) and 10(3) copies/tube for GI and GII with differentiation by genotype, and no cross-reactions among NoV GI and GII and other gastroenteritis viruses, such as sapovirus, human astrovirus, adenovirus type 40 and 41, and group A and C rotavirus, were found. In the evaluation tests with fecal specimens obtained from gastroenteritis outbreaks, the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay with regard to RT-PCR were 100 and 94% for GI and 100 and 100% for GII, respectively. These findings establish that the RT-LAMP assay is potentially useful for the rapid detection of NoV genomes from fecal specimens in outbreaks of food-borne and person-to-person-transmitted gastroenteritis.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.013632871,0.07935581,0.259582162,0.071731023,0.003027392,-0.076922205,0.014067614,0.004147958,-0.031704661,-0.090687059,-0.010865701,0.086946114,-0.098506119,0.03366229,-0.061702126,0.014122834,0.032922118,0.059096774,-0.073676694,0.031992208,-0.045708089,-0.001061883,-0.107415253,0.207628985,0.103081887,-0.010332789,-0.040885814,0.07818219,-0.04558196,-0.014475694
Bovine Coronavirus 5′-Proximal Genomic Acceptor Hotspot for Discontinuous Transcription Is 65 Nucleotides Wide,"Coronaviruses are positive-strand, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-utilizing viruses that require a polymerase template switch, characterized as discontinuous transcription, to place a 5′-terminal genomic leader onto subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs). The usually precise switch is thought to occur during the synthesis of negative-strand templates for sgmRNA production and to be directed by heptameric core donor sequences within the genome that match an acceptor core (UCUAAAC in the case of bovine coronavirus) near the 3′ end of the 5′-terminal genomic leader. Here it is shown that a 22-nucleotide (nt) donor sequence engineered into a packageable bovine coronavirus defective interfering (DI) RNA and made to match a sequence within the 65-nt virus genomic leader caused a template switch yielding an sgmRNA with only a 33-nt minileader. By changing the donor sequence, acceptor sites between genomic nt 33 and 97 (identical between the DI RNA and the viral genome) could be used to generate sgmRNAs detectable by Northern analysis (∼2 to 32 molecules per cell) by 24 h postinfection. Whether the switch was intramolecular only was not determined since a potentially distinguishing acceptor region in the DI RNA rapidly conformed to that in the helper virus genome through a previously described template switch known as leader switching. These results show that crossover acceptor sites for discontinuous transcription (i) need not include the UCUAAAC core and (ii) rest within a surprisingly wide 5′-proximal “hotspot.” Overlap of this hotspot with that for leader switching and with elements required for RNA replication suggests that it is part of a larger 5′-proximal multifunctional structure.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.196498392,-0.058292529,-0.044451378,0.056268558,0.071986722,-0.138365524,-0.140022527,0.073486681,-0.048843976,-0.068712874,0.007317796,-0.062025112,0.038603253,-0.022979329,0.107087545,0.11784519,-0.121834873,0.075131297,-0.008280222,-0.027203619,0.017568802,-0.013046709,-0.018441815,-0.008061928,0.010361082,-0.061744351,-0.030259542,0.013292917,0.127593264,-0.019901994
Clinical Applications of Molecular Biology for Infectious Diseases,"Molecular biological methods for the detection and characterisation of microorganisms have revolutionised diagnostic microbiology and are now part of routine specimen processing. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques have led the way into this new era by allowing rapid detection of microorganisms that were previously difficult or impossible to detect by traditional microbiological methods. In addition to detection of fastidious microorganisms, more rapid detection by molecular methods is now possible for pathogens of public health importance. Molecular methods have now progressed beyond identification to detect antimicrobial resistance genes and provide public health information such as strain characterisation by genotyping. Treatment of certain microorganisms has been improved by viral resistance detection and viral load testing for the monitoring of responses to antiviral therapies. With the advent of multiplex PCR, real-time PCR and improvements in efficiency through automation, the costs of molecular methods are decreasing such that the role of molecular methods will further increase. This review will focus on the clinical utility of molecular methods performed in the clinical microbiology laboratory, illustrated with the many examples of how they have changed laboratory diagnosis and therefore the management of infectious diseases.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.063252179,0.039602321,0.153713807,0.033070201,-0.086788991,0.023977406,0.065810055,0.023762484,-0.009327294,0.124006477,-0.053503321,-0.029909275,0.112719237,-0.09912557,0.029167141,-0.023222464,-0.034104817,0.034974972,-0.044686153,-0.092253977,-0.007963899,-0.010697335,0.048788383,-0.093636736,-0.013810736,-0.026780932,0.040177042,-0.056410006,0.002658596,0.021712917
Surveillance of respiratory virus infections in adult hospital admissions using rapid methods,"Both influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cause epidemics of respiratory illness of variable severity during the winter season. Influenza in particular has been blamed for hospital winter bed pressures, although it is thought that RSV may also play a role. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a new respiratory virus reported to be important in children; only a limited number of studies are available for adult populations. We aimed to determine initially the burden of virologically confirmed infections, i.e. influenza, RSV and hMPV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology and, in addition, to assess the feasibility of this approach as a surveillance tool for these respiratory viruses. Adult patients admitted to hospital in the previous 24 hours with onset of acute respiratory symptoms in the last 14 days were asked to participate. Informed written consent was obtained and nose and throat swabs taken. Multiplex PCR for influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), influenza B and RSV A and B were carried out together with a separate PCR for hMPV. A total of 219 patients in 2001–2002 and 216 in 2002–2003 were tested and the combined results for both seasons were: 8 positive for influenza A/H1N1, 14 for influenza A/H3N2, 2 for influenza B, 14 for RSV A and 6 for RSV B. Most patients (261/435) were >65 years and most positives (30/44) were found within this age group. A number of patients aged >65 years who were positive for influenza (12/15) reported having had vaccine. In total, 373 samples were tested for hMPV and 20 were found positive across all age groups except the 45–54 years age group. As influenza activity was low during the study period the impact of infection on admissions could not be assessed. Nevertheless the viruses studied accounted for 15% of hospital admissions for respiratory infection. Most patients were aged >65 years, as expected. In the two years studied RSV and hMPV were each responsible for as many hospitalized cases of respiratory infection as influenza. Influenza infection must be considered even in those who give a history of vaccination. The molecular methods used in this study showed that surveillance of these respiratory viruses can be conducted and may help in the management of patients.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.382029739,-0.173753233,-0.142197629,0.242221009,0.037393146,0.143269635,-0.152603806,-0.062957369,0.046567863,-0.151742665,0.039240284,-0.051010288,-0.125152206,0.035063292,-0.129754467,-0.045456171,0.018320359,0.152735412,-0.076594467,0.035896239,0.115206675,-0.090989847,0.021695728,-0.142361783,-0.005722912,-0.095335073,-0.020616227,0.012401282,-0.035358312,0.03627658
Identification of 5′ and 3′ cis-Acting Elements of the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus: Acquisition of Novel 5′ AU-Rich Sequences Restored Replication of a 5′-Proximal 7-Nucleotide Deletion Mutant,"We here demonstrate the successful engineering of the RNA genome of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) by using an infectious cDNA as a bacterial artificial chromosome. Runoff transcription from this cDNA by SP6 polymerase resulted in capped synthetic RNAs bearing authentic 5′ and 3′ ends of the viral genome that had specific infectivities of >5 × 10(5) PFU/μg of RNA. The synthetic viruses recovered from the transfected cells were genotypically and phenotypically indistinguishable from the parental virus. Using our system, a series of genomic RNAs with nucleotide deletions in their 5′ ends produced viruses with decreased or no infectivity. Various pseudorevertants were isolated, and acquisition of novel 5′ sequences of various sizes, composed predominantly of A and U bases, restored their infectivities, providing a novel insight into functional elements of the 5′ end of the PRRSV genome. In addition, our system was further engineered to generate a panel of self-replicating, self-limiting, luciferase-expressing PRRSV viral replicons bearing various deletions. Analysis of these replicons revealed the presence and location of a 3′ cis-acting element in the genome that was required for replication. Moreover, we produced enhanced green fluorescent protein-expressing infectious viruses, which indicates that the PRRSV cDNA/viral replicon/recombinant virus can be developed as a vector for the expression of a variety of heterologous genes. Thus, our PRRSV reverse genetics system not only offers a means of directly investigating the molecular mechanisms of PRRSV replication and pathogenesis but also can be used to generate new heterologous gene expression vectors and genetically defined antiviral vaccines.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.146099442,-0.05471723,-0.007347905,0.024462122,-0.010161954,-0.015808449,-0.047872669,-0.01916504,0.03502721,0.044561368,-0.042060065,-0.089144797,0.041405156,0.061429747,0.09408035,-0.046640646,-0.026831759,-0.030535466,-0.002667552,0.054277396,-0.035410113,0.014497957,0.035472804,-0.023375359,-0.030122881,0.029648945,0.051639133,-0.02718259,-0.084440486,0.061593448
Chronic liver injury in rats and humans upregulates the novel enzyme angiotensin converting enzyme 2,"Background: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a recently identified homologue of ACE that may counterregulate the actions of angiotensin (Ang) II by facilitating its breakdown to Ang 1–7. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cirrhosis but the role of ACE2 in liver disease is not known. Aims: This study examined the effects of liver injury on ACE2 expression and activity in experimental hepatic fibrosis and human cirrhosis, and the effects of Ang 1–7 on vascular tone in cirrhotic rat aorta. Methods: In sham operated and bile duct ligated (BDL) rats, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to assess hepatic ACE2 mRNA, and western blotting and immunohistochemistry to quantify and localise ACE2 protein. ACE2 activity was quantified by quenched fluorescent substrate assay. Similar studies were performed in normal human liver and in hepatitis C cirrhosis. Results: ACE2 mRNA was detectable at low levels in rat liver and increased following BDL (363-fold; p<0.01). ACE2 protein increased after BDL (23.5-fold; p<0.05) as did ACE2 activity (fourfold; p<0.05). In human cirrhotic liver, gene (>30-fold), protein expression (97-fold), and activity of ACE2 (2.4 fold) were increased compared with controls (all p<0.01). In healthy livers, ACE2 was confined to endothelial cells, occasional bile ducts, and perivenular hepatocytes but in both BDL and human cirrhosis there was widespread parenchymal expression of ACE2 protein. Exposure of cultured human hepatocytes to hypoxia led to increased ACE2 expression. In preconstricted rat aorta, Ang 1–7 alone did not affect vascular tone but it significantly enhanced acetylcholine mediated vasodilatation in cirrhotic vessels. Conclusions: ACE2 expression is significantly increased in liver injury in both humans and rat, possibly in response to increasing hepatocellular hypoxia, and may modulate RAS activity in cirrhosis.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.058750451,-0.021784671,-0.005224525,-0.106829857,-0.069425684,0.031027747,0.019301205,-0.036521615,0.030725209,-0.056289801,-0.048969807,0.008112395,-0.017711989,0.041935787,-0.033957276,-0.002585005,0.011342259,-0.009836586,-0.002022627,-0.052624959,0.029201106,-0.014001139,0.026532263,0.012774869,-0.004078962,0.028565612,-0.002363029,0.01201552,0.022284066,-0.05878631
Molecular Diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome : The State of the Art,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first appeared in Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002. Although virus isolation and serology were useful early in the SARS outbreak for diagnosing new cases, these tests are not generally useful because virus culture requires a BSL-3 laboratory and seroconversion is often delayed until 2 to 3 weeks after infection. The first qualitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-coronavirus (CoV) were sensitive and capable of detecting 1 to 10 genome equivalents. These assays were quickly supplemented with quantitative real-time assays that helped elucidate the natural history of SARS, particularly the initial presence of low viral loads in the upper respiratory tract and high viral loads in the lower respiratory tract. The unique natural history of SARS-CoV infection dictates the testing of both respiratory and nonrespiratory specimens, the testing of multiple specimens from the same patient, and sending out positives to be confirmed by a reference laboratory. Commercially available reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS have recently appeared; however, meaningful evaluations of these assays have not yet been performed and their true performance has not been determined. These and other issues related to diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection are discussed in this review.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.108566626,0.433370182,-0.172521182,0.05183419,-0.056560432,-0.016359136,-0.035346584,-0.240664346,-0.015262866,0.030366865,-0.014425589,-0.04859441,0.090938506,-0.060364838,0.069707754,-0.006577663,-0.038823719,-0.007751202,-0.003535921,-0.006477725,0.01588824,-0.027617117,-0.014894191,-0.038423433,-0.044437212,-0.020341877,-0.009511058,-0.002048129,-0.019847023,-0.020666817
Human Coronavirus NL63 Is Not Detected in the Respiratory Tracts of Children with Acute Kawasaki Disease,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is a self-limited, systemic vasculitis of children for which an infectious trigger is suspected. Recently, an association between KD and human coronavirus (HCoV)–New Haven (NH) was reported, on the basis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers that also amplified HCoV-NL63. We investigated the possible association between these HCoVs in the respiratory tract and KD by reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR and viral culture in a geographically and ethnically diverse population. Only 1 (2%) of 48 patients with acute KD was positive by RT-PCR for HCoV-NL63/NH in a nasopharyngeal swab.

Aetiological role of viral and bacterial infections in acute adult lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are a common reason for consulting general practitioners (GPs). In most cases the aetiology is unknown, yet most result in an antibiotic prescription. The aetiology of LRTI was investigated in a prospective controlled study. METHODS: Eighty adults presenting to GPs with acute LRTI were recruited together with 49 controls over 12 months. Throat swabs, nasal aspirates (patients and controls), and sputum (patients) were obtained and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) assays were used to detect Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, influenza viruses (AH1, AH3 and B), parainfluenza viruses 1–3, coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, and enteroviruses. Standard sputum bacteriology was also performed. Outcome was recorded at a follow up visit. RESULTS: Potential pathogens were identified in 55 patients with LRTI (69%) and seven controls (14%; p<0.0001). The identification rate was 63% (viruses) and 26% (bacteria) for patients and 12% (p<0.0001) and 6% (p = 0.013), respectively, for controls. The most common organisms identified in the patients were rhinoviruses (33%), influenza viruses (24%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (19%) compared with 2% (p<0.001), 6% (p = 0.013), and 4% (p = 0.034), respectively, in controls. Multiple pathogens were identified in 18 of the 80 LRTI patients (22.5%) and in two of the 49 controls (4%; p = 0.011). Atypical organisms were rarely identified. Cases with bacterial aetiology were clinically indistinguishable from those with viral aetiology. CONCLUSION: Patients presenting to GPs with acute adult LRTI predominantly have a viral illness which is most commonly caused by rhinoviruses and influenza viruses.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.223734269,-0.072033609,-0.073797297,-0.0050867,-0.021274665,-0.02727343,-0.044918653,0.0574307,-0.161149733,0.064368127,-0.040911448,-0.02523921,0.009419921,0.022094393,-0.039546486,-0.042330147,0.032539571,-0.022697286,0.009887672,-0.009441394,0.003877773,0.033607755,0.083883799,0.053873205,0.018571503,0.037418164,0.013969917,0.023022234,0.059991727,-0.021406029
Scalable Transcriptional Analysis Routine—Multiplexed Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Platform for Gene Expression Analysis and Molecular Diagnostics,"We report the development of a new technology for simultaneous quantitative detection of multiple targets in a single sample. Scalable transcriptional analysis routine (STAR) represents a novel integration of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and capillary electrophoresis that allows detection of dozens of gene transcripts in a multiplexed format using amplicon size as an identifier for each target. STAR demonstrated similar or better sensitivity and precision compared to two commonly used methods, SYBR Green-based and TaqMan probe-based real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. STAR can be used as a flexible platform for building a variety of applications to monitor gene expression, from single gene assays to assays analyzing the expression level of multiple genes. Using severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus as a model system, STAR technology detected single copies of the viral genome in a two-gene multiplex. Blinded studies using RNA extracted from various tissues of a SARS-infected individual showed that STAR correctly identified all samples containing SARS virus and yielded negative results for non-SARS control samples. Using alternate priming strategies, STAR technology can be adapted to transcriptional profiling studies without requiring a priori sequence information. Thus, STAR technology offers a flexible platform for development of highly multiplexed assays in gene expression analysis and molecular diagnostics.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.025321561,0.196184202,0.054651983,0.038483618,-0.018526019,-0.017486378,-0.044646968,-0.185210793,-0.0218113,0.027291606,-0.102191448,-0.076561477,0.082074216,-0.016078274,0.016053464,-0.046448974,-0.040495746,-0.065277485,-0.005997854,-0.074820054,0.009626955,-0.012937816,0.030527501,0.014986709,-0.093483123,-0.078379945,0.027187523,-0.008988285,0.016139745,0.012835232
"ADP-Ribose-1""-Monophosphatase: a Conserved Coronavirus Enzyme That Is Dispensable for Viral Replication in Tissue Culture","Replication of the ∼30-kb plus-strand RNA genome of coronaviruses and synthesis of an extensive set of subgenome-length RNAs are mediated by the replicase-transcriptase, a membrane-bound protein complex containing several cellular proteins and up to 16 viral nonstructural proteins (nsps) with multiple enzymatic activities, including protease, polymerase, helicase, methyltransferase, and RNase activities. To get further insight into the replicase gene-encoded functions, we characterized the coronavirus X domain, which is part of nsp3 and has been predicted to be an ADP-ribose-1""-monophosphate (Appr-1""-p) processing enzyme. Bacterially expressed forms of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus X domains were shown to dephosphorylate Appr-1""-p, a side product of cellular tRNA splicing, to ADP-ribose in a highly specific manner. The enzyme had no detectable activity on several other nucleoside phosphates. Guided by the crystal structure of AF1521, an X domain homolog from Archaeoglobus fulgidus, potential active-site residues of the HCoV-229E X domain were targeted by site-directed mutagenesis. The data suggest that the HCoV-229E replicase polyprotein residues, Asn 1302, Asn 1305, His 1310, Gly 1312, and Gly 1313, are part of the enzyme's active site. Characterization of an Appr-1""-pase-deficient HCoV-229E mutant revealed no significant effects on viral RNA synthesis and virus titer, and no reversion to the wild-type sequence was observed when the mutant virus was passaged in cell culture. The apparent dispensability of the conserved X domain activity in vitro indicates that coronavirus replicase polyproteins have evolved to include nonessential functions. The biological significance of the novel enzymatic activity in vivo remains to be investigated.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.179920893,-0.040024207,-0.118932336,0.060825001,0.029447742,-0.076115064,0.024821853,-0.044617963,0.084769776,-0.055078772,-0.04540747,0.245840132,0.192186074,0.085005954,-0.058790918,-0.016209085,0.074216976,-0.056002515,-0.021343933,0.052485097,-0.0566477,-0.0092081,0.019162957,-0.101404556,0.113855593,0.062189697,-0.024054447,0.038328121,-0.017744468,-0.042082501
RNA Interference-Mediated Virus Clearance from Cells both Acutely and Chronically Infected with the Prototypic Arenavirus Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus,"Several arenaviruses, including Lassa fever virus, cause severe, often lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans. No licensed vaccines are available in the United States, and currently there is no efficacious therapy to treat this viral infection. Therefore the importance of developing effective antiviral approaches to combat pathogenic arenaviruses is clear. Moreover, the prototypic arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is an important model for the study of viral persistence and associated diseases, as well as for exploring therapies to treat viral chronic infections. The use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to downregulate gene expression via RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a powerful genetic tool for the study of gene function. In addition, the successful use of siRNAs to target a variety of animal viruses has led us to consider RNAi as a potential novel antiviral strategy. We have investigated the use of RNAi therapy against LCMV. Here, we show that siRNAs targeting sequences within the viral L polymerase and Z mRNAs inhibit LCMV multiplication in cultured cells. Unexpectedly, the antiviral efficacy of RNAi-based therapy against LCMV was highly dependent on the method used to deliver effector siRNA molecules. Thus, transfection of chemically synthesized siRNA pools to L and Z was ineffective in preventing virus multiplication. In contrast, targeting of the same viral L and Z gene products with siRNAs produced inside cells using a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus expression system inhibited LCMV multiplication very efficiently. Notably, transduction with the replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus expression system to Z and L effectively cured persistently LCMV-infected cells, suggesting the feasibility of using RNAi therapy to combat viral chronic infections by riboviruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.094683319,-0.048322592,-0.022141764,0.001849262,-0.097246488,0.052378421,0.057476646,-0.02863455,0.056502821,0.057889614,-0.02953792,-0.077559529,0.044898165,0.067480466,0.035455001,-0.01252687,-0.065772843,0.048002979,0.017032323,0.04147255,0.013247683,0.051444013,-0.022780577,0.052760145,-0.02434442,-0.00889165,0.070548036,-0.030384804,0.019294211,0.051815663
A loop 2 cytidine-stem 1 minor groove interaction as a positive determinant for pseudoknot-stimulated –1 ribosomal frameshifting,"The molecular determinants of stimulation of –1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (–1 PRF) by RNA pseudoknots are poorly understood. Sugarcane yellow leaf virus (ScYLV) encodes a 28-nt mRNA pseudoknot that promotes –1 PRF between the P1 (protease) and P2 (polymerase) genes in plant luteoviruses. The solution structure of the ScYLV pseudoknot reveals a well ordered loop 2 (L2) that exhibits continuous stacking of A20 through C27 in the minor groove of the upper stem 1 (S1), with C25 flipped out of the triple-stranded stack. Five consecutive triple base pairs flank the helical junction where the 3′ nucleotide of L2, C27, adopts a cytidine 27 N3-cytidine 14 2′-OH hydrogen bonding interaction with the C14-G7 base pair. This interaction is isosteric with the adenosine N1–2′-OH interaction in the related mRNA from beet western yellows virus (BWYV); however, the ScYLV and BWYV mRNA structures differ in their detailed L2–S1 hydrogen bonding and L2 stacking interactions. Functional analyses of ScYLV/BWYV chimeric pseudoknots reveal that the ScYLV RNA stimulates a higher level of –1 PRF (15 ± 2%) relative to the BWYV pseudoknot (6 ± 1%), a difference traced largely to the identity of the 3′ nucleotide of L2 (C27 vs. A25 in BWYV). Strikingly, C27A ScYLV RNA is a poor frameshift stimulator (2.0%) and is destabilized by ≈1.5 kcal·mol(–1) (pH 7.0, 37°C) with respect to the wild-type pseudoknot. These studies establish that the precise network of weak interactions nearest the helical junction in structurally similar pseudoknots make an important contribution to setting the frameshift efficiency in mRNAs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.125494044,-0.054076529,-0.022524867,-0.030753236,0.013846252,-0.029618729,-0.038740579,0.017476127,-0.008910676,-0.03162779,-0.029028145,0.012004221,-0.026624121,-0.056146622,-0.03089413,-0.000534233,0.00652933,-0.013377094,-0.033167544,-0.039047004,-0.000393349,-0.029551124,-0.03862803,0.020370014,-0.036956347,-0.089028447,-0.025915422,0.02571166,0.099025535,-0.063402935
Human Metapneumovirus: An Important Cause of Respiratory Disease in Children and Adults,"Human metapneumovirus is a paramyxovirus that was discovered in 2001 in the Netherlands. Epidemiologic studies have shown it to be a major cause of acute respiratory tract disease in normal infants and children worldwide, with a seasonal occurrence and spectrum of clinical illness most similar to the closely related respiratory syncytial virus. The greatest prevalence of severe disease requiring hospitalization in otherwise healthy children appears to be in those aged between 6 and 12 months, older than the peak age of hospitalizations for respiratory syncytial virus. Human metapneumovirus is also a significant cause of acute respiratory disease in adults, particularly the elderly and those with comorbid conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and cancer. Because there is no rapid diagnostic assay, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction is most widely used. Animal models have been developed, and candidate live-attenuated vaccines are in preclinical trials, offering the potential for future interventions in high-risk groups.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.18350026,-0.061927168,-0.055481592,0.032369273,0.019890283,-0.041880944,0.082976896,-0.085766115,0.119479803,0.014985847,-0.002269703,-0.023713063,0.020229662,-0.064025346,0.006118876,0.005473884,-0.030059954,0.028204568,-0.016896273,0.039778342,0.033745336,-0.09451962,-0.023599075,0.028555833,0.017017228,0.026818851,-0.05365785,-0.00580677,0.058131443,-0.037107547
A single immunization with a rhabdovirus-based vector expressing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) S protein results in the production of high levels of SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies,"Foreign viral proteins expressed by rabies virus (RV) have been shown to induce potent humoral and cellular immune responses in immunized animals. In addition, highly attenuated and, therefore, very safe RV-based vectors have been constructed. Here, an RV-based vaccine vehicle was utilized as a novel vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). For this approach, the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (N) or envelope spike protein (S) genes were cloned between the RV glycoprotein G and polymerase L genes. Recombinant vectors expressing SARS-CoV N or S protein were recovered and their immunogenicity was studied in mice. A single inoculation with the RV-based vaccine expressing SARS-CoV S protein induced a strong SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibody response. The ability of the RV-SARS-CoV S vector to confer immunity after a single inoculation makes this live vaccine a promising candidate for eradication of SARS-CoV in animal reservoirs, thereby reducing the risk of transmitting the infection to humans.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.047487034,0.393590009,-0.215341133,-0.028962944,-0.030528526,0.049742811,-0.036836938,-0.196897886,0.066182127,-0.007605527,-0.050603814,-0.052606088,-0.011641202,-0.048224346,-0.004217767,-0.024830888,0.005846595,-0.058282347,-0.022985099,0.040957564,0.016592785,-0.017734581,0.054184014,0.074945251,0.040705892,-0.012929917,0.039305015,-0.01317327,-0.03872275,0.071367095
Exploiting cis-Acting Replication Elements To Direct Hepatitis C Virus-Dependent Transgene Expression,"We describe here a novel targeting gene therapy strategy to direct gene expression responsive to hepatitis C virus (HCV). The goal was approached by engineering a construct containing the antisense sequence of the transgene and internal ribosome entry site of encephalomyocarditis virus flanked by 5′- and 3′-end sequences of HCV cDNA that contain cis-acting replication elements. Thus, expression of the transgene is only promoted when the minus-strand RNA has been synthesized by the functional replication machinery present in infected cells. Reporter assay and strand-specific reverse transcription-PCR showed selective transgene expression in Huh-7 cells harboring an autonomously replicating HCV subgenome but remaining silent in uninfected cells. Furthermore, using the cytosine deaminase suicide gene as a transgene coupled with recombinant adenovirus delivery, we demonstrated that cytosine deaminase was specifically expressed in replicon cells, resulting in marked chemosensitization of replicon cells to the cytotoxic effects of flucytosine. This new targeting strategy could be extended to other single-stranded RNA viruses encoding the unique RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that has no parallel in mammalian cells.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.238101954,-0.064363748,-0.015900367,0.049946827,-0.057491734,-0.048755058,-0.051261444,-0.015868515,0.043825696,-0.022496344,-0.035491637,-0.04494391,0.017612393,0.164314589,0.002742387,-0.00073083,-0.011108171,0.116146864,0.209656053,-0.096541761,-0.01252646,0.037727682,0.080006543,0.038706408,-0.108466832,-0.072698654,-0.029187456,0.089432537,-0.057228817,-0.031181188
Development of a quantitative assay for SARS coronavirus and correlation of GAPDH mRNA with SARS coronavirus in clinical specimens,"Aims: To develop a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) detection and explore the potential of using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA as an internal control to exclude false negative results. Methods: SARS-CoV and GAPDH mRNA were both measured in 26 specimens from 16 patients with SARS, 40 follow up specimens from the same batch of patients, and appropriate control subjects. The relation between SARS positivity and GAPDH mRNA concentration was investigated using the χ(2) test. Increasing the sensitivity for SARS-CoV and GAPDH mRNA detection was investigated in follow up specimens in which SARS-CoV and GAPDH mRNA were not detected initially. Results: Varying amounts of SARS-CoV were found in the 26 SARS-CoV positive specimens and SARS-CoV was not detected in the 40 follow up specimens and controls. In addition, concentrations of GAPDH mRNA were significantly different between the patients with SARS, follow up specimens, and healthy controls (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.05). Moreover, GAPDH mRNA concentrations were highly correlated with SARS-CoV positivity (χ(2) = 5.43; p<0.05). Finally, SARS-CoV and GAPDH mRNA were both detected in three follow up urine specimens that were initially negative when the amount of cDNA used was increased from 5 μl to 10 and 15 μl. Conclusions: This Q-RT-PCR assay can be used to detect SARS-CoV. Moreover, GAPDH mRNA may be useful to rule out false negative results in SARS-CoV detection, and the current extraction method for urine may not be sensitive enough to detect low titres of SARS-CoV.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.04328132,0.479422629,-0.171351239,-0.007560198,-0.051302548,-0.02743531,-0.080609161,-0.190179156,-0.04477759,-0.04482835,-0.019250478,-0.044886857,0.00846031,0.005044348,0.003753689,0.026718524,-0.012591531,-0.058209384,-0.005835048,-0.035339292,-0.004637299,0.01481279,0.066168236,0.043839313,-0.022881116,-0.073196978,-0.031711169,0.015303926,0.071324067,0.012835737
Detection of CK20mRNA in peripheral blood of pancreatic cancer and its clinical significance,"AIM: To detect the expression of CK20mRNA in peripheral blood of pancreatic cancer and evaluate its clinical significance. METHODS: Expression of CK20mRNA in peripheral blood was detected by fluorogenic qualitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 40 cases of pancreatic cancer at the night before operation, in 5 cases of benign pancreatic diseases, in 5 cases of healthy individuals. The relationships were investigated between CK20mRNA expression and the clinicopathological variables, and clinical follow-up outcome in those patients with pancreatic cancer having undergone radical resection. RESULTS: Of the 40 patients with pancreatic cancer, 23 (57.5%) cases were positive for CK20mRNA expression. CK20mRNA expression was significantly correlated with lymphatic metastasis (P = 0.008), histopathological grading (P = 0.009), and pathological stage (P = 0.021); there was no significant correlation between CK20mRNA expression and age, gender, tumor diameter, and depth of invasion. The cumulative metastasis rates of patients with CK20mRNA expression were higher than those of patients with no CK20mRNA expression within 6 mo (34.7% vs 5.9%, P = 0.043) or 12 mo (73.9% vs 35.3%, P = 0.02) after operation. CK20mRNA expression in peripheral blood of pancreatic cancer indicated poorer prognosis. The survival rate of patients with CK20mRNA expression was lower than that of patients with negative CK20mRNA expression (Log-Rank = 13.31, P = 0.0003). CONCLUSION: CK20mRNA is a sensitive and specific molecular marker for the detection of micrometastasis in peripheral blood of patients with pancreatic cancer. The CK20mRNA expression in peripheral blood is correlated with biological characteristic of pancreatic cancer. It can help to predict the prognosis of pancreatic cancer after operation, and to determine which patient will benefit from aggressive adjuvant therapies.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.016098209,-0.013397634,-0.000664943,-0.125117479,-0.066931634,0.0041149,-0.012508041,0.017242814,-0.034431274,-0.032377235,-0.030466946,0.001032833,-0.007397104,0.051148558,-0.030719246,0.015892059,0.01430557,-0.012732684,-0.023850169,-0.043962604,0.03248996,-0.026555338,-0.003430528,-0.002958125,-0.030601929,-0.004673301,0.009762236,0.027328122,0.01030513,-0.036611801
Role of Nucleotides Immediately Flanking the Transcription-Regulating Sequence Core in Coronavirus Subgenomic mRNA Synthesis,"The generation of subgenomic mRNAs in coronavirus involves a discontinuous mechanism of transcription by which the common leader sequence, derived from the genome 5′ terminus, is fused to the 5′ end of the mRNA coding sequence (body). Transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) precede each gene and include a conserved core sequence (CS) surrounded by relatively variable sequences (5′ TRS and 3′ TRS). Regulation of transcription in coronaviruses has been studied by reverse-genetics analysis of the sequences immediately flanking a unique CS in the Transmissible gastroenteritis virus genome (CS-S2), located inside the S gene, that does not lead to detectable amounts of the corresponding mRNA, in spite of its canonical sequence. The transcriptional inactivity of CS-S2 was genome position independent. The presence of a canonical CS was not sufficient to drive transcription, but subgenomic synthesis requires a minimum base pairing between the leader TRS (TRS-L) and the complement of the body TRS (cTRS-B) provided by the CS and its adjacent nucleotides. A good correlation was observed between the free energy of TRS-L and cTRS-B duplex formation and the levels of subgenomic mRNA S2, demonstrating that base pairing between the leader and body beyond the CS is a determinant regulation factor in coronavirus transcription. In TRS mutants with increasing complementarity between TRS-L and cTRS-B, a tendency to reach a plateau in ΔG values was observed, suggesting that a more precise definition of the TRS limits might be proposed, specifically that it consists of the central CS and around 4 nucleotides flanking 5′ and 3′ the CS. Sequences downstream of the CS exert a stronger influence on the template-switching decision according to a model of polymerase strand transfer and template switching during minus-strand synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.11521354,-0.034637813,-0.002986219,-0.046983323,0.033787088,-0.034474381,-0.067293383,0.016620374,-0.003255905,-0.060136777,-0.031755614,-0.017410617,0.014447865,-0.038624346,0.015179294,0.039884105,-0.02645281,0.008764132,-0.033731238,-0.031293765,0.011290551,-0.01423164,-0.024246832,0.01021454,-0.004866238,-0.062388883,-0.033420205,0.026679923,0.091420476,-0.007997865
"Acquired but reversible loss of erythrocyte complement receptor 1 (CR1, CD35) and its longitudinal alteration in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome","This longitudinal study investigates the change of erythrocyte complement receptor (E-CR1) expression in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Circulating E-CR1 expression was semiquantified by flow cytometric analyses in 54 SARS patients and in 212 healthy individuals as a control. Since E-CR1 expression is influenced by the genetic polymorphisms in the CR1 gene, a major genetic polymorphism located within intron 27 of the CR1 gene was simultaneously analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The results showed that the expression level of E-CR1 (referred to as net fluorescence intensity values, NFI) was statistically correlated with the relevant genetic genotypes among the Chinese population including the healthy individuals (NFI: 5·14 ± 0·82, 3·57 ± 0·66 and 2·67 ± 0·32 for HH, HL and LL genotypes, respectively) and SARS patients (NFI: 3·52 ± 0·91 and 2·63 ± 0·70 for HH and HL genotypes, respectively). Interestingly, the expression density of E-CR1 was found to fall significantly during the initiation and progressive phases (weeks 1 and 2 after the disease onset) and gradually returned close to normal through their whole convalescent phase (beginning from weeks 2 or 3 to weeks 7 or 8) in SARS patients irrespective CR1 genotype. In conclusion, our findings, at least, suggest that E-CR1 is likely involved in immune pathogenesis of SARS disease.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.035187506,0.191266948,-0.125198808,-0.142636924,-0.03433215,0.009743231,-0.083935351,-0.184064408,-0.117140204,-0.008654599,-0.054194813,0.014367383,-0.004100968,0.037618177,-0.047791438,0.019345729,-0.024177669,-0.032484796,0.000381153,-0.030901173,0.051106634,-0.063464178,-0.001111761,0.036046557,-0.086177487,-0.066136075,0.019328217,-0.036412462,0.004779688,-0.006227144
Short Internal Sequences Involved in Replication and Virion Accumulation in a Subviral RNA of Turnip Crinkle Virus,"cis-acting sequences and structural elements in untranslated regions of viral genomes allow viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases to correctly initiate and transcribe asymmetric levels of plus and minus strands during replication of plus-sense RNA viruses. Such elements include promoters, enhancers, and transcriptional repressors that may require interactions with distal RNA sequences for function. We previously determined that a non-sequence-specific hairpin (M1H) in the interior of a subviral RNA (satC) associated with Turnip crinkle virus is required for fitness and that its function might be to bridge flanking sequences (X. Sun and A. E. Simon, J. Virol. 77:7880-7889, 2003). To establish the importance of the flanking sequences in replication and satC-specific virion repression, segments on both sides of M1H were randomized and subjected to in vivo functional selection (in vivo SELEX). Analyses of winning (functional) sequences revealed three different conserved elements within the segments that could be specifically assigned roles in replication, virion repression, or both. One of these elements was also implicated in the molecular switch that releases the 3′ end from its interaction with the repressor hairpin H5, which is possibly involved in controlling the level of minus-strand synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.208808075,-0.06790588,-0.059796485,0.075621167,0.012088217,-0.078054238,-0.018528084,0.037583225,-0.054318977,0.014188125,0.041995767,-0.003313093,-0.010289054,0.003819758,0.005107911,0.032404196,-0.009433932,-0.018549937,-0.034540912,-0.029137307,-0.023516826,0.007089265,-0.063629064,-0.019243518,-0.072199399,-0.119604983,-0.043936157,0.023399367,0.066679234,0.010110621
Quantitation of Adenovirus Genome During Acute Infection in Normal Children,"BACKGROUND: Adenovirus infection causes a wide range of clinical illness in normal children. New molecular techniques allow quantitation of viral genome to study the natural history of adenovirus infection and viral load in normal children. METHODS: Clinical samples were collected from 38 previously healthy, febrile children, and viral cultures were performed. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect adenovirus genome and to determine viral load. Adenovirus isolates were genotyped with a PCR-based assay. RESULTS: Adenovirus culture was positive in 6 children who were diagnosed with acute adenovirus infection. Throat swabs contained high copy numbers of adenovirus genome (1.6 × 10(6)–6 × 10(7) copies/swab) from 4 of 4 adenovirus culture-positive children. Only 2 of 32 adenovirus culture-negative children had detectable adenovirus genome from throat swabs, but with a lower copy number (8 × 10(2) copies/swab). Adenovirus genome was not detected in blood samples from 5 of 6 adenovirus culture-positive children with uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection and from all adenovirus culture-negative children. High level viremia (1.8 × 10(8)/ml) was detected in an adenovirus culture-positive 6-month-old infant with fever, pneumonia, conjunctivitis and hepatitis. Subsequent reduction in viral load paralleled her clinical recovery. Adenovirus viruria (1 × 10(9) copies/ml) with normal urinanalysis was detected in another adenovirus culture-positive child. All 6 adenovirus isolates were genotyped as adenovirus type 7h. CONCLUSION: Viral load assessment in clinical samples determined by quantitative PCR can be useful in the diagnosis of adenovirus infection in immunocompetent, febrile children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.145797948,-0.063450861,0.012124904,-0.018116136,0.034906593,-0.113740533,0.062019728,-0.061308915,0.022400623,0.009238317,0.013287741,-0.069084804,-0.021137647,-0.026136066,0.048267977,-0.043816433,-0.055789237,-0.02266475,0.025743818,-0.096203323,-0.027878894,0.202488358,0.027065168,0.005631335,-0.119283009,0.048373387,0.00832079,0.049262726,-0.06632799,0.019460073
High-yield expression of recombinant SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid protein in methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris,"AIM: Nucleocapsid (N) protein plays an important role in reproduction and pathological reaction of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SCoV), the antigenicity of the protein is better than spike (S) protein. This study was to find a highly specific and antigenic recombinant SCoV nucleocapsid (rSCoVN) protein, and to provide a basis for further researches on early diagnosis of SARS. METHODS: Full length cDNA of SCoV nucleocapsid (SCoVN) protein was amplified through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into yeast expression vector pPIC3.5K to construct plasmid of pPIC3.5K-SCoVN. The plasmid was linearized and then transformed into Pichia pastoris (P.pastoris) GS115 (His(-)Mut(+)) by electroporation. His(+)Mut(+) recombinant strains were identified by PCR and cultivated on MM/MD plates. The influence of different factors on biomass and rSCoVN protein production during induction phase, such as various induction media, dissolved oxygen (DO) and different final concentrations of methanol, was subsequently studied. The expression level and activation were detected by SDS-PAGE and Western-blot respectively. RESULTS: All of the recombinants were His(+)Mut(+) after transformation of P.pastoris with linearized plasmids. The BMMY medium was optimal for recombinant ScoVN (rSCoVN) protein expression and growth of the recombinant strains. The final optimal concentration of methanol was 20 mL/L, the DO had a significant effect on rSCoVN protein expression and growth of recombinant strains. The rSCoVN protein expressed in recombinant strains was about 8% of the total cell protein, 520 mg/L of rSCoVN protein was achieved, and a maximum cell A at 600 nm of 62 was achieved in shake flask culture. The rSCoVN protein had a high specificity against mouse-anti-SARS-CoVN-mAb and SARS positive sera, but had no cross-reaction with normal human serum. The biological activity of rSCoVN expressed in P.pastoris was about 4-fold higher than that expressed in E.coli when the same rSCoVN protein quantity was used. CONCLUSION: Active recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus nucleocapsid (rSCoVN) protein can be successfully expressed in recombinant methylotrophic yeast P.pastoris GS115. The rSCoVN protein has a high specificity against SARS-CoVN-mAb and SARS positive sera, but has no cross-reaction with normal human serum.

HCV-371 displayed broad inhibitory activities against the NS5B RdRp enzyme, with 50% inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 1.8 μM for 90% of the isolates derived from HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, and 3a. HCV-371 showed no inhibitory activity against a panel of human polymerases, including mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, and other unrelated viral polymerases, demonstrating its specificity for the HCV polymerase. A single administration of HCV-371 to cells containing the HCV subgenomic replicon for 3 days resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of the steady-state levels of viral RNA and protein. Multiple treatments with HCV-371 for 16 days led to a >3-log(10) reduction in the HCV RNA level. In comparison, multiple treatments with a similar inhibitory dose of alpha interferon resulted in a 2-log(10) reduction of the viral RNA level. In addition, treatment of cells with a combination of HCV-371 and pegylated alpha interferon resulted in an additive antiviral activity. Within the effective antiviral concentrations of HCV-371, there was no effect on cell viability and metabolism. The intracellular antiviral specificity of HCV-371 was demonstrated by its lack of activity in cells infected with several DNA or RNA viruses. Fluorescence binding studies show that HCV-371 binds the NS5B with an apparent dissociation constant of 150 nM, leading to high selectivity and lack of cytotoxicity in the antiviral assays.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.141798791,-0.045583834,-0.029117613,0.014883872,-0.117515886,0.009778387,0.077537986,0.007626411,0.034506302,0.017554677,0.013874381,0.107997155,-0.001524126,0.066559805,-0.049670741,-0.040522559,0.023978942,0.291878821,0.365908267,-0.153981055,-0.080154122,-0.004595945,0.132248973,0.069115335,-0.076668889,-0.073423771,-0.070553548,0.082483138,-0.080027957,-0.048434594
Initial viral load and the outcomes of SARS,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus. It may progress to respiratory failure, and a significant proportion of patients die. Preliminary data suggest that a high viral load of the SARS coronavirus is associated with adverse outcomes in the intensive care unit, but the relation of viral load to survival is unclear. METHODS: We prospectively studied an inception cohort of 133 patients with virologically confirmed SARS who were admitted to 2 general acute care hospitals in Hong Kong from Mar. 24 to May 4, 2003. The patients were followed until death or for a minimum of 90 days. We used Cox proportional hazard modelling to analyze potential predictors of survival recorded at the time of presentation, including viral load from nasopharyngeal specimens (measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [PCR] of the SARS-associated coronavirus). RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (24.1%) met the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 24 patients (18.0%) died. The following baseline factors were independently associated with worse survival: older age (61–80 years) (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 5.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.03–13.53), presence of an active comorbid condition (adjusted HR 3.36, 95% CI 1.44–7.82) and higher initial viral load of SARS coronavirus, according to quantitative PCR of nasopharyngeal specimens (adjusted HR 1.21 per log(10) increase in number of RNA copies per millilitre, 95% CI 1.06–1.39). INTERPRETATION: We found preliminary evidence that higher initial viral load is independently associated with worse prognosis in SARS. Mortality data for patients with SARS should be interpreted in light of age, comorbidity and viral load. These considerations will be important in future studies of SARS.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.159532573,0.20858623,-0.21297896,-0.048663095,-0.078382721,-0.075645362,-0.071559554,-0.17128145,-0.163765638,-0.005009028,-0.011503312,0.012267131,-0.003840508,0.013807207,-0.050800793,0.058022185,-0.06044985,-0.033980371,0.038941734,0.024369693,-0.09827035,0.012799678,-0.04311974,0.061851934,-0.060946067,-0.090863881,0.020247304,-0.165214041,-0.082543813,0.023928457
Immunological response to Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis in chickens,"Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and culture are 2 common diagnostic tests for detecting Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) in Johne’s disease, but they are not as sensitive as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, inhibitors can coextract with the target DNA and cause interference in PCR. Development of an immune capture assay followed by PCR amplification can alleviate this problem. In this study, we were able to induce an immune response in chickens using heat or formalin inactivated Map. The purified immunoglobulin (Ig)Y has a molecular weight of 160 kDa. The titers were at 1:6400 and 1:12 800 at weeks 5 to 6 and 8 to 9, respectively, as determined by the IDEXX modified ELISA kit for Johne’s disease. The IgY produced from inactivated bacterial cells had no effect on its ability to recognize live Map cells as illustrated by immunofluorescence assay and immune capture PCR results.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.003526973,0.032508025,0.145561151,-0.037050796,-0.089254144,0.007842513,0.030340084,-0.040280666,0.031190028,0.008468498,-0.024430845,-0.038340723,0.016913704,0.039118057,-0.006178671,-0.0086566,0.006390175,-0.008728928,-0.005891408,-0.060676109,0.018548682,-0.01393597,0.089467143,-0.036643838,-0.024310779,0.014612783,0.035590102,-0.026356521,0.005452095,-0.002362158
cis-Acting RNA Signals in the NS5B C-Terminal Coding Sequence of the Hepatitis C Virus Genome,"The cis-replicating RNA elements in the 5′ and 3′ nontranslated regions (NTRs) of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome have been thoroughly studied before. However, no cis-replicating elements have been identified in the coding sequences of the HCV polyprotein until very recently. The existence of highly conserved and stable stem-loop structures in the RNA polymerase NS5B coding sequence, however, has been previously predicted (A. Tuplin, J. Wood, D. J. Evans, A. H. Patel, and P. Simmonds, RNA 8:824-841, 2002). We have selected for our studies a 249-nt-long RNA segment in the C-terminal NS5B coding region (NS5BCR), which is predicted to form four stable stem-loop structures (SL-IV to SL-VII). By deletion and mutational analyses of the RNA structures, we have determined that two of the stem-loops (SL-V and SL-VI) are essential for replication of the HCV subgenomic replicon in Huh-7 cells. Mutations in the loop and the top of the stem of these RNA elements abolished replicon RNA synthesis but had no effect on translation. In vitro gel shift and filter-binding assays revealed that purified NS5B specifically binds to SL-V. The NS5B-RNA complexes were specifically competed away by unlabeled homologous RNA, to a small extent by 3′ NTR RNA, and only poorly by 5′ NTR RNA. The other two stem-loops (SL-IV and SL-VII) of the NS5BCR domain were found to be important but not essential for colony formation by the subgenomic replicon. The precise function(s) of these cis-acting RNA elements is not known.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.214126367,-0.059837946,-0.050470153,0.070906059,-0.010319326,-0.097115585,-0.035257758,0.048325289,-0.037906418,-0.030723778,0.027393509,0.048306974,-0.01202178,0.000796429,-0.019299279,0.00211506,0.01713996,0.118779462,0.117957692,-0.09705015,-0.056200971,-0.019271009,0.00019184,0.011007702,-0.062281439,-0.102715586,-0.079810406,0.069147995,0.03039025,-0.041737608
Identification and Characterization of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Replicase Proteins,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) encodes proteins required for RNA transcription and genome replication as large polyproteins that are proteolytically processed by virus-encoded proteinases to produce mature replicase proteins. In this report, we generated antibodies against SARS-CoV predicted replicase protein and used the antibodies to identify and characterize 12 of the 16 predicted mature replicase proteins (nsp1, nsp2, nsp3, nsp4, nsp5, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14, nsp15, and nsp16) in SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells. Immunoblot analysis of infected-cell lysates identified proteins of the predicted sizes. Immunofluorescence microscopy detected similar patterns of punctate perinuclear and distributed cytoplasmic foci with all replicase antibodies and as early as 6 h postinfection. Dual-labeling studies demonstrated colocalization of replicase protein nsp8 with nsp2 and nsp3 in cytoplasmic complexes and also with LC3, a protein marker for autophagic vacuoles. Antibodies directed against mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) virions and against the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol) detected SARS-CoV nucleocapsid and nsp12 (Pol), respectively, in SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells. These results confirm the predicted protein processing pattern for mature SARS-CoV replicase proteins, demonstrate localization of replicase proteins to cytoplasmic complexes containing markers for autophagosome membranes, and suggest conservation of protein epitopes in the replicase and nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV and the group II coronavirus, MHV. Further, the results demonstrate the ability of replicase antibodies to detect SARS-CoV-infected cells as early as 6 h postinfection and thus represent important tools for studies of SARS-CoV replication, inhibition, and diagnosis.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.152616416,0.338736625,-0.248351954,0.047061054,-0.048776504,-0.037009786,-0.074863179,-0.17710743,0.043940093,-0.030106015,-0.031487853,-0.043885244,0.018794426,0.010480127,-0.001795211,-0.012961746,0.063426868,-0.093433943,0.018444819,0.078056724,-0.048580255,0.043784959,0.044311117,-0.042239419,0.109738544,0.066870389,-0.059671946,-0.002368222,-0.104266408,0.013891474
"Alternate, virus-induced membrane rearrangements support positive-strand RNA virus genome replication","All positive-strand RNA [(+)RNA] viruses replicate their RNA on intracellular membranes, often in association with spherular invaginations of the target membrane. For brome mosaic virus, we previously showed that such spherules serve as compartments or mini-organelles for RNA replication and that their assembly, structure, and function have similarities to the replicative cores of retrovirus and double-stranded RNA virus virions. Some other (+)RNA viruses conduct RNA replication in association with individual or clustered double-membrane vesicles, appressed double membranes, or other structures whose possible relationships to the spherular invaginations are unclear. Here we show that modulating the relative levels and interactions of brome mosaic virus replication factors 1a and 2a polymerase (2a(pol)) shifted the membrane rearrangements associated with RNA replication from small invaginated spherules to large, karmellae-like, multilayer stacks of appressed double membranes that supported RNA replication as efficiently as spherules. Spherules were induced by expressing 1a, which has functional similarities to retrovirus virion protein Gag, or 1a plus low levels of 2a(pol). Double-membrane layers were induced by 1a plus higher levels of 2a(pol) and were suppressed by deleting the major 1a-interacting domain from 2a(pol). The stacked, double-membrane layers alternated with spaces that, like spherule interiors, were 50–60 nm wide, connected to the cytoplasm, and contained 1a and 2a(pol). These and other results suggest that seemingly diverse membrane rearrangements associated with RNA replication by varied (+)RNA viruses may represent topologically and functionally related structures formed by similar protein–protein and protein–membrane interactions and interconverted by altering the balances among those interactions.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.210552286,-0.07535145,-0.085446954,0.083082862,-0.055508854,-0.077067405,0.005264296,0.027748995,-0.023526664,-0.007245304,0.050177916,-0.004902549,-0.047863449,0.088992722,-0.010853947,0.023552688,0.046845849,-0.080145035,0.013988469,0.020550474,-0.065200831,0.048779833,-0.077718886,-0.07703501,0.003174759,-0.061456201,-0.080335905,0.005330866,-0.064887418,-0.042891943
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in tears,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease that caused a global outbreak in 2003. Research has shown that it is caused by a novel coronavirus. A series of cases is reported where polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on tears had demonstrated the presence of the virus. Detection of ocular infection from tears using the PCR technique has been widely used by ophthalmologists to diagnose infections for other viruses. Methods: This is a case series report from cases classified as probable or suspect SARS cases. Tear samples were collected from 36 consecutive patients who were suspected of having SARS in Singapore over a period of 12 days (7–18 April 2003), and analysed by PCR using protocols developed by the WHO network of laboratories. Results: Three patients with probable SARS (one female and two male patients) had positive results from their tear samples. Tear samples were used to confirm SARS in the female patient, who was positive only from her tears. The positive specimens were found in cases sampled early in their course of infection. Conclusions: This is the first case series reported with the detection of the SARS coronavirus from tears, and has important implications for the practice of ophthalmology and medicine. The ability to detect and isolate the virus in the early phase of the disease may be an important diagnostic tool for future patients and tear sampling is both simple and easily repeatable. Many healthcare workers are in close proximity to the eyes of patients and this may be a source of spread among healthcare workers and inoculating patients. Ophthalmic practices may need to change as more stringent barrier methods, appropriate quarantine, and isolation measures are vital when managing patients with SARS.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.175210573,0.317296775,-0.126055197,-0.038406152,-0.065248746,-0.021375948,-0.115116091,-0.123229691,-0.19248194,0.06940929,-0.004845347,-0.001737356,0.05070349,0.01097976,0.04093804,0.002983618,-0.003711648,0.037309673,0.002392255,-0.000453126,0.042821107,-0.008882938,-0.076334684,-0.050946645,-0.039054207,0.005109353,-0.00647428,0.030607655,-0.065236675,0.002481192
Pathogenesis of Malaria and Clinically Similar Conditions,"There is now wide acceptance of the concept that the similarity between many acute infectious diseases, be they viral, bacterial, or parasitic in origin, is caused by the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines initiated when the organism interacts with the innate immune system. This is also true of certain noninfectious states, such as the tissue injury syndromes. This review discusses the historical origins of these ideas, which began with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and spread from their origins in malaria research to other fields. As well the more established proinflammatory mediators, such as TNF, interleukin-1, and lymphotoxin, the roles of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, which are chiefly inhibitory, are discussed. The established and potential roles of two more recently recognized contributors, overactivity of the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and the escape of high-mobility-group box 1 (HMGB1) protein from its normal location into the circulation, are also put in context. The pathogenesis of the disease caused by falciparum malaria is then considered in the light of what has been learned about the roles of these mediators in these other diseases, as well as in malaria itself.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.048392648,-0.023858886,-0.002920429,-0.097455726,-0.060226674,0.053612651,0.062324809,-0.025815095,0.018725244,0.01297307,-0.034235462,-0.012542474,0.017288579,-0.018544052,-0.014064739,-0.003197158,-0.0023499,-0.012799178,-0.050632716,-0.007298836,-0.010575852,-0.006640054,-0.029731082,-0.02719585,0.013393028,-0.002202819,-0.018162971,-0.010204751,0.045988724,-0.039176399
Inhibition of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus Replication by Small Interfering RNAs in Mammalian Cells,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute respiratory infectious disease that spread worldwide in early 2003. The cause was determined as a novel coronavirus (CoV), SARS-associated CoV (SARS-CoV), with a single-stranded, plus-sense RNA. To date, no effective specific treatment has been identified. To exploit the possibility of using RNA interference as a therapeutic approach to fight the disease, plasmid-mediated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were generated to target the SARS-CoV genome. The expression of siRNAs from two plasmids, which specifically target the viral RNA polymerase, effectively blocked the cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV on Vero cells. These two plasmids also inhibited viral replication as shown by titer assays and by an examination of viral RNA and protein levels. Thus, our results demonstrated the feasibility of developing siRNAs as effective anti-SARS drugs.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.09165664,0.427318276,-0.266765627,0.08532439,-0.091259366,-0.014920459,-0.035179986,-0.211105242,0.019642743,0.029910098,0.015777273,-0.077058247,0.047083196,0.019448515,0.056982274,0.022382555,-0.060747057,-0.001665858,0.029183831,0.049347524,-0.013842578,0.030886662,-0.006083611,0.04371901,-0.024117092,-0.048955234,-0.00080785,-0.007565788,0.026910526,0.040402221

Common laboratory features include lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, raised alanine transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. The constellation of compatible clinical and laboratory findings, together with certain characteristic radiological features and lack of clinical response to broad spectrum antibiotics, should arouse suspicion of SARS.

Multiple Enzymatic Activities Associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Helicase,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a newly identified group 2 coronavirus, is the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a life-threatening form of pneumonia in humans. Coronavirus replication and transcription are highly specialized processes of cytoplasmic RNA synthesis that localize to virus-induced membrane structures and were recently proposed to involve a complex enzymatic machinery that, besides RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, and protease activities, also involves a series of RNA-processing enzymes that are not found in most other RNA virus families. Here, we characterized the enzymatic activities of a recombinant form of the SARS-CoV helicase (nonstructural protein [nsp] 13), a superfamily 1 helicase with an N-terminal zinc-binding domain. We report that nsp13 has both RNA and DNA duplex-unwinding activities. SARS-CoV nsp13 unwinds its substrates in a 5′-to-3′ direction and features a remarkable processivity, allowing efficient strand separation of extended regions of double-stranded RNA and DNA. Characterization of the nsp13-associated (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphatase ([dNTPase) activities revealed that all natural nucleotides and deoxynucleotides are substrates of nsp13, with ATP, dATP, and GTP being hydrolyzed slightly more efficiently than other nucleotides. Furthermore, we established an RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity for the SARS-CoV nsp13 helicase which may be involved in the formation of the 5′ cap structure of viral RNAs. The data suggest that the (d)NTPase and RNA 5′-triphosphatase activities of nsp13 have a common active site. Finally, we established that, in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells, nsp13 localizes to membranes that appear to be derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and are the likely site of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.167738177,0.272047377,-0.250747424,0.120126666,-0.036392421,-0.082753787,-0.03617572,-0.100477611,-0.032428996,0.00108241,0.038045538,-0.006271441,-0.006373017,-0.016452555,-0.007172536,0.022596099,0.009202403,-0.024061186,0.03023549,0.053042214,-0.052659878,0.034663792,0.033240097,-0.03455695,0.050028587,-0.040909054,-0.106785988,0.055881409,0.025920147,0.005991478
The Laboratory Diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: Emerging Laboratory Tests for an Emerging Pathogen,"The 2003 pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) profiled the ability of modern diagnostic microbiology and molecular biology to identify, isolate and characterize, within weeks, a previously unknown viral infectious pathogen. The culprit, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was detected in patient specimens by traditional cell culture using an unusual cell line for respiratory viruses, Vero E6, and by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the polymerase 1 B region of the genome. In addition, serologic assays were rapidly developed, and the genome of this large virus was sequenced within one month of its spread to North America. At the present time, diagnostics have progressed to the point that RT-PCR has a sensitivity approaching 80% within the first few days of onset of illness, while serology has a sensitivity close to 100% on convalescent sera taken >21 days after illness onset. Viral culture remains a method confined to biosafety level III laboratories. The specificity of RT-PCR and serology remains to be conclusively defined, but in most studies to date seems to be >90%. Serologic cross-reactivity with human coronaviruses causing the common cold may be a problem with some serologic assays. The early development of SARS-CoV diagnostics is now being replaced by refinement and optimization of these assays. Although at the present time we do not have a test that will definitively rule in or rule out SARS at the time of initial presentation of a patient with a respiratory infection, modifications of existing assays will hopefully result in our ability to make this diagnosis with a high degree of accuracy in the future.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.083824649,0.336755986,-0.008674076,0.08875145,-0.047308755,-0.020511815,-0.034099747,-0.158694247,-0.016241901,0.029089182,-0.018782441,-0.046177203,0.077157634,0.000267435,0.033944275,-0.015594649,-0.00116298,0.003822204,-0.016864747,-0.034503838,0.01719135,-0.011117264,-0.011505351,-0.009631418,-0.017823269,-0.004797967,0.027486969,-0.031286282,-0.004975495,-0.036533875
Presence of an Encephalomyocarditis Virus Internal Ribosome Entry Site Sequence in Avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus Defective RNAs Abolishes Rescue by Helper Virus,"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) defective RNAs (D-RNAs) have been used for the expression of heterologous genes in a helper-virus-dependent expression system. The heterologous genes were expressed under the control of an IBV transcription-associated sequence (TAS) derived from gene 5 of IBV Beaudette. However, coronavirus D-RNA expression vectors display an inherent instability following serial passage with helper virus, resulting in the eventual loss of the heterologous genes. The use of the picornavirus encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence to initiate gene translation was investigated as an alternative method to the coronavirus-mediated TAS-controlled heterologous gene expression system. IBV D-RNAs containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene, under EMCV IRES control, were assessed for IRES-mediated CAT protein translation. CAT protein was detected from T7-derived IBV D-RNA transcripts in a cell-free protein synthesis system and in situ in avian chick kidney (CK) cells following T7-derived D-RNA synthesis from a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing the bacteriophage T7 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. However, CAT protein was not detected in CK cells from IRES-containing IBV D-RNAs, in which the IRES-CAT construct was inserted at two different positions within the D-RNA, in the presence of helper IBV. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the IRES-containing D-RNAs were not rescued on serial passage with helper virus, indicating that the EMCV IRES sequence had a detrimental effect on IBV D-RNA rescue.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.182738946,-0.058190906,0.02991234,-0.04865191,0.102205479,-0.001776125,-0.195147784,-0.060100308,0.093360879,0.176160703,0.023338745,-0.085784938,-0.011197434,0.080018846,-0.082607961,0.14039629,-0.026282338,-0.009557908,0.014641778,0.022705541,-0.036484221,-0.012870474,0.039456454,-0.032610484,-0.019018776,0.026116238,0.006938073,0.038419038,0.052367862,0.007944704
Interpretation of diagnostic laboratory tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome: the Toronto experience,"BACKGROUND: An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) began in Canada in February 2003. The initial diagnosis of SARS was based on clinical and epidemiological criteria. During the outbreak, molecular and serologic tests for the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) became available. However, without a “gold standard,” it was impossible to determine the usefulness of these tests. We describe how these tests were used during the first phase of the SARS outbreak in Toronto and offer some recommendations that may be useful if SARS returns. METHODS: We examined the results of all diagnostic laboratory tests used in 117 patients admitted to hospitals in Toronto who met the Health Canada criteria for suspect or probable SARS. Focusing on tests for SARS-CoV, we attempted to determine the optimal specimen types and timing of specimen collection. RESULTS: Diagnostic test results for SARS-CoV were available for 110 of the 117 patients. SARS-CoV was detected by means of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in at least one specimen in 59 (54.1%) of 109 patients. Serologic test results of convalescent samples were positive in 50 (96.2%) of 52 patients for whom paired serum samples were collected during the acute and convalescent phases of the illness. Of the 110 patients, 78 (70.9%) had specimens that tested positive by means of RT-PCR, serologic testing or both methods. The proportion of RT-PCR test results that were positive was similar between patients who met the criteria for suspect SARS (50.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 38.4%–63.2%) and those who met the criteria for probable SARS (58.0%, 95% CI 44.2%–70.7%). SARS-CoV was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs in 33 (32.4%) of 102 patients, in stool specimens in 19 (63.3%) of 30 patients, and in specimens from the lower respiratory tract in 10 (58.8%) of 17 patients. INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that the rapid diagnostic tests in use at the time of the initial outbreak lack sufficient sensitivity to be used clinically to rule out SARS. As tests for SARS-CoV continue to be optimized, evaluation of the clinical presentation and elucidation of a contact history must remain the cornerstone of SARS diagnosis. In patients with SARS, specimens taken from the lower respiratory tract and stool samples test positive by means of RT-PCR more often than do samples taken from other areas.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.186930177,0.495969241,-0.175828645,-0.007246207,-0.070088796,-0.054250048,-0.134485461,-0.218292539,-0.187190595,0.002507722,-0.00757556,0.019750357,0.023769906,0.003131057,0.004161076,0.018236135,0.000840701,0.007685905,0.012435746,-0.035912493,0.004587885,-0.006872767,0.002759327,-0.021255525,-0.022124979,-0.033525482,-0.005743542,-0.059378141,-0.047347794,-0.010152483
Molecular model of SARS coronavirus polymerase: implications for biochemical functions and drug design,"The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a previously unidentified coronavirus, SARS-CoV. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV plays a pivotal role in viral replication and is a potential target for anti-SARS therapy. There is a lack of structural or biochemical data on any coronavirus polymerase. To provide insights into the structure and function of SARS-CoV RdRp, we have located its conserved motifs that are shared by all RdRps, and built a three-dimensional model of the catalytic domain. The structural model permits us to discuss the potential functional roles of the conserved motifs and residues in replication and their potential interactions with inhibitors of related enzymes. We predict important structural attributes of potential anti-SARS-CoV RdRp nucleotide analog inhibitors: hydrogen-bonding capability for the 2′ and 3′ groups of the sugar ring and C3′ endo sugar puckering, and the absence of a hydrophobic binding pocket for non-nucleoside analog inhibitors similar to those observed in hepatitis C virus RdRp and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase. We propose that the clinically observed resistance of SARS to ribavirin is probably due to perturbation of the conserved motif A that controls rNTP binding and fidelity of polymerization. Our results suggest that designing anti-SARS therapies can benefit from successful experiences in design of other antiviral drugs. This work should also provide guidance for future biochemical experiments.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.140789269,0.362272734,-0.28634953,0.117254547,-0.097244829,0.031316684,0.045158904,-0.219489673,-0.064009032,0.046942133,0.073134502,0.121455814,-0.040447425,-0.115611041,-0.037728136,-0.040801521,0.024228412,0.020438859,0.000857521,-0.016226377,0.056240525,-0.024081608,0.060173442,0.065287445,0.027872632,0.034340043,0.019023936,-0.00300463,0.099047733,-0.003101343
"Characterization of the Expression, Intracellular Localization, and Replication Complex Association of the Putative Mouse Hepatitis Virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase","Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) RNA synthesis is mediated by a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) on membrane-bound replication complexes in the host cell cytoplasm. However, it is not known how the putative MHV RdRp (Pol) is targeted to and retained on cellular membranes. In this report, we show that a 100-kDa protein was stably detected by an anti-Pol antiserum as a mature product throughout the virus life cycle. Gradient fractionation and biochemical extraction experiments demonstrated that Pol was not an integral membrane protein but was tightly associated with membranes and coimmunoprecipitated with the replicase proteins 3CLpro, p22, and p12. By immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, Pol colocalized with viral proteins at replication complexes, distinct from sites of virion assembly, over the entire course of infection. To determine if Pol associated with cellular membranes in the absence of other viral factors, the pol domain of gene 1 was cloned and expressed in cells as a fusion with green fluorescent protein, termed Gpol. In Gpol-expressing cells that were infected with MHV, but not in mock-infected cells, Gpol relocalized from a diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm to punctate foci that colocalized with markers for replication complexes. Expression of Gpol deletion mutants established that the conserved enzymatic domains of Pol were dispensable for replication complex association, but a 38-amino-acid domain in the RdRp unique region of Pol was required. This study demonstrates that viral or virus-induced factors are necessary for Pol to associate with membranes of replication complexes, and it identifies a defined region of Pol that may mediate its interactions with those factors.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.229668362,-0.083175412,-0.086642676,0.039027975,-0.092671266,-0.054595948,0.002394003,-0.0260476,0.027358537,-0.025113847,-0.009859408,-0.018902121,-0.030582693,0.101631646,-0.029983877,0.00131253,0.062540926,-0.09928858,-0.048477567,0.038372968,-0.013828687,0.046242044,-0.016622805,-0.021924917,0.113803063,0.060098415,-0.009538707,-0.012318857,-0.08675144,-0.023050797
Functional Analysis of Mosquito-Borne Flavivirus Conserved Sequence Elements within 3′ Untranslated Region of West Nile Virus by Use of a Reporting Replicon That Differentiates between Viral Translation and RNA Replication,"We have developed a reporting replicon of West Nile virus (WNV) that could be used to quantitatively distinguish viral translation and RNA replication. A Renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene was fused in-frame with the open reading frame of a subgenomic replicon in the position where the viral structural region was deleted, resulting in RlucRep. Transfection of BHK cells with RlucRep RNA yielded two distinctive Rluc signal peaks, one between 2 and 10 h and the other after 26 h posttransfection. By contrast, only the 2- to 10-h Rluc signal peak was observed in cells transfected with a mutant replicon containing an inactivated viral polymerase NS5 (RlucRep-NS5mt). Immunofluorescence and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assays showed that the levels of viral protein expression and RNA replication increased in cells transfected with the RlucRep but not in those transfected with the RlucRep-NS5mt. These results suggest that the Rluc signal that occurred at 2 to 10 h posttransfection reflects viral translation of the input replicon, while the Rluc activity after 26 h posttransfection represents RNA replication. Using this system, we showed that mutations of conserved sequence (CS) elements within the 3′ untranslated region of the mosquito-borne flaviviruses did not significantly affect WNV translation but severely diminished or completely abolished RNA replication. Mutations of CS1 that blocked the potential base pairing with a conserved sequence in the 5′ region of the capsid gene (5′CS) abolished RNA replication. Restoration of the 5′CS-CS1 interaction rescued viral replication. Replicons containing individual deletions of CS2, repeated CS2 (RCS2), CS3, or RCS3 were viable, but their RNA replication was dramatically compromised. These results demonstrate that genome cyclization through the 5′CS-CS1 interaction is essential for WNV RNA replication, whereas CS2, RCS2, CS3, and RCS3 facilitate, but are dispensable for, WNV replication.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.221442303,-0.067452017,-0.050168665,0.081788715,-0.048848221,-0.084555447,-0.044386227,0.014361645,-0.003571135,-0.006257875,0.016034388,-0.040908263,-0.018203511,0.086962078,-0.00041847,-0.000776651,-0.006209142,-0.006786004,0.02941836,0.009520461,-0.015430677,0.033914091,-0.012002275,-0.001417531,-0.060259688,-0.022566761,0.024034928,-0.009200293,-0.023121538,0.012757865
Reverse Transcription-PCR Assays for Detection of Bovine Enteric Caliciviruses (BEC) and Analysis of the Genetic Relationships among BEC and Human Caliciviruses,"Two genetically distinct bovine enteric caliciviruses (BECs) have been identified: the norovirus (NLV) Jena and Newbury Agent-2 (NA-2) BECs, which are genetically related to human noroviruses, and the Nebraska (NB) BECs, which is related to sapoviruses and lagoviruses but may also represent a new calicivirus genus. The prevalence of these two BEC genotypes in cattle is unknown. Although reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) primers for human NLV recognize NLV-BECs, the genetic relationships between NLV from humans and the NLV-BECs commonly circulating in cattle is undefined. In the present study, veal calf fecal samples were assayed for enteric caliciviruses by using six RT-PCR primer sets designed for the detection of human NLVs or BECs. Caliciviruses genetically related to the NLV-BEC Jena and NA-2 strains or to the recently characterized NB BEC strain were identified in three of four and four of four sampled veal herds, respectively. Extended 3′-terminal genome sequences of two NLV-BECs, designated CV95-OH and CV186-OH, encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; open reading frame 1 [ORF-1]), VP1 (ORF-2), and VP2 (ORF-3) genes were determined. Phylogenetic and sequence identity analyses of each genome region demonstrated these viruses to be most closely related to the NLV-BEC Jena and NA-2 strains. In initial testing, the human P289-P290 (P289/290) primer set was found to be the most sensitive for calicivirus detection. However, its failure to identify all positive fecal pools (as determined by other assays) led us to design two new primer sets, CBECU-F/R and NBU-F/R, for the sensitive and specific detection of NLV-BEC (NLV-BEC Jena and NA-2) and BEC-NB-like viruses, respectively. The RT-PCR assays with the new primers were compared against other primer sets, including P289/290. Composite results of the tests completed by using the new assays identified 72% (54 of 75) of veal calf fecal samples as positive, with 21 of 21 sequenced reaction products specific for the target RdRp gene. The same design strategy used for the new BEC assays may also be applicable to the design of similar assays for the detection of human caliciviruses (HuCVs). Our data support the genetic relationship between NLV-BECs and NLV-HuCVs but with the NLV-BECs comprising two clusters within a third NLV genogroup.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.048379832,0.019692723,0.094138827,0.001831933,0.080953507,-0.006650363,-0.000105249,4.40E-05,-0.017833795,-0.012831995,-0.012649841,0.049014765,-0.003239084,-0.02415905,0.008699586,-0.061881944,0.026275469,0.009380649,-0.003232402,-0.059010886,0.040382292,0.019129578,-0.022907044,0.041871661,-0.006276611,-0.021394985,0.015483424,-0.037474589,0.01725951,0.001520053
An Alternate Pathway for Recruiting Template RNA to the Brome Mosaic Virus RNA Replication Complex,"The multidomain RNA replication protein 1a of brome mosaic virus (BMV), a positive-strand RNA virus in the alphavirus-like superfamily, plays key roles in assembly and function of the viral RNA replication complex. 1a, which encodes RNA capping and helicase-like domains, localizes to endoplasmic reticulum membranes, recruits BMV 2a polymerase and viral RNA templates, and forms membrane-bound, capsid-like spherules in which RNA replication occurs. cis-acting signals necessary and sufficient for RNA recruitment by 1a have been mapped in BMV genomic RNA2 and RNA3. Both signals comprise an extended stem-loop whose apex matches the conserved sequence and structure of the TΨC stem-loop in tRNAs (box B). Mutations show that this box B motif is crucial to 1a responsiveness of wild-type RNA2 and RNA3. We report here that, unexpectedly, some chimeric mRNAs expressing the 2a polymerase open reading frame from RNA2 were recruited by 1a to the replication complex and served as templates for negative-strand RNA synthesis, despite lacking the normally essential, box B-containing 5′ signal. Further studies showed that this template recruitment required high-efficiency translation of the RNA templates. Moreover, multiple small frameshifting insertion or deletion mutations throughout the N-terminal region of the open reading frame inhibited this template recruitment, while an in-frame insertion did not. Providing 2a in trans did not restore template recruitment of RNAs with frameshift mutations. Only those deletions in the N-terminal region of 2a that abolished 2a interaction with 1a abolished template recruitment of the RNA. These and other results indicate that this alternate pathway for 1a-dependent RNA recruitment involves 1a interaction with the translating mRNA via the 1a-interactive N-terminal region of the nascent 2a polypeptide. Interaction with nascent 2a also may be involved in 1a recruitment of 2a polymerase to membranes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.232184473,-0.073016075,-0.07069084,0.0833141,-0.024682066,-0.11606809,-0.062397474,0.061398932,-0.02705955,-0.044181085,0.030981692,0.014555216,-0.04179171,0.019486588,-0.019874824,0.018192498,0.033549639,-0.028913971,0.021861043,-0.008600453,-0.066329593,0.015465365,-0.077296934,-0.083932375,-0.012332763,-0.114071533,-0.107703919,0.036627559,0.019051197,-0.050096287
Interferon-gamma levels in nasopharyngeal secretions of infants with respiratory syncytial virus and other respiratory viral infections,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, one of the most common causes of hospitalization of children in developed countries, has been implicated as a cause of asthma. We aimed to characterize the cytokine profile in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) taken from infants during upper respiratory tract infection to investigate whether RSV induced a unique immune response as compared with other viruses. Additionally, we sought to determine whether this profile was influenced by the infants' atopic status. A prospective birth cohort of babies at high risk of atopy was recruited. Ratios of a T-helper 1 (Th1) cytokine, interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and a T-helper 2 (Th2)-like cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL-10), in NPAs were determined during episodes of respiratory tract infections in the first year. The viral aetiology of the respiratory tract infections was determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture and immunofluorescence. Atopic status was ascertained at 1 year of age using skin prick tests. Participants were recruited antenatally and subsequently followed in the community. Sixty babies with one or both parents atopic were enrolled into the study. IFN-γ : IL-10 ratios in NPAs during upper respiratory tract infections and their correlation with viral aetiology and atopic status were the main outcome measures. The mean IFN-γ : IL-10 ratio was significantly lower (due to lower IFN-γ) during RSV infections than during infections with other viruses (P = 0·035). The cytokine ratio, however, did not differ between infants with or without wheeze during URTIs (P = 0·44), or between infants who were atopic or non-atopic (P = 0·49). This study suggests that RSV is associated with lower IFN-γ production in young babies, regardless of their atopic status, compared to upper respiratory tract infections where either another virus is detected or where no viral identification is made.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.136605855,-0.104598765,-0.059358997,-0.027322508,-0.02009604,-0.067403447,0.077416178,-0.076933618,0.120811518,-0.026857773,0.013920904,-0.080504969,-0.041118394,0.001751238,0.002773652,0.021132696,0.000928941,-0.044759213,0.040516386,-0.018438585,-0.001796487,-0.14470563,-0.005531971,0.014785423,0.041758956,-0.084004399,0.095003665,0.008196701,0.024307956,-0.025409522
Coronaviruses Maintain Viability despite Dramatic Rearrangements of the Strictly Conserved Genome Organization,"Despite their high frequency of RNA recombination, the plus-strand coronaviruses have a characteristic, strictly conserved genome organization with the essential genes occurring in the order 5′-polymerase (pol)-S-E-M-N-3′. We have investigated the significance of this remarkable conservation by rearrangement of the murine coronavirus genome through targeted recombination. Thus, viruses were prepared with the following gene order: 5′-pol-S-M-E-N-3′, 5′-pol-S-N-E-M-3′, 5′-pol-M-S-E-N-3′, and 5′-pol-E-M-S-N-3′. All of these viruses were surprisingly viable, and most viruses replicated in cell culture with growth characteristics similar to those of the parental virus. The recombinant virus with the gene order 5′-pol-E-M-S-N-3′ was also tested for the ability to replicate in the natural host, the mouse. The results indicate that the canonical coronavirus genome organization is not essential for replication in vitro and in vivo.

Molecular Characterization Confirms the Presence of a Divergent Strain of Canine Coronavirus (UWSMN-1) in Australia,"Canine coronavirus (CCV) UWSMN-1 was originally identified from an outbreak of fatal gastroenteritis in breeding colonies. In this report, we examined whether UWSMN-1 represents a novel divergent strain or is the result of recombination events between canine and feline coronavirus strains. Sequencing of various regions of the spike and polymerase genes confirms that UWSMN-1 is widely divergent from other CCV and feline coronavirus strains.

The Synthesis of Minus-Strand RNA of Bamboo Mosaic Potexvirus Initiates from Multiple Sites within the Poly(A) Tail,"The 3′ terminus of the bamboo mosaic potexvirus (BaMV) contains a poly(A) tail, the 5′ portion of which participates in the formation of an RNA pseudoknot required for BaMV RNA replication. Recombinant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of BaMV binds to the pseudoknot poly(A) tail in gel mobility shift assays (C.-Y. Huang, Y.-L. Huang, M. Meng, Y.-H. Hsu, and C.-H. Tsai, J. Virol. 75:2818-2824, 2001). Approximately 20 nucleotides of the poly(A) tail adjacent to the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) are protected from diethylpyrocarbonate modification, suggesting that this region may be used to initiate minus-strand RNA synthesis. The 5′ terminus of the minus-strand RNA synthesized by the RdRp in vitro was examined using 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and DNA sequencing. Minus-strand RNA synthesis was found to initiate from several positions within the poly(A) tail, with the highest frequency of initiation being from the 7th to the 10th adenylates counted from the 5′-most adenylate of the poly(A) tail. Sequence analyses of BaMV progeny RNAs recovered from Nicotiana benthamiana protoplasts which were inoculated with mutants containing a mutation at the 1st, 4th, 7th, or 16th position of the poly(A) tail suggested the existence of variable initiation sites, similar to those found in 5′ RACE experiments. We deduce that the initiation site for minus-strand RNA synthesis is not fixed at one position but resides opposite one of the 15 adenylates of the poly(A) tail immediately downstream of the 3′ UTR of BaMV genomic RNA.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.20414866,-0.055341791,-0.037731516,0.062318091,-0.00824689,-0.109459535,-0.050317754,0.04606429,-0.047327855,-0.032506105,0.042896008,0.031314458,-0.035457602,-0.019526522,-0.006289046,0.05365067,-0.005946754,-0.002648376,-0.010871515,-0.041164794,-0.032281999,-0.009744196,-0.016393952,-0.064054504,-0.021904123,-0.078363697,-0.088602621,0.060429329,0.074176557,0.023529371
"Comparison of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization for the detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in pigs","Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization were compared for the detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Fifteen piglets experimentally infected with PEDV were used in the study. In addition, 94 diarrheic piglets submitted to the Department of Veterinary Pathology in Seoul National University for diagnosis of PEDV infection were used to compare the 3 methods. Antigen and nucleic acid of PEDV were detected in 15/15, 13/15, and 14/15 of the intestinal and fecal samples from the PEDV-inoculated pigs by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization, respectively. The virus was isolated from 15/15 of the jejunal samples from the PEDV-inoculated pigs. Neither PEDV antigen nor PEDV nucleic acid was detected in the intestinal and fecal samples from mock-infected control pigs. Of the 94 samples, 63 were positive for PEDV by all 3 techniques. Six samples were positive for PEDV by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Three samples were positive for PEDV by in situ hybridization and RT-PCR. Seven samples were positive for PEDV by RT-PCR. Although RT-PCR identified the presence of PEDV more frequently than the other methods, when only formalin-fixed tissues are submitted, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization would be useful methods for the detection of PEDV antigen and nucleic acid.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.026046431,0.040405119,0.190495451,-0.100434953,0.061442406,0.015010897,-0.030849407,-0.030984285,-0.02395627,-0.047864742,0.082272514,0.103103687,-0.209672095,0.084910715,0.365330295,-0.267830895,-0.025385926,0.056022286,-0.094486721,0.184156796,-0.260203366,-0.090734315,0.129543829,-0.086164316,-0.043264987,-0.040961319,-0.039209647,0.016557435,0.070648502,-0.008245893
Synergism between allergens and viruses and risk of hospital admission with asthma: case-control study,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the importance of sensitisation and exposure to allergens and viral infection in precipitating acute asthma in adults resulting in admission to hospital. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Large district general hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 60 patients aged 17-50 admitted to hospital over a year with acute asthma, matched with two controls: patients with stable asthma recruited from the outpatient department and patients admitted to hospital with non-respiratory conditions (inpatient controls). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Atopic status (skin testing and total and specific IgE), presence of common respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria (polymerase chain reaction), dust samples from homes, and exposure to allergens (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA): Der p 1, Fel d 1, Can f 1, and Bla g 2). RESULTS: Viruses were detected in 31 of 177 patients. The difference in the frequency of viruses detected between the groups was significant (admitted with asthma 26%, stable asthma 18%, inpatient controls 9%; P=0.04). A significantly higher proportion of patients admitted with asthma (66%) were sensitised and exposed to either mite, cat, or dog allergen than patients with stable asthma (37%) and inpatient controls (15%; P<0.001). Being sensitised and exposed to allergens was an independent associate of the group admitted to hospital (odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 5.4; P=0.05), whereas the combination of sensitisation, high exposure to one or more allergens, and viral detection considerably increased the risk of being admitted with asthma (8.4, 2.1 to 32.8; P=0.002).

The Brome mosaic virus subgenomic promoter hairpin is structurally similar to the iron-responsive element and functionally equivalent to the minus-strand core promoter stem-loop C.,"In the Bromoviridae family of plant viruses, trinucleotide hairpin loops play an important role in RNA transcription. Recently, we reported that Brome mosaic virus (BMV) subgenomic (sg) transcription depended on the formation of an unusual triloop hairpin. By native gel electrophoresis, enzymatic structure probing, and NMR spectroscopy it is shown here that in the absence of viral replicase the hexanucleotide loop 5'C1AUAG5A3' of this RNA structure can adopt a pseudo trinucleotide loop conformation by transloop base pairing between C1 and G5. By means of in vitro replication assays using partially purified BMV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) it was found that other base pairs contribute to sg transcription, probably by stabilizing the formation of this pseudo triloop, which is proposed to be the primary element recognized by the viral replicase. The BMV pseudo triloop structure strongly resembles iron-responsive elements (IREs) in cellular messenger RNAs and may represent a general protein-binding motif. In addition, in vitro replication assays showed that the BMV sg hairpin is functionally equivalent to the minus-strand core promoter hairpin stem-loop C at the 3' end of BMV RNAs. Replacement of the sg hairpin by stem-loop C yielded increased sg promoter activity whereas replacement of stem-loop C by the sg hairpin resulted in reduced minus-strand promoter activity. We conclude that AUA triloops represent the common motif in the BMV sg and minus-strand promoters required for recruitment of the viral replicase. Additional sequence elements of the minus-strand promoter are proposed to direct the RdRp to the initiation site at the 3' end of the genomic RNA.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.184213447,-0.059289225,-0.044644869,0.071189556,-0.037939291,-0.095609482,-0.020511952,0.035144468,-0.040171089,-0.02846136,0.026435377,0.046891472,-0.039777315,-0.004815373,-0.025337643,0.033099027,0.023949835,-0.023685326,-0.047362052,-0.046502802,-0.033705949,-0.014805301,-0.052675436,-0.0349019,-0.007769711,-0.084898339,-0.083215306,0.068810612,0.092222518,-0.026497851
Reverse Genetics System for the Avian Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus,"Major advances in the study of the molecular biology of RNA viruses have resulted from the ability to generate and manipulate full-length genomic cDNAs of the viral genomes with the subsequent synthesis of infectious RNA for the generation of recombinant viruses. Coronaviruses have the largest RNA virus genomes and, together with genetic instability of some cDNA sequences in Escherichia coli, this has hampered the generation of a reverse-genetics system for this group of viruses. In this report, we describe the assembly of a full-length cDNA from the positive-sense genomic RNA of the avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an important poultry pathogen. The IBV genomic cDNA was assembled immediately downstream of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter by in vitro ligation and cloned directly into the vaccinia virus genome. Infectious IBV RNA was generated in situ after the transfection of restricted recombinant vaccinia virus DNA into primary chick kidney cells previously infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase. Recombinant IBV, containing two marker mutations, was recovered from the transfected cells. These results describe a reverse-genetics system for studying the molecular biology of IBV and establish a paradigm for generating genetically defined vaccines for IBV.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.191568681,-0.059563169,0.019990483,0.049132013,0.147197722,-0.006731848,-0.178467694,-0.055164519,0.061388435,0.321792476,0.093276366,-0.07812807,-0.013468636,0.08668207,-0.06308433,0.160409718,-0.042361301,0.000245056,0.020179302,0.0667797,-0.07561133,-0.012766759,0.022641728,-0.058566563,-0.055669228,0.010605117,0.001789421,0.014421434,-0.054827254,0.024322392
"Molecular Determinants of Virulence, Cell Tropism, and Pathogenic Phenotype of Infectious Bursal Disease Virus","Infectious bursal disease viruses (IBDVs), belonging to the family Birnaviridae, exhibit a wide range of immunosuppressive potential, pathogenicity, and virulence for chickens. The genomic segment A encodes all the structural (VP2, VP4, and VP3) and nonstructural proteins, whereas segment B encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (VP1). To identify the molecular determinants for the virulence, pathogenic phenotype, and cell tropism of IBDV, we prepared full-length cDNA clones of a virulent strain, Irwin Moulthrop (IM), and constructed several chimeric cDNA clones of segments A and B between the attenuated vaccine strain (D78) and the virulent IM or GLS variant strain. Using the cRNA-based reverse-genetics system developed for IBDV, we generated five chimeric viruses after transfection by electroporation procedures in Vero or chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells, one of which was recovered after propagation in embryonated eggs. To evaluate the characteristics of the recovered viruses in vivo, we inoculated 3-week-old chickens with D78, IM, GLS, or chimeric viruses and analyzed their bursae for pathological lesions 3 days postinfection. Viruses in which VP4, VP4-VP3, and VP1 coding sequences of the virulent strain IM were substituted for the corresponding region in the vaccine strain failed to induce hemorrhagic lesions in the bursa. In contrast, viruses in which the VP2 coding region of the vaccine strain was replaced with the variant GLS or virulent IM strain caused rapid bursal atrophy or hemorrhagic lesions in the bursa, as seen with the variant or classical virulent strain, respectively. These results show that the virulence and pathogenic-phenotype markers of IBDV reside in VP2. Moreover, one of the chimeric viruses containing VP2 sequences of the virulent strain could not be recovered in Vero or CEF cells but was recovered in embryonated eggs, suggesting that VP2 contains the determinants for cell tropism. Similarly, one of the chimeric viruses containing the VP1 segment of the virulent strain could not be recovered in Vero cells but was recovered in CEF cells, suggesting that VP1 contains the determinants for cell-specific replication in Vero cells. By comparing the deduced amino acid sequences of the D78 and IM strains and their reactivities with monoclonal antibody 21, which binds specifically to virulent IBDV, the putative amino acids involved in virulence and cell tropism were identified. Our results indicate that residues Gln at position 253 (Gln253), Asp279, and Ala284 of VP2 are involved in the virulence, cell tropism, and pathogenic phenotype of virulent IBDV.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.10559548,-0.048148385,0.012369408,-0.058878757,0.048913778,0.053166943,-0.047747145,-0.036874213,0.029331032,0.048241247,-4.82E-05,0.005869467,-0.010307372,-0.012925931,0.025149786,-0.044266641,-0.018719357,-0.023574729,0.004999665,0.024407402,0.0686719,-0.012789528,0.011676127,0.060229627,0.003230196,0.027099668,0.01231761,-0.013055801,-0.090957392,0.026158133
Structural Analysis of the −1 Ribosomal Frameshift Elements in Giardiavirus mRNA,"The RNA polymerase of giardiavirus (GLV) is synthesized as a fusion protein through a −1 ribosomal frameshift in a region where gag and pol open reading frames (ORFs) overlap. A heptamer, CCCUUUA, and a potential pseudoknot found in the overlap were predicted to be required for the frameshift. A 68-nucleotide (nt) cDNA fragment containing these elements was inserted between the GLV 5′ 631-nt cDNA and the out-of-frame luciferase gene that required a −1 frameshift within the 68-nt fragment for expression. Giardia lamblia trophozoites transfected with the transcript of this construct showed a frameshift frequency at 1.7%, coinciding with the polymerase-to-capsid protein ratio in GLV. The heptamer is required for the frameshift but can be replaced with other sequences of the same motif. Mutations placing stop codons in the 0 or −1 frame, located directly before or after the heptamer, implicated the latter as the site for the −1 frameshift. Shortening or destroying the putative stem decreased the frameshift efficiency threefold; the efficiency was fully recovered by mutations to restore the stem. Deleting 18 nt from the 3′ end of the 68-nt fragment, which formed the second stem in the putative pseudoknot, had no effect on the frequency of the frameshift. Chemical probing of the RNA secondary structure in the frameshift region showed that bases resistant to chemical modification were clustered in the putative stem structures, thus confirming the presence of the postulated stem-loop, while all the bases in the loop were chemically modified, thus ruling out their capability of forming a pseudoknot. These results confirmed the conclusion based on data from the mutation study that there is but a simple stem-loop downstream from the heptamer. Together, they constitute the structural elements for a −1 ribosomal frameshift in the GLV transcript.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.147671768,-0.049799234,-0.012639186,-0.044564211,0.046861238,-0.060914752,-0.102086583,0.027765125,-0.00389873,-0.076422317,-0.087161819,0.001255798,0.005994793,-0.113799256,-0.051610738,-0.028222847,0.038271265,0.018755606,-0.017826945,-0.058986957,-0.012139039,-0.054926251,-0.072567822,0.038667124,-0.063815139,-0.080185498,-0.037491991,0.01977972,0.106182786,-0.100415394
Clinical diagnosis of influenza virus infection: evaluation of diagnostic tools in general practice.,"BACKGROUND: With the development of new antiviral agents for influenza, the urge for rapid and reliable diagnosis of influenza becomes increasingly important. Respiratory virus infections are difficult to distinguish on clinical grounds. General practitioners (GPs) however, still depend on their clinical judgement. AIM: To evaluate the importance of clinical symptoms in the diagnosis of influenza virus infection. DESIGN OF STUDY: A multicentre questionnaire study. SETTING: Eighty-one patients from 14 general practices. METHOD: Patients with fever and at least one constitutional symptom and one respiratory symptom were included. A questionnaire with the medical history and clinical symptoms was completed and a combined nose-throat swab was taken. Virus culture, rapid culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification were performed on each specimen. Multivariate analysis was used to obtain the best predictive model. RESULTS: By using PCR, an increase was seen in the detection of the viral pathogens compared with the results of culture. In 42 out of 81 patients PCR was positive for influenza. A positive predictive value (PPV) of 75% was observed for the combination of headache at onset, feverishness at onset, cough, and vaccination status during the period of increase influenza activity. Criteria used by the ICHPPC-2 resulted in a PPV of 54%. The PPV for diagnosis made by the GP was 76%. CONCLUSION: Although influenza is difficult to diagnose on clinical grounds, the GPs in this study were able to diagnose influenza as such more accurately on their judgement than by the other criteria.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.212495568,-0.044607825,0.017111733,0.136242102,-0.082299289,0.185820733,-0.132921021,0.038585004,-0.092975117,0.002156406,-0.001850842,-0.012451735,0.055001379,0.015714644,-0.004373981,-0.007038261,0.032510982,0.027104779,0.014756574,-0.041379624,0.018243166,-0.052192019,0.013926894,-0.074855219,-0.002077525,0.002665704,-0.023164007,-0.03469406,-0.009077619,0.034275118
Downstream Sequences Influence the Choice between a Naturally Occurring Noncanonical and Closely Positioned Upstream Canonical Heptameric Fusion Motif during Bovine Coronavirus Subgenomic mRNA Synthesis,"Mechanisms leading to subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) synthesis in coronaviruses are poorly understood but are known to involve a heptameric signaling motif, originally called the intergenic sequence. The intergenic sequence is the presumed crossover region (fusion site) for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) during discontinuous transcription, a process leading to sgmRNAs that are both 5′ and 3′ coterminal. In the bovine coronavirus, the major fusion site for synthesis of mRNA 5 (GGUAGAC) does not conform to the canonical motif (UC[U,C]AAAC) at three positions (underlined), yet it lies just 14 nucleotides downstream from such a sequence (UCCAAAC). The infrequently used canonical sequence, by computer prediction, is buried within the stem of a stable hairpin (−17.2 kcal/mol). Here we document the existence of this stem by enzyme probing and examine its influence and that of neighboring sequences on the unusual choice of fusion sites by analyzing transcripts made in vivo from mutated defective interfering RNA constructs. We learned that (i) mutations that were predicted to unfold the stem-loop in various ways did not switch RdRp crossover to the upstream canonical site, (ii) a totally nonconforming downstream motif resulted in no measurable transcription from either site, (iii) the canonical upstream site does not function ectopically to lend competence to the downstream noncanonical site, and (iv) altering flanking sequences downstream of the downstream noncanonical motif in ways that diminish sequence similarity with the virus genome 5′ end caused a dramatic switch to the upstream canonical site. These results show that sequence elements downstream of the noncanonical site can dramatically influence the choice of fusion sites for synthesis of mRNA 5 and are interpreted as being most consistent with a mechanism of similarity-assisted RdRp strand switching during minus-strand synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.19484513,-0.055823522,-0.044526511,0.017574521,0.040833057,-0.08649273,-0.084016552,0.043092644,-0.034769652,-0.0635149,-0.015464428,0.034430492,-0.010180764,-0.08410831,-0.018238828,0.014762147,-0.001452458,0.000743972,-0.047275089,-0.065340171,0.033319645,-0.046516593,-0.01045415,0.00487529,-0.006691609,-0.057463028,-0.053217652,0.046956706,0.146440969,-0.039065775
Induction of Caspase-Dependent Apoptosis in Cultured Cells by the Avian Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus,"Avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the causative agent of chicken infectious bronchitis, an acute, highly contagious viral respiratory disease. Replication of IBV in Vero cells causes extensive cytopathic effects (CPE), leading to destruction of the entire monolayer and the death of infected cells. In this study, we investigated the cell death processes during acute IBV infection and the underlying mechanisms. The results show that both necrosis and apoptosis may contribute to the death of infected cells in lytic IBV infection. Caspase-dependent apoptosis, as characterized by chromosomal condensation, DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase degradation, was detected in IBV-infected Vero cells. Addition of the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK to the culture media showed inhibition of the hallmarks of apoptosis and increase of the release of virus to the culture media at 16 h postinfection. However, neither the necrotic process nor the productive replication of IBV in Vero cells was severely affected by the inhibition of apoptosis. Screening of 11 IBV-encoded proteins suggested that a 58-kDa mature cleavage product could induce apoptotic changes in cells transiently expressing the protein. This study adds one more example to the growing list of animal viruses that induce apoptosis during their replication cycles.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.10180275,-0.050164304,0.009894116,-0.118334718,0.022714511,0.096094875,-0.103870778,-0.137443766,0.164885387,0.286379883,0.035927321,-0.056800291,-0.056599347,0.171112268,-0.105807395,0.15638442,0.0238646,-0.03665948,0.061313035,0.077790625,-0.032321766,0.018808645,0.021242114,-0.085943485,0.049460651,0.072732473,-0.070181359,0.079435969,-0.027641797,-0.075477219
The packaging signal of influenza viral RNA molecules.,"The packaging signal present in influenza viral RNA molecules is shown not to constitute a separate structural element, but to reside within the 5'-bulged promoter structure, as caused by the central unpaired residue A10 in its 5' branch. Upon insertion of two uridine residues in the 3' branch opposite A10, the minus-strand viral RNA (vRNA) promoter is converted into a 3'-bulged structure, whereas the plus-strand cRNA promoter instead adopts the 5'-bulged conformation. In this promoter variant it is exclusively the cRNA that is found packaged in the progeny virions. Upon insertion of only a single uridine nucleotide opposite 5'A10, the two debulged structures of the vRNA and cRNA promoters are rendered identical, and both vRNA and cRNA molecules are packaged indiscriminately, in a 1:1 ratio, but at lower rates. We propose that the binding interactions of viral polymerase with either of the two differently bulged vRNA and cRNA promoter structures result in two different conformations of the enzyme protein. Only the 5' bulged RNA-associated polymerase conformation appears to be recognized for nuclear export, which depends on nuclear matrix protein M1 and nonstructural protein NS2. And the respective wild-type vRNP- or insertion mutant cRNP complex is observed to enter the cytoplasm and hence is included in the viral encapsidation process, which takes place at the plasma membrane.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.129165529,-0.060027429,-0.045730665,0.021705882,-0.049360679,-0.016909189,-0.009922553,0.0053671,-0.015366228,-0.025503603,0.007425845,0.019987932,-0.033020889,-0.00997383,-0.012239084,0.00888191,0.021177151,-0.038775752,-0.040666461,-0.002651837,-0.008692146,0.01844775,-0.035624659,-0.028394982,0.013959813,-0.026168706,-0.022692853,-0.004363099,0.027211634,0.026721215
Biogenesis of the Semliki Forest Virus RNA Replication Complex,"The nonstructural (ns) proteins nsP1 to -4, the components of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) RNA polymerase, were localized in infected cells by confocal microscopy using double labeling with specific antisera against the individual ns proteins. All ns proteins were associated with large cytoplasmic vacuoles (CPV), the inner surfaces of which were covered by small invaginations, or spherules, typical of alphavirus infection. All ns proteins were localized by immuno-electron microscopy (EM) to the limiting membranes of CPV and to the spherules, together with newly labeled viral RNA. Along with earlier observations by EM-autoradiography (P. M. Grimley, I. K. Berezesky, and R. M. Friedman, J. Virol. 2:326–338, 1968), these results suggest that individual spherules represent template-associated RNA polymerase complexes. Immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled ns proteins showed that each antiserum precipitated the other three ns proteins, implying that they functioned as a complex. Double labeling with organelle-specific and anti-ns-protein antisera showed that CPV were derivatives of late endosomes and lysosomes. Indeed, CPV frequently contained endocytosed bovine serum albumin-coated gold particles, introduced into the medium at different times after infection. With time, increasing numbers of spherules were also observed on the cell surfaces; they were occasionally released into the medium, probably by secretory lysosomes. We suggest that the spherules arise by primary assembly of the RNA replication complexes at the plasma membrane, guided there by nsP1, which has affinity to lipids specific for the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Endosomal recycling and fusion of CPV with the plasma membrane can circulate spherules between the plasma membrane and the endosomal-lysosomal compartment.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.117163241,-0.038284466,-0.010710055,-0.02515891,-0.058700963,-0.017960468,0.013205865,-0.004575013,0.007012962,-0.034842792,0.006965872,-0.007381389,-0.024486567,0.034836426,0.02197704,0.008736914,0.018762854,-0.072844711,0.047791592,0.034590813,0.003994617,0.064205736,-0.057295433,-0.096028389,0.079051539,-0.015441491,-0.070500395,-0.001932172,-0.104635356,0.047866698
Sequences at the 3′ Untranslated Region of Bamboo Mosaic Potexvirus RNA Interact with the Viral RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase,"The 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of bamboo mosaic potexvirus (BaMV) genomic RNA was found to fold into a series of stem-loop structures including a pseudoknot structure. These structures were demonstrated to be important for viral RNA replication and were believed to be recognized by the replicase (C.-P. Cheng and C.-H. Tsai, J. Mol. Biol. 288:555–565, 1999). Electrophoretic mobility shift and competition assays have now been used to demonstrate that the Escherichia coli-expressed RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain (Δ893) derived from BaMV open reading frame 1 could specifically bind to the 3′ UTR of BaMV RNA. No competition was observed when bovine liver tRNAs or poly(I)(C) double-stranded homopolymers were used as competitors, and the cucumber mosaic virus 3′ UTR was a less efficient competitor. Competition analysis with different regions of the BaMV 3′ UTR showed that Δ893 binds to at least two independent RNA binding sites, stem-loop D and the poly(A) tail. Footprinting analysis revealed that Δ893 could protect the sequences at loop D containing the potexviral conserved hexamer motif and part of the stem of domain D from chemical cleavage.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.190535502,-0.042451789,-0.028867103,0.041594342,0.007855278,-0.076268292,-0.046357528,0.027079678,-0.021426068,-0.034647587,-0.005914232,0.02270973,-0.021610598,-0.032972432,-0.034953417,-0.002950366,0.036952759,0.004744362,-0.016274741,-0.037417995,-0.039979354,-0.011232223,-0.050384716,-0.013895712,-0.01599395,-0.065303731,-0.058701667,0.040507464,0.076520473,-0.015755462
Mutation of Host Δ9 Fatty Acid Desaturase Inhibits Brome Mosaic Virus RNA Replication between Template Recognition and RNA Synthesis,"All positive-strand RNA viruses assemble their RNA replication complexes on intracellular membranes. Brome mosaic virus (BMV) replicates its RNA in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated complexes in plant cells and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. BMV encodes RNA replication factors 1a, with domains implicated in RNA capping and helicase functions, and 2a, with a central polymerase-like domain. Factor 1a interacts independently with the ER membrane, viral RNA templates, and factor 2a to form RNA replication complexes on the perinuclear ER. We show that BMV RNA replication is severely inhibited by a mutation in OLE1, an essential yeast chromosomal gene encoding Δ9 fatty acid desaturase, an integral ER membrane protein and the first enzyme in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. OLE1 deletion and medium supplementation show that BMV RNA replication requires unsaturated fatty acids, not the Ole1 protein, and that viral RNA replication is much more sensitive than yeast growth to reduced unsaturated fatty acid levels. In ole1 mutant yeast, 1a still becomes membrane associated, recruits 2a to the membrane, and recognizes and stabilizes viral RNA templates normally. However, RNA replication is blocked prior to initiation of negative-strand RNA synthesis. The results show that viral RNA synthesis is highly sensitive to lipid composition and suggest that proper membrane fluidity or plasticity is essential for an early step in RNA replication. The strong unsaturated fatty acid dependence also demonstrates that modulating fatty acid balance can be an effective antiviral strategy.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.24986571,-0.070092025,-0.090103929,0.130000631,-0.088374001,-0.105677923,-0.001930499,0.041573104,-0.034174284,0.01485245,0.077211743,0.000808824,-0.046827622,0.094411506,0.000939342,0.030323214,0.01787762,-0.05303833,0.021441197,0.036490471,-0.089642892,0.042041208,-0.057555909,-0.120340895,0.005706045,-0.05916963,-0.079265973,0.000939576,-0.066537122,0.021876026
Efficacy of a transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus with an altered ORF-3 gene.,Serial passage of virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus through cell culture reduced its virulence in 3-day-old piglets. Intramuscular inoculation of pregnant gilts with 2 doses of this modified-live virus elicited a level of lactogenic immunity that protected their nursing piglets against a lethal dose of challenge virus. Sequence analysis of a 637-bp fragment of the spike gene containing most of the aminopeptidase receptor and the 4 major antigenic sites from the original and the serially passed viruses were nearly identical. Gel analysis revealed that the fragment from the ORF-3 gene of virulent virus was smaller than the corresponding fragment from the serially passed virus. Sequence analysis of the fragment from the passed virus revealed that the sequence between nt 5310 and nt 5434 was replaced by a 636-bp fragment from the polymerase 1A gene. This replacement resulted in the loss of the CTAAACTT leader RNA-binding site and ATG start codon for the ORF-3A gene but it did not affect the ORF-3B gene.,0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.130524533,-0.049651594,0.017404643,-0.05362997,0.107440597,0.003622222,-0.123797603,-0.012612672,0.030835827,-0.019775308,-0.066455669,-0.045506609,0.002608942,-0.060324722,0.019314633,-0.051488467,0.00602936,0.009313248,0.010777771,0.008371488,0.036973982,-0.024835755,0.01600884,0.054877,-0.036226371,-0.013129825,0.029008349,-0.049038971,0.000648839,-0.008920083
"DNA-Directed Expression of Functional Flock House Virus RNA1 Derivatives in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Heterologous Gene Expression, and Selective Effects on Subgenomic mRNA Synthesis","Flock house virus (FHV), a positive-strand RNA animal virus, is the only higher eukaryotic virus shown to undergo complete replication in yeast, culminating in production of infectious virions. To facilitate studies of viral and host functions in FHV replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, yeast DNA plasmids were constructed to inducibly express wild-type FHV RNA1 in vivo. Subsequent translation of FHV replicase protein A initiated robust RNA1 replication, amplifying RNA1 to levels approaching those of rRNA, as in FHV-infected animal cells. The RNA1-derived subgenomic mRNA, RNA3, accumulated to even higher levels of >100,000 copies per yeast cell, compared to 10 copies or less per cell for 95% of yeast mRNAs. The time course of RNA1 replication and RNA3 synthesis in induced yeast paralleled that in yeast transfected with natural FHV virion RNA. As in animal cells, RNA1 replication and RNA3 synthesis depended on FHV RNA replicase protein A and 3′-terminal RNA1 sequences but not viral protein B2. Additional plasmids were engineered to inducibly express RNA1 derivatives with insertions of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene in subgenomic RNA3. These RNA1 derivatives were replicated, synthesized RNA3, and expressed GFP when provided FHV polymerase in either cis or trans, providing the first demonstration of reporter gene expression from FHV subgenomic RNA. Unexpectedly, fusing GFP to the protein A C terminus selectively inhibited production of positive- and negative-strand subgenomic RNA3 but not genomic RNA1 replication. Moreover, changing the first nucleotide of the subgenomic mRNA from G to T selectively inhibited production of positive-strand but not negative-strand RNA3, suggesting that synthesis of negative-strand subgenomic RNA3 may precede synthesis of positive-strand RNA3.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.138851187,-0.053108497,-0.021895576,-0.011720409,-0.054074902,-0.036171277,-0.027483886,0.009339701,0.001874875,-0.043935335,0.017580998,-0.024982817,-0.020949473,0.056163794,0.003773102,0.037054692,0.001351027,-0.039911437,0.019861168,0.007326164,-0.031249173,0.032687586,-0.017066124,-0.064911973,-0.003379768,-0.031099086,-0.054600505,0.002711584,0.013176578,0.01168202
Alphavirus RNA Genome Repair and Evolution: Molecular Characterization of Infectious Sindbis Virus Isolates Lacking a Known Conserved Motif at the 3′ End of the Genome,"The 3′ nontranslated region of the genomes of Sindbis virus (SIN) and other alphaviruses carries several repeat sequence elements (RSEs) as well as a 19-nucleotide (nt) conserved sequence element (3′CSE). The 3′CSE and the adjoining poly(A) tail of the SIN genome are thought to act as viral promoters for negative-sense RNA synthesis and genome replication. Eight different SIN isolates that carry altered 3′CSEs were studied in detail to evaluate the role of the 3′CSE in genome replication. The salient findings of this study as it applies to SIN infection of BHK cells are as follows: i) the classical 19-nt 3′CSE of the SIN genome is not essential for genome replication, long-term stability, or packaging; ii) compensatory amino acid or nucleotide changes within the SIN genomes are not required to counteract base changes in the 3′ terminal motifs of the SIN genome; iii) the 5′ 1-kb regions of all SIN genomes, regardless of the differences in 3′ terminal motifs, do not undergo any base changes even after 18 passages; iv) although extensive addition of AU-rich motifs occurs in the SIN genomes carrying defective 3′CSE, these are not essential for genome viability or function; and v) the newly added AU-rich motifs are composed predominantly of RSEs. These findings are consistent with the idea that the 3′ terminal AU-rich motifs of the SIN genomes do not bind directly to the viral polymerase and that cellular proteins with broad AU-rich binding specificity may mediate this interaction. In addition to the classical 3′CSE, other RNA motifs located elsewhere in the SIN genome must play a major role in template selection by the SIN RNA polymerase.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.144322168,-0.049542876,-0.033016009,-0.003447833,0.010341899,-0.045907087,-0.034439497,0.025125717,-0.024829277,-0.015012067,0.006156459,0.012286659,-0.004185495,-0.042162935,0.017979158,0.023046819,-0.000141686,0.004020851,-0.042642509,-0.007525749,0.002877004,0.005538422,-0.044884811,-0.010205385,-0.0392688,-0.036096134,-0.003189726,0.02159134,0.015962969,-0.0147604
"Helicase and Capping Enzyme Active Site Mutations in Brome Mosaic Virus Protein 1a Cause Defects in Template Recruitment, Negative-Strand RNA Synthesis, and Viral RNA Capping","Brome mosaic virus (BMV) encodes two RNA replication proteins: 1a, which contains RNA capping and helicase-like domains, and 2a, which is related to polymerases. BMV 1a and 2a can direct virus-specific RNA replication in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which reproduces the known features of BMV replication in plant cells. We constructed single amino acid point mutations at the predicted capping and helicase active sites of 1a and analyzed their effects on BMV RNA3 replication in yeast. The helicase mutants showed no function in any assays used: they were strongly defective in template recruitment for RNA replication, as measured by 1a-induced stabilization of RNA3, and they synthesized no detectable negative-strand or subgenomic RNA. Capping domain mutants divided into two groups. The first exhibited increased template recruitment but nevertheless allowed only low levels of negative-strand and subgenomic mRNA synthesis. The second was strongly defective in template recruitment, made very low levels of negative strands, and made no detectable subgenomes. To distinguish between RNA synthesis and capping defects, we deleted chromosomal gene XRN1, encoding the major exonuclease that degrades uncapped mRNAs. XRN1 deletion suppressed the second but not the first group of capping mutants, allowing synthesis and accumulation of large amounts of uncapped subgenomic mRNAs, thus providing direct evidence for the importance of the viral RNA capping function. The helicase and capping enzyme mutants showed no complementation. Instead, at high levels of expression, a helicase mutant dominantly interfered with the function of the wild-type protein.

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 regulates RNA synthesis of a cytoplasmic virus,"Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP A1) is involved in pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus and translational regulation in the cytoplasm. In the present study, we demonstrate that hnRNP A1 also participates in the transcription and replication of a cytoplasmic RNA virus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Overexpression of hnRNP A1 accelerated the kinetics of viral RNA synthesis, whereas the expression in the cytoplasm of a dominant-negative hnRNP A1 mutant that lacks the nuclear transport domain significantly delayed it. The hnRNP A1 mutant caused a global inhibition of viral mRNA transcription and genomic replication, and also a preferential inhibition of the replication of defective-interfering RNAs. Similar to the wild-type hnRNP A1, the hnRNP A1 mutant complexed with an MHV polymerase gene product, the nucleocapsid protein and the viral RNA. However, in contrast to the wild-type hnRNP A1, the mutant protein failed to bind a 250 kDa cellular protein, suggesting that the recruitment of cellular proteins by hnRNP A1 is important for MHV RNA synthesis.

Avian Nephritis Virus (ANV) as a New Member of the Family Astroviridae and Construction of Infectious ANV cDNA,"The complete RNA genome of the avian nephritis virus (ANV) associated with acute nephritis in chickens has been molecularly cloned and sequenced. Excluding the poly(A) tail, the genome comprises 6,927 nucleotides and contains three sequential open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF (ORF 1a) contains a sequence encoding a serine protease motif, and the second ORF (ORF 1b) has a sequence encoding an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. ORF 1a may be linked to the second ORF by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. The third ORF (ORF 2) may encode the virion structural proteins as a polyprotein precursor. Two RNAs, probably genonic and subgenonic RNA (7.5 and 3.0 kb), were detected in the cytoplasm of ANV-infected cells. ANV and human astroviruses have the same genonic organization, and both are characterized by the presence of two RNA bands. The amino acid homologies of the products of ORF 1a, 1b, and 2 were 20.3, 41.9, and 25.8% to products of the corresponding ORFs of human astrovirus serotype 1 (A/88 Newcastle strain). We have constructed a genonic-length cDNA clone of ANV to test whether the in vitro transcript is infectious. When a chicken kidney cell culture was transfected with RNA transcribed in vitro and the cDNA clone, infectious virus was produced with cytopathic effects in the absence of trypsin.

Identification of Mouse Hepatitis Virus Papain-Like Proteinase 2 Activity,"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a 31-kb positive-strand RNA virus that is replicated in the cytoplasm of infected cells by a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, termed the replicase. The replicase is encoded in the 5′-most 22 kb of the genomic RNA, which is translated to produce a polyprotein of >800 kDa. The replicase polyprotein is extensively processed by viral and perhaps cellular proteinases to give rise to a functional replicase complex. To date, two of the MHV replicase-encoded proteinases, papain-like proteinase 1 (PLP1) and the poliovirus 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro), have been shown to process the replicase polyprotein. In this report, we describe the cloning, expression, and activity of the third MHV proteinase domain, PLP2. We show that PLP2 cleaves a substrate encoding the first predicted membrane-spanning domain (MP1) of the replicase polyprotein. Cleavage of MP1 and release of a 150-kDa intermediate, p150, are likely to be important for embedding the replicase complex in cellular membranes. Using an antiserum (anti-D11) directed against the C terminus of the MP1 domain, we verified that p150 encompasses the MP1 domain and identified a 44-kDa protein (p44) as a processed product of p150. Pulse-chase experiments showed that p150 is rapidly generated in MHV-infected cells and that p44 is processed from the p150 precursor. Protease inhibitor studies revealed that unlike 3CLpro activity, PLP2 activity is not sensitive to cysteine protease inhibitor E64d. Furthermore, coexpression studies using the PLP2 domain and a substrate encoding the MP1 cleavage site showed that PLP2 acts efficiently in trans. Site-directed mutagenesis studies confirmed the identification of cysteine 1715 as a catalytic residue of PLP2. This study is the first to report enzymatic activity of the PLP2 domain and to demonstrate that three distinct viral proteinase activities process the MHV replicase polyprotein.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.184344687,-0.054987151,-0.061424048,0.021461998,-0.035382305,-0.051286958,-0.052999844,-0.008749127,0.019197333,-0.0490583,-0.035906739,0.018683621,0.006109113,-0.004983668,-0.023802164,-0.020762719,0.063278579,-0.010124286,0.032630689,0.018505011,-0.036533047,0.010387384,0.01543416,-0.071918977,0.13345872,0.144020288,-0.035312908,-0.000302917,-0.065066732,-0.038944763
Primary Structure of the Sialodacryoadenitis Virus Genome: Sequence of the Structural-Protein Region and Its Application for Differential Diagnosis,"Sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) is a coronavirus that is commonly found in laboratory rats and that causes sialodacryoadenitis and respiratory illness. We cloned and sequenced the 3′ terminal 9.8 kb of the genomic RNA and analyzed the structure of the viral genome. As with mouse hepatitis coronaviruses (MHVs), the SDAV genome was able to code for a spike protein, a small membrane protein, a membrane-associated protein, and a nucleocapsid protein. In addition, the hemagglutinin-esterase gene capable of encoding a protein of 439 amino acids (aa) was identified. The putative functional site for acetylesterase activity was present in the HE protein as Phe-Gly-Asp-Ser (FGDS), suggesting that the SDAV HE protein might have retained the esterase activity. Immediately upstream of the HE gene and downstream of the polymerase 1b gene, the NS2 nonstructural-protein gene was identified with a coding capacity of 274 aa. A motif of UCUAAAC was identified as a potential transcription signal for subgenomic mRNA synthesis. Large insertions of 172, 127, and 44 aa were detected in the N-terminal half of the predicted S protein of SDAV when its sequence was compared to the sequences of MHV 2, MHV JHM, and MHV A59, respectively. The sequence information on the SDAV S-protein gene was applied to a differential diagnostic PCR to detect and distinguish the rat coronavirus from mouse coronaviruses. This is the first report on the comprehensive genetic information of any rat coronavirus.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.202324695,-0.040049856,-0.042127467,-0.005007491,0.092506225,-0.083957522,-0.167078147,-0.024362351,0.047599653,-0.074074152,-0.147771425,-0.062690516,0.09282588,-0.065396811,-0.049127374,-0.118133467,0.078644477,-0.004676065,0.020658499,0.026249935,0.00439057,0.001403559,0.039705522,0.014503532,0.122446276,0.145038097,0.039812801,-0.078636133,-0.038903975,0.04485878
Identification of a cis-Acting Replication Element within the Poliovirus Coding Region,"The replication of poliovirus, a positive-stranded RNA virus, requires translation of the infecting genome followed by virus-encoded VPg and 3D polymerase-primed synthesis of a negative-stranded template. RNA sequences involved in the latter process are poorly defined. Since many sequences involved in picornavirus replication form RNA structures, we searched the genome, other than the untranslated regions, for predicted local secondary structural elements and identified a 61-nucleotide (nt) stem-loop in the region encoding the 2C protein. Covariance analysis suggested the structure was well conserved in the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae. Site-directed mutagenesis, disrupting the structure without affecting the 2C product, destroyed genome viability and suggested that the structure was required in the positive sense for function. Recovery of revertant viruses suggested that integrity of the structure was critical for function, and analysis of replication demonstrated that nonviable mutants did not synthesize negative strands. Our conclusion, that this RNA secondary structure constitutes a novel poliovirus cis-acting replication element (CRE), is supported by the demonstration that subgenomic replicons bearing lethal mutations in the native structure can be restored to replication competence by the addition of a second copy of the 61-nt wild-type sequence at another location within the genome. This poliovirus CRE functionally resembles an element identified in rhinovirus type 14 (K. L. McKnight and S. M. Lemon, RNA 4:1569–1584, 1998) and the cardioviruses (P. E. Lobert, N. Escriou, J. Ruelle, and T. Michiels, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96:11560–11565, 1999) but differs in sequence, structure, and location.

A conserved hairpin structure in Alfamovirus and Bromovirus subgenomic promoters is required for efficient RNA synthesis in vitro.,"The coat protein gene in RNA 3 of alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV; genus Alfamovirus, family Bromoviridae) is translated from the subgenomic RNA 4. Analysis of the subgenomic promoter (sgp) in minus-strand RNA 3 showed that a sequence of 37 nt upstream of the RNA 4 start site (nt +1) was sufficient for full sgp activity in an in vitro assay with the purified viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp). The sequence of nt -6 to -29 could be folded into a potential hairpin structure with a loop represented by nt -16, -17, and -18, and a bulge involving nt -23. By introducing mutations that disrupted base pairing and compensatory mutations that restored base pairing, it was shown that base pairing in the top half of the putative stem (between the loop and bulge) was essential for sgp activity, whereas base pairing in the bottom half of the stem was less stringently required. Deletion of the bulged residue A-23 or mutation of this residue into a C strongly reduced sgp activity, but mutation of A-23 into U or G had little effect on sgp activity. Mutation of loop residues A-16 and A-17 affected sgp activity, whereas mutation of U-18 did not. Using RNA templates corresponding to the sgp of brome mosaic virus (BMV; genus Bromovirus, family Bromoviridae) and purified BMV RdRp, evidence was obtained indicating that also in BMV RNA a triloop hairpin structure is required for sgp activity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.215315633,-0.063183458,-0.0620017,0.090030452,0.008314079,-0.100469751,-0.037263627,0.049143032,-0.065542732,-0.03618046,0.045092062,0.066476632,-0.067369781,-0.032746912,-0.041536152,-0.001784897,0.030351354,0.004351827,-0.002204915,-0.056272923,0.013531582,-0.033133783,-0.014219737,-0.00132169,-0.046463895,-0.051116718,-0.042980103,0.051490419,0.075858198,-0.019290543
cis- and trans-Acting Elements in Flavivirus RNA Replication,"Most of the seven flavivirus nonstructural proteins (NS1 to NS5) encoded in the distal two-thirds of the RNA positive-sense genome are believed to be essential components of RNA replication complexes. To explore the functional relationships of these components in RNA replication, we used trans-complementation analysis of full-length infectious RNAs of Kunjin (KUN) virus with a range of lethal in-frame deletions in the nonstructural coding region, using as helper a repBHK cell line stably producing functional replication complexes from KUN replicon RNA. Recently we showed that replication of KUN RNAs with large carboxy-terminal deletions including the entire RNA polymerase region in the NS5 gene, representing 34 to 75% of the NS5 coding content, could be complemented after transfection into repBHK cells. In this study we have demonstrated that KUN RNAs with deletions of 84 to 97% of the NS1 gene, or of 13 to 63% of the NS3 gene including the entire helicase region, were also complemented in repBHK cells with variable efficiencies. In contrast, KUN RNAs with deletions in any of the other four nonstructural genes NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, and NS4B were not complemented. We have also demonstrated successful trans complementation of KUN RNAs containing either combined double deletions in the NS1 and NS5 genes or triple deletions in the NS1, NS3, and NS5 genes comprising as much as 38% of the entire nonstructural coding content. Based on these and our previous complementation results, we have generated a map of cis- and trans-acting elements in RNA replication for the nonstructural coding region of the flavivirus genome. These results are discussed in the context of our model on formation and composition of the flavivirus replication complex, and we suggest molecular mechanisms by which functions of some defective components of the replication complex can be complemented by their wild-type counterparts expressed from another (helper) RNA molecule.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.212064736,-0.064190476,-0.04743454,0.045529866,-0.018096738,-0.056380898,-0.044835983,0.021470141,-0.004328563,-0.012056128,0.019231711,-0.012368258,-0.013460794,0.044086642,0.01869876,0.030952667,-0.026648305,-0.006390013,0.007932816,0.002121369,-0.003628508,0.021013061,-0.005383535,-0.042280641,-0.001707208,0.011795651,0.008788606,0.00489181,-0.027319915,0.014981426
"Translation from the 5′ Untranslated Region (UTR) of mRNA 1 Is Repressed, but That from the 5′ UTR of mRNA 7 Is Stimulated in Coronavirus-Infected Cells","Viral gene products are generally required in widely differing amounts for successful virus growth and assembly. For coronaviruses, regulation of transcription is a major contributor to these differences, but regulation of translation may also be important. Here, we examine the possibility that the 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs), unique for each of the nine species of mRNA in the bovine coronavirus and ranging in length from 70 nucleotides (nt) to 210 nt (inclusive of the common 5′-terminal 65-nt leader), can differentially affect the rate of protein accumulation. When the natural 77-nt 5′ UTR on synthetic transcripts of mRNA 7 (mRNA for N and I proteins) was replaced with the 210-nt 5′ UTR from mRNA 1 (genomic RNA, mRNA for viral polymerase), approximately twofold-less N, or (N) CAT fusion reporter protein, was made in vitro. Twofold less was also made in vivo in uninfected cells when a T7 RNA polymerase-driven transient-transfection system was used. In coronavirus-infected cells, this difference surprisingly became 12-fold as the result of both a stimulated translation from the 77-nt 5′ UTR and a repression of translation from the 210-nt 5′ UTR. These results reveal that a differential 5′ UTR-directed regulation of translation can occur in coronavirus-infected cells and lead us to postulate that the direction and degree of regulation is carried out by viral or virally induced cellular factors acting in trans on cis-acting elements within the 5′ UTR.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.165634717,-0.061762819,-0.041688828,-0.035132295,-0.002469833,-0.055510171,-0.081450103,-0.003669973,0.022247534,-0.067473126,-0.055391235,-0.090600105,0.040700469,0.03981513,-0.008101753,0.021278681,-0.001525463,-0.021464742,-0.015201915,-0.005949096,-0.003315498,0.030119163,-0.03619075,0.007249394,-0.000377445,-0.091267589,-0.029342017,0.009803755,0.126663816,0.027871575
A Recombinant Hepatitis C Virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Capable of Copying the Full-Length Viral RNA,"All of the previously reported recombinant RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp), the NS5B enzymes, of hepatitis C virus (HCV) could function only in a primer-dependent and template-nonspecific manner, which is different from the expected properties of the functional viral enzymes in the cells. We have now expressed a recombinant NS5B that is able to synthesize a full-length HCV genome in a template-dependent and primer-independent manner. The kinetics of RNA synthesis showed that this RdRp can initiate RNA synthesis de novo and yield a full-length RNA product of genomic size (9.5 kb), indicating that it did not use the copy-back RNA as a primer. This RdRp was also able to accept heterologous viral RNA templates, including poly(A)- and non-poly(A)-tailed RNA, in a primer-independent manner, but the products in these cases were heterogeneous. The RdRp used some homopolymeric RNA templates only in the presence of a primer. By using the 3′-end 98 nucleotides (nt) of HCV RNA, which is conserved in all genotypes of HCV, as a template, a distinct RNA product was generated. Truncation of 21 nt from the 5′ end or 45 nt from the 3′ end of the 98-nt RNA abolished almost completely its ability to serve as a template. Inclusion of the 3′-end variable sequence region and the U-rich tract upstream of the X region in the template significantly enhanced RNA synthesis. The 3′ end of minus-strand RNA of HCV genome also served as a template, and it required a minimum of 239 nt from the 3′ end. These data defined the cis-acting sequences for HCV RNA synthesis at the 3′ end of HCV RNA in both the plus and minus senses. This is the first recombinant HCV RdRp capable of copying the full-length HCV RNA in the primer-independent manner expected of the functional HCV RNA polymerase.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.285949763,-0.065585546,-0.087241124,0.152433938,-0.02014733,-0.165327367,-0.035351168,0.062979882,-0.066021984,0.006887452,0.086345303,0.116164007,-0.023766919,0.025484516,-0.02996597,-0.004152421,0.019865638,0.207203345,0.259707583,-0.16082351,-0.065462146,-0.010210452,0.083855194,-0.001966612,-0.091190219,-0.133682733,-0.098781516,0.112341357,-0.011013681,0.018814262
Localization of Mouse Hepatitis Virus Nonstructural Proteins and RNA Synthesis Indicates a Role for Late Endosomes in Viral Replication,"The aim of the present study was to define the site of replication of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Antibodies directed against several proteins derived from the gene 1 polyprotein, including the 3C-like protease (3CLpro), the putative polymerase (POL), helicase, and a recently described protein (p22) derived from the C terminus of the open reading frame 1a protein (CT1a), were used to probe MHV-infected cells by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) and electron microscopy (EM). At early times of infection, all of these proteins showed a distinct punctate labeling by IF. Antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein also displayed a punctate labeling that largely colocalized with the replicase proteins. When infected cells were metabolically labeled with 5-bromouridine 5′-triphosphate (BrUTP), the site of viral RNA synthesis was shown by IF to colocalize with CT1a and the 3CLpro. As shown by EM, CT1a localized to LAMP-1 positive late endosomes/lysosomes while POL accumulated predominantly in multilayered structures with the appearance of endocytic carrier vesicles. These latter structures were also labeled to some extent with both anti-CT1a and LAMP-1 antibodies and could be filled with fluid phase endocytic tracers. When EM was used to determine sites of BrUTP incorporation into viral RNA at early times of infection, the viral RNA localized to late endosomal membranes as well. These results demonstrate that MHV replication occurs on late endosomal membranes and that several nonstructural proteins derived from the gene 1 polyprotein may participate in the formation and function of the viral replication complexes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.207464436,-0.051618072,-0.039624773,0.03591974,-0.060054927,-0.073015953,-0.0674784,-0.017847711,0.042135131,-0.049132198,-0.054945715,-0.058874251,0.025914445,0.07646539,-0.011131493,-0.004593465,0.056029457,2.24E-05,-0.015191369,0.058281212,-0.071438349,0.034826899,-0.053923435,0.012763877,0.169470491,0.111539721,-0.040042208,-0.009274974,-0.137206912,0.011142132
Specific Interaction between the Hepatitis C Virus NS5B RNA Polymerase and the 3′ End of the Viral RNA,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B protein is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase capable of directing RNA synthesis. In this study, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated the interaction between a partially purified recombinant NS5B protein and a 3′ viral genomic RNA with or without the conserved 98-nucleotide tail. The NS5B-RNA complexes were specifically competed away by the unlabeled homologous RNA but not by the viral 5′ noncoding region and very poorly by the 3′ conserved 98-nucleotide tail. A 3′ coding region with conserved stem-loop structures rather than the 3′ noncoding region of the HCV genome is critical for the specific binding of NS5B. Nevertheless, no direct interaction between the 3′ coding region and the HCV NS5A protein was detected. Furthermore, two independent RNA-binding domains (RBDs) of NS5B were identified, RBD1, from amino acid residues 83 to 194, and RBD2, from residues 196 to 298. Interestingly, the conserved motifs of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for putative RNA binding (220-DxxxxD-225) and template/primer position (282-S/TGxxxTxxxNS/T-292) are present in the RBD2. Nevertheless, the RNA-binding activity of RBD2 was abolished when it was linked to the carboxy-terminal half of the NS5B.

Colocalization and Membrane Association of Murine Hepatitis Virus Gene 1 Products and De Novo-Synthesized Viral RNA in Infected Cells,"Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) gene 1, the 22-kb polymerase (pol) gene, is first translated into a polyprotein and subsequently processed into multiple proteins by viral autoproteases. Genetic complementation analyses suggest that the majority of the gene 1 products are required for viral RNA synthesis. However, there is no physical evidence supporting the association of any of these products with viral RNA synthesis. We have now performed immunofluorescent-staining studies with four polyclonal antisera to localize various MHV-A59 gene 1 products in virus-infected cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that these antisera detected proteins representing the two papain-like proteases and the 3C-like protease encoded by open reading frame (ORF) 1a, the putative polymerase (p100) and a p35 encoded by ORF 1b, and their precursors. De novo-synthesized viral RNA was labeled with bromouridine triphosphate in lysolecithin-permeabilized MHV-infected cells. Confocal microscopy revealed that all of the viral proteins detected by these antisera colocalized with newly synthesized viral RNA in the cytoplasm, particularly in the perinuclear region of infected cells. Several cysteine and serine protease inhibitors, i.e., E64d, leupeptin, and zinc chloride, inhibited viral RNA synthesis without affecting the localization of viral proteins, suggesting that the processing of the MHV gene 1 polyprotein is tightly associated with viral RNA synthesis. Dual labeling with antibodies specific for cytoplasmic membrane structures showed that MHV gene 1 products and RNA colocalized with the Golgi apparatus in HeLa cells. However, in murine 17CL-1 cells, the viral proteins and viral RNA did not colocalize with the Golgi apparatus but, instead, partially colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum. Our results provide clear physical evidence that several MHV gene 1 products, including the proteases and the polymerase, are associated with the viral RNA replication-transcription machinery, which may localize to different membrane structures in different cell lines.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.251738996,-0.085974245,-0.078324897,0.073960727,-0.007898188,-0.108986324,-0.103372897,-0.001249584,0.02750463,-0.016731582,-0.055363212,-0.124362846,0.052557817,0.087534499,0.011578845,-0.005349483,0.004910595,-0.003130758,0.041146432,0.066019148,-0.062024481,0.060799372,-0.031412724,-0.003858601,0.080270092,0.069971715,0.013506038,-0.050956004,-0.109749043,0.045848819
The Versatility of Paramyxovirus RNA Polymerase Stuttering,"Paramyxoviruses cotranscriptionally edit their P gene mRNAs by expanding the number of Gs of a conserved A(n)G(n) run. Different viruses insert different distributions of guanylates, e.g., Sendai virus inserts a single G, whereas parainfluenza virus type 3 inserts one to six Gs. The sequences conserved at the editing site, as well as the experimental evidence, suggest that the insertions occur by a stuttering process, i.e., by pseudotemplated transcription. The number of times the polymerase “stutters” at the editing site before continuing strictly templated elongation is directed by a cis-acting sequence found upstream of the insertions. We have examined the stuttering process during natural virus infections by constructing recombinant Sendai viruses with mutations in their cis-acting sequences. We found that the template stutter site is precisely determined (C(1052)) and that a relatively short region (∼6 nucleotides) just upstream of the A(n)G(n) run can modulate the overall frequency of mRNA editing as well as the distribution of the nucleotide insertions. The positions more proximal to the 5′ A(n)G(n) run are the most important in this respect. We also provide evidence that the stability of the mRNA/template hybrid plays a determining role in the overall frequency and range of mRNA editing. When the template U run is extended all the way to the stutter site, adenylates rather than guanylates are added at the editing site and their distribution begins to resemble the polyadenylation associated with mRNA 3′ end formation by the viral polymerase. Our data suggest how paramyxovirus mRNA editing and polyadenylation are related mechanistically and how editing sites may have evolved from poly(A)-termination sites or vice versa.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.099303695,-0.054953504,-0.011311898,-0.029875592,0.019897283,-0.00882601,-0.016390815,0.0053534,-0.000293556,-0.035040845,-0.03078399,-0.011916556,0.01278229,-0.042089571,-0.003978807,0.013381248,-0.011156429,-0.018836733,-0.033831594,-0.031297434,0.019032846,-0.008831238,-0.015923936,0.05164771,-0.00555752,-0.061830405,-0.031844969,0.02290453,0.087660544,-0.032604851
Expression of Murine Coronavirus Recombinant Papain-Like Proteinase: Efficient Cleavage Is Dependent on the Lengths of both the Substrate and the Proteinase Polypeptides,"Proteolytic processing of the replicase gene product of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is essential for viral replication. In MHV strain A59 (MHV-A59), the replicase gene encodes two predicted papain-like proteinase (PLP) domains, PLP-1 and PLP-2. Previous work using viral polypeptide substrates synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation from the replicase gene demonstrated both cis and trans cleavage activities for PLP-1. We have cloned and overexpressed the PLP-1 domain in Escherichia coli by using a T7 RNA polymerase promoter system or as a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion protein. With both overexpression systems, the recombinant PLP-1 exhibited trans cleavage activity when incubated with in vitro-synthesized viral polypeptide substrates. Subsequent characterization of the recombinant PLP-1 revealed that in vitro trans cleavage is more efficient at 22°C than at higher temperatures. Using substrates of increasing lengths, we observed efficient cleavage by PLP-1 requires a substrate greater than 69 kDa. In addition, when PLP-1 was expressed as a polypeptide that included additional viral sequences at the carboxyl terminus of the predicted PLP-1 domain, a fivefold increase in proteolytic activity was observed. The data presented here support previous data suggesting that in vitro and in vivo cleavage of the ORF 1a polyprotein by PLP-1 can occur in both in cis and in trans. In contrast to the cleavage activity demonstrated for PLP-1, no in vitro cleavage in cis or in trans could be detected with PLP-2 expressed either as a polypeptide, including flanking viral sequences, or as an MBP fusion enzyme.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.126390927,-0.051312245,-0.021554468,-0.037579643,-0.016658974,-0.023180596,-0.05217196,-0.009406007,0.02903291,-0.048958932,-0.057550187,-0.002336776,0.00827338,-0.028283036,-0.021488925,-0.017820664,0.037610286,-0.002138617,0.026373318,-0.012171528,-0.015659656,-0.00116944,0.009564221,-0.018510094,0.069541478,0.080048623,-0.026447978,-0.013001416,-0.02611061,-0.017179327
Molecular Characterization of a Bovine Enteric Calicivirus: Relationship to the Norwalk-Like Viruses,"Jena virus (JV) is a noncultivatable bovine enteric calicivirus associated with diarrhea in calves and was first described in Jena, Germany. The virus was serially passaged 11 times in colostrum-deprived newborn calves and caused diarrheal disease symptoms at each passage. The complete JV genome sequence was determined by using cDNA made from partially purified virus obtained from a single stool sample. JV has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome which is 7,338 nucleotides in length, excluding the poly(A) tail. JV genome organization is similar to that of the human Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs), with three separate open reading frames (ORFs) and a 24-nucleotide sequence motif located at the 5′ terminus of the genome and at the start of ORF 2. The polyprotein (ORF 1) consists of 1,680 amino acids and has the characteristic 2C helicase, 3C protease, and 3D RNA polymerase motifs also found in the NLVs. However, comparison of the N-terminal 100 amino acids of the JV polyprotein with those of the group 1 and group 2 NLVs showed a considerable divergence in sequence. The capsid protein (ORF 2) at 519 amino acids is smaller than that of all other caliciviruses. JV ORF 2 was translated in vitro to produce a 55-kDa protein that reacted with postinfection serum but not preinfection serum. Phylogenetic studies based on partial RNA polymerase sequences indicate that within the Caliciviridae JV is most closely related to the group 1 NLVs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.164215945,-0.048892141,-0.018959188,-0.030185912,0.142900224,-0.073486351,-0.123421148,0.010768376,-0.012483962,-0.047559781,-0.073911883,-0.00107987,0.025658389,-0.131232612,-0.013876783,-0.14222198,0.064065398,0.020970115,0.043201033,0.023754331,-0.022299595,-0.027912699,-0.071165718,0.016403829,-0.045948802,0.020066105,0.038008784,-0.100836029,-0.068209921,-0.033056187
Two Nucleotides Immediately Upstream of the Essential A(6)G(3) Slippery Sequence Modulate the Pattern of G Insertions during Sendai Virus mRNA Editing,"Editing of paramyxovirus P gene mRNAs occurs cotranscriptionally and functions to fuse an alternate downstream open reading frame to the N-terminal half of the P protein. G residues are inserted into a short G run contained within a larger purine run (A(n)G(n)) in this process, by a mechanism whereby the transcribing polymerase stutters (i.e., reads the same template cytosine more than once). Although Sendai virus (SeV) and bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (bPIV3) are closely related, the G insertions in their P mRNAs are distributed differently. SeV predominantly inserts a single G residue within the G run of the sequence 5′ AACAAAAAAGGG, whereas bPIV3 inserts one to six G’s at roughly equal frequency within the sequence 5′ AUUAAAAAAGGGG (differences are underlined). We have examined how the cis-acting editing sequence determines the number of G’s inserted, both in a transfected cell system using minigenome analogues and by generating recombinant viruses. We found that the presence of four rather than three G’s in the purine run did not affect the distribution of G insertions. However, when the underlined AC of the SeV sequence was replaced by the UU found in bPIV3, the editing phenotype from both the minigenome and the recombinant virus resembled that found in natural bPIV3 infections (i.e., a significant fraction of the mRNAs contained two to six G insertions). The two nucleotides located just upstream of the polypurine tract are thus key determinants of the editing phenotype of these viruses. Moreover, the minimum number of A residues that will promote SeV editing phenotype is six but can be reduced to five when the upstream AC is replaced by UU. A model for how the upstream dinucleotide controls the insertion phenotype is presented.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.095344947,-0.059923198,-0.011915126,-0.034542458,0.034626615,-0.015907807,-0.041539606,0.003214051,0.015822288,-0.034653817,-0.05204607,-0.012236733,0.019163288,-0.062413571,0.012317049,-0.010730015,-0.001029047,-0.014608408,-0.014547607,-0.020694191,0.032649014,-0.02151167,-0.008287982,0.050670428,-0.005753876,-0.00228419,-0.005737142,-0.01484525,0.038728184,-0.034661553
Antigenic Structure of the Nucleocapsid Protein of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus,"A collection of 12 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus was used to study the antigenic structure of the virus nucleocapsid protein (N). The full-length N gene, encoded by open reading frame 7, was cloned from the Canadian PRRS virus, PA-8. Deletions were introduced into the N gene to produce a series of nine overlapping protein fragments ranging in length from 25 to 112 amino acids. The individual truncated genes were cloned as glutathione S-transferase fusions into a eukaryotic expression vector downstream of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. HeLa cells infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding the N protein fragments, and the antigenicity of the synthesized proteins was analyzed by immunoprecipitation. Based on the immunoreactivities of the N protein deletion mutants with the panel of N-specific MAbs, five domains of antigenic importance were identified. MAbs SDOW17, SR30, and 5H2.3B12.1C9 each identified independent domains defined by amino acids 30 to 52, 69 to 123, and 37 to 52, respectively. Seven of the MAbs tested specifically recognized the local protein conformation formed in part by the amino acid residues 52 to 69. Furthermore, deletion of 11 amino acids from the carboxy terminus of the nucleocapsid protein disrupted the epitope configuration recognized by all of the conformation-dependent MAbs, suggesting that the carboxy-terminal region plays an important role in maintaining local protein conformation.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.157716814,-0.055943559,-0.023220301,-0.034010096,0.029425531,-0.030821345,-0.097674485,-0.033597902,0.050928429,-0.039847481,-0.103520571,-0.020765772,0.013801476,-0.052689489,-0.030932697,-0.116953239,0.085022297,-0.045731956,0.016535971,0.029793648,-0.014328261,-0.018414265,0.047663076,-0.037116713,0.052106385,0.102528173,0.035968263,-0.040896142,-0.081730044,0.061435258
Mutations in the N Terminus of the Brome Mosaic Virus Polymerase Affect Genetic RNA-RNA Recombination,"Previously, we have observed that mutations in proteins 1a and 2a, the two virally encoded components of the brome mosaic virus (BMV) replicase, can affect the frequency of recombination and the locations of RNA recombination sites (P. D. Nagy, A. Dzianott, P. Ahlquist, and J. J. Bujarski, J. Virol. 69:2547–2556, 1995; M. Figlerowicz, P. D. Nagy, and J. J. Bujarski, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:2073–2078, 1997). Also, it was found before that the N-terminal domain of 2a, the putative RNA polymerase protein, participates in the interactions between 1a and 2a (C. C. Kao, R. Quadt, R. P. Hershberger, and P. Ahlquist, J. Virol. 66:6322–6329, 1992; E. O’Reilly, J. Paul, and C. C. Kao, J. Virol. 71:7526–7532, 1997). In this work, we examine how mutations within the N terminus of 2a influence RNA recombination in BMV. Because of the likely electrostatic character of 1a-2a interactions, five 2a mutants, MF1 to MF5, were generated by replacing clusters of acidic amino acids with their neutral counterparts. MF2 and MF5 retained nearly wild-type levels of 1a-2a interaction and were infectious in Chenopodium quinoa. However, compared to that in wild-type virus, the frequency of nonhomologous recombination in both MF2 and MF5 was markedly decreased. Only in MF2 was the frequency of homologous recombination reduced and the occurrence of imprecise homologous recombination increased. In MF5 there was also a 3′ shift in the positions of homologous crossovers. The observed effects of MF2 and MF5 reveal that the 2a N-terminal domain participates in different ways in homologous and in nonhomologous BMV RNA recombination. This work maps specific locations within the N terminus involved in 1a-2a interaction and in recombination and further suggests that the mechanisms of the two types of crossovers in BMV are different.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.145043201,-0.058106026,-0.032535106,-0.006469152,0.013663656,-0.036614102,-0.013820471,0.027717654,-0.025127451,-0.005066744,0.04226219,0.044839032,-0.047855991,-0.024355798,0.001730965,0.038627661,-0.015974363,-0.029104542,-0.008294886,-0.014826723,0.031525768,-0.039773516,-0.009388376,-0.0071506,0.007096284,-0.018783712,-0.028796022,0.009331867,-0.064071784,-0.044798684
ORF1a-Encoded Replicase Subunits Are Involved in the Membrane Association of the Arterivirus Replication Complex,"Among the functions of the replicase of equine arteritis virus (EAV; family Arteriviridae, order Nidovirales) are important viral enzyme activities such as proteases and the putative RNA polymerase and RNA helicase functions. The replicase is expressed in the form of two polyproteins (open reading frame 1a [ORF1a] and ORF1ab), which are processed into 12 nonstructural proteins by three viral proteases. In immunofluorescence assays, the majority of these cleavage products localized to the perinuclear region of the cell. A dense granular and vesicular staining was observed, which strongly suggested membrane association. By using confocal microscopy and double-label immunofluorescence, the distribution of the EAV replicase was shown to overlap with that of PDI, a resident protein of the endoplasmic reticulum and intermediate compartment. An in situ labeling of nascent viral RNA with bromo-UTP demonstrated that the membrane-bound complex in which the replicase subunits accumulate is indeed the site of viral RNA synthesis. A number of ORF1a-encoded hydrophobic domains were postulated to be involved in the membrane association of the arterivirus replication complex. By using various biochemical methods (Triton X-114 extraction, membrane purification, and sodium carbonate treatment), replicase subunits containing these domains were shown to behave as integral membrane proteins and to be membrane associated in infected cells. Thus, contribution to the formation of a membrane-bound scaffold for the viral replication-transcription complex appears to be an important novel function for the arterivirus ORF1a replicase polyprotein.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.196404047,-0.057301187,-0.077441779,0.052939461,-0.05786067,-0.067409517,-0.011939987,-1.39E-05,0.015679252,-0.009358497,-0.016525971,0.002078138,0.005933907,0.028985133,-0.047564005,-0.056842709,0.11352114,-0.081920679,0.012144537,0.054488114,-0.099981559,0.050197856,-0.068545994,-0.124408334,0.058708497,0.032637405,-0.052647808,-0.011067353,-0.086035654,-0.010545729
Genes Required for Replication of the 15.5-Kilobase RNA Genome of a Plant Closterovirus,"A full-length cDNA clone of beet yellows closterovirus (BYV) was engineered and used to map functions involved in the replication of the viral RNA genome and subgenomic RNA formation. Among 10 open reading frames (ORFs) present in BYV, ORFs 1a and 1b suffice for RNA replication and transcription. The proteins encoded in these ORFs harbor putative methyltransferase, RNA helicase, and RNA polymerase domains common to Sindbis virus-like viruses and a large interdomain region that is unique to closteroviruses. The papain-like leader proteinase (L-Pro) encoded in the 5′-proximal region of ORF 1a was found to have a dual function in genome amplification. First, the autocatalytic cleavage between L-Pro and the remainder of the ORF 1a product was essential for replication of RNA. Second, an additional L-Pro function that was separable from proteolytic activity was required for efficient RNA accumulation. The deletion of a large, ∼5.6-kb, 3′-terminal region coding for a 6-kDa hydrophobic protein, an HSP70 homolog, a 64-kDa protein, minor and major capsid proteins, a 20-kDa protein, and a 21-kDa protein (p21) resulted in replication-competent RNA. However, examination of mutants with replacements of start codons in each of these seven 3′-terminal ORFs revealed that p21 functions as an enhancer of genome amplification.

MHC-genotype of progeny influenced by parental infection.,"In a previous series of in vitro fertilization experiments with mice we found non-random combination of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotypes in the very early embryos. Our results suggested that two selection mechanisms were operating: (i) the eggs selected specific sperm; and (ii) the second meiotic division in the eggs was influenced by the type of sperm that entered the egg. Furthermore, the proportion of MHC-heterozygous embryos varied over time, suggesting that non-random fertilization was dependent on an external factor that changed over time. As a higher frequency of heterozygous individuals correlated with an uncontrolled epidemic by MHV (mouse hepatitis virus), we suggested that MHV-infection might have influenced the outcome of fertilization. Here, we present an experiment that tests this hypothesis. We infected randomly chosen mice with MHV and sham-infected control mice five days before pairing. We recovered the two-cell embryos from the oviduct, cultured them until the blastocyst stage, and determined the genotype of each resulting blastocyst by polymerase chain reaction. We found the pattern that we expected from our previous experiments: virus-infected mice produced more MHC-heterozygous embryos than sham-infected ones. This suggests that parents are able to promote specific combinations of MHC-haplotypes during fertilization according to the presence or absence of a viral infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.065062056,-0.032283661,0.011664127,-0.072012957,-0.029998228,0.018768587,-0.032862516,-0.012101023,0.030075451,-0.010887421,-0.004922017,-0.033107968,-0.002807223,0.043217573,0.047193123,0.053294044,-0.049936498,0.003744855,-0.014927719,-0.010087337,0.02976229,-0.029996563,0.033678491,0.025224426,0.039614274,0.049658625,0.004073027,-0.018510465,-0.046556528,-0.002023569
Brome mosaic virus RNA replication protein 1a dramatically increases in vivo stability but not translation of viral genomic RNA3,"Brome mosaic virus (BMV), a positive-strand RNA virus in the alphavirus-like superfamily, encodes two RNA replication proteins: 1a, which contains a helicase-like domain and a domain implicated in RNA capping, and 2a, which contains a polymerase-like domain. To further explore their functions, we expressed 1a and 2a individually and together in yeast also expressing replicatable transcripts of BMV genomic RNA3. Complementing prior results that 1a and 2a are required jointly for positive-strand RNA synthesis, both also were required for negative-strand RNA synthesis. Nevertheless, in the absence of 2a, 1a expression increased the accumulation of DNA-derived RNA3 transcripts 8-fold. Increased accumulation was specific for RNA3: none of a diverse set of yeast mRNAs tested showed increased accumulation in the presence of 1a. Increased RNA3 accumulation was not due to increased DNA transcription, but to a 20- to 40-fold increase in the in vivo half-life of RNA3 from 5–10 min in the absence of 1a to more than 3 hr in the presence of 1a. Although (1a+2a)-dependent RNA replication selectively amplified the natural viral 5′ end from among multiple transcription starts of DNA-derived RNA3 transcripts, 1a-induced stabilization affected all RNA3 transcripts, without specificity for the precise viral 5′ end. Increased RNA3 accumulation did not increase expression of a directly translatable, 5′-proximal gene in RNA3, implying that 1a-induced stabilization blocked rather than facilitated RNA3 translation. These and other results suggest that the striking, 1a-induced stabilization of RNA3 may reflect an interaction involved in recruiting viral RNA templates into RNA replication while diverting them from the competing processes of translation and degradation.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.1609024,-0.055944689,-0.036572739,0.026864267,-0.052714228,-0.068739772,-0.02064316,0.032351631,-0.014245036,-0.035605233,0.025187367,-0.003224039,-0.045854716,0.058054726,-0.009506722,0.047653232,0.011062763,-0.045558652,0.01908389,-0.011890764,-0.052035842,0.015905208,-0.037543275,-0.083408574,-0.010254223,-0.085740383,-0.094288964,0.038348595,0.009534882,-0.026065402
Mouse Hepatitis Virus 3C-Like Protease Cleaves a 22-Kilodalton Protein from the Open Reading Frame 1a Polyprotein in Virus-Infected Cells and In Vitro,"The 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is predicted to cleave at least 11 sites in the 803-kDa gene 1 polyprotein, resulting in maturation of proteinase, polymerase, and helicase proteins. However, most of these cleavage sites have not been experimentally confirmed and the proteins have not been identified in vitro or in virus-infected cells. We used specific antibodies to identify and characterize a 22-kDa protein (p1a-22) expressed from gene 1 in MHV A59-infected DBT cells. Processing of p1a-22 from the polyprotein began immediately after translation, but some processing continued for several hours. Amino-terminal sequencing of p1a-22 purified from MHV-infected cells showed that it was cleaved at a putative 3CLpro cleavage site, Gln_Ser(4014) (where the underscore indicates the site of cleavage), that is located between the 3CLpro domain and the end of open reading frame (ORF) 1a. Subclones of this region of gene 1 were used to express polypeptides in vitro that contained one or more 3CLpro cleavage sites, and cleavage of these substrates by recombinant 3CLpro in vitro confirmed that amino-terminal cleavage of p1a-22 occurred at Gln_Ser(4014). We demonstrated that the carboxy-terminal cleavage of the p1a-22 protein occurred at Gln_Asn(4208), a sequence that had not been predicted as a site for cleavage by MHV 3CLpro. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of recombinant MHV 3CLpro in identifying and confirming cleavage sites within the gene 1 polyprotein. Based on our results, we predict that at least seven mature proteins are processed from the ORF 1a polyprotein by 3CLpro and suggest that additional noncanonical cleavage sites may be used by 3CLpro during processing of the gene 1 polyprotein.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.158349634,-0.05040023,-0.022399026,-0.064355566,0.026642273,-0.034980167,-0.13840791,-0.015200602,0.050094951,-0.090616522,-0.128203038,-0.035024709,0.034517215,-0.061160402,-0.027990896,-0.048194706,0.055123264,0.005759798,0.037979293,0.007892099,-0.010758331,-0.006984587,0.023132511,-0.019840454,0.113257117,0.159199572,-0.007100204,-0.022834645,-0.081485091,-0.044331706
Functional Characterization of Naturally Occurring Variants of Human Hepatitis B Virus Containing the Core Internal Deletion Mutation,"Naturally occurring variants of human hepatitis B virus (HBV) containing the core internal deletion (CID) mutation have been found frequently in HBV carriers worldwide. Despite numerous sequence analysis reports of CID variants in patients, in the past decade, CID variants have not been characterized functionally, and thus their biological significance to HBV infection remains unclear. We report here two different CID variants identified from two patients that are replication defective, most likely due to the absence of detectable core protein. In addition, we were unable to detect the presence of the precore protein and e antigen from CID variants. However, the production of polymerase appeared to be normal. The replication defect of the CID variants can be rescued in trans by complementation with wild-type core protein. The rescued CID variant particles, which utilize the wild-type core protein, presumably are enveloped properly since they can be secreted into the medium and band at a position similar to that of mature wild-type Dane particles, as determined by gradient centrifugation analysis. Our results also provide an explanation for the association of CID variants with helper or wild-type HBV in nature. The significance of CID variants in HBV infection and pathogenesis is discussed.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.067026164,-0.038391777,-0.009571996,-0.077837332,-0.03015513,0.026692016,0.008449919,0.00117705,0.000336081,-0.003480366,-0.014528231,0.025035166,-0.0229367,-0.003475331,0.008809796,0.001416786,-0.010989051,0.011722096,-0.009649521,0.010155541,0.057467951,-0.015772681,0.01080382,0.028820152,0.019391721,0.028287433,-0.00244062,-0.01622745,-0.036179593,-0.013599123
Hygromycin B resistance mediates elimination of Leishmania virus from persistently infected parasites.,"A series of pX63-HYG derivatives encoding Leishmania RNA virus 1-4 (LRV1-4) sequences were electroporated into cells of Leishmania strain M4147, a virus-infected strain of L. guyanensis. After 6 weeks of drug selection (hygromycin B), transfected parasites lacked detectable quantities of viral genomic double-stranded RNA, viral capsid protein, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) activity. Evidence of viral infection was not recovered upon removal of the drug. While viral RNA transcripts were produced from electroporated expression vectors, as determined by reverse transcription-PCR, viral antigens were not detected, suggesting that the antiviral effects of hygromycin B are mediated through translation inhibition. A short-term selection study suggests that the LRV1-4 elimination may not only be a function of hygromycin B as a protein synthesis inhibitor but also possibly related to the mechanism of hygromycin B resistance in Leishmania strains.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.206426131,-0.059938405,-0.062569289,0.078436424,-0.045878263,-0.040322167,0.002293257,-0.009680753,0.000691601,0.049659353,0.063922045,-0.016422584,-0.006726564,0.078655888,0.011884269,-0.03940735,0.007254504,0.013820695,0.025867197,0.025378458,-0.01474362,0.060949854,-0.034217876,0.027265897,0.025360897,-0.017295805,0.050593222,-0.024590893,-0.010633347,0.130843981
Prospective case-control study of role of infection in patients who reconsult after initial antibiotic treatment for lower respiratory tract infection in primary care.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess direct and indirect evidence of active infection which may benefit from further antibiotics in adults who reconsult within 4 weeks of initial antibiotic management of acute lower respiratory tract infection in primary care. DESIGN: Observational study with a nested case-control group. SETTING: Two suburban general practices in Arnold, Nottingham, over 7 winter months. SUBJECTS: 367 adults aged 16 years and over fulfilling a definition of lower respiratory tract infection and treated with antibiotics. 74 (20%) patients who reconsulted within 4 weeks for the same symptoms and 82 ""control"" patients who did not were investigated in detail at fallow up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Direct and indirect evidence of active infection at the time of the reconsultation or the follow up visit with the research nurse for the controls. Investigations performed included sputum culture, pneumococcal antigen detection, serial serology for viral and atypical pathogens and C reactive protein, throat swabs for detecting viral and atypical pathogens by culture and polymerase chain reaction, and chest radiographs. RESULTS: Demographic and clinical features of the groups were similar. Two thirds of the 74 patients who reconsulted received another antibiotic because the general practitioner suspected continuing infection. Any evidence of infection warranting antibiotic treatment was uncommon at reconsultation. The findings for the two groups were similar for the occurrence of identified pathogens; chest x ray changes of infection (present in 13%); and C reactive protein concentrations, which had nearly all fallen towards normal. Only three patients in the reconsultation group had concentrations > or = 40 mg/l. Pathogens identified at follow up in the 156 patients in both groups included ampicillin sensitive bacteria in six. Atypical infections diagnosed in 27 (Chlamydia pneumoniae in 22) and viral infections in 54 had probably been present at the initial presentation. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that active infection, which may benefit from further antibiotics, is uncommon in patients who reconsult after a lower respiratory tract infection, and a repeat antibiotic prescription should be the exception rather than the rule. Other factors, such as patients' perception of their illness, may be more important than disease and infection in their decision to reconsult.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.201054804,-0.041163562,-0.110867053,-0.108916048,-0.075527149,-0.072799489,-0.016944519,0.07276115,-0.092634569,0.081731548,-0.037310681,-0.021155852,0.021306769,0.049398201,-0.035413011,-0.04125197,0.029983411,0.039473204,0.005210569,0.057305377,0.027634203,-0.069966611,-0.018538338,-0.049233259,0.038652941,0.013210531,-0.003353821,-0.021798563,-0.007522295,0.004483512
Transcriptional strategy of closteroviruses: mapping the 5' termini of the citrus tristeza virus subgenomic RNAs.,"Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) induces formation of a nested set of at least nine 3' coterminal subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) in infected tissue. The organization and expression of the 19,296-nucleotide (nt) CTV genome resembles that of coronaviruses, with polyprotein processing, translational frameshifting, and multiple sgRNA formation, but phylogenetically the CTV polymerase, like polymerases of other closteroviruses, belongs to the Sindbis virus-like lineage of RNA virus polymerases. Both positive-strand RNA virus supergroups, coronaviruses and Sindbis-like viruses, utilize different mechanisms of transcription. To address the mechanism of CTV transcription, 5' termini for the two most abundant sgRNAs, 1.5 and 0.9 kb, respectively, were mapped by runoff reverse transcription. The two sgRNAs were demonstrated to have 48- and 38-nt 5' untranslated regions (5'-UTRs), respectively. The 5'-UTR for the 1.5-kb RNA was cloned, sequenced, and demonstrated to be colinear with the 48-nt genomic sequence upstream of the initiator codon of the respective open reading frame 10, i.e., to be of continuous template origin. The data obtained suggest that the sgRNA transcription of CTV is dissimilar from the coronavirus transcription and consistent with the transcriptional mechanism of other Sindbis-like viruses. Thus, the Sindbis virus-like mechanism of transcription of the positive-strand RNA genomes might be successfully utilized by the closterovirus genome of up to 19.3 kb with multiple sgRNAs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.169159663,-0.049639314,-0.035305757,0.070742456,0.093430473,-0.080158897,-0.095674922,0.032499564,-0.03042573,-0.043184013,-0.011245033,-0.035385071,0.028504038,0.002731141,0.023238505,0.005131784,0.005609901,0.001837156,0.001000639,-0.011133961,-0.024626205,-0.007598322,-0.082628793,-0.001354175,-0.054390806,-0.063406306,0.003756579,0.0383288,0.035986746,-0.072528959
A retention signal necessary and sufficient for Golgi localization maps to the cytoplasmic tail of a Bunyaviridae (Uukuniemi virus) membrane glycoprotein.,"Members of the Bunyaviridae family mature by a budding process in the Golgi complex. The site of maturation is thought to be largely determined by the accumulation of the two spike glycoproteins, G1 and G2, in this organelle. Here we show that the signal for localizing the Uukuniemi virus (a phlebovirus) spike protein complex to the Golgi complex resides in the cytoplasmic tail of G1. We constructed chimeric proteins in which the ectodomain, transmembrane domain (TMD), and cytoplasmic tail (CT) of Uukuniemi virus G1 were exchanged with the corresponding domains of either vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV G), chicken lysozyme, or CD4, all proteins readily transported to the plasma membrane. The chimeras were expressed in HeLa or BHK-21 cells by using either the T7 RNA polymerase-driven vaccinia virus system or the Semliki Forest virus system. The fate of the chimeric proteins was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence, and their localizations were compared by double labeling with markers specific for the Golgi complex. The results showed that the ectodomain and TMD (including the 10 flanking residues on either side of the membrane) of G1 played no apparent role in targeting chimeric proteins to the Golgi complex. Instead, all chimeras containing the CT of G1 were efficiently targeted to the Golgi complex and colocalized with mannosidase II, a Golgi-specific enzyme. Conversely, replacing the CT of G1 with that from VSV G resulted in the efficient transport of the chimeric protein to the cell surface. Progressive deletions of the G1 tail suggested that the Golgi retention signal maps to a region encompassing approximately residues 10 to 50, counting from the proposed border between the TMD and the tail. Both G1 and G2 were found to be acylated, as shown by incorporation of [3H]palmitate into the viral proteins. By mutational analyses of CD4-G1 chimeras, the sites for palmitylation were mapped to two closely spaced cysteine residues in the G1 tail. Changing either or both of these cysteines to alanine had no effect on the targeting of the chimeric protein to the Golgi complex.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.116254031,-0.043791298,-0.016235697,-0.049691808,-0.044505586,0.011327905,-0.007207367,-0.020318596,0.029923084,-0.032702089,-0.042706455,-0.001624385,-0.018594929,0.011935321,-0.015438357,-0.018725117,0.055890122,-0.046800754,-0.008295867,0.026826228,-0.026729703,0.016242755,-0.016189491,-0.050153324,0.051462558,0.053365728,-0.007454919,0.007938736,-0.043972662,0.004600187
Assembled coronavirus from complementation of two defective interfering RNAs.,"In the presence of an RNA- temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant helper virus, two coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) defective interfering (DI) RNAs complemented each other, resulting in the assembly of MHV particles; we used this ability to complement as a means to study coronavirus assembly. One of the two DI RNAs was DIssA, a naturally occurring self-replicating DI RNA encoding N protein and the gene 1 proteins that encode RNA polymerase function; DIssA supports the replication and transcription of other non-self-replicating DI RNAs. The other DI was a genetically engineered DI RNA that encoded sM and M proteins. Coinfection of these two DIs at the nonpermissive temperature for the ts helper virus resulted in replication and transcription of both DI RNAs but not in synthesis of the helper virus RNAs. MHV particles containing DI RNAs, N protein, and M protein, all of which were exclusively derived from the two DI RNAs, were released from the coinfected cells; the amount of sM protein was below the limits of detection. Analyses of DI RNAs with mutations in the two envelope protein genes demonstrated that M and sM proteins appeared to be required for assembly and release of MHV particles that contained DI RNAs and N protein, while S protein was not required for assembly and release of MHV particles.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.208147731,-0.079750688,-0.044102835,0.04330509,0.007542518,-0.136944416,-0.1981846,0.050516589,-0.002119466,-0.101062951,-0.03273097,-0.160442518,0.065885261,0.053921266,0.229111129,0.229362265,-0.239125585,0.117066199,-0.003603194,0.014913004,0.066108954,-0.028949075,0.118761672,-0.00292127,0.189830222,0.204371015,0.044533474,-0.057385961,0.029590798,-0.015544118
"RNA-RNA recombination in Sindbis virus: roles of the 3' conserved motif, poly(A) tail, and nonviral sequences of template RNAs in polymerase recognition and template switching.","Sindbis virus (SIN), a mosquito-transmitted animal RNA virus, carries a 11.7-kb positive-sense RNA genome which is capped and polyadenylated. We recently reported that the SIN RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) could initiate negative-strand RNA synthesis from a 0.3-kb 3'-coterminal SIN RNA fragment and undergo template switching in vivo (M. Hajjou, K. R. Hill, S. V. Subramaniam, J. Y. Hu, and R. Raju, J. Virol. 70:5153-5164, 1996). To identify and characterize the viral and nonviral sequences which regulate SIN RNA synthesis and recombination, a series of SIN RNAs carrying altered 3' ends were tested for the ability to produce infectious virus or to support recombination in BHK cells. The major findings of this report are as follows: (i) the 3'-terminal 20-nucleotides (nt) sequence along with the abutting poly(A) tail of the SIN genome fully supports negative-strand synthesis, genome replication, and template switching; (ii) a full-length SIN RNA carrying the 3'-terminal 24 nt but lacking the poly(A) tail is noninfectious; (iii) SIN RNAs which carry 3' 64 nt or more without the poly(A) tail are infectious and regain their poly(A) tail in vivo; (iv) donor templates lacking the poly(A) tail do not support template switching; (v) full-length SIN RNAs lacking the poly(A) tail but carrying 3' nonviral extensions, although debilitated to begin with, evolve into rapidly growing poly(A)-carrying mutants; (vi) poly(A) or poly(U) motifs positioned internally within the acceptor templates, in the absence of other promoter elements within the vicinity, do not induce the jumping polymerase to reinitiate at these sites; and (vii) the junction site selection on donor templates occurs independently of the sequences around the acceptor sites. In addition to furthering our understanding of RNA recombination, these studies give interesting clues as to how the alphavirus polymerase interacts with its 3' promoter elements of genomic RNA and nonreplicative RNAs. This is the first report that an in vitro-synthesized alphavirus RNA lacking a poly(A) tail can initiate infection and produce 3' polyadenylated viral genome in vivo.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.199485134,-0.061658312,-0.055494741,0.056951722,0.013197811,-0.103539008,-0.063962674,0.052748479,-0.04497014,-0.016893428,0.051668037,-0.003180778,-0.013513147,-0.004736778,0.041919237,0.08161667,-0.044668515,0.009012888,-0.035526298,-0.022624064,-0.002544092,-0.005280701,-0.031501815,-0.045431555,-0.02610075,-0.073893559,-0.043992086,0.045823409,0.049336468,-0.001053923
Processing of the equine arteritis virus replicase ORF1b protein: identification of cleavage products containing the putative viral polymerase and helicase domains.,"The replicase open reading frame lb (ORF1b) protein of equine arteritis virus (EAV) is expressed from the viral genome as an ORF1ab fusion protein (345 kDa) by ribosomal frameshifting. Processing of the ORF1b polyprotein was predicted to be mediated by the nsp4 serine protease, the main EAV protease. Several putative cleavage sites for this protease were detected in the ORF1b polyprotein. On the basis of this tentative processing scheme, peptides were selected to raise rabbit antisera that were used to study the processing of the EAV replicase ORF1b polyprotein (158 kDa). In immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments, processing products of 80, 50, 26, and 12 kDa were detected. Of these, the 80-kDa and the 50-kDa proteins contain the putative viral polymerase and helicase domains, respectively. Together, the four cleavage products probably cover the entire ORF1b-encoded region of the EAV replicase, thereby representing the first complete processing scheme of a coronaviruslike ORF1b polyprotein. Pulse-chase analysis revealed that processing of the ORF1b polyprotein is slow and that several large precursor proteins containing both ORF1a- and ORF1b-encoded regions are generated. The localization of ORF1b-specific proteins in the infected cell was studied by immunofluorescence. A perinuclear staining was observed, which suggests association with a membranous compartment.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.127114346,-0.046599774,-0.024541362,-0.049593101,0.016612256,-0.029168147,-0.070933143,-0.008529718,0.041136588,-0.057435158,-0.103344275,0.003418066,0.038988817,-0.094246441,-0.066951553,-0.094422046,0.122093952,-0.018249971,0.044622101,0.013898634,-0.067301843,-0.000802654,-0.03820052,-0.055558377,0.035866859,0.07381847,-0.020320691,-0.009884853,-0.047008621,-0.062133634
Serological and molecular evidence of enterovirus infection in patients with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy.,"OBJECTIVE: To study the relative diagnostic value of enterovirus-specific molecular biological and serological assays in patients with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy, and to investigate the possible role of other cardiotropic viruses in dilated cardiomyopathy. DESIGN: Analysis of recipient myocardial tissue and serum from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and controls undergoing cardiac transplantation for end-stage cardiac disease. SETTING: University virology department and transplantation unit. METHODS: Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequence analysis of myocardial RNA and DNA; enterovirus-specific in situ hybridization; enterovirus-specific immunoglobulin M detection. RESULTS: Enterovirus RNA was detected in myocardial tissue from only a small proportion of (five of 75) hearts. However, although enterovirus-specific immunoglobulin M responses were detected in 22 (28%) of 39 controls patients, a significantly higher prevalence was observed among patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (22 (56%) of 39 patients; P < 0.005). All enteroviruses detected in myocardium showed greatest nucleotide sequence homology with coxsackievirus type B3. Detection of enterovirus RNA in myocardium by the polymerase chain reaction and by in situ hybridisation gave comparable results. Other potentially cardiotropic virus genomes, including human cytomegalovirus, influenzaviruses, and coronaviruses were not detected in myocardium. CONCLUSION: This study found that enterovirus-specific immunoglobulin M responses provided the strongest evidence of enterovirus involvement in patients with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the high background prevalence of these responses limits their diagnostic value. The finding that enteroviruses detected in myocardium were coxsackievirus type B3 accords with recent findings in patients with acute myocarditis, and indicates that this serotype is the major cardiotropic human enterovirus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.041590852,-0.021817949,-0.011351925,-0.05493826,-0.002331481,-0.051849942,-0.028559336,0.046478932,-0.103232492,0.040425159,-0.022230145,0.011346682,0.028404707,0.028117239,-0.014851495,-0.019202394,-0.008441822,0.009844762,-0.004777419,-0.01078019,0.042847168,-0.058904344,0.007037215,0.020178008,-0.026567223,-0.01591825,-0.031382113,0.029072963,-0.039742704,0.003461115
Replication of murine coronavirus defective interfering RNA from negative-strand transcripts.,"The positive-strand defective interfering (DI) RNA of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), when introduced into MHV-infected cells, results in DI RNA replication and accumulation. We studied whether the introduction of negative-strand transcripts of MHV DI RNA would also result in replication. At a location downstream of the T7 promoter and upstream of the human hepatitis delta virus ribozyme domain, we inserted a complete cDNA clone of MHV DI RNA in reverse orientation; in vitro-synthesized RNA from this plasmid yielded a negative-strand RNA copy of the MHV DI RNA. When the negative-strand transcripts of the DI RNA were expressed in MHV-infected cells by a vaccinia virus T7 expression system, positive-strand DI RNAs accumulated in the plasmid-transfected cells. DI RNA replication depended on the expression of T7 polymerase and on the presence of the T7 promoter. Transfection of in vitro-synthesized negative-strand transcripts into MHV-infected cells and serial passage of virus samples from RNA-transfected cells also resulted in accumulation of the DI RNA. Positive-strand DI RNA transcripts were undetectable in sample preparations of the in vitro-synthesized negative-strand DI RNA transcripts, and DI RNA did not accumulate after cotransfection of a small amount of positive-strand DI RNA and truncated-replication-disabled negative-strand transcripts; clearly, the DI RNA replicated from the transfected negative-strand transcripts and not from minute amounts of positive-strand DI RNAs that might be envisioned as artifacts of T7 transcription. Sequence analysis of positive-strand DI RNAs in the cells transfected with negative-strand transcripts showed that DI RNAs maintained the DI-specific unique sequences introduced within the leader sequence. These data indicated that positive-strand DI RNA synthesis occurred from introduced negative-strand transcripts in the MHV-infected cells; this demonstration, using MHV, of DI RNA replication from transfected negative-strand DI RNA transcripts is the first such demonstration among all positive-stranded RNA viruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.232734436,-0.079279781,-0.058026385,0.087048834,0.012074937,-0.187419953,-0.206816829,0.094074198,-0.045761473,-0.102768542,0.047541043,-0.143554293,0.030409911,0.11473397,0.248925531,0.265625531,-0.261819758,0.124436661,0.018804484,-0.038550434,0.048213466,-0.019559174,0.09290895,-0.045406268,0.103939106,0.097378014,-0.028521738,-0.007247667,0.063632299,-0.02772993
Nonhomologous RNA-RNA recombination events at the 3' nontranslated region of the Sindbis virus genome: hot spots and utilization of nonviral sequences.,"The mechanism of RNA-RNA recombination at the 3' nontranslated region (3'NTR) of the Sindbis virus (SIN) genome was studied by using nonreplicative RNA precursors. The 11.7-kb SIN genome was transcribed in vitro as two nonoverlapping RNA fragments. RNA-1 contained the entire 11.4-kb protein coding sequence of SIN and also carried an additional 1.8-kb nonviral sequence at its 3' end. RNA-2 carried the remaining 0.26 or 0.3 kb of the SIN genome containing the 3'NTR. Transfection of these two fragments into BHK cells resulted in vivo RNA-RNA recombination and release of infectious SIN recombinants. Eighteen plaque-purified recombinant viruses were sequenced to precisely map the RNA-RNA crossover sites at the 3'NTR. Sixteen of the 18 recombinants were found to be genetically heterogeneous at the 3'NTR. Two major clustered sites within the 3'NTR of RNA-2 were found to be fused to multiple locations on the nonviral sequence of RNA-1, resulting in insertions of 10 to 1,085 nucleotides at the 3'NTR. Sequence analysis of crossover sites suggested only limited homology and heteroduplex-forming capability between substrate RNAs. Analysis of additional 23 recombinant viruses generated by mutagenized donor and acceptor templates supports the occurrence of recombination hot spots on donor templates. Introduction of a 17-nucleotide rudimentary replicase recognition signal in the acceptor template alone did not induce the polymerase to reinitiate at the 17-nucleotide signal. Interestingly, deletion of a 24-nucleotide hot spot locus on the donor template abolished crossover events at one of the two sites and allowed the polymerase to reinitiate at the 17-nucleotide replicase recognition signal inserted at the acceptor template. The possible roles of RNA-protein and RNA-RNA interactions in the differential regulation of apparent pausing, template selection, and reinitiation are discussed.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.223206974,-0.061982899,-0.055175034,0.086604329,0.065851408,-0.11935523,-0.080780812,0.051688396,-0.063080437,-0.001712421,0.049604092,0.004629964,-0.005571989,-0.022461207,0.033454388,0.044537728,-0.050453264,0.014214131,-0.005735915,-0.020775159,0.012559303,-0.013599409,0.001946969,-0.009319345,-0.052478944,-0.034528021,0.011997322,0.032900232,-0.015271084,0.017777291
Astrovirus ribosomal frameshifting in an infection-transfection transient expression system.,"Different regions of the human astrovirus frameshift signal were cloned into the rhesus rotavirus VP4 gene and evaluated in an infection-transfection transient expression cell culture system. BHK-21 cells, infected with a vaccinia virus that expresses T7 RNA polymerase (vTF7-3), were transfected with the various astrovirus-VP4 constructs. All constructs were driven by a T7 promoter and contained an internal ribosome entry site. Frameshifted and nonframeshifted protein products were immunoprecipitated with VP4 amino- and carboxy-terminal-specific monoclonal antibodies, and their ratios were determined by PhosphorImager analysis. The efficiency of frameshifting was 25 to 28%, significantly greater than the 5 to 7% efficiency reported previously in a cell-free translation system. Coupling of transcription and translation in a cell-free system yielded frameshifting efficiencies threefold greater than that of the uncoupled in vitro system. The presence of the shifty heptamer was an absolute requirement for frameshifting in both cell-free and intact-cell systems, while deletion of the potential downstream pseudoknot region did not affect the efficiency of frameshifting.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.128732668,-0.052486281,0.001603877,-0.07101753,-0.007012736,-0.008877981,-0.057412766,-0.019986823,0.045740693,-0.04800237,-0.089401539,-0.055213047,0.024992372,-0.004986089,0.004290023,-0.022756053,0.019834856,-0.017354155,0.00657835,-0.034240957,0.008032056,-0.031282636,0.001720298,0.006181417,-0.012986824,0.005174939,-0.025404095,0.004606452,-5.06E-05,-0.030659339
cis Requirement for N-specific protein sequence in bovine coronavirus defective interfering RNA replication.,"A naturally occurring 2.2-kb defective interfering (DI) RNA of the bovine coronavirus, structurally a simple fusion of the genomic termini, contains a single contiguous open reading frame (ORF) or 1.7 kb composed of the 5'-terminal 288 nucleotides of polymerase gene 1a and all 1,344 nucleotides of the nucleocapsid protein (N) gene. The ORF must remain open throughout most of its sequence for replication to occur. To determine the qualitative importance of the N portion of the chimeric ORF in DI RNA replication, transcripts of mutated reporter-containing constructs were tested for replication in helper virus-infected cells. It was determined that the N ORF could not be replaced by the naturally occurring internal I protein ORF, accomplished by deleting the first base in the N start codon which leads to a +1 frameshift, nor could it be replaced by the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ORF. Furthermore, 3'-terminal truncations of the N gene leaving less than 85% of its total length were likewise not tolerated. Small in-frame deletions and in-frame foreign sequence insertions of up to 99 nucleotides within certain regions of the N ORF were tolerated, however, but the rate of DI RNA accumulation in these cases was lower. These results indicate that there is a requirement for translation of most if not all of the N protein in cis for optimal replication of the bovine coronavirus DI RNA and suggest that a similar requirement may exist for viral genome replication.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.232530436,-0.071674128,-0.054755402,0.020377832,0.075583562,-0.144638042,-0.229609519,0.045658468,0.020542261,-0.095423231,-0.077610132,-0.102835276,0.06441547,-0.052133693,0.070034598,0.024403069,-0.065664033,0.066403262,0.044145664,0.025586372,0.017979133,-0.019593349,0.008524933,0.005588003,-0.001833329,0.064114494,0.049278255,-0.087413155,0.025850477,-0.048652858
Saccharomyces cerevisiae L-BC double-stranded RNA virus replicase recognizes the L-A positive-strand RNA 3' end.,"L-A and L-BC are two double-stranded RNA viruses present in almost all strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. L-A, the major species, has been extensively characterized with in vitro systems established, but little is known about L-BC. Here we report in vitro template-dependent transcription, replication, and RNA recognition activities of L-BC. The L-BC replicase activity converts positive, single-stranded RNA to double-stranded RNA by synthesis of the complementary RNA strand. Although L-A and L-BC do not interact in vivo, in vitro L-BC virions can replicate the positive, single-stranded RNA of L-A and its satellite, M1, with the same 3' end sequence and stem-loop requirements shown by L-A virions for its own template. However, the L-BC virions do not recognize the internal replication enhancer of the L-A positive strand. In a direct comparison of L-A and L-BC virions, each preferentially recognizes its own RNA for binding, replication, and transcription. These results suggest a close evolutionary relation of these two viruses, consistent with their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence similarities.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.178487566,-0.043826005,-0.048200382,0.079010597,0.006925914,-0.080759561,-0.010335549,0.046848684,-0.051425525,-0.004278266,0.065056204,0.025509243,-0.035151238,0.028994823,0.016959425,0.037407403,-0.007466711,-0.002478312,0.005867544,-0.015917034,-0.030962143,0.015482136,-0.043825369,-0.042737447,-0.033346304,-0.060169192,-0.063984698,0.031995736,0.00547137,-0.003135905
Genesis of Sindbis virus by in vivo recombination of nonreplicative RNA precursors.,"Genetically engineered RNA transcripts coding for various Sindbis virus (SIN) genes were used to study structure and sequence requirements of RNA recombination in BHK cells. Three different groups of RNA transcripts were made: (i) RNAs which retain the ability to replicate and which carry sequences coding for either viral polymerase or viral structural proteins; (ii) RNAs which lack the complete 3' end of the SIN genome and thus are incapable of replicating; and (iii) RNAs which lack the complete 5' end of the SIN genome and also are incapable of replicating. BHK cells were transfected with specific combinations of these precursor RNAs, and virus production and RNA synthetic abilities of the released virus were determined. We demonstrate in vivo generation of infectious SIN by fusion of (i) replicative RNAs to nonreplicative RNAs and (ii) two nonreplicative RNA precursors. Both homologous and nonhomologous types of recombinations were observed. In the homologous type of recombination, a 694-nucleotide overlap at the crossover region of the first pair of precursors resulted in the addition of an A residue converting the UAG stop codon of nonstructural protein P4 to a UAA stop codon. In the nonhomologous type of recombination, the crossover sites contained deletion of up to 76 nucleotides from one of the precursors and complete preservation of junction sequence from the other precursor. This is also the first report that a cytoplasmic RNA virus can be generated from biologically nonreplicative RNA precursors. These results have implications for initiation of viral RNA synthesis and recombination between RNA viral genomes in general. We favor template switching as a mechanism for the fusion events described here and suggest inclusion of polymerase scanning of diverse nonreplicative RNAs as an inherent feature of the copy choice model of RNA recombination. Very importantly, the facile nature of RNA recombination occurring between nonreplicative RNA precursors should speed up the production and analysis of targeted mutants of SIN and possibly other RNA viruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.243401661,-0.075949935,-0.061887713,0.103681868,0.053613501,-0.118816849,-0.084566626,0.053840058,-0.056298847,0.017414225,0.051231542,-0.040515963,0.01421467,0.009978615,0.070390432,0.077625594,-0.099773203,0.01552151,-0.04056322,0.001091383,0.03940671,-0.019392912,-0.003515161,0.022406619,-0.054318905,-0.041781259,0.046709649,0.01132059,-0.029736602,0.007475291
3C-like protease of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus: identification of cleavage sites in the ORF1 polyprotein and analysis of cleavage specificity.,"Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, a positive-stranded RNA virus of the family Caliciviridae, encodes a trypsin-like cysteine protease as part of a large polyprotein. Upon expression in Escherichia coli, the protease releases itself from larger precursors by proteolytic cleavages at its N and C termini. Both cleavage sites were determined by N-terminal sequence analysis of the cleavage products. Cleavage at the N terminus of the protease occurred with high efficiency at an EG dipeptide at positions 1108 and 1109. Cleavage at the C terminus of the protease occurred with low efficiency at an ET dipeptide at positions 1251 and 1252. To study the cleavage specificity of the protease, amino acid substitutions were introduced at the P2, P1, and P1' positions at the cleavage site at the N-terminal boundary of the protease. This analysis showed that the amino acid at the P1 position is the most important determinant for substrate recognition. Only glutamic acid, glutamine, and aspartic acid were tolerated at this position. At the P1' position, glycine, serine, and alanine were the preferred substrates of the protease, but a number of amino acids with larger side chains were also tolerated. Substitutions at the P2 position had only little effect on the cleavage efficiency. Cell-free expression of the C-terminal half of the ORF1 polyprotein showed that the protease catalyzes cleavage at the junction of the RNA polymerase and the capsid protein. An EG dipeptide at positions 1767 and 1768 was identified as the putative cleavage site. Our data show that rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus encodes a trypsin-like cysteine protease that is similar to 3C proteases with regard to function and specificity but is more similar to 2A proteases with regard to size.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.129127176,-0.043284466,-0.009043327,-0.050826072,0.006181804,-0.001074879,-0.049385848,-0.013219159,0.028199929,-0.043688111,-0.069855172,0.032064544,0.015078729,-0.107464807,-0.0435004,-0.074384584,0.076020094,0.016991503,0.028634196,-0.003013623,-0.013916398,-0.022578241,-0.017541894,-0.034416842,0.05231681,0.093743299,-0.007452691,-0.016132074,-0.036850777,-0.05200671
Investigation of the control of coronavirus subgenomic mRNA transcription by using T7-generated negative-sense RNA transcripts.,"The subgenomic mRNAs of the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) are not produced in equimolar amounts. We have developed a reporter gene system to investigate the control of this differential subgenomic mRNA synthesis. Transcription of mRNAs by the TGEV polymerase was obtained from negative-sense RNA templates generated in situ from DNA containing a T7 promoter. A series of gene cassettes was produced; these cassettes comprised the reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene downstream of transcription-associated sequences (TASs) (also referred to as intergenic sequences and promoters) believed to be involved in the synthesis of TGEV subgenomic mRNAs 6 and 7. The gene cassettes were designed so that negative-sense RNA copies of the CAT gene with sequences complementary to the TGEV TASs, or modified versions, at the 3' end would be synthesized in situ by T7 RNA polymerase. Using this system, we have demonstrated that CAT was expressed from mRNAs derived from the T7-generated negative-sense RNA transcripts only in TGEV-infected cells and only from transcripts possessing a TGEV negative-sense TAS. Analysis of the CAT mRNAs showed the presence of the TGEV leader RNA sequence at the 5' end, in keeping with observations that all coronavirus mRNAs have a 5' leader sequence corresponding to the 5' end of the genomic RNA. Our results indicated that the CAT mRNAs were transcribed from the in situ-synthesized negative-sense RNA templates without the requirement of TGEV genomic 5' or 3' sequences on the T7-generated negative-sense transcripts (3'-TAS-CAT-5'). Modification of the TGEV TASs indicated (i) that the degree of potential base pairing between the 3' end of the leader RNA and the TGEV negative-sense TAS was not the sole determinant of the amount of subgenomic mRNA transcribed and (ii) that other factors, including nucleotides flanking the TAS, are involved in the regulation of transcription of TGEV subgenomic mRNAs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.183576462,-0.041431843,0.003706518,-0.018463893,0.048790783,-0.093115717,-0.147040753,0.037715257,-0.010783214,-0.089175115,-0.007647551,-0.060196067,0.017324299,0.017208898,0.056902367,0.03077372,-0.04658297,0.008731748,-0.003117787,0.016087575,-0.008066689,0.014240345,-0.003350897,-0.000807036,0.011897005,-0.079498681,-0.027951676,-0.003308625,0.092192582,0.045591803
Characterization of a human coronavirus (strain 229E) 3C-like proteinase activity.,"The RNA polymerase gene of human coronavirus (HCV) 229E encodes a large polyprotein that contains domains with motifs characteristic of both papain-like cysteine proteinases and proteinases with homology to the 3C proteinase of picornaviruses. In this study, we have, first, expressed the putative HCV 229E 3C-like proteinase domain as part of a beta-galactosidase fusion protein in Escherichia coli and have shown that the expressed protein has proteolytic activity. The substitution of one amino acid within the predicted proteinase domain (His-3006-->Asp-3006) abolishes, or at least significantly reduces, this activity. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of a purified, 34-kDa cleavage product shows that the bacterial fusion protein is cleaved at the dipeptide Gln-2965-Ala-2966, which is the predicted amino-terminal end of the putative 3C-like proteinase domain. Second, we have confirmed the proteolytic activity of a bacterially expressed polypeptide with the amino acid sequence of the predicted HCV 229E 3C-like proteinase by trans cleavage of an in vitro translated polypeptide encoded within open reading frame 1b of the RNA polymerase gene. Finally, using fusion protein-specific antiserum, we have identified a 34-kDa, 3C-like proteinase polypeptide in HCV 229E-infected MRC-5 cells. This polypeptide can be detected as early as 3 to 5 h postinfection but is present in the infected cell in very low amounts. These data contribute to the characterization of the 3C-like proteinase activity of HCV 229E.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.175514169,-0.058646697,-0.041849547,-0.035141093,0.025485685,-0.031145782,-0.078175915,-0.022070357,0.067313785,-0.071946721,-0.131543607,0.091401967,0.086576413,-0.056971228,-0.102779135,-0.136912673,0.135055882,0.115246994,0.204866412,-0.055600549,-0.06559015,-0.022895073,0.068047484,-0.02406696,0.026004948,0.077879569,-0.041117155,0.026815267,-0.096781708,-0.065593657
Formation of brome mosaic virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in yeast requires coexpression of viral proteins and viral RNA.,"In this report we show that yeast expressing brome mosaic virus (BMV) replication proteins 1a and 2a and replicating a BMV RNA3 derivative can be extracted to yield a template-dependent BMV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) able to synthesize (-)-strand RNA from BMV (+)-strand RNA templates added in vitro. This virus-specific yeast-derived RdRp mirrored the template selectivity and other characteristics of RdRp from BMV-infected plants. Equivalent extracts from yeast expressing 1a and 2a but lacking RNA3 contained normal amounts of 1a and 2a but had no RdRp activity on BMV RNAs added in vitro. To determine which RNA3 sequences were required in vivo to yield RdRp activity, we tested deletions throughout RNA3, including the 5',3', and intercistronic noncoding regions, which contain the cis-acting elements required for RNA3 replication in vivo. RdRp activity was obtained only from cells expressing 1a, 2a, and RNA3 derivatives retaining both 3' and intercistronic noncoding sequences. Strong correlation between extracted RdRp activity and BMV (-)-strand RNA accumulation in vivo was found for all RNA3 derivatives tested. Thus, extractable in vitro RdRp activity paralleled formation of a complex capable of viral RNA synthesis in vivo. The results suggest that assembly of active RdRp requires not only viral proteins but also viral RNA, either to directly contribute some nontemplate function or to recruit essential host factors into the RdRp complex and that sequences at both the 3'-terminal initiation site and distant internal sites of RNA3 templates may participate in RdRp assembly and initiation of (-)-strand synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.224257688,-0.058568404,-0.091453761,0.113120413,-0.064180862,-0.088094582,0.036995635,0.044855696,-0.064625502,0.004366177,0.126422939,0.118566615,-0.117294847,0.019907166,-0.035157996,0.023450457,0.046075917,-0.049953999,0.009363923,-0.067048421,0.004222395,-0.010153179,0.024438092,-0.114263203,0.015849455,-0.021599413,-0.069568849,0.060962067,0.050088832,0.049649372

SUBJECTS--108 Children aged 9-11 years who had reported wheeze or cough, or both, in a questionnaire. SETTING--Southampton and surrounding community. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Upper and lower respiratory viral infections detected by polymerase chain reaction or conventional methods, reported exacerbations of asthma, computer identified episodes of respiratory tract symptoms or peak flow reductions. RESULTS--Viruses were detected in 80% of reported episodes of reduced peak expiratory flow, 80% of reported episodes of wheeze, and in 85% of reported episodes of upper respiratory symptoms, cough, wheeze, and a fall in peak expiratory flow. The median duration of reported falls in peak expiratory flow was 14 days, and the median maximum fall in peak expiratory flow was 81 l/min. The most commonly identified virus type was rhinovirus. CONCLUSIONS--This study supports the hypothesis that upper respiratory viral infections are associated with 80-85% of asthma exacerbations in school age children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.13815571,-0.075802765,-0.060940697,-0.028593722,0.001180291,-0.072439793,0.059620778,-0.031255748,0.037470876,0.02093439,-0.008326122,-0.019506703,-0.00949922,-0.038703464,0.040978532,0.021019861,-0.008468234,-0.096771023,0.06408724,-0.008813144,-0.019042081,-0.1235993,-0.07110715,0.060979346,0.020288034,0.089549327,-0.057501962,0.011172421,0.095396892,0.052701359
A cis-acting function for the coronavirus leader in defective interfering RNA replication.,"To test the hypothesis that the 65-nucleotide (nt) leader on subgenomic mRNAs suffices as a 5'-terminal cis-acting signal for RNA replication, a corollary to the notion that coronavirus mRNAs behave as replicons, synthetic RNA transcripts of a cloned, reporter-containing N mRNA (mRNA 7) of the bovine coronavirus with a precise 5' terminus and a 3' poly(A) of 68 nt were tested for replication after being transfected into helper virus-infected cells. No replication was observed, but synthetic transcripts of a cloned reporter-containing defective interfering (DI) RNA differing from the N mRNA construct by 433 nt of continuous 5'-proximal genomic sequence between the leader and the N open reading frame did replicate and become packaged, indicating the insufficiency of the leader alone as a 5' signal for replication of transfected RNA molecules. The leader was shown to be a necessary part of the cis-acting signal for DI RNA replication, however, since removal of terminal bases that destroyed a predicted intraleader stem-loop also destroyed replicating ability. Surprisingly, when the same stem-loop was disrupted by base substitutions, replication appeared only minimally impaired and the leader was found to have rapidly reverted to wild type during DI RNA replication, a phenomenon reminiscent of high-frequency leader switching in the mouse hepatitis coronavirus. These results suggest that once a minimal structural requirement for leader is fulfilled for initiation of DI RNA replication, the wild-type leader is strongly preferred for subsequent replication. They also demonstrate that, in contrast to reported natural mouse hepatitis coronavirus DI RNAs, the DI RNA of the bovine coronavirus does not require sequence elements originating from discontinuous downstream regions within the polymerase gene for replication or for packaging.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.266819136,-0.077163688,-0.071823919,0.072136807,0.024796701,-0.171353901,-0.203003264,0.071950746,-0.023655632,-0.108360267,0.001198154,-0.117954119,0.048356161,0.038184234,0.159056464,0.191363032,-0.199199649,0.111329305,0.011483821,-0.01916207,0.065825062,-0.017522842,0.039304619,0.021242639,0.083889196,0.002928195,-0.03029884,-0.008224457,0.132095105,-0.047867283
Genetics of mouse hepatitis virus transcription: evidence that subgenomic negative strands are functional templates.,"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants belonging to complementation group C were characterized and mapped by standard genetic recombination techniques. Temperature shift experiments early in infection suggested that the group C allele can be divided into two phenotypically distinct subgroups, designated C1 and C2. Since previous data indicated that the group C1 mutants probably contained an early defect which affects negative-strand synthesis, RNA synthesis was further examined by analyzing replicative-form (RF) RNA. Full-length as well as subgenomic-length RF RNAs were radiolabeled from 3 to 12 h postinfection (p.i.) and labeled late in infection after shift to the nonpermissive temperature (39.5 degrees C). The relative percent molar ratios of each mRNA and corresponding RF RNA were roughly equivalent throughout infection. Temperature shift experiments at 5.5 or 6.0 h p.i. resulted in an 83 to 92% reduction in the amount of total RF RNA at 39.5 degrees C. Radiolabeling time course experiments after temperature shift to 39.5 degrees C also demonstrated incorporation (6 to 9 h p.i.) into both subgenomic-length and full-length RF RNAs, suggesting that previously transcribed negative strands were functional templates throughout infection. To determine if the reduction in RF RNA was due to a decrease in positive- or negative-strand RNA synthesis, rates of mRNA synthesis were calculated from both full-length and subgenomic-length templates. The rate of mRNA synthesis after the shift was increased at 39.5 degrees C compared with that at 32 degrees C regardless of the template used; however, transcription rates calculated from subgenomic-length templates were similar to those of other viral and eukaryotic polymerases. These findings support the notion that the group C1 allele regulates negative-strand RNA synthesis and strongly suggest that the subgenomic negative-strand RNAs are probably the predominant functional templates for the synthesis of positive-strand RNAs late in infection.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.143093186,-0.054607733,-0.051919377,0.030899757,-0.008169109,-0.10864751,-0.063194975,0.058767084,-0.062178204,-0.044265025,0.052967349,-0.016636492,-0.018523177,0.042199412,0.045255244,0.099612319,-0.06383201,0.007246014,-0.010386988,-0.019039571,-0.028486047,-0.03032542,-0.018094601,-0.053954502,-0.001848586,-0.063555363,-0.050253203,0.00332215,0.008730135,0.022465226
Map locations of mouse hepatitis virus temperature-sensitive mutants: confirmation of variable rates of recombination.,"Using standard genetic recombination techniques, studies in our laboratory suggest that recombination rates are very high and vary in different portions of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genome. To determine the actual recombination frequencies in the MHV genome and localize the nucleotide boundaries of individual viral genes, we have sequenced temperature-sensitive and revertant viruses to identify the location of specific mutant alleles. Complementation group F RNA+ ts mutants (LA7, NC6, and NC16) each contained a unique mutation which was tightly linked to the ts phenotype and resulted in a conservative or nonconservative amino acid change in the MHV S glycoprotein gene. In agreement with previous recombination mapping studies, the mutation in LA7 and NC6 mapped within the S1 domain while NC16 mapped within the S2 domain. To determine the map coordinates of the MHV polymerase genes, several RNA- mutants and their revertants belonging to complementation groups C (NC3 and LA9) and E (LA18 and NC4) were also sequenced. Mutations were identified in each virus that were tightly linked to the ts phenotype and resulted in either a conservative or nonconservative amino acid change. The group C allele spanned the ORF 1a/ORF 1b junction, while the group E mutants mapped at the C terminus of ORF 1b about 20 to 22 kb from the 5' end of the genome. Mutation rates, calculated from the reversion frequencies of plaque-purified ts viruses requiring a single nucleotide alteration for reversion, approached 1.32 (+/- 0.89) x 10(-4) substitutions per nucleotide site per round of template copying. Detailed recombination mapping studies across known distances between these different ts alleles has confirmed that homologous recombination rates approached 25% and varied within different portions of the MHV genome.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14220369,-0.054340357,-0.016869177,-0.004365181,0.089880015,-0.050985748,-0.074685537,0.02446635,-0.030873203,-0.005158586,-0.018040679,-0.003701662,0.006142039,-0.074739019,0.038634219,0.028746598,-0.080166026,0.017762,-0.040274831,-0.002834016,0.074766051,-0.106925091,0.048915298,0.111583512,-0.020191445,0.070287408,0.07004588,-0.059593731,-0.135136462,-0.075446001
"Analysis of astrovirus serotype 1 RNA, identification of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase motif, and expression of a viral structural protein.","We report the results from sequence analysis and expression studies of the gastroenteritis agent astrovirus serotype 1. We have cloned and sequenced 5,944 nucleotides (nt) of the estimated 7.2-kb RNA genome and have identified three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF-3, at the 3' end, is 2,361 nt in length and is fully encoded in both the genomic and subgenomic viral RNAs. Expression of ORF-3 in vitro yields an 87-kDa protein that is immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody specific for viral capsids. This protein comigrates with an authentic 87-kDa astrovirus protein immunoprecipitated from infected cells, indicating that this region encodes a viral structural protein. The adjacent upstream ORF (ORF-2) is 1,557 nt in length and contains a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase motif. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase motifs from four astrovirus serotypes are compared. Partial sequence (2,018 nt) of the most 5' ORF (ORF-1) reveals a 3C-like serine protease motif. The ORF-1 sequence is incomplete. These results indicate that the astrovirus genome is organized with nonstructural proteins encoded at the 5' end and structural proteins at the 3' end. ORF-2 has no start methionine and is in the -1 frame compared with ORF-1.

An 'elaborated' pseudoknot is required for high frequency frameshifting during translation of HCV 229E polymerase mRNA.,"The RNA polymerase gene (gene 1) of the human coronavirus 229E is approximately 20 kb in length and is located at the 5' end of the positive-strand genomic RNA. The coding sequence of gene 1 is divided into two large open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, that overlap by 43 nucleotides. In the region of the ORF1a/ORF1b overlap, the genomic RNA displays two elements that are known to mediate (-1) ribosomal frameshifting. These are the slippery sequence, UUUAAAC, and a 3' pseudoknot structure. By introducing site-specific mutations into synthetic mRNAs, we have analysed the predicted structure of the HCV 229E pseudoknot and shown that besides the well-known stem structures, S1 and S2, a third stem structure, S3, is required for a high frequency of frameshifting. The requirement for an S3 stem is independent of the length of loop 2.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.198482517,-0.048074161,-0.033622741,0.009697904,0.114108774,-0.116322317,-0.1402114,0.055430672,0.011674929,-0.073358222,-0.097897174,0.040898324,0.073912361,-0.109901212,-0.068120605,-0.042743278,0.039204851,0.085655529,0.046032462,-0.066228844,-0.040061484,-0.061306029,-0.040673047,0.044675165,-0.102242548,-0.126328055,-0.044849561,0.044088742,0.090747748,-0.112143099
A translation-attenuating intraleader open reading frame is selected on coronavirus mRNAs during persistent infection.,"Short open reading frames within the 5' leader of some eukaryotic mRNAs are known to regulate the rate of translation initiation on the downstream open reading frame. By employing the polymerase chain reaction, we learned that the 5'-terminal 5 nt on the common leader sequence of bovine coronavirus subgenomic mRNAs were heterogeneous and hypervariable throughout early infection in cell culture and that as a persistent infection became established, termini giving rise to a common 33-nt intraleader open reading frame were selected. Since the common leader is derived from the genomic 5' end during transcription, a common focus of origin for the heterogeneity is expected. The intraleader open reading frame was shown by in vitro translation studies to attenuate translation of downstream open reading frames in a cloned bovine coronavirus mRNA molecule. Selection of an intraleader open reading frame resulting in a general attenuation of mRNA translation and a consequent attenuation of virus replication may, therefore, be a mechanism by which coronaviruses and possibly other RNA viruses with a similar transcriptional strategy maintain a persistent infection.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.147249359,-0.059962351,-0.039939394,-0.021991706,0.077199313,-0.091059733,-0.141232819,0.044889645,0.022484812,-0.083137088,-0.103334996,-0.083996017,0.087244334,-0.068701119,0.006591699,-0.03143363,0.017977169,0.026730572,0.010833123,0.007322624,0.010923896,-0.009733181,-0.060380564,0.037751728,-0.029226656,-0.074034782,-0.010841805,-0.022633871,0.111185545,-0.059076885
Deletion mapping of a mouse hepatitis virus defective interfering RNA reveals the requirement of an internal and discontiguous sequence for replication.,"All of the defective interfering (DI) RNAs of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) contain both the 5' and 3' ends of the viral genomic RNA, which presumably include the cis sequences required for RNA replication. To define the replication signal of MHV RNA, we have used a vaccinia virus-T7 polymerase-transcribed MHV DI RNA to study the effects of sequence deletion on DI RNA replication. Following infection of susceptible cells with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase, various cDNA clones derived from a DI RNA (DIssF) of the JHM strain of MHV, which is a 3.5-kb naturally occurring DI RNA, behind a T7 promoter were transfected. On superinfection with a helper MHV, the ability of various DI RNAs to replicate was determined. Serial deletions from the middle of the RNA toward both the 5' and 3' ends demonstrated that 859 nucleotides from the 5' end and 436 nucleotides from the 3' end of the MHV RNA genome were necessary for RNA replication. Surprisingly, an additional stretch of 135 nucleotides located at 3.1 to 3.3 kb from the 5' end of the genome was also required. This stretch is discontiguous from the 5'-end cis replication signal and is present in all of the naturally occurring DI RNAs studied so far. The requirement for a long stretch of 5'- and 3'-end sequences predicts that the subgenomic MHV mRNAs cannot replicate. The efficiency of RNA replication varied with different cDNA constructs, suggesting possible interaction between different regions of DI RNA. The identification of MHV RNA replication signals allowed the construction of an MHV DI-based expression vector, which can express foreign genes, such as the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.283019139,-0.087558897,-0.072349515,0.105273457,0.041032447,-0.197910435,-0.227424094,0.079367433,-0.030683841,-0.078801835,0.011846154,-0.162613732,0.062810253,0.062880174,0.228318996,0.238536247,-0.266341217,0.14159915,0.013185169,-0.008023055,0.069086815,-0.036075739,0.118685506,0.020021352,0.130718249,0.123152069,0.019442774,-0.040348352,0.032741608,-0.005228281
Spontaneous mutagenesis of a plant potyvirus genome after insertion of a foreign gene.,"The RNA genome of tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) was engineered to express bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) fused to the virus helper component proteinase (HC-Pro). It was shown previously that prolonged periods (approximately 1 month) of TEV-GUS propagation in plants resulted in the appearance of spontaneous deletion variants. Nine deletion mutants were identified by nucleotide sequence analysis of 40 cDNA clones obtained after polymerase chain reaction amplification. The mutants were missing between 1,741 and 2,074 nucleotides from TEV-GUS, including the sequences coding for most of GUS and the N-terminal region of HC-Pro. This region of HC-Pro contains determinants involved in helper component activity during aphid transmission, as well as a highly conserved series of cysteine residues. The deletion variants were shown to replicate and move systemically without the aid of a helper virus. Infectious viruses harboring the two largest HC-Pro deletions (termed TEV-2del and TEV-7del) were reconstructed by subcloning the corresponding mutated regions into full-length DNA copies of the TEV genome. Characterization of these and additional variants derived by site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that deletion of sequences coding for the HC-Pro N-terminal domain had a negative effect on accumulation of viral RNA and coat protein. The TEV-2del variant possessed an aphid-nontransmissible phenotype that could be rescued partially by prefeeding of aphids on active HC-Pro from another potyvirus. These data suggest that the N-terminal domain of HC-Pro or its coding sequence enhances virus replication or genome expression but does not provide an activity essential for these processes. The function of this domain, as well as a proposed deletion mechanism involving nonhomologous recombination, is discussed.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.130615168,-0.041218629,-0.0164002,-0.022297223,0.006535669,-0.015123542,-0.035129139,0.000126179,-0.003130082,-0.018620108,-0.018514982,0.015989734,-0.001389178,-0.055067408,-0.002736022,-0.001562216,-0.005458047,0.000367182,-0.011324072,-0.007658401,0.020778784,-0.028392203,0.016591378,0.011610099,-0.004487251,0.02844286,0.005271531,0.001753509,-0.009767076,-0.013668056
"ADA3: a gene, identified by resistance to GAL4-VP16, with properties similar to and different from those of ADA2.","We describe the isolation of a yeast gene, ADA3, mutations in which prevent the toxicity of GAL4-VP16 in vivo. Toxicity was previously proposed to be due to the trapping of general transcription factors required at RNA polymerase II promoters (S. L. Berger, B. Piña, N. Silverman, G. A. Marcus, J. Agapite, J. L. Regier, S. J. Triezenberg, and L. Guarente, Cell 70:251-265, 1992). trans activation by VP16 as well as the acidic activation domain of GCN4 is reduced in the mutant. Other activation domains, such as those of GAL4 and HAP4, are only slightly affected in the mutant. This spectrum is similar to that observed for mutants with lesions in ADA2, a gene proposed to encode a transcriptional adaptor. The ADA3 gene is not absolutely essential for cell growth, but gene disruption mutants grow slowly and are temperature sensitive. Strains doubly disrupted for ada2 and ada3 grow no more slowly than single mutants, providing further evidence that these genes function in the same pathway. Selection of initiation sites by the general transcriptional machinery in vitro is altered in the ada3 mutant, providing a clue that ADA3 could be a novel general transcription factor involved in the response to acidic activators.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.133731409,-0.038259155,-0.004648414,-0.060237354,-0.020555962,0.023748924,-0.020728956,-0.020135195,0.033442373,-0.016706054,-0.040741684,-0.006633948,-0.019490277,0.025706168,-0.017352807,0.011656167,0.000438362,-0.043872508,-0.050252062,-0.015483745,0.04840006,-0.023934765,-0.002145017,0.028877226,-0.015225272,-0.027835073,0.00198833,0.016654446,0.010744438,-0.059028105
The signal for translational readthrough of a UGA codon in Sindbis virus RNA involves a single cytidine residue immediately downstream of the termination codon.,"The nucleotide sequences surrounding termination codons influence the efficiency of translational readthrough. In this report, we examined the sequence requirement for efficient readthrough of the UGA codon in the Sindbis virus genomic RNA which regulates production of the putative viral RNA polymerase, nsP4. The UGA codon and its neighboring nucleotide sequences were subcloned into a heterologous coding context, and readthrough efficiency was measured by cell-free translation of RNA transcripts in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The CUA codon immediately downstream of the UGA codon was found to be sufficient for efficient translational readthrough. Further mutagenesis of residues in the CUA triplet demonstrated that mutations at the second or third residues following the UGA codon (U and A, respectively) had little effect on readthrough efficiency. In contrast, replacement of the cytidine residue immediately downstream of the UGA codon with any of the other three nucleotides (U, A, or G) dramatically reduced the readthrough efficiency from approximately 10% to less than 1%. These results show that a simple sequence context can allow efficient readthrough of UGA codons in a mammalian translation system. Interestingly, compilation studies of nucleotide sequences surrounding eukaryotic termination codons indicate a strong bias against cytidine residues immediately 3' to UGA termination codons. Taken together with our results, this bias may reflect a selective pressure for efficient translation termination for most eukaryotic gene products.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.12255377,-0.043245772,-0.009526124,-0.036388201,0.013284938,-0.023039825,-0.044431761,0.018382479,-0.005760192,-0.038558258,-0.033136891,0.000968401,-0.008515633,-0.073196156,-0.017022148,-0.000769333,0.010029545,-0.009675759,-0.030863649,-0.032544088,-0.00281602,-0.024124389,-0.038978665,0.011600715,-0.048296421,-0.049752867,-0.005793913,0.004033372,0.059114752,-0.045767711
Definition of a subset of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells that are permissive to human cytomegalovirus infection.,"The identity of cells responsible for transmission of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in blood products or bone marrow transplants is unknown. We have tested the capacity of HCMV to in vitro infect human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors and found that certain PBMC are permissive to HCMV infection. In vitro-infected viable cells were double stained for surface expression of different HMCV proteins and for cell-type-specific antigens to allow the identification of sensitive cells. All analysis were performed on viable cells, using HCMV-specific monoclonal antibodies and automated flow cytofluorimetry. PBMC were infected either with the laboratory-adapted HCMV strain AD169 or with a virus isolate obtained from a viremic patient. Up to 25% of all PBMC could express the major immediate-early antigen as well as the pp65 antigen, known at the lower matrix protein. Infected cells were mainly CD14+ monocytes, but also a small population of large CD8+ cells were susceptible to HCMV infection. CD19+ B lymphocytes were resistant to HCMV infection. Different populations of infected cells were enriched by using Dynabeads coated with cell-type-specific antibodies, and the presence of infectious virus was demonstrated by incubating the selected and sonicated cell material on human fibroblasts. Only material from infected monocytes and from CD3+ CD8+ cells gave rise to HCMV-specific plaques. The presence of HCMV mRNA as a sign of active viral transcription of the major immediate-early and late pp150 genes in infected cells was demonstrated by using nested reversed polymerase chain reaction. A common denominator was found for all cells that could be infected with HCMV. The CD13 antigen, a 130- to 150-kDa integral membrane protein identical to the enzyme aminopeptidase N, was expressed on all HCMV-permissive cells.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.083745497,-0.033033667,0.00996037,-0.087706844,-0.066355892,0.044446147,0.012646564,-0.045282293,0.06858751,-0.023713367,-0.037367899,-0.063136459,0.02651032,0.106438121,0.032380982,0.009114678,-0.013199748,-0.025805345,0.000755017,0.02364488,0.034812926,0.019098799,0.024886059,-0.006322808,0.025150873,0.031580225,-0.021929835,0.029861587,-0.076351473,0.011959344
Structural requirements for efficient translational frameshifting in the synthesis of the putative viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of potato leafroll virus.,"The putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of potato leafroll luteovirus (PLRV) is expressed by -1 ribosomal frameshifting in the region where the open reading frames (ORF) of proteins 2a and 2b overlap. The signal responsible for efficient frameshift is composed of the slippery site UUUAAAU followed by a sequence that has the potential to adopt two alternative folding patterns, either a structure involving a pseudoknot, or a simple stem-loop structure. To investigate the structure requirements for efficient frameshifting, mutants in the stem-loop or in the potential pseudoknot regions of a Polish isolate of PLRV (PLRV-P) have been analyzed. Mutations that are located in the second stem (S2) of the potential pseudoknot structure, but are located in unpaired regions of the alternative stem-loop structure, reduce frameshift efficiency. Deletion of the 3' end sequence of the alternative stem-loop structure does not reduce frameshift efficiency. Our results confirm that -1 frameshift in the overlap region depends on the slippery site and on the downstream positioned sequence, and propose that in PLRV-P a pseudoknot is required for efficient frameshifting. These results are in agreement with those recently published for the closely related beet western yellows luteovirus (BWYV).",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.155819603,-0.045070916,-0.008578684,-0.017385261,0.053131839,-0.067876601,-0.08599101,0.03462285,-0.009223099,-0.075896691,-0.092199639,0.028284976,0.009290853,-0.147324865,-0.064977037,-0.040556585,0.047233338,0.028368622,-0.036416083,-0.048114098,-0.018476647,-0.075533861,-0.084126537,0.044196559,-0.052454354,-0.082671958,-0.048696733,0.045375099,0.12353837,-0.128612863
Several members of the mouse carcinoembryonic antigen-related glycoprotein family are functional receptors for the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus-A59.,"Mouse hepatitis virus-A59 (MHV-A59), a murine coronavirus, can utilize as a cellular receptor MHVR, a murine glycoprotein in the biliary glycoprotein (BGP) subfamily of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family in the immunoglobulin superfamily (G.S. Dveksler, M. N. Pensiero, C. B. Cardellichio, R. K. Williams, G.-S. Jiang, K. V. Holmes, and C. W. Dieffenbach, J. Virol. 65:6881-6891, 1991). Several different BGP isoforms are expressed in tissues of different mouse strains, and we have explored which of these glycoproteins can serve as functional receptors for MHV-A59. cDNA cloning, RNA-mediated polymerase chain reaction analysis, and Western immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody, CC1, specific for the N-terminal domain of MHVR showed that the inbred mouse strains BALB/c, C3H, and C57BL/6 expressed transcripts and proteins of the MHVR isoform and/or its splice variants but not the mmCGM2 isoform. In contrast, adult SJL/J mice, which are resistant to infection with MHV-A59, express transcripts and proteins only of the mmCGM2-related isoforms, not MHVR. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that the MHVR and mmCGM2 glycoproteins may be encoded by different alleles of the same gene. We studied binding of anti-MHVR antibodies or MHV-A59 virions to proteins encoded by transcripts of MHVR and mmCGM2 and two splice variants of MHVR, one containing two immunoglobulin-like domains [MHVR(2d)] and the other with four domains as in MHVR but with a longer cytoplasmic domain [MHVR(4d)L]. We found that the three isoforms tested could serve as functional receptors for MHV-A59, although only isoforms that include the N-terminal domain of MHVR were recognized by monoclonal antibody CC1 in immunoblots or by MHV-A59 virions in virus overlay protein blot assays. Thus, in addition to MHVR, both the two-domain isoforms, mmCGM2 and MHVR(2d), and the MHVR(4d)L isoform served as functional virus receptors for MHV-A59. This is the first report of multiple related glycoprotein isoforms that can serve as functional receptors for a single enveloped virus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.095791443,-0.0367289,-0.002968057,-0.055075624,0.001681751,-0.000236001,-0.043448066,-0.005305,0.024916217,-0.046172508,-0.039817117,-0.016102809,0.010025212,-0.020900277,0.030331854,0.027952945,-0.01575611,0.015548004,-0.013389233,0.000105452,0.024257426,-0.022774546,0.033121807,0.007297247,0.099217047,0.093970173,-0.002076879,-0.020678682,-0.030815536,-0.00537437
Mutagenic analysis of the coronavirus intergenic consensus sequence.,"Previously, a system in which an intergenic region from mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) inserted into an MHV defective interfering (DI) RNA led to transcription of a subgenomic DI RNA in helper virus-infected cells was established. In the present study, a DI cDNA containing one UCUAAAC consensus sequence in the middle of the 0.3-kb-long intergenic region located between genes 6 and 7 was constructed. From this DI cDNA clone, 21 mutant DI RNAs were constructed so that each of the seven consensus sequence nucleotides was changed individually to the three alternative bases. These mutants were used to define how changes in the integrity of MHV transcription consensus sequence UCUAAAC affected mRNA transcription. Except for two mutants with the sequences UGUAAAC and UCGAAAC, all of the mutants supported efficient subgenomic DI RNA transcription. This indicated that MHV transcription regulation was sufficiently flexible to recognize altered consensus sequences. Next, these and other mutants were used to examine the leader-body fusion site on the subgenomic DI RNAs. Sequence analysis demonstrated that all subgenomic DI RNAs analyzed contained two pentanucleotide sequences; the first sequence seemed to be contributed by the leader, and the leader-body fusion most likely took place at either the first or the second nucleotide of the second sequence. This observation was not consistent with the proposed coronavirus transcription model (S. C. Baker and M. M. C. Lai, EMBO J. 9:4173-4179, 1990) which states that nucleotide mismatch can be corrected by RNA polymerase proofreading activity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.216971047,-0.074265328,-0.03062815,0.022631834,0.094302174,-0.156659991,-0.249285457,0.073316941,-0.018387954,-0.1175271,-0.033086563,-0.133396746,0.071467726,-0.013908167,0.205218082,0.208779182,-0.251630327,0.147454873,-0.028589223,-0.03651068,0.108184404,-0.064860151,0.104770014,0.060741898,0.125990738,0.1028012,0.031564438,-0.018098392,0.103834606,-0.033282309
Mouse hepatitis virus utilizes two carcinoembryonic antigens as alternative receptors.,"The cellular receptor for the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) has been identified as a member of the murine carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family (R. K. Williams, G. S. Jiang, and K. V. Holmes, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:5533-5536, 1991). However, the receptor protein was not detected in some of the susceptible mouse tissues. We therefore examined whether other types of MHV receptor might exist. By polymerase chain reaction with the conserved sequences of murine CEA gene family members (mmCGM) as primers, we detected two CEA-encoding RNAs in the mouse liver. One of them (1.3 kb) encodes mmCGM1, which has previously been identified as the receptor for MHV, and the other one (0.8 kb) was shown to encode another member of mouse CGM, mmCGM2. The sequence analysis showed that mmCGM2 lacks 564 nucleotides in the middle of the gene compared with mmCGM1. These two CEA transcripts are probably derived from the same gene by an alternative splicing mechanism. Expression of either of these cDNA clones in COS-7 cells rendered these cells susceptible to MHV infection, suggesting that not only mmCGM1 but also mmCGM2 serves as a receptor for MHV. The mmCGM2 was the major CEA species in the mouse brain, which is a main target organ for the neurotropic strains of MHV. Very little mmCGM1 was detected in the mouse brain or in cells of the susceptible mouse astrocytoma cell line DBT. This result indicates that MHV may utilize different CEA molecules as the major receptor in the mouse brain and in the liver. This is a first identification of multiple receptors for a single virus. The presence of different receptors in different tissues may explain the target cell specificity of certain MHVs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.114145952,-0.034124295,0.008425572,-0.069655999,0.034182865,-0.01295942,-0.073356541,-0.007044848,0.037509253,-0.057162242,-0.068638226,-0.071161835,0.035494998,0.016159296,0.059313913,0.046470104,-0.061946381,0.035119465,-0.005936246,-0.010978746,0.066024553,-0.023809464,0.0594183,0.069604702,0.10357938,0.115066241,0.013110002,-0.021117481,-0.035175507,-0.017829473
RNA recombination in a coronavirus: recombination between viral genomic RNA and transfected RNA fragments.,"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus, has been shown to undergo a high frequency of RNA recombination both in tissue culture and in animal infection. So far, RNA recombination has been demonstrated only between genomic RNAs of two coinfecting viruses. To understand the mechanism of RNA recombination and to further explore the potential of RNA recombination, we studied whether recombination could occur between a replicating MHV RNA and transfected RNA fragments. We first used RNA fragments which represented the 5' end of genomic-sense sequences of MHV RNA for transfection. By using polymerase chain reaction amplification with two specific primers, we were able to detect recombinant RNAs which incorporated the transfected fragment into the 5' end of the viral RNA in the infected cells. Surprisingly, even the anti-genomic-sense RNA fragments complementary to the 5' end of MHV genomic RNA could also recombine with the MHV genomic RNAs. This observation suggests that RNA recombination can occur during both positive- and negative-strand RNA synthesis. Furthermore, the recombinant RNAs could be detected in the virion released from the infected cells even after several passages of virus in tissue culture cells, indicating that these recombinant RNAs represented functional virion RNAs. The crossover sites of these recombinants were detected throughout the transfected RNA fragments. However, when an RNA fragment with a nine-nucleotide (CUUUAUAAA) deletion immediately downstream of a pentanucleotide (UCUAA) repeat sequence in the leader RNA was transfected into MHV-infected cells, most of the recombinants between this RNA and the MHV genome contained crossover sites near this pentanucleotide repeat sequence. In contrast, when exogenous RNAs with the intact nine-nucleotide sequence were used in similar experiments, the crossover sites of recombinants in viral genomic RNA could be detected at more-downstream sites. This study demonstrated that recombination can occur between replicating MHV RNAs and RNA fragments which do not replicate, suggesting the potential of RNA recombination for genetic engineering.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.277760285,-0.066310151,-0.05820013,0.129974428,0.076906613,-0.188592825,-0.151440186,0.061471937,-0.061813278,-0.009965349,0.063777534,-0.084132724,0.036529039,0.053866751,0.132298018,0.148170165,-0.173774271,0.065734928,-0.011852714,-0.012714852,0.046263069,-0.020857733,0.06718532,0.03640641,0.021989057,0.036514675,0.026472445,-0.00907564,-0.075238365,0.042735604
Coronavirus mRNA transcription: UV light transcriptional mapping studies suggest an early requirement for a genomic-length template.,"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) synthesizes seven to eight mRNAs, each of which contains a leader RNA derived from the 5' end of the genome. To understand the mechanism of synthesis of these mRNAs, we studied how the synthesis of each mRNA was affected by UV irradiation at different time points after infection. When MHV-infected cells were UV irradiated at a late time in infection (5 h postinfection), the syntheses of the various mRNAs were inhibited to different extents in proportion to the sizes of the mRNAs. Analysis of the UV inactivation kinetics revealed that the UV target size of each mRNA was equivalent to its own physical size. In contrast, when cells were irradiated at 2.5 or 3 h postinfection, there appeared to be two different kinetics of inhibition of mRNA synthesis: the synthesis of every mRNA was inhibited to the same extent by a small UV dose, but the remaining mRNA synthesis was inhibited by additional UV doses at different rates for different mRNAs in proportion to RNA size. The analysis of the UV inactivation kinetics indicated that the UV target sizes for the majority of mRNAs were equivalent to that of the genomic-size RNA early in the infection. These results suggest that MHV mRNA synthesis requires the presence of a genomic-length RNA template at least early in the infection. In contrast, later in the infection, the sizes of the templates used for mRNA synthesis were equivalent to the physical sizes of each mRNA. The possibility that the genomic-length RNA required early in the infection was used only for the synthesis of a polymerase rather than as a template for mRNA synthesis was ruled out by examining the UV sensitivity of a defective interfering (DI) RNA. We found that the UV target size for the DI RNA early in infection was much smaller than that for mRNAs 6 and 7, which are approximately equal to or smaller in size than the DI RNA. This result indicates that even though DI RNA and viral mRNAs are synthesized by the same polymerase, mRNAs are synthesized from a larger (genomic-length) template. We conclude that a genomic-length RNA template is required for MHV subgenomic mRNA synthesis at least early in infection.

Identification and characterization of a coronavirus packaging signal.,"Previously, a mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genomic sequence necessary for defective interfering (DI) RNA packaging into MHV particles (packaging signal) was mapped to within a region of 1,480 nucleotides in the MHV polymerase gene by comparison of two DI RNAs. One of these, DIssF, is 3.6 kb in size and exhibits efficient packaging, whereas the other, DIssE, which is 2.3 kb, does not. For more precise mapping, a series of mutant DIssF RNAs with deletions within this 1,480-nucleotide region were constructed. After transfection of in vitro-synthesized mutant DI RNA in MHV-infected cells, the virus product was passaged several times. The efficiency of DI RNA packaging into MHV virions was then estimated by viral homologous interference activity and by analysis of intracellular virus-specific RNAs and virion RNA. The results indicated that an area of 190 nucleotides was necessary for packaging. A computer-generated secondary structural analysis of the A59 and JHM strains of MHV demonstrated that within this 190-nucleotide region a stable stem-loop of 69 nucleotides was common between the two viruses. A DIssE-derived DI DNA which had these 69 nucleotides inserted into the DIssE sequence demonstrated efficient DI RNA packaging. Site-directed mutagenic analysis showed that of these 69 nucleotides, the minimum sequence of the packaging signal was 61 nucleotides and that destruction of the secondary structure abolished packaging ability. These studies demonstrated that an MHV packaging signal was present within the 61 nucleotides, which are located on MHV genomic RNA 1,381 to 1,441 nucleotides upstream of the 3' end of gene 1.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.198952045,-0.073538545,-0.025143485,0.024539429,0.063384916,-0.134022965,-0.195607021,0.054522149,-0.014704651,-0.088929471,-0.036471325,-0.10124753,0.054202653,-0.02645595,0.156314647,0.162147004,-0.194396354,0.124845502,-0.001644269,-0.020949629,0.075176075,-0.057123256,0.098335685,0.064395156,0.130214831,0.134409003,0.00955907,-0.032201053,0.035319681,-0.019485597
Repair and mutagenesis of the genome of a deletion mutant of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus by targeted RNA recombination.,"The genetic characterization of a nucleocapsid (N) protein mutant of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is described. The mutant, Albany 4 (Alb4), is both temperature sensitive and thermolabile. Analysis of the progeny of a mixed infection showed that the defective Alb4 allele is recessive to wild type, and its gene product is diffusible. The N protein of Alb4 was found to be smaller than its wild-type counterpart, and sequence analysis of the Alb4 N gene revealed that it contains an internal deletion of 87 nucleotides, producing an in-frame deletion of 29 amino acids. All of these properties of Alb4 made it ideal for use as a recipient in a targeted RNA recombination experiment in which the deletion in Alb4 was repaired by recombination with synthetic RNA7, the smallest MHV subgenomic mRNA. Progeny from a cotransfection of Alb4 genomic RNA and synthetic RNA7 were selected for thermal stability. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of candidate recombinants showed that they had regained the material that is deleted in the Alb4 mutant. They also had acquired a five-nucleotide insertion in the 3' untranslated region, which had been incorporated into the synthetic RNA7 as a molecular tag. The presence of the tag was directly verified, as well, by sequencing the genomic RNA of purified recombinant viruses. This provided a clear genetic proof that the Alb4 phenotype was due to the observed deletion in the N gene. In addition, these results demonstrated that it is possible to obtain stable, independently replicating progeny from recombination between coronavirus genomic RNA and a tailored, synthetic RNA species.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.190461973,-0.041372736,-0.009476948,0.007611252,0.088373428,-0.070532507,-0.101052567,0.025939381,-0.013128702,-0.018198947,-0.023676493,-0.028561423,0.028179041,-0.036357009,0.018829376,0.021635873,-0.070850888,0.019504665,-0.028584184,0.004132688,0.068626689,-0.037121289,0.051277358,0.068138942,0.006194814,0.038177108,0.035608142,-0.032536602,-0.068255213,0.016384009
Translational frameshifting mediated by a viral sequence in plant cells.,"It has been proposed that the polymerase gene of barley yellow dwarf virus and related viruses is expressed by a ribosomal frameshift event during translation. The 5' end of this gene overlaps with the 3' end of an upstream gene that is in a different reading frame. The region of overlap is similar to sequences in retro- and coronaviruses that are known to express their polymerase genes by frameshifting. This overlap region includes a ""shifty"" heptanucleotide, followed by a highly structured region that may contain a pseudoknot. Sequences of 115 or 144 base pairs that span this region from barley yellow dwarf virus (PAV serotype) genomic RNA were introduced into a plasmid, so that a reporter gene could be expressed in plant cells only if a minus one (-1) frameshift event occurred. Frameshifting was detected at a rate of approximately 1%. This frameshifting was abolished when the stop codon at the 3' end of the upstream open reading frame was deleted. A sequence expected to form a strong stem-loop immediately upstream of the frameshift site was unnecessary for frameshifting, and initiation at AUG codons within the stem-loop appeared to be inhibited. Like viruses that infect hosts in other kingdoms, plant viruses also can induce frameshifting in translation of their genes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.160862602,-0.060120122,-0.002924137,-0.019102252,0.121114885,-0.055841468,-0.12974138,0.024916812,0.014464296,-0.071027766,-0.133739608,-0.046791736,0.047531278,-0.104521542,-0.060958096,-0.066924394,0.047353518,-0.001856465,-0.000369282,-0.034151493,-0.004885101,-0.038736869,-0.081797909,0.085493082,-0.117220287,-0.101201002,-0.019429188,0.033912572,0.106282071,-0.120103269
Ribosomal frameshifting in plants: a novel signal directs the -1 frameshift in the synthesis of the putative viral replicase of potato leafroll luteovirus.,"The 5.8 kb RNA genome of potato leafroll luteovirus (PLRV) contains two overlapping open reading frames, ORF2a and ORF2b, which are characterized by helicase and RNA polymerase motifs, respectively, and possibly represent the viral replicase. Within the overlap, ORF2b lacks an AUG translational start codon and is therefore presumably translated by -1 ribosomal frameshifting as a transframe protein with ORF2a. This hypothesis was studied by introducing the putative frameshift region into an internal position of the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene and testing for the occurrence of frameshifting in vivo by transient expression of GUS activity in potato protoplasts as well as in vitro by translation in the reticulocyte system. Both experimental approaches demonstrate that a -1 frameshift occurs at a frequency of approximately 1%. Site-directed mutagenesis identified the frameshift region and the involvement of the novel heptanucleotide motif UUUAAAU in conjunction with an adjacent stem-loop structure. Part of this stem-loop encodes a basic region in the ORF2b moiety of the transframe protein which was shown by binding experiments with PLRV RNA to represent a nucleic acid-binding domain. These data support a possible biological significance of the frameshift to occur at this position of the large overlap by including the putative RNA template-binding site of the PLRV replicase in the ORF2a/ORF2b transframe protein.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.221158508,-0.05528757,-0.046626402,0.02232349,0.021854941,-0.090656484,-0.091201769,0.026570247,0.000814189,-0.061513769,-0.092301398,0.019320846,0.026943321,-0.124928082,-0.102727375,-0.088075691,0.093645799,-0.005786843,-0.020662824,-0.029884608,-0.05204542,-0.043820747,-0.067021595,-0.015505677,-0.034349565,-0.031153377,-0.031533099,0.024625099,0.078220415,-0.080381581
Rapid detection and identification of avian infectious bronchitis virus.,"A rapid and sensitive method for the detection and unambiguous typing of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is described. RNA was isolated from IBV-infected allantoic fluid and was transcribed into cDNA. This cDNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction products were subsequently analyzed on an agarose gel. The presence of IBV-specific RNA in the allantoic fluid then allowed the amplification of a 438-bp DNA fragment from the nucleocapsid (N) gene. For the typing of IBV isolates, we used amplified double-stranded DNA as a template in a sequencing reaction. We report 360 bases of the N gene of 18 IBV isolates. The sequence of the N gene was different between serologically indistinguishable IBV strains and may be a valuable tool in epidemiologic studies. A phylogenetic tree that was based on the sequences obtained did not agree with trees that were based on other parts of the sequence, illustrating the high frequency of recombination between IBV strains.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.116333114,-0.002622102,0.164726476,-0.079298461,0.231593865,0.037262626,-0.228123429,-0.0931932,0.1103733,0.395867307,0.063744542,-0.003395332,-0.050595983,-0.000209331,-0.169187534,0.191014978,-0.042582269,0.022466957,0.01396001,0.028573264,-0.063982886,-0.025113903,0.030241964,-0.047638767,-0.034552461,-0.017834796,-0.043463787,0.061263852,-0.004448911,0.083720953
Rapid and biologically safe diagnosis of African swine fever virus infection by using polymerase chain reaction.,"In order to circumvent the need for infectious virus for the diagnosis of African swine fever (ASF), we established the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique for the detection of ASF virus (ASFV) DNA. A 740-bp fragment that originated from the conserved region of the viral genome was partially sequenced. From this sequence, four PCR primers and one oligonucleotide probe were designed and synthesized. A specific 640-bp PCR product was amplified by using oligonucleotides 1 and 5 as primers and extracts of the following samples as templates: organs and plasma obtained from ASFV-infected pigs, ASFV-infected cell cultures, and cloned DNA fragments containing the same conserved genomic region as that in the original 740-bp clone. No specific reaction products were observed in the corresponding controls. The identities of the PCR products were confirmed either by a second amplification with nested primers or by hybridization with a specific, biotinylated oligonucleotide probe. PCR proved to be a quicker and more sensitive method than virus isolation followed by the hemadsorption test when spleen and plasma samples from experimentally ASFV-infected pigs were tested. Furthermore, cloned virus DNA could be used as a positive control in the place of a live virus control. This is advantageous whenever the use of live virus is undesirable.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.032670844,0.018851158,0.177889773,0.005510492,0.033199768,-0.014036672,-0.066316048,-0.025546052,-0.002010961,0.023488155,0.007533543,-0.049750142,0.023178245,0.011680651,0.055018173,-0.018243747,0.000904202,-0.017380999,-0.002712103,-0.025756117,-0.041475132,0.015992868,0.059693957,-0.036509031,-0.018147829,0.000657496,-0.038790934,-0.012864548,-0.063272112,0.081304004
Detection of rodent coronaviruses in tissues and cell cultures by using polymerase chain reaction.,"A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was developed for the detection of rodent coronaviruses in biological material by using reverse transcriptase and two primers which flanked an M gene sequence of 375 bp. PCR detected all of 11 different strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) as well as rat sialodacryoadenitis virus but not bovine coronavirus or human coronavirus strains OC43 and 229E. The M gene sequences of bovine coronavirus and human coronavirus OC43 are homologous to that of MHV, but minor differences exist in the primer regions, preventing annealing of the primers.

The 5' end of coronavirus minus-strand RNAs contains a short poly(U) tract.,"A radiolabeled oligodeoxynucleotide primer that anneals near the common 5' end of bovine coronavirus minus-strand RNAs was extended with reverse transcriptase, and a major product suggesting poly(U) tracts of 8 to 20 nucleotides was found. The extended primer molecules were ligated head to tail, amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and sequenced, and poly(U) tracts of 9 to 26 nucleotides were found. Poly(A) tails of 100 to 130 nucleotides on the 3' end of coronavirus plus-strand mRNAs and genome must, therefore, be generated by a mechanism that uses only a short poly(U) template.

In vivo accumulation of a turnip crinkle virus defective interfering RNA is affected by alterations in size and sequence.,"Turnip crinkle virus is one of several single-stranded RNA plant viruses associated with defective interfering (DI) RNAs. A complete cDNA copy of a 344-base DI RNA (DI RNA G) was cloned downstream from a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Transcripts synthesized in vitro were infectious when inoculated with helper virus on turnip plants. Studies of the infectivity of DI transcripts containing deletions, insertions, and single-base changes suggest that (i) in general, only the 5' two-thirds of the molecule can tolerate mutations; (ii) between 52 and 67 bases of terminal 5' sequence are required for infectivity; (iii) nucleotides in positions 68 to 138 are not specifically involved in RNA infectivity; (iv) DI RNA G molecules smaller than 327 bases are not amplified efficiently in plants.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.196079805,-0.073745602,-0.043517471,0.070789118,0.032566374,-0.135550626,-0.151312525,0.060560094,-0.039777141,-0.048960127,0.034243697,-0.102138229,0.024564266,0.018354775,0.180711787,0.189809013,-0.204805941,0.099298766,-0.00855012,-0.024579637,0.05488419,-0.039437887,0.070742676,0.009821877,0.034742525,0.060179681,0.01230939,-0.012105828,0.079354957,-0.031119968
A domain at the 3' end of the polymerase gene is essential for encapsidation of coronavirus defective interfering RNAs.,"Two murine hepatitis virus strain A59 defective interfering (DI) RNAs were generated by undiluted virus passages. The DI RNAs were encapsidated efficiently. The smallest DI particle, DI-a, contained a 5.5-kb RNA consisting of the following three noncontiguous regions from the MHV-A59 genome, which were joined in frame: the 5'-terminal 3.9 kb, a 798-nucleotide fragment from the 3' end of the polymerase gene, and the 3'-terminal 805 nucleotides. A full-length cDNA clone of the DI-a genome was constructed and cloned downstream of the bacteriophage T7 promoter. Transcripts derived from this clone, pMIDI, were used for transfection of MHV-A59-infected cells and found to be amplified and packaged. Deletion analysis of pMIDI allowed us to identify a 650-nucleotide region derived from the 3' end of the second open reading frame of the polymerase gene that was required for efficient encapsidation.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.20698052,-0.075436362,-0.02058532,0.001609806,0.093279705,-0.139258826,-0.269961065,0.048830125,0.007652714,-0.104595433,-0.067506663,-0.149902407,0.081113241,-0.030956781,0.196181081,0.177026073,-0.230805746,0.140721983,0.006728545,-0.014149943,0.097877625,-0.056069522,0.12679925,0.04755452,0.116662984,0.144739215,0.037852627,-0.047098558,0.043269046,-0.005760259
Identification of polypeptides encoded in open reading frame 1b of the putative polymerase gene of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus A59.,"The polypeptides encoded in open reading frame (ORF) 1b of the mouse hepatitis virus A59 putative polymerase gene of RNA 1 were identified in the products of in vitro translation of genome RNA. Two antisera directed against fusion proteins containing sequences encoded in portions of the 3'-terminal 2.0 kb of ORF 1b were used to immunoprecipitate p90, p74, p53, p44, and p32 polypeptides. These polypeptides were clearly different in electrophoretic mobility, antiserum reactivity, and partial protease digestion pattern from viral structural proteins and from polypeptides encoded in the 5' end of ORF 1a, previously identified by in vitro translation. The largest of these polypeptides had partial protease digestion patterns similar to those of polypeptides generated by in vitro translation of a synthetic mRNA derived from the 3' end of ORF 1b. The polypeptides encoded in ORF 1b accumulated more slowly during in vitro translation than polypeptides encoded in ORF 1a. This is consistent with the hypothesis that translation of gene A initiates at the 5' end of ORF 1a and that translation of ORF 1b occurs following a frameshift at the ORF 1a-ORF 1b junction. The use of in vitro translation of genome RNA and immunoprecipitation with antisera directed against various regions of the polypeptides encoded in gene A should make it possible to study synthesis and processing of the putative coronavirus polymerase.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.166796506,-0.056569059,-0.02826603,-0.022467475,0.053217838,-0.068618946,-0.137184246,0.022308756,0.028907796,-0.060124796,-0.108246943,-0.043792888,0.050825535,-0.091454574,-0.040662329,-0.073791102,0.06936478,0.013212745,0.046620331,0.018908952,-0.044834027,0.007200742,-0.048917515,-0.010963966,-0.025827877,-0.006579301,0.011237699,-0.052669923,-0.00436184,-0.037861964
Equine arteritis virus is not a togavirus but belongs to the coronaviruslike superfamily.,"The nucleotide sequence of the genome of equine arteritis virus (EAV) was determined from a set of overlapping cDNA clones and was found to contain eight open reading frames (ORFs). ORFs 2 through 7 are expressed from six 3'-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs, which are transcribed from the 3'-terminal quarter of the viral genome. A number of these ORFs are predicted to encode structural EAV proteins. The organization and expression of the 3' part of the EAV genome are remarkably similar to those of coronaviruses and toroviruses. The 5'-terminal three-quarters of the genome contain the putative EAV polymerase gene, which also shares a number of features with the corresponding gene of corona- and toroviruses. The gene contains two large ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, with an overlap region of 19 nucleotides. The presence of a ""shifty"" heptanucleotide sequence in this region and a downstream RNA pseudoknot structure indicate that ORF1b is probably expressed by ribosomal frameshifting. The frameshift-directing potential of the ORF1a/ORF1b overlap region was demonstrated by using a reporter gene. Moreover, the predicted ORF1b product was found to contain four domains which have been identified in the same relative positions in coronavirus and torovirus ORF1b products. The sequences of the EAV and coronavirus ORF1a proteins were found to be much more diverged. The EAV ORF1a product contains a putative trypsinlike serine protease motif. Our data indicate that EAV, presently considered a togavirus, is evolutionarily related to viruses from the coronaviruslike superfamily.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.165039644,-0.03869445,-0.026880875,-0.030441465,0.110907161,-0.060885199,-0.129746895,0.014964037,0.022713042,-0.065750392,-0.13026862,-0.014334502,0.070631829,-0.138790016,-0.074092016,-0.115508594,0.108814308,0.000583278,0.019976284,-0.00786572,-0.034339744,-0.018053907,-0.062297018,-0.00069343,-0.056846347,-0.008748808,0.01428831,-0.010247331,0.024264718,-0.078284428
Translational frameshifting in the Escherichia coli dnaX gene in vitro.,"Production of the gamma subunit of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is dependent on a very efficient translational frameshif in the dnaX gene. I used an E. coli in vitro translation system to analyze the mechanism of this frameshifting event. In this system, gamma was produced almost to the same extent as the inframe translation product, tau, suggesting that efficient frameshifting was reproduced in vitro. Coupling with transcription was not necessary for frameshifting. Addition of purified tau or gamma had no effect on the frameshifting process suggesting the absence of direct feedback regulation. By use of mutant genes, a strong pausing site was identified at or very close to the frameshift site. This pausing was apparently caused by a potential stem-loop structure which was previously shown to enhance frameshifting. Thus, enhancement of frameshifting by this putative stem-loop seems to be mediated by the translation pausing at the frameshift site. Despite the apparent structural similarity of the dnaX frameshift site to that of the eukaryotic retroviral genes, dnaX mRNA synthesized in vitro failed to direct the production of gamma in eukaryotic translation systems. This suggests that frameshifting in the dnaX gene depends on components specific to the E. coli translation system.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.140410307,-0.048489193,0.006344258,-0.057950417,-0.009296648,-0.018463593,-0.057430695,0.003283089,0.031326174,-0.065629629,-0.110965017,-0.005452639,0.012721327,-0.087349829,-0.074313079,-0.033449912,0.050479898,-0.012920598,-0.040096616,-0.040370073,-0.021650129,-0.039258065,-0.064986891,0.030736018,-0.042491454,-0.08111595,-0.056387115,0.036984303,0.120957763,-0.103979758
Analysis of efficiently packaged defective interfering RNAs of murine coronavirus: localization of a possible RNA-packaging signal.,"We have previously shown that most of the defective interfering (DI) RNA of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) are not packaged into virions. We have now identified, after 21 serial undiluted passages of MHV, a small DI RNA, DIssF, which is efficiently packaged into virions. The DIssF RNA replicated at a high efficiency on its transfection into the helper virus-infected cells. The virus released from the transfected cells interfered strongly with mRNA synthesis and growth of helper virus. cDNA cloning and sequence analysis of DIssF RNA revealed that it is 3.6 kb and consists of sequences derived from five discontinuous regions of the genome of the nondefective virus. The first four regions (domains I to IV) from the 5' end are derived from gene 1, which presumably encodes the RNA polymerase of the nondefective virus. The entire domain I (859 nucleotides) and the first 750 nucleotides of domain II are also present in a previously characterized DI RNA, DIssE, which is not efficiently packaged into virions. Furthermore, the junction between these two domains is identical between the two DI RNAs. The remaining 77 nucleotides at the 3' end of domain II and all of domains III (655 nucleotides) and IV (770 nucleotides) are not present in DIssE RNA. These four domains are derived from gene 1. In contrast, the 3'-most domain (domain V, 447 nucleotides) is derived from the 3' end of the genomic RNA and is also present in DIssE. The comparison of primary sequences and packaging properties between DIsse and DIssF RNAs suggested that domains III and IV and part of the 3' end of domain II contain the packaging signal for MHV RNA. This conclusion was confirmed by inserting these DIssF-unique sequences into a DIssE cDNA construct; the in vitro-transcribed RNA from this hybrid construct was efficiently packaged into virion particles. DIssF RNA also contains an open reading frame, which begins from domain I and ends at the 5'-end 20 bases of domain III. In vitro translation of DIssF RNA and metabolic labeling of the virus-infected cells showed that this open reading frame is indeed translated into a 75-kDa protein. The structures of both DIssE and DIssF RNAs suggest that a protein-encoding capability is a common characteristic of MHV DI RNA.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.243136609,-0.074696137,-0.058111781,0.057305856,0.058935804,-0.140529722,-0.190282091,0.048237629,-0.011537363,-0.07538668,-0.030169475,-0.097763933,0.046232976,-0.003629309,0.110235757,0.11005962,-0.11697583,0.080548614,0.011698525,-0.003981387,0.041284437,-0.023738085,0.072353885,-0.004245518,0.088738555,0.097988538,0.015432163,-0.009443617,0.036131115,-0.012397767
"In vitro processing of dengue virus type 2 nonstructural proteins NS2A, NS2B, and NS3.","We have tested the hypothesis that the flavivirus nonstructural protein NS3 is a viral proteinase that generates the termini of several nonstructural proteins by using an efficient in vitro expression system and monospecific antisera directed against the nonstructural proteins NS2B and NS3. A series of cDNA constructs was transcribed by using T7 RNA polymerase, and the RNA was translated in reticulocyte lysates. The resulting protein patterns indicated that proteolytic processing occurred in vitro to generate NS2B and NS3. The amino termini of NS2B and NS3 produced in vitro were found to be the same as the termini of NS2B and NS3 isolated from infected cells. Deletion analysis of cDNA constructs localized the protease domain within NS3 to the first 184 amino acids but did not eliminate the possibility that sequences within NS2B were also required for proper cleavage. Kinetic analysis of processing events in vitro and experiments to examine the sensitivity of processing to dilution suggested that an intramolecular cleavage between NS2A and NS2B preceded an intramolecular cleavage between NS2B and NS3. The data from these expression experiments confirm that NS3 is the viral proteinase responsible for cleavage events generating the amino termini of NS2B and NS3 and presumably for cleavages generating the termini of NS4A and NS5 as well.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.116704524,-0.044195144,-0.013828094,-0.047375188,-0.031595327,-0.005140546,-0.017405808,-0.011174215,0.024145174,-0.03330389,-0.041355869,0.015836531,-0.00426202,-0.019607718,-0.01920927,-0.026396719,0.041383922,0.003865481,0.032016201,-0.007897259,-0.020718168,0.00731325,-0.00394394,-0.033370124,0.042162529,0.065115241,-0.002504456,-0.009052361,-0.03358768,0.009280315
The carboxyl-terminal part of the putative Berne virus polymerase is expressed by ribosomal frameshifting and contains sequence motifs which indicate that toro- and coronaviruses are evolutionarily related.,"Sequence analysis of the 3' part (8 kb) of the polymerase gene of the torovirus prototype Berne virus (BEV) revealed that this area contains at least two open reading frames (provisionally designated ORF1a and ORF1b) which overlap by 12 nucleotides. The complete sequence of ORF1b (6873 nucleotides) was determined. Like the coronaviruses, BEV was shown to express its ORF1b by ribosomal frameshifting during translation of the genomic RNA. The predicted tertiary RNA structure (a pseudoknot) in the toro- and coronaviral frameshift-directing region is similar. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of the predicted BEV ORF1b translation product revealed homology with the ORF1b product of coronaviruses. Four conserved domains were identified: the putative polymerase domain, an area containing conserved cysteine and histidine residues, a putative helicase motif, and a domain which seems to be unique for toro- and coronaviruses. The data on the 3' part of the polymerase gene of BEV supplement previously observed similarities between toro- and coronaviruses at the level of genome organization and expression.

Hemagglutinin mutations related to attenuation and altered cell tropism of a virulent avian influenza A virus.,"The H5 hemagglutinin (HA) of a highly virulent avian influenza virus, A/Turkey Ontario/7732/66 (H5N9), was previously shown to have five neutralizing epitopes, and escape mutants within one epitope (group 1) were markedly attenuated (M. Philpott, B. C. Easterday, and V. S. Hinshaw, J. Virol. 63:3453-3458, 1989). To define the genetic changes related to these antigenic and biologic properties, the HA genes of mutants within each of the epitope groups were sequenced by using the polymerase chain reaction. The mutations in the attenuated group 1 mutants were located near the distal tip of the HA molecule in close proximity to the receptor-binding site, on the basis of alignment with the three-dimensional structure of the H3 HA. All group 1 mutations involved charged amino acids. The group 1 mutants, similar to the wild-type virus, spread systemically and were recovered from the spleens of infected chickens but, unlike the wild-type virus, failed to produce severe necrosis in the spleens. Viral replication in the spleens was investigated by in situ hybridization of spleen sections from chickens infected with the wild-type or attenuated mutants. Wild-type virus replication was demonstrated in large, mononuclear, macrophagelike cells; however, group 1 mutant virus was detected attached only to erythrocytes within the red pulp. These results suggest that the attenuated mutants differ in their cell tropism within the spleen.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.083003738,-0.058967703,-0.014344889,-0.031871436,0.010056173,0.095629465,-0.018982996,-0.029429971,-0.005764317,-0.009147578,0.015507867,-0.002012704,-0.061279391,0.019536031,0.014744377,0.001715193,-0.016072774,-0.032937166,-0.045722228,0.044872687,0.091401755,-0.061321814,0.023587732,0.076974779,-0.001176273,0.009805888,-0.007889451,-0.029848939,-0.108159186,-0.05671888
The primary structure and expression of the second open reading frame of the polymerase gene of the coronavirus MHV-A59; a highly conserved polymerase is expressed by an efficient ribosomal frameshifting mechanism.,Sequence analysis of a substantial part of the polymerase gene of the murine coronavirus MHV-A59 revealed the 3' end of an open reading frame (ORF1a) overlapping with a large ORF (ORF1b; 2733 amino acids) which covers the 3' half of the polymerase gene. The expression of ORF1b occurs by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism since the ORF1a/ORF1b overlapping nucleotide sequence is capable of inducing ribosomal frameshifting in vitro as well as in vivo. A stem-loop structure and a pseudoknot are predicted in the nucleotide sequence involved in ribosomal frameshifting. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of MHV ORF1b with the amino acid sequence deduced from the corresponding gene of the avian coronavirus IBV demonstrated that in contrast to the other viral genes this ORF is extremely conserved. Detailed analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence revealed sequence elements which are conserved in many DNA and RNA polymerases.,0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.209062992,-0.052025137,0.003841678,-0.06312371,0.163609153,-0.065475517,-0.218939513,0.013698971,0.049362654,-0.031489098,-0.157879504,-0.008510712,0.07828155,-0.197423465,-0.096732024,-0.097716155,0.061333693,0.045569107,0.008213889,-0.0197549,-0.014074995,-0.073328162,-0.036495209,0.052245937,-0.057235128,-0.007511945,0.009326542,-0.009972647,0.034105487,-0.088564332
Programmed ribosomal frameshifting generates the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III gamma subunit from within the tau subunit reading frame.,"The Escherichia coli dnaX gene encodes both the tau and gamma subunits of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme in one reading frame. The 71.1 kDa tau and the shorter gamma share N-terminal sequences. Mutagenesis of a potential ribosomal frameshift signal located at codons 428-430 without changing the amino acid sequence of the tau product, eliminated detectable synthesis of the gamma subunit, suggesting that the reading frame is shifted at that sequence and gamma is terminated by a nonsense codon located in the -1 frame 3 nucleotides downstream of the signal. This seems to be the first known case of a frameshift which is used, along with the termination codon in the -1 frame, to terminate a peptide within a reading frame. [Mutagenesis of a dibasic peptide (lys-lys) at codons 498-499, the site at which a tau'-'LacZ fusion protein was cleaved in vitro (1) had no effect on gamma formation in vivo, suggesting that cleavage observed in vitro is not the mechanism of gamma formation in vivo.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14123341,-0.044476313,-0.010885689,-0.072012339,0.029197721,-0.030056846,-0.095914903,0.014879415,0.03143377,-0.08309737,-0.106801843,0.002299463,0.025145711,-0.129226399,-0.053232542,-0.058201472,0.052498068,0.005533385,0.00179535,-0.037182989,-0.008226901,-0.037700327,-0.036461673,0.002141556,-0.026785528,-0.004478451,-0.025672373,-0.013980135,0.062441906,-0.068466784
Translational frameshifting generates the gamma subunit of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme.,"The dnaX gene (previously called dnaZX) of Escherichia coli has only one open reading frame for a 71-kDa polypeptide from which two distinct DNA polymerase III holoenzyme subunits, tau (71 kDa) and gamma (47 kDa), are produced. To determine how the gamma subunit is generated, we examined the influence of mutations in the dnaX gene on the pattern of tau and gamma production in overproducing cells. Important structural elements in dnaX mRNA include a stretch of six adenines (nucleotides 1425-1430), a stable hairpin structure (nucleotides 1437-1466), and a UGA stop codon in a -1 frame (nucleotides 1434-1436) between the stretch of adenines and the hairpin structure. Disruption of this stop codon generates a slightly larger gamma subunit, indicative of the use of a -1 stop codon farther downstream (nucleotides 1470-1472). These results suggest that a -1 frameshift during translation allows the use of this UGA codon to terminate translation of the gamma polypeptide. The amino acid composition, sequence, and mass spectra of a C-terminal peptide from mild digestion of the purified gamma protein with endoproteinase Lys-C confirms that this frameshift occurs at either of the two lysine codons in the region of the adenine stretch. Remarkable features of this frameshifting are its high frequency (i.e., about 80% in an overproducing cell) and the striking structural similarity to the frameshifting signal responsible for expression of the pol and pro genes in many retroviruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.142905005,-0.053465173,-0.010950522,-0.076090945,0.020804543,-0.029005518,-0.090537848,0.004915187,0.032057007,-0.077772438,-0.110892083,-0.016065985,0.02922724,-0.115121907,-0.066115413,-0.049558719,0.045222641,-0.018351949,-0.024205179,-0.038719987,0.002798428,-0.039506672,-0.040130235,0.022865647,-0.045997236,-0.044266294,-0.015047879,-0.006598572,0.088942334,-0.084810985
Specificities involved in the initiation of retroviral plus-strand DNA.,"Reverse transcription of the retroviral RNA genome begins with tRNA-primed synthesis of a minus-strand DNA, which subsequently acts as the template for the synthesis of plus-strand DNA. This plus-strand DNA is initiated at a unique location and makes use of a purine-rich RNA oligonucleotide derived by RNase H action on the viral RNA. To determine the variables that are relevant to successful specific initiation of plus-strand DNA synthesis, we have used nucleic acid sequences from the genome of Rous sarcoma virus along with three different sources of RNase H: avian myeloblastosis virus DNA polymerase, murine leukemia virus DNA polymerase, and the RNase H of Escherichia coli. Our findings include evidence that specificity is controlled not only by the nucleic acid sequences but also by the RNase H. For example, while the avian reverse transcriptase efficiently and specifically initiates on the sequences of the avian retrovirus, the murine reverse transcriptase initiates specifically but at a location 4 bases upstream of the correct site.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.148434722,-0.036096169,0.029455429,0.061537554,-0.018195897,-0.041625415,-0.021291374,0.024638867,-0.026227715,0.020780597,0.016429827,-0.013753157,0.031129017,-0.039236435,0.000475854,0.071890171,-0.03980451,0.00360735,-0.022258259,-0.005576433,-0.062309585,0.000888499,-0.049463744,-0.041974139,-0.045202492,-0.084358224,-0.117502867,0.054885428,0.000879785,0.041739683
High-frequency leader sequence switching during coronavirus defective interfering RNA replication.,"A system was developed that exploited defective interfering (DI) RNAs of coronavirus to study the role of free leader RNA in RNA replication. A cDNA copy of mouse hepatitis virus DI RNA was placed downstream of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter to generate DI RNAs capable of extremely efficient replication in the presence of a helper virus. We demonstrated that, in the DI RNA-transfected cells, the leader sequence of these DI RNAs was switched to that of the helper virus during one round of replication. This high-frequency leader sequence exchange was not observed if a nine-nucleotide stretch of sequence (UUUAUAAAC) at the junction between the leader and the remaining DI sequence was deleted. This observation suggests that a free leader RNA generated from the genomic RNA of mouse hepatitis virus may participate in the replication of DI RNA.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.246486272,-0.086795101,-0.061756126,0.098131141,0.048209169,-0.179972153,-0.213356484,0.079524347,-0.041423584,-0.080987807,0.03016828,-0.151540084,0.054268779,0.039165454,0.24084834,0.260506205,-0.277035443,0.15145745,0.01808734,-0.007003706,0.080701144,-0.040926257,0.100677818,0.008963812,0.107377898,0.090427354,0.017376048,-0.023226115,0.093910261,-0.018241182
Detection of infectious bursal disease viruses by using cloned cDNA probes.,"A molecular clone representing 445 base pairs at the 3' end of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) genome segment B was used in a dot blot hybridization assay to detect viral RNA from cell culture and from chicken bursa and spleen tissue specimens. The cloned nucleotide sequence represents approximately 14% of the virus-encoded polymerase (VP-1) gene. The lower detection limit of radiolabeled probes prepared from this clone was 0.1 ng of IBDV double-stranded RNA. The probe had broad specificity and was used to detect four serotype 1 IBDV strains and one serotype 2 IBDV strain. This probe, however, did not cross-react with nucleic acid extracted from nine unrelated poultry viruses.

Overlapping genes in a yeast double-stranded RNA virus.,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae viruses have a large viral double-stranded RNA which encodes the major viral capsid polypeptide. We have previously shown that this RNA (L1) also encodes a putative viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (D. F. Pietras, M. E. Diamond, and J. A. Bruenn, Nucleic Acids Res., 16:6226, 1988). The organization and expression of the viral genome is similar to that of the gag-pol region of the retroviruses. The complete sequence of L1 demonstrates two large open reading frames on the plus strand which overlap by 129 bases. The first is the gene for the capsid polypeptide, and the second is the gene for the putative RNA polymerase. One of the products of in vitro translation of the denatured viral double-stranded RNA is a polypeptide of the size expected of a capsid-polymerase fusion protein, resulting from a -1 frameshift within the overlapping region. A polypeptide of the size expected for a capsid-polymerase fusion product was found in virions, and it was recognized in Western blots (immunoblots) by antibodies to a synthetic peptide derived from the predicted polymerase sequence.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.224975728,-0.069749924,-0.053118244,0.066783707,0.053328716,-0.114759573,-0.097114536,0.032589232,-0.014947971,-0.010699028,-0.055129401,-0.039519683,0.049315642,-0.066018614,-0.033893616,-0.083964328,0.051841406,0.000411422,0.013567787,0.006599428,-0.056107333,0.025989127,-0.077343532,-0.008816395,-0.071955692,-0.049342604,0.009573945,-0.028555895,-0.014858496,0.015247385
Identification of a domain required for autoproteolytic cleavage of murine coronavirus gene A polyprotein.,"The 5'-most gene of the murine coronavirus genome, gene A, is presumed to encode viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. It has previously been shown that the N-terminal portion of this gene product is cleaved into a protein of 28 kilodaltons (p28). To further understand the mechanism of synthesis of the p28 protein, cDNA clones representing the 5'-most 5.3 kilobases of murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM were sequenced and subcloned into pT7 vectors from which RNAs were transcribed and translated in vitro. The sequence was found to encode a single long open reading frame continuing from near the 5' terminus of the genome. Although p28 is encoded from the first 1 kilobase at the 5' end of the genome, translation of in vitro-transcribed RNAs indicated that this protein was not detected unless the product of the entire 5.3-kilobase region was synthesized. Translation of RNAs of 3.9 kilobases or smaller yielded proteins which contained the p28 sequence, but p28 was not cleaved. This suggests that the sequence in the region between 3.9 and 5.3 kilobases from the 5' end of the genomic RNA is essential for proteolytic cleavage and contains autoproteolytic activity. The p28 protein could not be cleaved from the smaller primary translation products of gene A, even in the presence of the larger autocleaving protein. Cleavage of the p28 protein was inhibited by addition of the protease inhibitor ZnCl2. This study thus identified a protein domain essential for autoproteolytic cleavage of the gene A polyprotein.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.219596153,-0.065351423,-0.041408798,-0.007514502,0.052889247,-0.087802154,-0.159321059,-0.00402543,0.037073509,-0.070178157,-0.118459517,-0.048784072,0.063128908,-0.062165655,-0.040308266,-0.074780459,0.06465966,0.00088014,0.034005424,0.031627748,-0.024627583,0.028424445,-0.00725017,-0.004768397,0.070878395,0.09624551,0.025814529,-0.040106653,-0.015301241,0.035320357
Coronavirus genome: prediction of putative functional domains in the non-structural polyprotein by comparative amino acid sequence analysis.,"Amino acid sequences of 2 giant non-structural polyproteins (F1 and F2) of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of Coronaviridae, were compared, by computer-assisted methods, to sequences of a number of other positive strand RNA viral and cellular proteins. By this approach, juxtaposed putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, nucleic acid binding (""finger""-like) and RNA helicase domains were identified in F2. Together, these domains might constitute the core of the protein complex involved in the primer-dependent transcription, replication and recombination of coronaviruses. In F1, two cysteine protease-like domains and a growth factor-like one were revealed. One of the putative proteases of IBV is similar to 3C proteases of picornaviruses and related enzymes of como- nepo- and potyviruses. Search of IBV F1 and F2 sequences for sites similar to those cleaved by the latter proteases and intercomparison of the surrounding sequence stretches revealed 13 dipeptides Q/S(G) which are probably cleaved by the coronavirus 3C-like protease. Based on these observations, a partial tentative scheme for the functional organization and expression strategy of the non-structural polyproteins of IBV was proposed. It implies that, despite the general similarity to other positive strand RNA viruses, and particularly to potyviruses, coronaviruses possess a number of unique structural and functional features.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.212422435,-0.043187165,-0.034754244,0.026819524,0.139975318,-0.009981937,-0.10971755,-0.032644586,0.032529296,0.183969966,0.016349697,0.029376792,-0.011491048,-0.042386411,-0.147737994,0.022728294,0.085759557,0.001034047,0.021425268,0.031277122,-0.082853138,-0.011213242,-0.056133802,-0.106260364,0.008822589,0.012534664,-0.022291807,0.024316021,0.005788878,-0.044275645
Sequence and organization of barley yellow dwarf virus genomic RNA.,"The nucleotide sequence of the genomic RNA of barley yellow dwarf virus, PAV serotype was determined, except for the 5'-terminal base, and its genome organization deduced. The 5,677 nucleotide genome contains five large open reading frames (ORFs). The genes for the coat protein (1) and the putative viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were identified. The latter shows a striking degree of similarity to that of carnation mottle virus (CarMV). By comparison with corona- and retrovirus RNAs, it is proposed that a translational frameshift is involved in expression of the polymerase. An ORF encoding an Mr 49,797 protein (50K ORF) may be translated by in-frame readthrough of the coat protein stop codon.

An efficient ribosomal frame-shifting signal in the polymerase-encoding region of the coronavirus IBV.,"The polymerase-encoding region of the genomic RNA of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) contains two very large, briefly overlapping open reading frames (ORF), F1 and F2, and it has been suggested on the basis of sequence analysis that expression of the downstream ORF, F2, might be mediated through ribosomal frame-shifting. To examine this possibility a cDNA fragment containing the F1/F2 overlap region was cloned within a marker gene and placed under the control of the bacteriophage SP6 promoter in a recombinant plasmid. Messenger RNA transcribed from this plasmid, when translated in cell-free systems, specified the synthesis of polypeptides whose size was entirely consistent with the products predicted by an efficient ribosomal frame-shifting event within the overlap region. The nature of the products was confirmed by their reactivity with antisera raised against defined portions of the flanking marker gene.

Sequence and translation of the murine coronavirus 5'-end genomic RNA reveals the N-terminal structure of the putative RNA polymerase.,"A 28-kilodalton protein has been suggested to be the amino-terminal protein cleavage product of the putative coronavirus RNA polymerase (gene A) (M.R. Denison and S. Perlman, Virology 157:565-568, 1987). To elucidate the structure and mechanism of synthesis of this protein, the nucleotide sequence of the 5' 2.0 kilobases of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM genome was determined. This sequence contains a single, long open reading frame and predicts a highly basic amino-terminal region. Cell-free translation of RNAs transcribed in vitro from DNAs containing gene A sequences in pT7 vectors yielded proteins initiated from the 5'-most optimal initiation codon at position 215 from the 5' end of the genome. The sequence preceding this initiation codon predicts the presence of a stable hairpin loop structure. The presence of an RNA secondary structure at the 5' end of the RNA genome is supported by the observation that gene A sequences were more efficiently translated in vitro when upstream noncoding sequences were removed. By comparing the translation products of virion genomic RNA and in vitro transcribed RNAs, we established that our clones encompassing the 5'-end mouse hepatitis virus genomic RNA encode the 28-kilodalton N-terminal cleavage product of the gene A protein. Possible cleavage sites for this protein are proposed.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.297773411,-0.073711595,-0.054090807,0.039390689,0.107357669,-0.139407119,-0.218074877,0.0228372,0.011657916,-0.07174357,-0.118530167,-0.052049538,0.076109157,-0.111819505,-0.048957101,-0.086709049,0.05847952,0.022528269,0.020761576,0.011424151,-0.021118286,-0.003751969,-0.023292088,0.023338221,0.016336659,0.033830416,0.028578357,-0.021813453,0.016951206,0.030010972
Initiation and termination of duck hepatitis B virus DNA synthesis during virus maturation.,"We characterized a number of important features of the structure of the cohesive overlap region of the DNA genome of duck hepatitis B virus. The 5'-terminal nucleotide of minus-strand DNA was localized to nucleotide 2537, a G residue within the 12-base repeat sequence DR1. This G residue was shown to be the site of a covalent linkage to a protein, consistent with speculation that this protein is the primer of minus-strand synthesis, which occurs by reverse transcription. The 3' terminus of the minus strand was heterogeneous, being mapped to nucleotides 2530 and 2531, indicating that the minus strand is terminally redundant by seven or eight bases and ends at the putative 5' end of the transcribed RNA template (pregenome) for reverse transcription. We previously demonstrated that the presumptive RNA primer of plus-strand synthesis remains attached to plus-strand DNA during virus maturation; moreover, the sequence of this primer suggested an origin from the 5' end of the pregenome (J.-M. Lien, C. E. Aldrich, and W. S. Mason, J. Virol. 57:229-236, 1986). We show here that over 75% of plus-strand primers are capped, further supporting the idea that these primers are uniquely derived from the 5' end of the pregenome. Finally, we found that seemingly mature duck hepatitis B virus genomes are incomplete by at least 12 bases, in that the 12-base repeat sequence DR2 is not copied into plus-strand DNA during virus maturation. Since DR2 in virion DNA is duplexed with the RNA primer of plus-strand synthesis, it is possible that the failure to make complete plus strands is due to an inability of the viral DNA polymerase to carry out a displacement of the bound RNA primer.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.184970782,-0.057762002,-0.009354679,0.064687451,0.008468154,-0.108134319,-0.075384849,0.0364736,-0.044653226,-0.031050548,0.010685941,0.004131386,0.005486358,-0.033421114,0.003732443,0.051052451,-0.000809254,0.014174185,-0.004317937,-0.023244165,-0.041912882,0.015357759,-0.046009202,-0.028043158,-0.02561349,-0.097271662,-0.118995968,0.067352245,0.034859605,0.029450287
Translation and processing of mouse hepatitis virus virion RNA in a cell-free system.,"The first event after infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) is presumed to be the synthesis of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from the input genomic RNA. The synthesis and processing of this putative polymerase protein was studied in a cell-free translation system utilizing 60S RNA from MHV-A59 virions. The polypeptide products of this reaction included two major species of 220 and 28 kilodaltons. Kinetics experiments indicated that both p220 and p28 appeared after 60 min of incubation and that protein p28 was synthesized initially as the N-terminal portion of a larger precursor protein. When the cell-free translation products were labeled with N-formyl[35S]methionyl-tRNAi, p28 was the predominant radioactive product, confirming its N-terminal location within a precursor protein. Translation in the presence of the protease inhibitors leupeptin and ZnCl2 resulted in the disappearance of p28 and p220 and the appearance of a new protein, p250. This product, which approached the maximal size predicted for a protein synthesized from genomic RNA, was not routinely detected in the absence of inhibitors even under conditions which optimized the translation reaction for elongation of proteins. Subsequent chelation of ZnCl2 resulted in the partial cleavage of the precursor protein and the reappearance of p28. One-dimensional peptide mapping with Staphylococcus aureus V-8 protease confirmed the precursor-product relationship of p250 and p28. The results show that MHV virion RNA, like many other viral RNAs, is translated into a large polyprotein, which is cleaved soon after synthesis into smaller, presumably functional proteins. This is in marked contrast to the synthesis of other MHV proteins, in which minimal proteolytic processing occurs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.216287216,-0.073382663,-0.056201601,0.0213588,-0.012166003,-0.082393528,-0.112797478,0.012974179,0.021820832,-0.063212824,-0.079511692,-0.058804772,0.048235236,-0.01623675,-0.001729203,-0.013542363,0.03293042,0.023195367,0.042315777,0.045154646,-0.049093301,0.027773804,0.002049489,-0.0358943,0.151965336,0.140488645,-0.006604368,-0.043414371,-0.054510125,0.045414474
Recombination between nonsegmented RNA genomes of murine coronaviruses.,"We have isolated a recombinant virus between the A59 and JHM strains of mouse hepatitis virus, which contain a single species of nonsegmented RNA genome. This recombinant was derived by mixed infection of DBT cells with temperature-sensitive mutants of A59 and JHM at nonpermissive temperature. Viruses recovered at this temperature were screened by oligonucleotide fingerprinting of their genomic RNAs. One recombinant virus, B1, was found to contain mostly A59-derived sequences, but the 3 kilobases at the 5' end of the genomic RNA was derived from JHM. Thus, the crossover point in the B1 genome is located within gene A, which codes for the viral RNA polymerases. The study of the intracellular RNA species of B1 virus revealed that probably all of the virus-specific subgenomic mRNA species contained the body sequences of strain A59 but the leader sequences of JHM. This result indicates that the JHM leader RNA, which differs from the A59 leader RNA, could be fused to the mRNAs of a different virus strain during RNA transcription. Furthermore, B1 virus-infected cells contain an additional subgenomic mRNA species which is transcribed from a new initiation site within gene C, suggesting that the leader RNA could determine the site of initiation for coronavirus mRNAs. These data represent a first report of RNA recombination between viruses, other than picornaviruses, which contain nonsegmented RNA genomes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.214006525,-0.069549361,-0.036168862,0.079793507,0.103665066,-0.093441832,-0.111197911,0.041775306,-0.036823157,-0.031182068,-0.006898527,-0.093640773,0.038484507,0.023496255,0.073493576,0.074110291,-0.091170327,0.037786451,0.003492251,0.014919356,0.035286443,0.001406381,0.013224501,0.040625572,0.00667272,-0.014407294,0.015465007,0.014638495,0.004500702,0.054377902

Characterization of two RNA polymerase activities induced by mouse hepatitis virus.,"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity was found in mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59)-infected cells. The enzyme was induced in the infected cells and could not be detected in the MHV-A59 virion. Two peaks of RNA polymerase activity, one early and the other late in infection, were detected. These polymerase activities were in temporal sequence with early and late virus-specific RNA synthesis. Both of them were found to be associated with membrane fractions. There were significant differences in the enzymatic properties of the two polymerases. The early polymerase, but not the late polymerase, could be activated by potassium ions in the absence of magnesium ions and also had a lower optimum pH than the late polymerase. It was therefore probable that the enzymes represent two different species of RNA polymerase and perform different roles in virus-specific RNA synthesis. The effects of cycloheximide on MHV-specific RNA synthesis were determined. Continuous protein synthesis was required for both early and late RNA synthesis and might also be required for shutoff of early RNA synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.22466957,-0.063529523,-0.074008385,0.097104077,-0.025779382,-0.112996199,-0.054268441,0.022959357,-0.026966295,-0.026663493,0.040347188,-0.042737583,0.000366559,0.085555498,0.06505389,0.080852257,-0.054845274,0.016531627,0.030903888,0.016486755,-0.014883094,0.00025611,0.024794696,-0.037634709,0.099210728,0.05456964,-0.04944133,0.011167672,-0.057988587,0.065605249
"Sequence Relationships Between the Genome and the Intracellular RNA Species 1, 3, 6, and 7 of Mouse Hepatitis Virus Strain A59","We have shown by T(1) oligonucleotide fingerprinting that the genome of mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 and its intracellular RNA 1 have identical fingerprints and that RNA 1 and the subgenomic RNAs 3, 6, and 7 contain common sequences. To localize the homologous region between the RNAs, we compared fingerprints of the 3′ terminus of the genome with those of RNA 7. The genome was partially degraded with alkali, and polyadenylate-containing fragments were purified by oligodeoxythymidylate-cellulose chromatography. The fragments were size fractionated by agarose-urea gel electrophoresis, and two pools, x and z, containing 3′-derived fragments of the genome with apparent molecular weights of 0.1 × 10(6) to 0.14 × 10(6) and 0.6 × 10(6) to 0.8 × 10(6), respectively, were further analyzed by RNase T(1) oligonucleotide fingerprinting. Comparison of the fingerprints of RNAs 6 and 7 with those of pools x and z showed that these subgenomic RNAs extend inwards from the 3′ terminus of the genome. The RNA fragments present in pool z were on average slightly larger than RNA 7 as confirmed by the presence in pool z of T(1) oligonucleotide spots specific for RNA 6 but not present in RNA 7. However, two large oligonucleotide spots derived from RNA 7, which were also present in RNAs 1, 3, and 6 and in the virion RNA, were not found in the T(1) oligonucleotide map of pool z. A possible explanation is that the two spots were derived from a leader sequence. The results of UV transcription mapping experiments (L. Jacobs, W. J. M. Spaan, M. C. Horzinek, and B. A. M. van der Zeijst, J. Virol. 39:401-406, 1981) excluded the possibility that such a leader sequence arises by splicing from a larger precursor molecule, but either a virus-specific RNA primer molecule for the synthesis of mRNAs or an RNA polymerase jumping mechanism could explain the presence of a leader sequence.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.21764415,-0.050063909,-0.027121103,0.084598055,0.064402886,-0.143925714,-0.133478428,0.057148385,-0.05139179,-0.037641538,0.029798084,-0.047843648,0.026040647,0.001549676,0.0785753,0.075985385,-0.092284147,0.054571097,0.016362176,-0.016751794,-0.009510986,0.0056552,0.00907976,-0.004101305,-0.012484695,-0.042037266,0.003190217,0.029485921,0.019385094,0.058737777
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in coronavirus- infected cells.,"An enzymatic activity which incorporates [3H]UMP into acid-precipitable material in the presence of endogenous template was found in the cytoplasm of porcine cells infected with the transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine. This activity was not found in uninfected control cells, nor was it found in purified virus. The activity was associated with the mitochondrial fraction of infected cells, suggesting that the enzyme is membrane bound. The activity required the presence of all three ribonucleoside triphosphates in addition to [3H]UTP, and it was not inhibited by actinomycin D. The heated product was digested by RNase but not by DNase. Mg2+ was required for enzymatic activity, and its optimal concentration was approximately 5 mM. The size of the in vitro products was compared by electrophoresis with that of in vivo-synthesized virus-specified RNA to confirm the viral specificity of the polymerase activity. Virus-specified RNA from infected cells consisted of 10 species of single-stranded, polyadenylated RNA with molecular weights of 6.8 X 10(6), 6.2 X 10(6), 3.15 X 10(6), 1.40 X 10(6), 1.05 X 10(6), 0.94 X 10(6), 0.66 X 10(6), 0.39 X 10(6), 0.34 X 10(6), and 0.24 X 10(6). In vitro synthesized RNA consisted of a high-molecular-weight species, of apparently higher molecular weight than genomic RNA, and two single-stranded species that electrophoretically comigrated with the species of 1.40 X 10(6) and 0.66 X 10(6) molecular weight made in vivo.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.132096892,-0.042036972,-0.002884016,0.019615091,-0.025840719,-0.029795101,0.022762849,-0.008749858,-0.016070863,-0.040914181,0.01950346,-0.016458409,-0.06136243,0.07194034,0.019751213,0.015626047,-0.026637433,0.005587019,0.090502228,0.032377479,-0.046070701,-0.003913728,0.08086946,-0.039333799,-0.048197502,-0.002429287,-0.018873322,0.056400483,-0.081039132,0.065970079
"Design, Synthesis, and Anti-RNA Virus Activity of 6′-Fluorinated-Aristeromycin Analogues","[Image: see text] The 6′-fluorinated aristeromycins were designed as dual-target antiviral compounds aimed at inhibiting both the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the host cell S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) hydrolase, which would indirectly target capping of viral RNA. The introduction of a fluorine at the 6′-position enhanced the inhibition of SAH hydrolase and the activity against RNA viruses. The adenosine and N(6)-methyladenosine analogues 2a–e showed potent inhibition against SAH hydrolase, while only the adenosine derivatives 2a–c exhibited potent antiviral activity against all tested RNA viruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, chikungunya virus, and/or Zika virus. 6′,6′-Difluoroaristeromycin (2c) showed the strongest antiviral effect for MERS-CoV, with a ∼2.5 log reduction in infectious progeny titer in viral load reduction assay. The phosphoramidate prodrug 3a also demonstrated potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity, possibly by inhibiting the viral RdRp.

The impact of PARPs and ADP-ribosylation on inflammation and host–pathogen interactions,"Poly-adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerases (PARPs) promote ADP-ribosylation, a highly conserved, fundamental posttranslational modification (PTM). PARP catalytic domains transfer the ADP-ribose moiety from NAD(+) to amino acid residues of target proteins, leading to mono- or poly-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation or PARylation). This PTM regulates various key biological and pathological processes. In this review, we focus on the roles of the PARP family members in inflammation and host–pathogen interactions. Here we give an overview the current understanding of the mechanisms by which PARPs promote or suppress proinflammatory activation of macrophages, and various roles PARPs play in virus infections. We also demonstrate how innovative technologies, such as proteomics and systems biology, help to advance this research field and describe unanswered questions.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.089934946,-0.036939774,-0.00491254,-0.055283592,-0.068433884,0.051777004,0.074592036,-0.021452006,0.043872071,0.012992597,-0.04686308,0.025261324,0.012898178,-0.057685856,-0.017791022,-0.016064049,0.037488543,-0.032324013,-0.054164471,0.018990429,-0.020253048,-0.001799778,-0.035409222,-0.061923041,0.056259221,0.029203765,-0.039925323,0.020481014,0.039999743,-0.068880391
"Divergent coronaviruses detected in wild birds in Brazil, including a central park in São Paulo","Coronaviruses are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses associated with important avian diseases. Their relatively high rates of mutation and recombination frequencies allow them to adapt to new hosts and ecological niches. Although Brazil has 18% of global avian species diversity, studies regarding the presence of avian viral diseases in wild birds in South America are scarce. In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis of the presence of CoVs in 746 wild birds. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were obtained and placed together in vials containing VTM transport medium collected in different regions of Brazil between 2006 and 2013. Screening for viral nucleic acid was performed using conventional RT-PCR and pancoronavirus nested PCR. Positive samples were characterized by partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, and ensuing phylogenetic analysis was performed to investigate the association between virus epidemiology and bird migration routes. Coronavirus RNA were detected and sequenced from six samples, in which three were related to gammacoronaviruses group and the other three to deltacoronavirus group.

Isolation of stem/progenitor cells from normal lung tissue of adult humans,"Objectives: This study aimed to isolate and characterize stem/progenitor cells, starting from normal airway epithelia, obtained from human adults. Materials and methods: Cultures of multicellular spheroids were obtained from human lung tissue specimens after mechanical and enzymatic digestion. Tissue‐specific markers were detected on their cells by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent techniques. Ultrastructural morphology of the spheroids (termed as bronchospheres) was evaluated by electron microscopy, gene expression analysis was performed by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, and gene down‐regulation was analysed by an RNA interference technique. Results: Bronchospheres were found to be composed of cells with high expression of stem cell regulatory genes, which was not or was only weakly detectable in original tissues. Morphological analysis showed that bronchospheres were composed of mixed phenotype cells with type II alveolar and Clara cell features, highlighting their airway resident cell origin. In addition to displaying specific pulmonary and epithelial commitment, bronchospheres showed mesenchymal features. Silencing of the Slug gene, known to play a pivotal role in epithelial–mesenchymal transition processes and which was highly expressed in bronchospheres but not in original tissue, led bronchospheres to gain a differentiated bronchial/alveolar phenotype and to lose the stemness gene expression pattern. Conclusions: Ours is the first study to describe ex vivo expansion of stem/progenitor cells resident in human lung epithelia, and our results suggest that the epithelial–mesenchymal transition process, still active in a subset of airway cells, may regulate transit of stem/progenitor cells towards epithelial differentiation.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.088562763,-0.032066143,0.011357973,-0.108957233,-0.044254197,0.023666815,-0.017189907,-0.058389693,0.060663594,-0.036793534,-0.087462142,-0.058823844,0.000985622,0.13061334,-0.000201826,-0.008723332,-0.011438242,-0.053903312,-0.029812367,-0.049409091,0.073216158,-0.014044932,0.049847235,0.022840908,-0.052680092,-0.011012083,-0.020635133,0.078952633,-0.020586432,-0.068339882
Identification of a novel base J binding protein complex involved in RNA polymerase II transcription termination in trypanosomes,"Base J, β-D-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil, is a modification of thymine DNA base involved in RNA Polymerase (Pol) II transcription termination in kinetoplastid protozoa. Little is understood regarding how specific thymine residues are targeted for J-modification or the mechanism of J regulated transcription termination. To identify proteins involved in J-synthesis, we expressed a tagged version of the J-glucosyltransferase (JGT) in Leishmania tarentolae, and identified four co-purified proteins by mass spectrometry: protein phosphatase (PP1), a homolog of Wdr82, a potential PP1 regulatory protein (PNUTS) and a protein containing a J-DNA binding domain (named JBP3). Gel shift studies indicate JBP3 is a J-DNA binding protein. Reciprocal tagging, co-IP and sucrose gradient analyses indicate PP1, JGT, JBP3, Wdr82 and PNUTS form a multimeric complex in kinetoplastids, similar to the mammalian PTW/PP1 complex involved in transcription termination via PP1 mediated dephosphorylation of Pol II. Using RNAi and analysis of Pol II termination by RNA-seq and RT-PCR, we demonstrate that ablation of PNUTS, JBP3 and Wdr82 lead to defects in Pol II termination at the 3’-end of polycistronic gene arrays in Trypanosoma brucei. Mutants also contain increased antisense RNA levels upstream of transcription start sites, suggesting an additional role of the complex in regulating termination of bi-directional transcription. In addition, PNUTS loss causes derepression of silent Variant Surface Glycoprotein genes involved in host immune evasion. Our results suggest a novel mechanistic link between base J and Pol II polycistronic transcription termination in kinetoplastids.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.14529347,-0.033650001,0.001850138,-0.033103645,-0.046567467,-0.010549342,0.000146088,-0.009479858,0.021733945,-0.046390337,-0.047903325,-0.004136129,-0.02072966,0.027896287,-0.046207162,-0.002240447,0.043673513,-0.072717713,-0.089686231,-0.022218609,-0.004023741,0.027976226,-0.041288226,0.006599409,0.012840234,-0.051453626,-0.021032544,0.026891079,0.044594425,-0.053502583
Evidence for Internal Initiation of RNA Synthesis by the Hepatitis C Virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase NS5B In Cellulo,"Initiation of RNA synthesis by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) NS5B has been extensively studied in vitro and in cellulo. Intracellular replication is thought to rely exclusively on terminal de novo initiation, as it conserves all genetic information of the genome. In vitro, however, additional modes of initiation have been observed. In this study, we aimed to clarify whether the intracellular environment allows for internal initiation of RNA replication by the HCV replicase. We used a dual luciferase replicon harboring a terminal and an internal copy of the viral genomic 5′ untranslated region, which was anticipated to support noncanonical initiation. Indeed, a shorter RNA species was detected by Northern blotting with low frequency, depending on the length and sequence composition upstream of the internal initiation site. By introducing mutations at either site, we furthermore established that internal and terminal initiation shared identical sequence requirements. Importantly, lethal point mutations at the terminal site resulted exclusively in truncated replicons. In contrast, the same mutations at the internal site abrogated internal initiation, suggesting a competitive selection of initiation sites, rather than recombination or template-switching events. In conclusion, our data indicate that the HCV replicase is capable of internal initiation in its natural environment, although functional replication likely requires only terminal initiation. Since many other positive-strand RNA viruses generate subgenomic messenger RNAs during their replication cycle, we surmise that their capability for internal initiation is a common and conserved feature of viral RdRps. IMPORTANCE Many aspects of viral RNA replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) are still poorly understood. The process of RNA synthesis is driven by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) NS5B. Most mechanistic studies on NS5B so far were performed with in vitro systems using isolated recombinant polymerase. In this study, we present a replicon model, which allows the intracellular assessment of noncanonical modes of initiation by the full HCV replicase. Our results add to the understanding of the biochemical processes underlying initiation of RNA synthesis by NS5B by the discovery of internal initiation in cellulo. Moreover, they validate observations made in vitro, showing that the viral polymerase acts very similarly in isolation and in complex with other viral and host proteins. Finally, these observations provide clues about the evolution of RdRps of positive-strand RNA viruses, which might contain the intrinsic ability to initiate internally.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.231305243,-0.078052939,-0.083703413,0.120702356,-0.035719617,-0.099671829,0.000410284,0.050545624,-0.048948893,0.023199303,0.0640493,0.059575558,-0.021058841,0.021988978,-0.017916646,0.002124176,0.015579757,0.082969739,0.131703703,-0.077555586,-0.044614766,-0.001076366,0.034358483,-0.016220598,-0.051947547,-0.057830351,-0.062634898,0.056207256,-0.01639453,-0.005183269
MYCOPLASMA FAUCIUM AND BREAST CANCER,"Viruses and bacteria are the cause of a large number of different human diseases. It is believed that some of them may even contribute to the development of cancer. The present work is dedicated to the identification of mycoplasmas in patients with breast cancer. Mycoplasmas may participate in the development of several human diseases including chronic fatigue syndrome, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, atypical pneumonia, etc. Moreover, there is a reason to believe that mycoplasma can participate in the development of cancer, leukemia and lymphoma.\n\nDNA samples from blood, saliva and tumor tissues of the Oncology Institute of Moldova patients diagnosed with breast cancer were analyzed. Mycoplasma testing was performed using nested PCR method. For Mycoplasma spp. detection, we used primers from the region of the 16S-23S RNA genes. The identification of Mycoplasma faucium, Mycoplasma salivarium and Mycoplasma orale was performed by nested PCR with primers for RNA polymerase beta subunit gene corresponding to mycoplasma.\n\nM.faucium and M.salivarius was found in saliva at about 100%, and M.orale at a frequency of about 50%. Only M.faucium was found with the frequency of about 60% in the tissue of the patients. Moreover, a fairly high rate of detection of mycoplasma is observed both in the cases when primers for RNA polymerase gene and primers for 16S-23S RNA were used.\n\nWe found M.faucium in tumor tissues of patients diagnosed with breast cancer. It is known that mycoplasmas are able to stimulate the synthesis of certain cytokines, which act as mitogenes on the cell. We assume that M.faucium can stimulate the mitogenes synthesis in breast tissues (e.g., cytokines) which, in turn, stimulate cell division and thus participate in the initiation of breast cancer.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.010104727,-0.008700498,0.021108465,-0.047118195,-0.031613643,-0.024677287,-0.011214699,0.044789019,-0.072557551,0.033144094,-0.012761515,-0.007371595,0.018759278,0.030478753,-0.009706011,-0.002245566,0.009089276,0.012392392,-0.017414009,-0.029836951,0.021420547,0.018996972,0.053758131,-1.56E-05,0.0086987,-0.019970517,-0.027161072,0.032235992,0.023447163,-0.031472729
The translational landscape of Zika virus during infection of mammalian and insect cells,"Zika virus is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae, which has recently undergone a rapid expansion among humans in the Western Hemisphere. Here, we report a high-resolution map of ribosomal occupancy of the Zika virus genome during infection of mammalian and insect cells, obtained by ribosome profiling. In contrast to some other flaviviruses such as West Nile, we find no evidence for substantial frameshift-induced ribosomal drop-off during translation of the viral polyprotein, indicating that Zika virus must use alternative mechanisms to downregulate levels of catalytically active viral polymerase. We also show that high levels of ribosome-protected fragments map in-frame to two previously overlooked upstream open reading frames (uORFs) initiating at CUG and UUG codons, with likely consequences for the efficiency of polyprotein expression. Curiously, in African isolates of Zika virus, the two uORFs are fused in-frame into a single uORF. A parallel RNA-Seq analysis reveals the 5' end position of the subgenomic flavivirus RNA in mammalian and insect cells. Together, these provide the first analysis of flavivirus gene expression by ribosome profiling.\n\nAuthor SummaryRecent Zika virus outbreaks have been associated with congenital diseases and neurological complications. An enhanced understanding of the molecular biology of this pathogen may contribute towards the development of improved treatment and control methods. We present a single-codon resolution analysis of Zika virus translation in mammalian and mosquito cells using ribosome profiling. The analysis revealed two hitherto uncharacterized uORFs in the 5' leader of Zika virus Brazilian isolate PE243, both of which are occupied by ribosomes during infection. In contrast, these two uORFs are fused into a single uORF in African isolates. This observation provides a new avenue for further investigations into potential factors involved in the emergence of Zika virus from a rarely detected pathogen into a major epidemic.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.111544285,-0.048656337,-0.009165585,-0.001383763,0.001592045,0.00358576,-0.018133686,0.001862671,0.023832504,0.023428617,-0.041867831,-0.060742864,0.032597982,0.001061414,0.015301452,-0.02418396,-0.009987775,-0.005323442,-0.020390419,0.022032246,-0.002387026,-0.000529566,-0.028444393,0.019177512,-0.059798795,-0.026232674,0.046394111,-6.12E-05,-0.003523856,-0.011174182
Proofreading-deficient coronaviruses adapt over long-term passage for increased fidelity and fitness without reversion of exoribonuclease-inactivating mutations,"The coronavirus (CoV) RNA genome is the largest among single-stranded positive sense RNA viruses. CoVs encode a proofreading 3'[-&gt;]5'exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV high-fidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold decreased fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogs. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in parallel with WT-MHV. Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated enhanced replication, reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and increased competitive fitness. However, passage did not select for complete or partial reversion at the ExoN-inactivating mutations. We identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12-RdRp) and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially account for the observed changes in replication, susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and competitive fitness observed in the passaged virus population, indicating that additional determinants can compensate for the activities of nsp14-ExoN. Our results suggest that while selection favors restoration of replication fidelity in ExoN(-) CoVs, there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) reversion. These results also support the hypothesis that high-fidelity replication is linked to CoV fitness and identify additional candidate proteins that may regulate CoV replication fidelity.\n\nIMPORTANCEUnique among RNA viruses, CoVs encode a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) in nsp14 that mediates high-fidelity RNA genome replication. Proofreading-deficient CoVs with disrupted ExoN activity [ExoN(-)] are either non-viable or have significant defects in replication, RNA synthesis, fidelity, fitness, and virulence. In this study, we show that ExoN(-) murine hepatitis virus can adapt over long-term passage for increased replication and fitness without reverting the ExoN-inactivating mutations. Passage-adapted ExoN(-) mutants also demonstrate increasing resistance to nucleoside analogs that is only partially explained by secondary mutations in nsp12 and nsp14. These data suggest that enhanced resistance to nucleoside analogs is mediated by the interplay of multiple replicase proteins and support the proposed link between CoV fidelity and fitness.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.157860318,0.050264628,-0.114886342,0.065897844,-0.019612439,-0.010085965,0.06734683,0.032524111,-0.008070994,0.006989014,0.08246859,0.041770252,-0.082388193,-0.004214937,0.017508656,0.079371864,-0.04832111,-0.021987025,-0.049985279,-0.011859318,0.091207792,-0.084252238,0.148832441,0.114256069,0.05430465,0.136417702,-0.022039378,-0.101009282,-0.097621857,-0.139114431
Viral fitness predicts the magnitude and direction of perturbations in the infected host transcriptome,"Determining the fitness of viral genotypes has become a standard practice in virology as it is essential to evaluate their evolutionary potential. Darwinian fitness, defined as the advantage of a given genotype with respect to a reference one, is a mesoscopic property that captures into a single figure differences in performance at every stage of viral infection. But to which extent viral fitness results from particular molecular interactions with host factors and regulatory networks during infection? Can we identify host genes, and then functional classes, whose expression depends on viral fitness? Here, we compared the transcriptomes of tobacco plants infected with seven genotypes of tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) that differ in fitness. We found that the larger the fitness differences among genotypes, the more dissimilar the transcriptomic profiles are. Consistently, two different mutations, one in the viral RNA polymerase and another in the viral suppressor of RNA silencing, that led to close fitness values, also resulted in significantly similar gene expression profiles. Moreover, we identified host genes whose expression showed a significant correlation, positive or negative, with TEV fitness. Over-expression of genes with positive correlation activates hormone-and RNA silencing-mediated pathways of plant defense. By contrast, under-expression of genes negatively correlated reduces metabolism, growth, and development. Overall, these results reveal the high information content of viral fitness, and suggest its potential use to predict differences in genomic profiles of infected hosts.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.096591224,-0.042872411,-0.017973776,-0.042510429,-0.040308539,0.018824399,0.055562831,-0.01095673,0.013171069,0.009764554,-0.032103708,-0.026896018,-0.007613685,0.074570645,-0.014324216,-0.005259559,-0.028035356,-0.046816288,-0.061486779,-0.031489428,0.023383618,0.002846158,-0.024945698,0.058277481,-0.109382043,-0.064577809,0.080475787,-0.036080833,0.011387378,-0.011668682
A speed-fidelity trade-off determines the mutation rate and virulence of an RNA virus,"Mutation rates can evolve through genetic drift, indirect selection due to genetic hitchhiking, or direct selection on the physicochemical cost of high fidelity. However, for many systems, it has been difficult to disentangle the relative impact of these forces empirically. In RNA viruses, an observed correlation between mutation rate and virulence has led many to argue that their extremely high mutation rates are advantageous, because they may allow for increased adaptability. This argument has profound implications, as it suggests that pathogenesis in many viral infections depends on rare or de novo mutations. Here we present data for an alternative model whereby RNA viruses evolve high mutation rates as a byproduct of selection for increased replicative speed. We find that a poliovirus antimutator, 3DG64S, has a significant replication defect and that wild type and 3DG64S populations have similar adaptability in two distinct cellular environments. Experimental evolution of 3DG64S under r-selection led to reversion and compensation of the fidelity phenotype. Mice infected with 3DG64S exhibited delayed morbidity at doses well above the LD50, consistent with attenuation by slower growth as opposed to reduced mutational supply. Furthermore, compensation of the 3DG64S growth defect restored virulence, while compensation of the fidelity phenotype did not. Our data are consistent with the kinetic proofreading model for biosynthetic reactions and suggest that speed is more important than accuracy. In contrast to what has been suggested for many RNA viruses, we find that within host spread is associated with viral replicative speed and not standing genetic diversity.\n\nAuthor SummaryMutation rate evolution has long been a fundamental problem in evolutionary biology. The polymerases of RNA viruses generally lack proofreading activity and exhibit extremely high mutation rates. Since most mutations are deleterious and mutation rates are tuned by natural selection, we asked why hasnt the virus evolved to have a lower mutation rate? We used experimental evolution and a murine infection model to show that RNA virus mutation rates may actually be too high and are not necessarily adaptive. Rather, our data indicate that viral mutation rates are driven higher as a result of selection for viruses with faster replication kinetics. We suggest that viruses have high mutation rates, not because they facilitate adaption, but because it is hard to be both fast and accurate.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.106584498,-0.06210924,-0.049805511,0.074895014,-0.019744809,0.022077312,0.102963052,0.018566304,-0.047568615,0.083052325,0.085738839,0.028171753,-0.035042876,-0.00818961,0.029005782,0.03016836,-0.066871259,-0.07195057,-0.097041826,0.004471027,0.100793256,-0.063809549,0.015910622,0.130064443,-0.110487389,0.014324635,0.069551396,-0.064836908,-0.123704964,-0.116707331
G-quadruplex stabilization in the ions and maltose transporters inhibit Salmonella enterica growth and virulence.,"The G-quadruplex structure forming motifs have recently emerged as a novel therapeutic drug target in various human pathogens. Herein, we report three highly conserved G-quadruplex motifs (SE-PGQ-1, 2, and3) in genome of all the 412 strains of Salmonella enterica. Bioinformatics analysis inferred the presence of SE-PGQ-1 in the regulatory region of mgtA, presence of SE-PGQ-2 in the open reading frame of entA and presence of SE-PGQ-3 in the promoter region of malE and malK genes. The products of mgtA and entA are involved in transport and homeostasis of Mg2+ and Fe3+ ion and thereby required for bacterial survival in the presence of reactive nitrogen/oxygen species produced by the host macrophages, whereas, malK and malE genes are involved in transport of maltose sugar, that is one of the major carbon source in the gastrointestinal tract of human. The formation of stable intramolecular G-quadruplex structures by SE-PGQs was confirmed by employing CD, EMSA and NMR spectroscopy. Cellular studies revealed the inhibitory effect of 9-amino acridine on Salmonella enterica growth. Next, CD melting analysis demonstrated the stabilizing effect of 9-amino acridine on SE-PGQs. Further, polymerase inhibition and RT-qPCR assays emphasize the biological relevance of predicted G-quadruplex in the expression of PGQ possessing genes and demonstrate the G-quadruplexes as a potential drug target for the devolping novel therapeutics for combating Salmonella enterica infection.\n\nAuthor SummarySince last several decades scientific community has witnessed a rapid increase in number of such human pathogenic bacterial species that acquired resistant to multiple antibacterial agents. Currently, emergence of multidrug-resistant strains remain a major public health concern for clinical investigators that rings a global alarm to search for novel and highly conserved drug targets. Recently, G-quadruplex structure forming nucleic acid sequences were endorsed as highly conserved Drug target for preventing infection of several human pathogens including viral and protozoan species. Therefore, here we explored the presence G-quadruplex forming motif in genome of Salmonella enterica bacteria that causes food poisoning, and enteric fever in human. The formation of intra molecular G-quadruplex structure in four genes (mgtA, entA, malE and malK) was confirmed by NMR, CD and EMSA. The 9-amino acridine, a known G-quadruplex binder has been shown to stabilize the predicted G-quadruplex motif and decreases the expressioin of G-quadruplex hourbouring genes using RT-PCR and cellular toxicity assay. This study concludes the presence of G-quadruplex motifs in essential genes of Salmonella enterica genome as a novel and conserved drug target and 9-amino acridine as candidate small molecule for preventing the infection of Salmonella enterica using a G4 mediated inhibition mechanism.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.076180925,-0.010745831,0.028465251,-0.050156515,-0.001309926,0.043500507,0.048856466,0.000778737,0.025089253,0.004647685,-0.077346352,0.025143549,0.029304482,-0.061480891,-0.002951322,-0.021226219,0.044960264,0.038686085,-0.033168272,0.002058736,0.021849046,0.037172334,-0.03079071,0.052053876,-0.024021029,-0.029767372,0.041304614,0.016896014,0.07576419,-0.020053371
"Changes in mRNA abundance drive differential shuttling of RNA binding proteins, linking cytoplasmic RNA degradation to transcription","Alterations in global mRNA decay broadly impact multiple stages of gene expression, although signals that connect these processes are incompletely defined. Here, we used tandem mass tag labeling coupled with mass spectrometry to reveal that changing the mRNA decay landscape, as frequently occurs during viral infection, results in subcellular redistribution of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in human cells. Accelerating Xrn1-dependent mRNA decay through expression of a gammaherpesviral endonuclease drove nuclear translocation of many RBPs, including poly(A) tail-associated proteins. Conversely, cells lacking Xrn1 exhibited changes in the localization or abundance of numerous factors linked to mRNA turnover. Using these data, we uncovered a new role for relocalized cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein in repressing recruitment of TATA binding protein and RNA polymerase II to promoters. Collectively, our results show that changes in cytoplasmic mRNA decay can directly impact protein localization, providing a mechanism to connect seemingly distal stages of gene expression.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.149893957,-0.060020812,-0.041584999,-0.071051698,-0.0847348,0.004465871,-0.013844774,-0.041125107,0.055970376,-0.059598662,-0.092537547,-0.059672867,0.011991888,0.08696087,-0.054555724,-0.005372351,0.039365099,-0.116499655,-0.072475008,-0.027289643,0.009646099,0.04508565,-0.006980156,-0.02176382,0.013302745,-0.094351106,-0.028555564,0.03311961,0.106524074,0.003568846
Origins and Evolution of the Global RNA Virome,"Viruses with RNA genomes dominate the eukaryotic virome, reaching enormous diversity in animals and plants. The recent advances of metaviromics prompted us to perform a detailed phylogenomic reconstruction of the evolution of the dramatically expanded global RNA virome. The only universal gene among RNA viruses is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed an iterative computational procedure that alternates the RdRp phylogenetic tree construction with refinement of the underlying multiple sequence alignments. The resulting tree encompasses 4,617 RNA virus RdRps and consists of 5 major branches, 2 of which include positive-sense RNA viruses, 1 is a mix of positive-sense (+) RNA and double-stranded (ds) RNA viruses, and 2 consist of dsRNA and negative-sense (-) RNA viruses, respectively. This tree topology implies that dsRNA viruses evolved from +RNA viruses on at least two independent occasions, whereas -RNA viruses evolved from dsRNA viruses. Reconstruction of RNA virus evolution using the RdRp tree as the scaffold suggests that the last common ancestors of the major branches of +RNA viruses encoded only the RdRp and a single jelly-roll capsid protein. Subsequent evolution involved independent capture of additional genes, particularly, those encoding distinct RNA helicases, enabling replication of larger RNA genomes and facilitating virus genome expression and virus-host interactions. Phylogenomic analysis reveals extensive gene module exchange among diverse viruses and horizontal virus transfer between distantly related hosts. Although the network of evolutionary relationships within the RNA virome is bound to further expand, the present results call for a thorough reevaluation of the RNA virus taxonomy.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe majority of the diverse viruses infecting eukaryotes have RNA genomes, including numerous human, animal, and plant pathogens. Recent advances of metagenomics have led to the discovery of many new groups of RNA viruses in a wide range of hosts. These findings enable a far more complete reconstruction of the evolution of RNA viruses than what was attainable previously. This reconstruction reveals the relationships between different Baltimore Classes of viruses and indicates extensive transfer of viruses between distantly related hosts, such as plants and animals. These results call for a major revision of the existing taxonomy of RNA viruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.221394289,-0.07577398,-0.093885366,0.256078364,0.098377482,-0.087324124,0.072530285,0.079645325,-0.121550957,0.113491422,0.113670278,0.005512501,-0.01490489,0.039428199,0.035569669,-0.033135208,-0.00320753,-0.074805894,-0.010250312,0.010503995,0.017395926,0.018516588,-0.051726916,0.029790488,-0.15178323,-0.064733689,0.045458663,0.002640065,-0.030823561,-0.048636598
FilmArray Respiratory Panel Integrated in a field Point Of Care dispositive for the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections in rural areas in Senegal,"The development of molecular syndrome-based kits for the diagnosis of respiratory infections offers rapid and sensitive detection of common respiratory pathogens and will have a significant impact on the care of patients. In this study, we present the results obtained after the introduction of the FilmArray respiratory panel in a field Point of care (POC) for the diagnosis of virus and bacteria responsible of respiratory tract infections in Senegal rural area. From February to August 2017, we collected nasal swabs from febrile patients that presented symptoms of respiratory tract infections in three health posts located in Niakhar. Specimens were tested on site by multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), using the FilmArray respiratory panel(R) that targets 20 pathogens, including 17 virus and 3 bacteria (bioMerieux). Nasal swabs were collected from 113 patients. The median age was 4 years (ranging from 4 months to 60 years) and 51 (45%) were males. The prevalence of respiratory pathogens was 37.5% (12/32) during the dry season and 54.3% (44/81) in the rainy season (p=0.16). The prevalence of respiratory pathogen carriage was higher in children under 5 years of age (38/55, 69.1%). The most prevalent micro-organisms detected were influenza B virus (16/113, 14%), human rhinovirus/enterovirus (10/113, 9%), parainfluenzae virus (9/113, 8%), respiratory syncytial virus (8/113, 7%), adenovirus (5/113, 4%), human metapneumovirus (3/113, 3%), Chlamydia pneumoniae (2/113, 2%) and Coronavirus (2/113, 2%). The study has demonstrated that the integration of the FilmArray respiratory panel into a field POC could significantly improve the management of respiratory tract infections in rural areas.\n\nAuthor summaryRespiratory tract infections are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Populations in underdeveloped countries are the most affected, especially children under 5 years of age. Among the pathogens responsible for these infections, bacteria and viruses are the most identified. In poor countries, laboratory diagnosis can only be done in urban areas. They are generally based on bacteriological, immunological or molecular biology techniques. The concept of POC is not developed in underdeveloped countries. Its existence would have made it possible to carry out RDTs to confirm the clinicians diagnosis and allow rapid management of the patient. In the current situation, the time required to achieve results is often very long for patients. In this study, we sought to demonstrate the significant contribution of the FilmArray respiratory panel in the management of respiratory tract infections in rural areas. We also wanted to reduce the time it takes to deliver results in order to improve patient care. This dispositif was integrated in a field POC which was implemented in Niakhar since 2015, in order to improve the management of emerging diseases. The FilmArray respiratory panel gave us the opportunity to investigate the causes of respiratory tract infections in this area. For each patient, we systematically target 20 pathogens, including 17 viruses and 3 bacteria, with a single multiplex PCR. One of the main results of this study is that children under 5 years of age are the most affected by respiratory tract infections. Then we noted a lack of consultation among adults that could be explained by the banalization of respiratory problems or a preference for traditional care. The fact that children under 5 years of age are the most affected could also serve as a basis for implementing vaccination programmes directly targeting the most vulnerable age groups. It should be noted that for 51% of patients, the result of the diagnosis was negative. It would appear that some pathogens responsible for respiratory tract infections are not targeted by the multiplex PCR. Thus, it would be necessary to screen these pathogens in order to integrate them into a panel that would cover the most pathogens in circulation in this area.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.27367418,-0.072696291,-0.047706105,0.062646049,0.010783492,-0.08443024,0.040688449,0.004159309,0.029705129,0.101022589,-0.021420724,-0.023553822,0.084954468,-0.058808903,0.045839923,-0.036578654,0.007729764,-0.033092773,0.049166372,0.011010226,0.005799659,-0.060685153,0.03101463,-0.055321662,0.060212334,0.019912712,-0.05709865,0.00338388,0.047207489,-0.091433323
Biological Evaluation of Molecules of the azaBINOL Class as Antiviral Agents: Specific Inhibition of HIV-1 RNase H Activity by 7-Isopropoxy-8-(naphth-1-yl)quinoline,"Inspired by bioactive biaryl-containing natural products found in plants and the marine environment, a series of synthetic compounds belonging to the azaBINOL chiral ligand family was evaluated for antiviral activity against HIV-1. Testing of 39 unique azaBINOLs in a singleround infectivity assay resulted in the identification of three promising antiviral compounds, including 7-isopropoxy-8-(naphth-1-yl)quinoline (azaBINOL B#24), which exhibited low-micromolar activity. The active compounds and several close structural analogues were further tested against three different HIV-1 envelope pseudotyped viruses as well as in a full-virus replication system (EASY-HIT). Mode-of-action studies using a time-of-addition assay indicated that azaBINOL B#24 acts after viral entry but before viral assembly and budding. HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) assays that individually test for polymerase and RNase H activity were used to demonstrate that B#24 inhibits RNase H activity, most likely allosterically. Further binding analysis using bio-layer interferometry (BLI) showed that B#24 interacts with HIV-1 RT in a highly specific manner. These results indicate that azaBINOL B#24 is a potentially viable, novel lead for the development of new HIV-1 RNase H inhibitors. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the survey of libraries of synthetic compounds, designed purely with the goal of facilitating chemical synthesis in mind, may yield unexpected and selective drug leads for the development of new antiviral agents.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.073828216,0.001167487,0.030783098,0.038703971,-0.112520195,0.062851721,0.086137554,-0.013388376,0.02891246,0.018390034,0.010453849,0.055415323,-0.014733206,0.018513706,-0.013396307,-0.010829824,0.002370753,0.101416981,0.05873184,-0.002391689,-0.01706857,0.029187509,-0.020215078,0.07482788,0.04787486,0.044003146,0.059040127,-0.054669141,0.070118629,0.023374521
A specific sequence in the genome of respiratory syncytial virus regulates the generation of copy-back defective viral genomes,"Defective viral genomes of the copy-back type (cbDVGs) are the primary initiators of the antiviral immune response during infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) both in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism governing cbDVG generation remains unknown, thereby limiting our ability to manipulate cbDVG content in order to modulate the host response to infection. Here we report a specific genomic signal that mediates the generation of RSV cbDVGs. Using a customized bioinformatics tool, we identified regions in the RSV genome frequently used to generate cbDVGs during infection. We then created a minigenome system to validate the function of one of these sequences and to determine if specific nucleotides were essential for cbDVG generation at that position. Further, we created a recombinant virus that selectively produced a specific cbDVG based on variations introduced in this sequence. The identified sequence was also found as a common site for cbDVG generation during natural RSV infections, and common cbDVGs generated at this sequence were found among samples from various infected patients. These data demonstrate that sequences encoded in the viral genome are critical determinants of the location of cbDVG generation and, therefore, this is not a stochastic process. Most importantly, these findings open the possibility of genetically manipulating cbDVG formation to modulate infection outcome. Author summaryCopy-back defective viral genomes (cbDVGs) regulate infection and pathogenesis of Mononegavirales. cbDVG are believed to arise from random errors that occur during virus replication and the predominant hypothesis is that the viral polymerase is the main driver of cbDVG generation. Here we describe a specific genomic sequence in the RSV genome that is necessary for the generation of a large proportion of the cbDVG population present during infection. We identified specific nucleotides that when modified altered cbDVG generation at this position, and we created a recombinant virus that selectively produced cbDVGs based on mutations in this sequence. These data demonstrate that the generation of RSV cbDVGs is regulated by specific viral sequences and that these sequences can be manipulated to alter the content and quality of cbDVG generated during infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.042154363,-0.063604452,-0.021084796,-0.010891655,0.00795985,-0.013977627,0.001632536,-0.023299445,0.053756725,-0.008118145,-0.015514985,-0.062831144,-0.009375875,-0.043703836,-0.008624387,-0.009467309,-0.030011277,0.038467349,-0.043358222,0.011180069,0.033888145,-0.054460016,-0.012993822,0.000401032,0.028190991,-0.078528382,0.108427928,0.032860627,-0.039335533,0.052242019
Structure of the SARS-CoV NSP12 polymerase bound to NSP7 and NSP8 co-factors,"Recent history is punctuated by the emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS- and MERS-CoV into human circulation. Upon infecting host cells, coronaviruses assemble a multi-subunit RNA-synthesis complex of viral non-structural proteins (NSP) responsible for the replication and transcription of the viral genome. Here, we present the 3.1 [A] resolution structure of the SARS-CoV NSP12 polymerase bound to its essential co-factors, NSP7 and NSP8, using single particle cryo-electron microscopy. NSP12 possesses an architecture common to all viral polymerases as well as a large N-terminal extension containing a kinase-like fold and is unexpectedly bound by two NSP8 co-factors. This structure illuminates the assembly of the coronavirus core RNA-synthesis machinery, provides key insights into NSP12 polymerase catalysis and fidelity and acts as a template for the design of novel antiviral therapeutics.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.170949987,0.174732696,-0.19108828,0.123517012,-0.045052661,-0.024934982,0.047780775,-0.007492238,0.023838892,0.025765496,0.061438016,0.032350314,-0.009678157,-0.01301112,-0.027177876,0.003855851,0.035728259,-0.067555026,-0.040016452,0.047721637,-0.039750025,0.0393987,-0.004978276,-0.002151378,0.021048146,-0.031554263,-0.040188245,0.008338623,-0.00207338,0.006330791
Stress-Induced Transcriptional Memory Accelerates Promoter-Proximal Pause-Release and Decelerates Termination over Mitotic Divisions,"Heat shock triggers an instant reprogramming of gene and enhancer transcription, but whether cells encode a memory to stress, at the level of nascent transcription, has remained unknown. Here, we measured transcriptional response to acute heat stress in unconditioned cells and in daughters of cells that had been exposed to a single or multiple heat shocks. Tracking RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) genome-wide at nucleotide-resolution revealed that cells precisely remember their transcriptional identity throughout stress, restoring Pol II distribution at gene bodies and enhancers upon recovery. However, single heat shock primed faster gene-induction in the daughter cells by increasing promoter-proximal Pol II pausing, and accelerating the pause-release. In repeatedly stressed cells, both basal and inducible transcription was refined, and pre-mRNA processing decelerated, which retained transcripts on chromatin and reduced recycling of the transcription machinery. These results mechanistically uncovered how the steps of pause-release and termination maintain transcriptional memory over mitosis.\n\nHighlights-Cell type-specific transcription precisely recovers after heat-induced reprogramming\n-Single heat shock primes genes for accelerated induction over mitotic divisions via increased promoter-proximal Pol II pausing and faster pause-release\n-Multiple heat shocks refine basal and inducible transcription over mitotic divisions to support survival of the daughter cells\n-Decelerated termination at active genes reduces recycling of Pol II to heat-activated promoters and enhancers\n-HSF1 increases the rate of promoter-proximal pause-release via distal and proximal regulatory elements",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.120506807,-0.04234283,-0.000621062,-0.0829877,-0.055191618,0.015101987,-0.007098879,-0.027658629,0.052579372,-0.056852757,-0.056026861,-0.046987747,-0.013865831,0.091805926,-0.003378448,0.042333546,-0.010218214,-0.079881262,-0.071865877,-0.037564668,0.044027025,0.010314767,-0.016110744,0.029394726,-0.013351392,-0.069668219,-0.012563533,0.050818972,0.036675686,-0.075555848
Comparative analysis of gene expression in virulent and attenuated strains of infectious bronchitis virus at sub-codon resolution,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a member of the genus Gammacoronavirus and the causative agent of avian infectious bronchitis. IBV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome ~27 kb in length and, like all coronaviruses, produces a set of sub-genomic messenger RNAs (sgmRNAs) synthesised via the viral polymerase. Here, we used RNA sequencing (RNASeq) and ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) to delineate gene expression in the IBV M41-CK and Beau-CK strains at sub-codon resolution. Quantification of reads flanking the programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) signal at the genomic RNA ORF1a/ORF1b junction revealed that PRF in IBV is highly efficient (33-40%), consistent with in vitro measurements. Triplet phasing of the profiling data allowed precise determination of reading frames and revealed the translation of two intergenic genes (4b and 4c on sgmRNA4), which are widely conserved across IBV isolates. RNASeq revealed two novel transcription junction sites in the attenuated Beau-CK strain, one of which would generate a sgmRNA encoding a ribosomally occupied ORF in the viral 3 untranslated region (dORF). Within IBV transcripts, the nucleocapsid (N) protein was unexpectedly found to be inefficiently translated, despite being an abundant structural component of mature IBV virions. Finally, we demonstrate that the host cell response to IBV occurs primarily at the level of transcription, with a global up-regulation of immune-related mRNA transcripts following infection, and comparatively modest changes in the translation efficiencies of host genes.\n\nIMPORTANCEIBV is a major avian pathogen and presents a substantial economic burden to the poultry industry. Improved vaccination strategies are urgently needed to curb the global spread of this pathogen, and the development of suitable vaccine candidates will be aided by an improved understanding of IBV molecular biology. Our high-resolution data have enabled a precise study of transcription and translation in both pathogenic and attenuated forms of IBV, and expand our understanding of gammacoronaviral gene expression. We demonstrate that gene expression shows considerable intra-species variation, with single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with altered production of sgmRNA transcripts, and our RiboSeq data sets enabled us to uncover novel ribosomally occupied ORFs in both strains. We also identify numerous cellular genes and gene networks that are differentially expressed during virus infection, giving insights into the host cell reponse to IBV infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.166528984,-0.046766704,0.043392744,-0.082925313,0.183652005,0.070937948,-0.202182597,-0.088498569,0.146418081,0.324291663,-0.005961904,-0.062597648,-0.033488098,0.055141507,-0.179737403,0.117459566,0.011093971,-0.021192405,-0.014202106,0.052705791,-0.056263618,0.004704417,-0.039266866,-0.033753254,-0.067708396,-0.061703843,0.029066608,0.030829036,0.093443822,-0.034613185
A case for a reverse-frame coding sequence in a group of positive-sense RNA viruses,"Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses form the largest and most diverse group of eukaryote-infecting viruses. Their genomes comprise one or more segments of coding-sense RNA that function directly as messenger RNAs upon release into the cytoplasm of infected cells. Positive-sense RNA viruses are generally accepted to encode proteins solely on the positive strand. However, we previously identified a surprisingly long (~1000 codons) open reading frame (ORF) on the negative strand of some members of the family Narnaviridae which, together with RNA bacteriophages of the family Leviviridae, form a sister group to all other positive-sense RNA viruses. Here, we completed the genomes of three mosquito-associated narnaviruses, all of which have the long reverse-frame ORF. We systematically identified narnaviral sequences in public data sets from a wide range of sources, including arthropod, fungi and plant transcriptomic datasets. Long reverse-frame ORFs are widespread in one clade of narnaviruses, where they frequently occupy >95% of the genome. The reverse-frame ORFs correspond to a specific avoidance of CUA, UUA and UCA codons (i.e. stop codon reverse complements) in the forward-frame RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ORF. However, absence of these codons cannot be explained by other factors such as inability to decode these codons or GC3 bias. Together with other analyses, we provide the strongest evidence yet of coding capacity on the negative strand of a positive-sense RNA virus. As these ORFs comprise some of the longest known overlapping genes, their study may be of broad relevance to understanding overlapping gene evolution and de novo origin of genes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.180878992,-0.051188077,-0.056233362,0.08780503,0.110457523,-0.105123959,-0.083541159,0.076648951,-0.062384539,-0.03108074,-0.00528993,-0.041587399,0.01622959,-0.008328429,0.00853549,-0.03929659,0.0212434,-0.020816198,0.015515956,-0.005285204,-0.074848405,0.021107646,-0.122485321,0.003529915,-0.16140338,-0.100374702,0.029445503,-0.04426695,-0.015785261,-0.072961929
Mutation of Ebola virus VP35 Ser129 uncouples interferon antagonist and replication functions,"Ebolaviruses are non-segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses (NNSVs) within the order Mononegavirales that possess the multifunctional virion protein 35 (VP35), a major determinant of virulence and pathogenesis that is indispensable for viral replication and host innate immune evasion. VP35 is functionally equivalent to the phosphoprotein (P) of other mononegaviruses such as rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses. Phosphorylation of the P protein is universally regarded as functionally important however, a regulatory role(s) of phosphorylation on VP35 function remains unexplored. Here, we identified a highly conserved Ser129 residue near the homo-oligomerization coiled coil motif, which is essential for VP35 functions. Affinity-purification MS followed by post-translational modification (PTM) analysis predicted phosphorylation of Ser129. Co-immunoprecipitation, cross-linking, and biochemical characterization studies revealed a moderately decreased capacity of VP35-S129A to oligomerize. Functional analysis showed that Ser-to-Ala substitution of Ebola virus (EBOV) VP35 did not affect IFN inhibitory activity but nearly abolished EBOV minigenome activity. Further coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated a lost interaction between VP35-S129A and the amino terminus of the viral polymerase but not between viral nucleoprotein (NP) or VP35-WT. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that phosphorylation modulates VP35 function, supporting VP35 as a NNSV P protein and providing a potentially valuable therapeutic target.\n\nImportanceEbola virus (EBOV) can cause severe disease in humans. The 2013-2016 West African epidemic and the two recent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo underscore the urgent need for effective countermeasures, which remain lacking. A better understanding of EBOV biology and the modulation of multifunctional viral proteins is desperately needed to develop improved therapeutics. We provide evidence here that function of virion protein 35 (VP35) is modulated by phosphorylation of Ser129, a conserved residue among other ebolavirus species.

Direct RNA nanopore sequencing of full-length coronavirus genomes provides novel insights into structural variants and enables modification analysis,"Sequence analyses of RNA virus genomes remain challenging due to the exceptional genetic plasticity of these viruses. Because of high mutation and recombination rates, genome replication by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases leads to populations of closely related viruses, so-called quasispecies. Standard (short-read) sequencing technologies are ill-suited to reconstruct large numbers of full-length haplotypes of (i) RNA virus genomes and (ii) subgenome-length (sg) RNAs comprised of noncontiguous genome regions. Here, we used a full-length, direct RNA sequencing (DRS) approach based on nanopores to characterize viral RNAs produced in cells infected with a human coronavirus.\n\nUsing DRS, we were able to map the longest ([~]26 kb) contiguous read to the viral reference genome. By combining Illumina and nanopore sequencing, we reconstructed a highly accurate consensus sequence of the human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E genome (27.3 kb). Furthermore, using long reads that did not require an assembly step, we were able to identify, in infected cells, diverse and novel HCoV-229E sg RNAs that remain to be characterized. Also, the DRS approach, which circumvents reverse transcription and amplification of RNA, allowed us to detect methylation sites in viral RNAs. Our work paves the way for haplotype-based analyses of viral quasispecies by demonstrating the feasibility of intra-sample haplotype separation.\n\nEven though several technical challenges remain to be addressed to exploit the potential of the nanopore technology fully, our work illustrates that direct RNA sequencing may significantly advance genomic studies of complex virus populations, including predictions on long-range interactions in individual full-length viral RNA haplotypes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.18665703,-0.046711196,-0.044810278,0.142858364,0.079766903,-0.105246724,0.013381597,0.036589154,-0.019822543,0.042554091,0.015727959,0.044099239,0.161758218,0.068312289,0.055674702,0.062592915,-0.11535328,-0.00627674,-0.078560113,0.041538622,-0.020506202,0.013700045,-0.018972632,0.011737972,-0.08848579,-0.091838931,0.077039877,0.007968798,-0.05688962,0.056811389
Identification of a Novel Base J Binding Protein Complex Involved in RNA Polymerase II Transcription Termination in Trypanosomes,"Base J, {beta}-D-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil, is a modification of thymine DNA base involved in RNA Polymerase (Pol) II transcription termination in kinetoplastid protozoa. Little is understood regarding how specific thymine residues are targeted for J-modification or the mechanism of J regulated transcription termination. To identify proteins involved in J-synthesis, we expressed a tagged version of the J-glucosyltransferase (JGT) in Leishmania tarentolae, and identified four co-purified proteins by mass spectrometry: protein phosphatase (PP1), a homolog of Wdr82, a potential PP1 regulatory protein (PNUTS) and a protein containing a J-DNA binding domain (named JBP3). Gel shift studies indicate JBP3 is a J-DNA binding protein. Reciprocal tagging, co-IP and sucrose gradient analyses indicate PP1, JGT, JBP3, Wdr82 and PNUTS form a multimeric complex in kinetoplastids, similar to the mammalian PTW/PP1 complex involved in transcription termination via PP1 mediated dephosphorylation of Pol II. Using RNAi and analysis of Pol II termination by RNA-seq and RT-PCR, we demonstrate that ablation of PNUTS, JBP3 and Wdr82 lead to defects in Pol II termination at the 3-end of polycistronic gene arrays in Trypanosoma brucei. Mutants also contain increased antisense RNA levels upstream of promoters, suggesting an additional role of the complex in regulating termination of bi-directional transcription. In addition, PNUTS loss causes derepression of silent Variant Surface Glycoprotein genes important for host immune evasion. Our results provide the first direct mechanistic link between base J and regulation of Pol II termination and suggest a novel molecular model for the role of the CTD of Pol II in terminating polycistronic transcription in trypanosomatids.\n\nAuthor SummaryTrypanosoma brucei is an early-diverged parasitic protozoan that causes African sleeping sickness in humans. The genome of T. brucei is organized into polycistronic gene clusters that contain multiple genes that are co-transcribed from a single promoter. We have recently described the presence of a modified DNA base J and variant of histone H3 (H3.V) at transcription termination sites within gene clusters where the loss of base J and H3.V leads to read-through transcription and the expression of downstream genes. We now identify a novel stable multimeric complex containing a J binding protein (JBP3), base J glucosyltransferase (JGT), PP1 phosphatase, PP1 interactive-regulatory protein (PNUTS) and Wdr82, which we refer to as PJW/PP1. A similar complex (PTW/PP1) has been shown to be involved in Pol II termination in humans and yeast. We demonstrate that PNUTS, JBP3 and Wdr82 mutants lead to read-through transcription in T. brucei. Our data suggest the PJW/PP1 complex regulates termination by recruitment to termination sites via JBP3-base J interactions and dephosphorylation of specific proteins (including Pol II and termination factors) by PP1. These findings significantly expand our understanding of mechanisms underlying transcription termination in eukaryotes, including divergent organisms that utilize polycistronic transcription and novel epigenetic marks such as base J and H3.V. The studies also provide the first direct mechanistic link between J modification of DNA at termination sites and regulated Pol II termination and gene expression in kinetoplastids.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.133195362,-0.034118149,0.003276768,-0.046159822,-0.038073539,0.003293517,0.004376813,-0.010340468,0.028335777,-0.045394221,-0.060664247,-0.00747191,-0.013100364,0.018180774,-0.045681633,0.003002248,0.029631334,-0.070251413,-0.094636566,-0.025690748,0.006044099,0.02165049,-0.04337704,0.015093214,-0.002147179,-0.059719326,-0.016277327,0.025783167,0.049464031,-0.060026283
Bat coronavirus phylogeography in the western Indian Ocean,"Bats are important reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens, including coronaviruses (CoVs). The Western Indian Ocean (WIO) islands are a biodiversity hotspot with more than 50 bat species. Here we tested 1,099 bats belonging to 39 species from Mozambique, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Reunion Island and Seychelles. Based on molecular screening and partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene, a total of 88 bats (8.0% {+/-} 1.6%) tested positive for bat-borne coronaviruses (CoVs), with higher prevalence in Mozambican bats (19.6% {+/-} 4.7%) as compared to those sampled on islands (4.2% {+/-} 1.2%). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that a large diversity of - and {beta}-CoVs are maintained in bat populations of the WIO, some being genetically related to human CoVs (e.g. NL63, MERS). Finally, we found a strong signal of co-evolution between CoVs and their bat host species with limited evidence for host-switching, except for bat species sharing day roost sites.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.093177088,0.102856183,-0.07234728,0.000882727,0.427843552,0.169917255,0.389577082,0.164918564,-0.16135512,-0.098845254,-0.152939303,-0.163229425,-0.070293669,0.112367068,-0.088131242,0.126312706,0.020089316,0.093020837,0.025680106,-0.012817016,-0.068437446,-0.041081129,0.05979127,-0.122210987,0.057518608,0.046119997,-0.027509727,-0.012121407,0.019420331,0.027463339
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase speed and fidelity are not the only determinants of the mechanism or efficiency of recombination.,"Using the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from poliovirus (PV) as our model system, we have shown that Lys-359 in motif-D functions as a general acid in the mechanism of nucleotidyl transfer. A K359H (KH) RdRp derivative is slow and faithful relative to wild-type enzyme. In the context of the virus, RdRp-coding sequence evolves, selecting for the following substitutions: I331F (IF, motif-C) and P356S (PS, motif-D). We have evaluated IF-KH, PS-KH, and IF-PS-KH viruses and enzymes. The speed and fidelity of each double mutant are equivalent. Each exhibits a unique recombination phenotype, with IF-KH being competent for copy-choice recombination and PS-KH being competent for forced-copy-choice recombination. Although the IF-PS-KH RdRp exhibits biochemical properties within twofold of wild type, the virus is impaired substantially for recombination in cells. We conclude that there are biochemical properties of the RdRp in addition to speed and fidelity that determine the mechanism and efficiency of recombination. The interwoven nature of speed, fidelity, the undefined property suggested here, and recombination makes it impossible to attribute a single property of the RdRp to fitness. However, the derivatives described here may permit elucidation of the importance of recombination on the fitness of the viral population in a background of constant polymerase speed and fidelity.\n\nSignificanceThe availability of a \""universal\"" method to create attenuated viruses for use as vaccine strains would permit a rapid response to outbreaks of newly emerging viruses. Targeting RdRp fidelity has emerged as such a universal approach. However, because polymerase fidelity and speed are inextricably linked, the effort to attribute the attenuated phenotype to a single biochemical property of the RdRp may be futile. Here, we show that this circumstance is even more complex. We provide evidence for the existence of a biochemical parameter that combines with fidelity and speed to govern the mechanism and/or efficiency of recombination. We conclude that the field will be served best by continued emphasis on discovery of manipulatable functions of the RdRp instead of debating the importance of individual properties.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.140980393,-0.036757498,-0.034301457,0.059608093,-0.012705457,-0.004310981,0.089887296,0.017471045,-0.060542835,0.06775214,0.13008862,0.1651033,-0.108819662,-0.096100952,-0.014177551,0.01864748,-0.026563016,-0.072953631,-0.128363654,-0.070940776,0.180048005,-0.132233932,0.115622443,0.077300712,-0.029041798,0.087127377,0.068128714,-0.01527604,-0.071208618,-0.052943253
Astrovirus in Reunion Free-tailed Bat (Mormopterus francoismoutoui),"Astroviruses (AstVs) are RNA viruses responsible for infection of a large diversity of avian and mammalian species, including bats, livestock, and humans. We investigated AstV infection in a free-tailed bat species, Mormopterus francoismoutoui, endemic to Reunion Island. A total of 190 guano samples were collected in a maternity colony during 19 different sampling sessions, between June 2016 and June 2017. Biological material was tested for the presence of the AstV RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) gene with a pan-AstV semi-nested polymerase chain reaction assay. In total, 15 guano samples (7.9%) tested positive, with high genetic diversity of the partial RdRp gene sequences among positive samples. A phylogenetic analysis further revealed that the detected viruses were genetically related to AstVs reported in reptiles, dogs, and pigs, but did not cluster with AstVs commonly found in bats. Although more investigation need to be conducted to assess the level of infected bats in the studied population, our findings suggest that Reunion free-tailed bats are exposed to AstV, and that cross-species transmission may occur with other hosts sharing the same habitat.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.067729935,0.028988613,-0.002685601,0.011206388,0.298156897,0.083465541,0.218429754,0.096244604,-0.144278957,-0.044171379,-0.002602721,-0.057657345,-0.099784567,0.068623378,-0.00455075,0.029086069,0.0058583,0.000954571,0.031495985,-0.025404347,0.025865844,0.004152203,-0.012771537,-0.085780844,0.011403991,0.021733465,-0.015920121,0.030579042,-0.001941391,0.03040341
Herpesvirus infection reduces Pol II occupancy of host promoters but spares viral promoters,"In mammalian cells, widespread acceleration of cytoplasmic mRNA degradation is linked to impaired RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription. This mRNA decay-induced transcriptional repression occurs during infection with gammaherpesviruses including Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), which encode an mRNA endonuclease that initiates widespread RNA decay. Here, we show that MHV68-induced mRNA decay leads to a genome-wide reduction of Pol II occupancy at mammalian promoters. Viral genes, despite the fact that they require Pol II for transcription, escape this transcriptional repression. Protection is not governed by viral promoter sequences; instead, location on the viral genome is both necessary and sufficient to escape the transcriptional repression effects of mRNA decay. We hypothesize that the ability to escape from transcriptional repression is linked to the localization of viral DNA in replication compartments, providing a means for these viruses to counteract decay-induced viral transcript loss.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.123323746,-0.060011521,-0.024687147,-0.05088289,-0.07521076,-0.00308738,0.018475024,-0.011795256,0.02599157,-0.035878314,-0.044218655,-0.073299784,0.01288354,0.086811758,-0.010701064,0.041867861,-0.012155132,-0.103479732,-0.104321722,-0.016986201,0.009946145,0.042642558,-0.06145141,0.036109193,-0.020472087,-0.157576683,-0.031720418,0.039467606,0.107957846,-0.033447938
First isolation and characterisation of Alongshan virus in Russia,"In recent decades, many new flavi-like viruses have been discovered predominantly in different invertebrates and, as was recently shown, some of them may cause disease in humans. The Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) group holds a special place among flavi-like viruses because, in contrast to the ""classic"" flaviviruses and other flavi-like viruses, they have a segmented ssRNA(+) genome. Two segments of the JMTV genome have homology with regions of the flavivirus genome encoding polymerase and helicase-protease proteins. JMTVs have several open reading frames (ORF) in segments encoding glycoprotein(s) and capsid protein and these ORF are specific only to them. JMTVs greatly differ in virion size. We isolated three strains of Alongshan virus (ALSV), which is a representative of the JMTV group, from adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks collected in two geographically-separated Russian regions in the tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Most virions purified from tick cells were spherical with a diameter of approximately 40.5 nm. In addition, we found smaller particles of approximately 13.1 nm in diameter. We obtained full genome sequences of all four segments of two of the isolated ALSV strains, and partial sequences of one segment from the third strain. Phylogenetic analysis on genome segment 2 of the JMTV group clustered our novel strains with other ALSV strains. We found evidence for the existence of a novel upstream ORF in the glycoprotein-coding segment of ALSV and other members of the JMTV group. Significance StatementWe isolated three strains of Alongshan virus (ALSV) from adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks from two geographically separate areas of Russia in the Ixodes ricinus tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Our study confirmed the value of tick cell lines in virus isolation and maintenance of persistent infection. The majority of virions of the ALSV strain Miass527 were enveloped spherical particles with a diameter of 40.5{+/-}3.7 nm.

Nucleotide Analogues as Inhibitors of Viral Polymerases,"Coronaviruses such as the newly discovered virus from Wuhan, China, 2019-nCoV, and the viruses that cause SARS and MERS, have resulted in regional and global public health emergencies. Based on our molecular insight that the hepatitis C virus and the coronavirus use a similar viral genome replication mechanism, we reasoned that the FDA-approved drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) for the treatment of hepatitis C will also inhibit the above coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV. To develop broad spectrum anti-viral agents, we further describe a novel strategy to design and synthesize viral polymerase inhibitors, by combining the ProTide Prodrug approach used in the development of Sofosbuvir with the use of 3-blocking groups that we have previously built into nucleotide analogues that function as polymerase terminators.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.059959021,0.082087501,-0.077461883,0.024805511,-0.06576333,0.073321752,0.063718225,0.028335859,0.033098164,0.064947846,-0.002677046,0.01106214,0.065023489,-0.046656145,0.029232724,-0.015493385,-0.057106514,0.147982552,0.015052552,0.006603083,-0.04653481,0.055722004,-0.137884607,0.013233478,0.042053752,0.069397367,0.148882371,-0.014411248,0.065729274,-0.052092889
Rapid reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 using a synthetic genomics platform,"Reverse genetics has been an indispensable tool revolutionising our insights into viral pathogenesis and vaccine development. Large RNA virus genomes, such as from Coronaviruses, are cumbersome to clone and to manipulate in E. coli hosts due to size and occasional instability1-3. Therefore, an alternative rapid and robust reverse genetics platform for RNA viruses would benefit the research community. Here we show the full functionality of a yeast-based synthetic genomics platform for the genetic reconstruction of diverse RNA viruses, including members of the Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae and Paramyxoviridae families. Viral subgenomic fragments were generated using viral isolates, cloned viral DNA, clinical samples, or synthetic DNA, and reassembled in one step in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using transformation associated recombination (TAR) cloning to maintain the genome as a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC). T7-RNA polymerase has been used to generate infectious RNA, which was then used to rescue viable virus. Based on this platform we have been able to engineer and resurrect chemically-synthetized clones of the recent epidemic SARS-CoV-24 in only a week after receipt of the synthetic DNA fragments.

Partial RdRp sequences offer a robust method for Coronavirus subgenus classification,"The recent reclassification of the Riboviria, and the introduction of multiple new taxonomic categories including both subfamilies and subgenera for coronaviruses (family Coronaviridae, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) represents a major shift in how official classifications are used to designate specific viral lineages. While the newly defined subgenera provide much-needed standardisation for commonly cited viruses of public health importance, no method has been proposed for the assignment of subgenus based on partial sequence data, or for sequences that are divergent from the designated holotype reference genomes. Here, we describe the genetic variation of a partial region of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is one of the most used partial sequence loci for both detection and classification of coronaviruses in molecular epidemiology. We infer Bayesian phylogenies from more than 7000 publicly available coronavirus sequences and examine clade groupings relative to all subgenus holotype sequences. Our phylogenetic analyses are largely coherent with genome-scale analyses based on designated holotype members for each subgenus. Distance measures between sequences form discrete clusters between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can attribute subgenus or indicate sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both accurately and robustly. We thus propose that partial RdRp sequence data of coronaviruses is sufficient for the attribution of subgenus-level taxonomic classifications and we supply the R package, ""MyCoV"", which provides a method for attributing subgenus and assessing the reliability of the attribution. Importance StatementThe analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplicons derived from biological samples is the most common modern method for detection and classification of infecting viral agents, such as Coronaviruses. Recent updates to the official standard for taxonomic classification of Coronaviruses, however, may leave researchers unsure as to whether the viral sequences they obtain by these methods can be classified into specific viral taxa due to variations in the sequences when compared to type strains. Here, we present a plausible method for defining genetic dissimilarity cut-offs that will allow researchers to state which taxon their virus belongs to and with what level of certainty. To assist in this, we also provide the R package MyCoV which classifies user generated sequences.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.109356809,0.014291333,0.02557558,0.047387605,0.145058601,0.001586558,0.041127983,0.022099718,-0.050346577,0.056304444,-0.020364677,0.014741456,0.060545396,-0.095870916,-0.017393465,-0.046604043,-0.017798844,-0.000123152,-0.050773971,-0.018540896,0.011846975,-0.011192332,-0.015992999,0.027294081,-0.024720709,-0.057635981,0.03892084,0.015334028,0.011566473,0.057869585
Aerodynamic Characteristics and RNA Concentration of SARS-CoV-2 Aerosol in Wuhan Hospitals during COVID-19 Outbreak,"Background: The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has spread rapidly and sparked global concern. While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear, the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been little studied. Methods: Thirty-five aerosol samples of three different types (total suspended particle, size segregated and deposition aerosol) were collected in Patient Areas (PAA) and Medical Staff Areas (MSA) of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Renmin) and Wuchang Fangcang Field Hospital (Fangcang), and Public Areas (PUA) in Wuhan, China during COVID-19 outbreak. A robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method was employed to quantitate the viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and determine aerosol RNA concentration. Results: The ICU, CCU and general patient rooms inside Renmin, patient hall inside Fangcang had undetectable or low airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but deposition samples inside ICU and air sample in Fangcang patient toilet tested positive. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 in Fangcang MSA had bimodal distribution with higher concentration than those in Renmin during the outbreak but turned negative after patients number reduced and rigorous sanitization implemented. PUA had undetectable airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but obviously increased with accumulating crowd flow. Conclusions: Room ventilation, open space, proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Gathering of crowds with asymptomatic carriers is a potential source of airborne SARS-CoV-2. The virus aerosol deposition on protective apparel or floor surface and their subsequent resuspension is a potential transmission pathway and effective sanitization is critical in minimizing aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.016812325,0.398131934,-0.190198368,-0.018438342,-0.034482746,0.037649456,-0.03582094,-0.08300955,-0.00877877,-0.012522552,0.012391493,-0.00930499,-0.013993815,-0.060376528,0.059623985,0.040817494,-0.046939636,-0.010907227,-0.002726065,-0.005406095,-0.023377734,0.025190144,-0.028084815,-0.00330344,-0.032220288,0.005250253,0.011495528,0.049393597,-0.016305638,0.006754422
A data-driven drug repositioning framework discovered a potential therapeutic agent targeting COVID-19,"AbstractThe global spread of SARS-CoV-2 requires an urgent need to find effective therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19. We developed a data-driven drug repositioning framework, which applies both machine learning and statistical analysis approaches to systematically integrate and mine large-scale knowledge graph, literature and transcriptome data to discover the potential drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. The retrospective study using the past SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV data demonstrated that our machine learning based method can successfully predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus. Our in silico screening followed by wet-lab validation indicated that a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor, CVL218, currently in Phase I clinical trial, may be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Our in vitro assays revealed that CVL218 can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 replication without obvious cytopathic effect. In addition, we showed that CVL218 is able to suppress the CpG-induced IL-6 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that it may also have anti-inflammatory effect that is highly relevant to the prevention immunopathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic evaluation in rats and monkeys showed a high concentration of CVL218 in lung and observed no apparent signs of toxicity, indicating the appealing potential of this drug for the treatment of the pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, molecular docking simulation suggested that CVL218 may bind to the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2, providing a possible model to explain its antiviral action. We also proposed several possible mechanisms to explain the antiviral activities of PARP1 inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, based on the data present in this study and previous evidences reported in the literature. In summary, the PARP1 inhibitor CVL218 discovered by our data-driven drug repositioning framework can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of COVID-19.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.04879302,0.432563283,-0.226352111,-0.018611077,-0.127629351,0.098582739,0.015568838,-0.117032096,0.082586279,0.004463444,-0.002940418,-0.003432929,0.009894619,-0.038727695,-0.00831997,-0.001477475,-0.031673535,0.054191763,0.028018678,0.006168509,-0.015136137,0.048543886,-0.002877557,0.045954493,0.049458006,0.028388795,0.050377871,0.021937225,0.084422248,0.014879155
High sensitivity detection of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 using multiplex PCR and a multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method,"Many detection methods have been used or reported for the diagnosis and/or surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. Among them, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive, claiming detection of about 5 copies of viruses. However, it has been reported that only 47-59% of the positive cases were identified by RT-PCR, probably due to loss or degradation of virus RNA in the sampling process, or even mutation of the virus genome. Therefore, developing highly sensitive methods is imperative to ensure robust detection capabilities. With the goal of improving sensitivity and accommodate various application settings, we developed a multiplex-PCR-based method comprised of 172 pairs of specific primers, and demonstrate its efficiency to detect SARS-CoV-2 at low copy numbers. The assay produces clean characteristic target peaks of defined sizes, which allows for direct identification of positives by electrophoresis. In addition, optional sequencing can provide further confirmation as well as phylogenetic information of the identified virus(es) for specific strain discrimination, which will be of paramount importance for surveillance purposes that represent a global health imperative. Finally, we also developed in parallel and tested a multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method that is amenable to detect SARS-CoV-2, with the additional benefit of its potential for uncovering mutational diversity and novel pathogens at low sequencing depth.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.039657923,0.308174474,0.099171027,0.144871053,0.009298699,-0.016940817,-0.013984504,-0.08067049,-0.020495179,0.045664242,0.002657517,-0.037324743,0.032987372,-0.022115474,0.038405221,-0.013999628,0.001224891,-0.041654692,-0.038839606,-0.060919376,-0.007970027,0.035501294,0.055090435,0.033933779,-0.013001967,-0.015270305,0.042087054,0.014993992,-0.014154966,0.007993378
Nucleotide Analogues as Inhibitors of SARS-CoV Polymerase,"SummarySARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronavirus family, has caused a global public health emergency.1 Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously reasoned that the FDA-approved heptatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) should inhibit coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.2 Here, using model polymerase extension experiments, we demonstrate that the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is incorporated by low-fidelity polymerases and SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and blocks further incorporation by these polymerases; the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is not incorporated by a host-like high-fidelity DNA polymerase. Using the same molecular insight, we selected two other anti-viral agents, Alovudine and AZT (an FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV RdRp. We demonstrate the ability of two HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 3’-fluoro-3’-deoxythymidine triphosphate and 3’-azido-3’-deoxythymidine triphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of Alovudine and AZT), to be incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp where they also terminate further polymerase extension. Given the 98% amino acid similarity of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps, we expect these nucleotide analogues would also inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase. These results offer guidance to further modify these nucleotide analogues to generate more potent broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus agents.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.117133394,0.380506243,-0.236209191,0.085316018,-0.069182643,0.051813258,0.05322518,-0.123580726,0.010720876,0.042912871,0.067364175,0.076825199,-0.020336517,-0.103851792,-0.011969076,-0.003832354,-0.014177105,0.039855149,0.01863832,-0.023518219,0.025296842,-0.004778927,0.058510778,0.089460233,0.029887546,0.010820864,0.029803402,-0.018337042,0.047352775,0.018586946
Evidence and characteristics of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2,"Background: On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 in humans was reported in Wuhan, and then spread fast to other provinces, China. We analyzed data from field investigations and genetic sequencing to describe the evidence and characteristics of human-to-human transmission in Guangdong Province. Methods: A confirmed COVID-19 case was defined if a suspected case was verified with positive of SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs, nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), or endotracheal aspirates by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) or genetic sequencing. Field investigations were conducted for each confirmed case. Clinical and demographic data of confirmed cases were collected from medical records. Exposure and travel history were obtained by interview. Results: A total of 1,151 confirmed cases were identified as of February 10, 2020 in Guangdong Province, China. Of them, 697 (60.1%) cases were from 234 cluster infections. Two hundred and fourteen (18.6%) were secondary cases, in which 144 cases were from family cluster infections. With the epidemic continuing, although familial cluster events were dominated, community cluster events increased with a nosocomial event. The whole genomes within the same family cluster infections were identical, and presented a few unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) compared with SARS-CoV-2 identified on December 2019 in Wuhan. Conclusions: We observed evident human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong, China. Although most of them were from family cluster infections, community and nosocomial infections were increasing. Our findings indicate that human-to-human transmission risks are transferring from family to community in Guangdong Province.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.088544173,0.186000085,-0.087577735,-0.043306879,0.033157727,0.02454594,-0.007700579,-0.000641827,-0.009152586,-0.015166379,0.014345212,0.046209073,-0.019610157,-0.053206979,0.048282438,-0.00875673,-0.050082518,0.052252988,-0.038059339,-0.028011412,-0.005678167,0.092673825,-0.149792623,-0.014067302,-0.033135957,0.116672292,0.085578602,0.105322577,0.016200944,-0.063443685

Clinical characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in China,"Background: Since December 2019, acute respiratory disease (ARD) due to 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. We sought to delineate the clinical characteristics of these cases. Methods: We extracted the data on 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/provincial municipalities through January 29th, 2020. Results: The median age was 47.0 years, and 41.90% were females. Only 1.18% of patients had a direct contact with wildlife, whereas 31.30% had been to Wuhan and 71.80% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%) were the most common symptoms. Diarrhea is uncommon. The median incubation period was 3.0 days (range, 0 to 24.0 days). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (50.00%). Significantly more severe cases were diagnosed by symptoms plus reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction without abnormal radiological findings than non-severe cases (23.87% vs. 5.20%, P<0.001). Lymphopenia was observed in 82.1% of patients. 55 patients (5.00%) were admitted to intensive care unit and 15 (1.36%) succumbed. Severe pneumonia was independently associated with either the admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death in multivariate competing-risk model (sub-distribution hazards ratio, 9.80; 95% confidence interval, 4.06 to 23.67). Conclusions: The 2019-nCoV epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Normal radiologic findings are present among some patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The disease severity (including oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count and chest X-ray/CT manifestations) predict poor clinical outcomes.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.168189004,0.031796656,-0.105969937,-0.148633882,-0.070264943,-0.019965001,-0.063334158,0.108134416,-0.113066226,0.002298144,-0.000122957,0.074277308,-0.039554396,-0.002202671,-0.026479256,0.039167137,-0.047959694,0.138876771,-0.04004993,0.002428093,-0.052894625,0.043550919,-0.223004512,-0.094067757,0.014419203,0.123983477,0.15613008,0.020429363,-0.004083486,-0.100670489
"Single-cell RNA expression profiling of ACE2, the putative receptor of Wuhan 2019-nCoV, in the nasal tissue","A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spreads to the other Provinces of China. WHO decides to determine a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) of 2019-nCoV. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the tissues at different locations of the respiratory tract. The result indicates that the ACE2 expression appears in nasal epithelial cells. We found that the size of this population of ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells is comparable with the size of the population of ACE2-expression type II alveolar cells (AT2) in the Asian sample reported by Yu Zhao et al. We further detected 2019-nCoV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the nasal-swab and throat-swab of seven suspected cases. We found that 2019-nCoV tends to have a higher concentration in the nasal-swab comparing to the throat-swab, which could attribute to the ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells. We hope this study could be informative for virus-prevention strategy development, especially the treatment of nasal mucus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.018206039,0.058839749,-0.038327354,-0.079244572,-0.052933793,0.023384862,-0.00507756,-0.00864707,0.012265859,-0.028550478,-0.009734138,-0.003106379,-0.010432249,0.026606016,0.051465997,0.032277943,-0.045026678,0.019467396,-0.008896718,-0.095701532,-0.013610142,0.031712468,-0.120820521,-0.089033401,0.045151892,0.120660524,0.141381349,0.070059662,0.043813462,-0.135753201
Comparison of throat swabs and sputum specimens for viral nucleic acid detection in 52 cases of novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19),"Abstract Background: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. Diagnostic test based on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (qRT-PCR) was the main means of confirmation, and sample collection was mostly throat swabs, which was easy to miss the diagnosis. It is necessary to seek specimen types with higher detection efficiency and accuracy. Methods: Paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum were obtained from 54 cases, and RNA was extracted and tested for 2019-nCoV (equated with SARS-CoV-2) by qRT-PCR assay. Results: The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. Sputum specimens showed a significantly higher positive rate than throat swabs in detecting viral nucleic acid using qRT-PCR assay (P=0.001). Conclusions: The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens are significantly higher than throat swabs. We suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of 2019-nCoV in patients who produce sputum. The results can facilitate the selection of specimens and increase the accuracy of diagnosis.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.096333817,0.178160918,0.025305832,-0.020688695,-0.054522131,-0.045252096,-0.044615994,0.026376238,-0.087334343,0.002958225,0.006932422,0.024946619,-0.013837491,0.004188706,0.009452278,-0.001374445,-0.034661404,0.040219022,-0.015468969,-0.118361756,-0.053398547,0.068699472,-0.088119155,-0.124329062,0.013744544,0.143825667,0.175666834,0.05863178,0.029230422,-0.075695307
The infection evidence of SARS-COV-2 in ocular surface： a single-center cross-sectional study,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to identify whether SARS-COV-2 infected in ocular surface. Methods: Cross-sectional study of patients presenting for who received a COVID-19 diagnosis, from December 30, 2019 to February 7, 2020, at Tongji hospital, Tongji medical college, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Demographics, temperature was recorded, blood routine test (Rt), chest Computed Tomography (CT) were took intermittently, and SARS-COV-2 real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay were arranged for the nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swab samples. Results: A total of 102 patients (48 Male [50%] and 54 Female [50%]) with clinical symptoms, Rt, and chest Computed Tomography (CT) abnormalities were identified with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients had a mean [SD] gestational age of 57.63 [14.90] years. Of a total of 102 patients identified, 72 patients (36 men [50%] and 36 women [50%]; mean [SD] age, 58.68 [14.81] years) confirmed by laboratory diagnosis with SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR assay. Only two patients (2.78%) with conjunctivitis was identified from 72 patients with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19. However, SARS-COV-2 RNA fragments was found in ocular discharges by SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR only in one patient with conjunctivitis. Conclusions: Although we suspect the incidence of SARS-COV-2 infection through the ocular surface is extremely low, the nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 through the eyes after occupational exposure is a potential route. The inefficient diagnostic method and the sampling time lag may contribute to the lower positive rate of conjunctival swab samples of SARS-COV-2. Therefore, to lower the SARS-COV-2 nosocomial infection, the protective goggles should be wore in all the health care workers.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.16326185,0.481960516,-0.154759242,-0.019342907,-0.064586551,-0.050777079,-0.125005962,-0.061658311,-0.106474563,-0.029128248,0.023780176,0.01785425,-0.041572806,0.051742609,-0.021671113,0.027031511,0.037824426,0.060010222,0.003597986,-0.014029517,0.005952294,0.030641006,-0.058967626,-0.000661215,0.000544854,0.046424434,0.083203538,0.014887802,0.003169263,0.001641831
"Clinical features and sexual transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 infected female patients: a descriptive study in Wuhan, China","Background: As of March 2, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 80174 people and caused 2915 deaths in China. This virus rapidly spreads to 56 countries worldwide. Thus, in order to effectively block its transmission, it is urgent to uncover all the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: From January 28 to February 18, 2020, 35 female patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital were included in this descriptive study. The gynecologic history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography (CT) of all patients were recorded in detail. To examine whether there is sexual transmission through vaginal from female to her partner, we employed real-time polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal environment (including vaginal discharge, cervical or vaginal residual exfoliated cells) and anal swab samples, and inquired recent sexual behaviors from the patients. Findings: The age range of the 35 patients with COVID-19 was 37-88 years. Over 50% patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had chronic diseases. We tested the vaginal environment and anal swabs from the 35 female patients with COVID-19 and found that only an anal swab sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. All the samples from vaginal environment were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The infection rate of the patients' sexual partner was 42.9%. Additionally, two female patients admitted having sex with their partners during a possible infection incubation period, while one patient's partner was uninfected and the other patient's partner was diagnosed with COVID-19 (after the diagnosis of the female patient). Conclusion: No positive RT-PCR result was found in the vaginal environment perhaps due to the lack of ACE2 expression, which is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, in the vagina and cervix tissues (human protein atlas). The results from this study show no evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through vaginal sex from female to her partner. However, the risk of infection of non vaginal sex and other intimate contacts during vaginal sex should not be ignored.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.090858157,0.311310787,-0.154071472,-0.078165378,-0.05345915,-0.000704142,-0.073590343,-0.018198045,-0.063737984,-0.013569236,0.004171271,0.017308348,-0.016731227,0.031184787,0.002576343,0.027368134,0.006560137,0.036920324,-0.01039626,-0.008083813,0.008384052,0.015155885,-0.066361316,-0.022498951,-0.0121201,0.040860207,0.049503817,0.024506472,-0.017766499,0.009405334
Sensitive one-step isothermal detection of pathogen-derived RNAs,"The recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) require fast, simple, and sensitive onsite nucleic acid diagnostics that can be developed rapidly to prevent the spread of diseases. We have developed a SENsitive Splint-based one-step isothermal RNA detection (SENSR) method for rapid and straightforward onsite detection of pathogen RNAs with high sensitivity and specificity. SENSR consists of two simple enzymatic reactions: a ligation reaction by SplintR ligase and subsequent transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. The resulting transcript forms an RNA aptamer that induces fluorescence. Here, we demonstrate that SENSR is an effective and highly sensitive method for the detection of the current epidemic pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We also show that the platform can be extended to the detection of five other pathogens. Overall, SENSR is a molecular diagnostic method that can be developed rapidly for onsite uses requiring high sensitivity, specificity, and short assaying times.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.012078769,0.285762317,0.075280314,0.128779135,-0.078007878,-0.065741333,0.015695035,0.026730806,0.021490148,0.053313374,-0.028934949,-0.021708741,0.058099618,-0.105816017,0.025044408,0.033658296,-0.091298915,0.005578082,-0.050816057,0.012791541,-0.082098868,-0.042980659,0.018532756,-0.03379139,0.039065649,-0.033764071,-0.031738778,0.056942928,-0.032927805,0.008260371
Prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 in feces of pediatric patients during the convalescent phase,"Background: Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified virus which mainly spreads from person-to-person. Fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 has been constantly reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Most published studies focus on adult populations, whereas data concerning pediatric patients is relatively scarce. Methods: From January 17, 2020 to March 6, 2020, three pediatric cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data of these children were collected. Real-time fluorescence reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs and fecal specimens. Results: All the three pediatric cases were household contacts of adults whose symptoms developed earlier. There has been no evidence showing the virus was transmitted from the children to others. Severity of disease of these children was mild to moderate and fever was the most consistent and predominant symptom at onset of illness (two cases had body temperature higher than 38.5 Celsius). All children showed increased lymphocytes (>4.4*109/L) with normal white blood cell counts on admission. One child had elevated serum levels of procalcitonin and C-reaction protein. Radiological changes were not typical for COVID-19. All children showed good response to supportive treatment. Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas persistent presence of viral RNA was found in stools of all children. One case had fecal SARS-CoV-2 turned negative 8 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 20 days. At the time of writing, one child still had positive results for RT-PCR analysis in stools after negative conversion of viral RNA in respiratory samples (over 19 days behind). Conclusions: Pediatric patients with COVID-19 are very different from adult patients in regards to epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics. Prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected children indicates the potential for the virus to be transmitted through fecal excretion. Massive efforts should be made at all levels to prevent spreading of the infection among children after reopening of kindergartens and schools.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.18237436,0.26426843,-0.195216624,-0.009657171,-0.015372638,-0.093299709,-0.048680345,-0.071203555,-0.025535274,-0.024920464,0.05201225,-0.015724054,-0.037366861,0.012276393,0.023105545,0.017434414,-0.030886256,0.038375584,-0.003993398,-0.032413553,-0.055226821,0.132257238,-0.118172318,-0.029074156,-0.046200324,0.124627813,0.090281608,0.025638393,0.029516965,-0.001180986
"Amodiaquine, an antimalarial drug, inhibits dengue virus type 2 replication and infectivity","Abstract Dengue virus serotypes 1–4 (DENV1–4) are transmitted by mosquitoes which cause most frequent arboviral infections in the world resulting in ∼390 million cases with ∼25,000 deaths annually. There is no vaccine or antiviral drug currently available for human use. Compounds containing quinoline scaffold were shown to inhibit flavivirus NS2B–NS3 protease (NS2B–NS3pro) with good potencies. In this study, we screened quinoline derivatives, which are known antimalarial drugs for inhibition of DENV2 and West Nile virus (WNV) replication using the corresponding replicon expressing cell-based assays. Amodiaquine (AQ), one of the 4-aminoquinoline drugs, inhibited DENV2 infectivity measured by plaque assays, with EC50 and EC90 values of 1.08±0.09μM and 2.69±0.47 μM, respectively, and DENV2 RNA replication measured by Renilla luciferase reporter assay, with EC50 value of 7.41±1.09μM in the replicon expressing cells. Cytotoxic concentration (CC50) in BHK-21 cells was 52.09±4.25μM. The replication inhibition was confirmed by plaque assay of the extracellular virions as well as by qRT-PCR of the intracellular and extracellular viral RNA levels. AQ was stable for at least 96h and had minor inhibitory effect on entry, translation, and post-replication stages in the viral life cycle. DENV protease, 5′-methyltransferase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase do not seem to be targets of AQ. Both p-hydroxyanilino and diethylaminomethyl moieties are important for AQ to inhibit DENV2 replication and infectivity. Our results support AQ as a promising candidate for anti-flaviviral therapy.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.129519379,-0.038378399,-0.023573725,0.057152259,-0.139868903,0.029221012,0.05887173,-0.014454291,0.039977575,0.033245715,0.027368495,0.004279749,-0.023895543,0.09442387,0.011058005,0.007270989,-0.018878497,0.081642,0.100852383,0.009868856,-0.022670768,0.0552608,-0.016171733,0.020548385,0.015868564,0.051712834,0.066439398,-0.042139293,0.022022793,0.018238692
"The Role of Human Coronaviruses in Children Hospitalized for Acute Bronchiolitis, Acute Gastroenteritis, and Febrile Seizures: A 2-Year Prospective Study","Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are associated with a variety of clinical presentations in children, but their role in disease remains uncertain. The objective of our prospective study was to investigate HCoVs associations with various clinical presentations in hospitalized children up to 6 years of age. Children hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis (AB), acute gastroenteritis (AGE), or febrile seizures (FS), and children admitted for elective surgical procedures (healthy controls) were included in the study. In patients with AB, AGE, and FS, a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and blood sample were obtained upon admission and the follow-up visit 14 days later, whereas in children with AGE a stool sample was also acquired upon admission; in healthy controls a NP swab and stool sample were taken upon admission. Amplification of polymerase 1b gene was used to detect HCoVs in the specimens. HCoVs-positive specimens were also examined for the presence of several other viruses. HCoVs were most often detected in children with FS (19/192, 9.9%, 95% CI: 6–15%), followed by children with AGE (19/218, 8.7%, 95% CI: 5.3–13.3%) and AB (20/308, 6.5%, 95% CI: 4.0–9.8%). The presence of other viruses was a common finding, most frequent in the group of children with AB (19/20, 95%, 95% CI: 75.1–99.8%), followed by FS (10/19, 52.6%, 95% CI: 28.9–75.6%) and AGE (7/19, 36.8%, 95% CI: 16.3–61.6%). In healthy control children HCoVs were detected in 3/156 (1.9%, 95% CI: 0.4–5.5%) NP swabs and 1/150 (0.7%, 95% CI: 0.02–3.3%) stool samples. It seems that an etiological role of HCoVs is most likely in children with FS, considering that they had a higher proportion of positive HCoVs results than patients with AB and those with AGE, and had the highest viral load; however, the co-detection of other viruses was 52.6%.

The SARS-Unique Domain (SUD) of SARS Coronavirus Contains Two Macrodomains That Bind G-Quadruplexes,"Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the three-dimensional structures of several of the replicase/transcriptase components of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the non-structural proteins (Nsps), have been determined. However, within the large Nsp3 (1922 amino-acid residues), the structure and function of the so-called SARS-unique domain (SUD) have remained elusive. SUD occurs only in SARS-CoV and the highly related viruses found in certain bats, but is absent from all other coronaviruses. Therefore, it has been speculated that it may be involved in the extreme pathogenicity of SARS-CoV, compared to other coronaviruses, most of which cause only mild infections in humans. In order to help elucidate the function of the SUD, we have determined crystal structures of fragment 389–652 (“SUD(core)”) of Nsp3, which comprises 264 of the 338 residues of the domain. Both the monoclinic and triclinic crystal forms (2.2 and 2.8 Å resolution, respectively) revealed that SUD(core) forms a homodimer. Each monomer consists of two subdomains, SUD-N and SUD-M, with a macrodomain fold similar to the SARS-CoV X-domain. However, in contrast to the latter, SUD fails to bind ADP-ribose, as determined by zone-interference gel electrophoresis. Instead, the entire SUD(core) as well as its individual subdomains interact with oligonucleotides known to form G-quadruplexes. This includes oligodeoxy- as well as oligoribonucleotides. Mutations of selected lysine residues on the surface of the SUD-N subdomain lead to reduction of G-quadruplex binding, whereas mutations in the SUD-M subdomain abolish it. As there is no evidence for Nsp3 entering the nucleus of the host cell, the SARS-CoV genomic RNA or host-cell mRNA containing long G-stretches may be targets of SUD. The SARS-CoV genome is devoid of G-stretches longer than 5–6 nucleotides, but more extended G-stretches are found in the 3′-nontranslated regions of mRNAs coding for certain host-cell proteins involved in apoptosis or signal transduction, and have been shown to bind to SUD in vitro. Therefore, SUD may be involved in controlling the host cell's response to the viral infection. Possible interference with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-like domains is also discussed.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.086654016,0.198607002,-0.138574848,-0.015910162,-0.019722578,0.032128872,0.012063219,-0.119898022,-0.001555519,-0.021244058,-0.033579082,-0.007398098,0.007796652,-0.043701652,-0.010901424,0.005463743,0.02395045,-0.03252622,-0.017370495,0.018990849,-0.005203955,0.002504579,-0.009289831,-0.001479113,0.020088525,-0.011495778,-0.037429003,0.017080818,0.022217278,-0.030910625
Diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy of lung infiltrates in febrile neutropenic patients (allogeneic SCT excluded): updated guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Working Party (AGIHO) of the German Society of Hematology and Medical Oncology (DGHO)(†),"Up to 25% of patients with profound neutropenia lasting for >10 days develop lung infiltrates, which frequently do not respond to broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. While a causative pathogen remains undetected in the majority of cases, Aspergillus spp., Pneumocystis jirovecii, multi-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, mycobacteria or respiratory viruses may be involved. In at-risk patients who have received trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) prophylaxis, filamentous fungal pathogens appear to be predominant, yet commonly not proven at the time of treatment initiation. Pathogens isolated from blood cultures, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or respiratory secretions are not always relevant for the etiology of pulmonary infiltrates and should therefore be interpreted critically. Laboratory tests for detecting Aspergillus galactomannan, β-d-glucan or DNA from blood, BAL or tissue samples may facilitate the diagnosis; however, most polymerase chain reaction assays are not yet standardized and validated. Apart from infectious agents, pulmonary side-effects from cytotoxic drugs, radiotherapy or pulmonary involvement by the underlying malignancy should be included into differential diagnosis and eventually be clarified by invasive diagnostic procedures. Pre-emptive treatment with mold-active systemic antifungal agents improves clinical outcome, while other microorganisms are preferably treated only when microbiologically documented. High-dose TMP/SMX is first choice for treatment of Pneumocystis pneumonia, while cytomegalovirus pneumonia is treated primarily with ganciclovir or foscarnet in most patients. In a considerable number of patients, clinical outcome may be favorable despite respiratory failure, so that intensive care should be unrestrictedly provided in patients whose prognosis is not desperate due to other reasons.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.148993533,-0.010633644,-0.04288067,-0.104033529,-0.118241629,-0.018146227,-0.004400181,0.112791997,-0.118686125,0.106096881,-0.026104329,0.008418002,0.058120245,0.022464152,-0.016780911,-0.028201876,-0.005074187,0.086832787,0.006753473,0.036456151,0.055690815,-0.036164606,0.000735134,-0.044301061,0.024045251,-0.031063788,-0.01720223,-0.008045059,-0.010966776,-0.034783804
Reverse transcription strand invasion based amplification (RT-SIBA): a method for rapid detection of influenza A and B,"Rapid and accurate diagnosis of influenza viruses plays an important role in infection control, as well as in preventing the misuse of antibiotics. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods offer significant advantages over the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), since they are more rapid and do not require the sophisticated instruments needed for thermal cycling. We previously described a novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification method, ‘Strand Invasion Based Amplification’ (SIBA®), with high analytical sensitivity and specificity, for the detection of DNA. In this study, we describe the development of a variant of the SIBA method, namely, reverse transcription SIBA (RT-SIBA), for the rapid detection of viral RNA targets. The RT-SIBA method includes a reverse transcriptase enzyme that allows one-step reverse transcription of RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA) and simultaneous amplification and detection of the cDNA by SIBA under isothermal reaction conditions. The RT-SIBA method was found to be more sensitive than PCR for the detection of influenza A and B and could detect 100 copies of influenza RNA within 15 min. The development of RT-SIBA will enable rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral RNA targets within point-of-care or central laboratory settings.

Human cytomegalovirus and Herpes Simplex type I virus can engage RNA polymerase I for transcription of immediate early genes,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) utilizes RNA polymerase II to transcribe viral genes and produce viral mRNAs. It can specifically target the nucleolus to facilitate viral transcription and translation. As RNA polymerase I (Pol I)-mediated transcription is active in the nucleolus, we investigated the role of Pol I, along with relative contributions of the human Pol II and Pol III, to early phases of viral transcription in HCMV infected cells, compared with Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) and Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Inhibition of Pol I with siRNA or the Pol I inhibitors CX-5461 or Actinomycin D (5nM) resulted in significantly decreased IE and pp65 mRNA and protein levels in human fibroblasts at early times post infection. This initially delayed replication was compensated for later during the replication process, at which stage it didn’t significantly affect virus production. Pol I inhibition also reduced HSV-1 ICP0 and gB transcripts, suggesting that some herpesviruses engage Pol I for their early transcription. In contrast, inhibition of Pol I failed to affect MCMV transcription. Collectively, our results contribute to better understanding of the functional interplay between RNA Pol I-mediated nucleolar events and the Herpes viruses, particularly HCMV whose pathogenic impact ranges from congenital malformations and potentially deadly infections among immunosuppressed patients, up to HCMV’s emerging oncomodulatory role in human tumors.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.1134968,-0.060605718,-0.037705692,-0.006202099,-0.09470129,0.001742481,0.0434554,-0.007676223,0.03145343,-0.003191756,-0.026331858,-0.03589013,0.011220727,0.112709415,-0.013228057,0.020391567,0.010266924,-0.044388229,-0.080557208,0.017592833,0.00633762,0.037552497,-0.073746391,0.064248024,0.015467567,-0.071300962,-0.014915244,0.012692113,0.023809303,-0.065219502
Viral RNA extraction for in-the-field analysis,"Abstract Retroviruses encode their genetic information with RNA molecules, and have a high genomic recombination rate which allows them to mutate more rapidly, thereby posting a higher risk to humans. One important way to help combat a pandemic of viral infectious diseases is early detection before large-scale outbreaks occur. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) have been used to identify precisely different strains of some very closely related pathogens. However, isolation and detection of viral RNA in the field are difficult due to the unstable nature of viral RNA molecules. Consequently, performing in-the-field nucleic acid analysis to monitor the spread of viruses is financially and technologically challenging in remote and underdeveloped regions that are high-risk areas for outbreaks. A simplified rapid viral RNA extraction method is reported to meet the requirements for in-the-field viral RNA extraction and detection. The ability of this device to perform viral RNA extraction with subsequent RT-PCR detection of retrovirus is demonstrated. This inexpensive device has the potential to be distributed on a large scale to underdeveloped regions for early detection of retrovirus, with the possibility of reducing viral pandemic events.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.064472873,0.034002676,0.137800003,0.154854364,-0.009367727,-0.061026358,0.030299429,0.043872493,-0.055942489,0.092322893,0.047518335,-0.029374567,0.035537727,-7.32E-05,0.030430396,0.008120932,-0.048701318,0.005944652,-0.063476416,-0.007250093,-0.055477887,0.033704118,-0.048489157,-0.002328345,-0.039938647,-0.052350527,0.056989795,-0.046514857,-0.023250196,0.085375382
Delicate structural coordination of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus Nsp13 upon ATP hydrolysis,"To date, an effective therapeutic treatment that confers strong attenuation toward coronaviruses (CoVs) remains elusive. Of all the potential drug targets, the helicase of CoVs is considered to be one of the most important. Here, we first present the structure of the full-length Nsp13 helicase of SARS-CoV (SARS-Nsp13) and investigate the structural coordination of its five domains and how these contribute to its translocation and unwinding activity. A translocation model is proposed for the Upf1-like helicase members according to three different structural conditions in solution characterized through H/D exchange assay, including substrate state (SARS-Nsp13-dsDNA bound with AMPPNP), transition state (bound with ADP-AlF(4)(−)) and product state (bound with ADP). We observed that the β19–β20 loop on the 1A domain is involved in unwinding process directly. Furthermore, we have shown that the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), SARS-Nsp12, can enhance the helicase activity of SARS-Nsp13 through interacting with it directly.

Development of a Rapid Fluorescent Immunochromatographic Test to Detect Respiratory Syncytial Virus,"Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most common viruses infecting the respiratory tracts of infants. The rapid and sensitive detection of RSV is important to minimize the incidence of infection. In this study, novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; B11A5 and E8A11) against RSV nucleoprotein (NP) were developed and applied to develop a rapid fluorescent immunochromatographic strip test (FICT), employing europium nanoparticles as the fluorescent material. For the FICT, the limits of detection of the antigen and virus were 1.25 µg/mL and 4.23 × 10(6) TCID(50)/mL, respectively, corresponding to 4.75 × 10(6) ± 5.8 ×10(5) (mean ± SD) RNA copy numbers per reaction mixture for RSV NP. A clinical study revealed a sensitivity of 90% (18/20) and specificity of 98.18% (108/110) for RSV detection when comparing the performance to that of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), representing a 15% improvement in sensitivity over the SD Bioline rapid kit. This newly developed FICT could be a useful tool for the rapid diagnosis of RSV infection.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.133658872,-0.024760375,0.106140431,0.110579911,-0.016805213,-0.091415143,0.027979806,-0.079689542,0.10030321,-0.069987003,0.012593642,-0.086164558,-0.122622688,-0.03829777,-0.049626999,-0.018215751,-0.002796595,0.074372833,0.011960857,-0.003895173,-0.009783327,-0.149205738,0.052815715,-0.071674808,0.088176863,-0.151709987,0.221857738,0.099499597,-0.10866795,0.067622604
The SARS-coronavirus nsp7+nsp8 complex is a unique multimeric RNA polymerase capable of both de novo initiation and primer extension,"Uniquely among RNA viruses, replication of the ∼30-kb SARS-coronavirus genome is believed to involve two RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activities. The first is primer-dependent and associated with the 106-kDa non-structural protein 12 (nsp12), whereas the second is catalysed by the 22-kDa nsp8. This latter enzyme is capable of de novo initiation and has been proposed to operate as a primase. Interestingly, this protein has only been crystallized together with the 10-kDa nsp7, forming a hexadecameric, dsRNA-encircling ring structure [i.e. nsp(7+8), consisting of 8 copies of both nsps]. To better understand the implications of these structural characteristics for nsp8-driven RNA synthesis, we studied the prerequisites for the formation of the nsp(7+8) complex and its polymerase activity. We found that in particular the exposure of nsp8's natural N-terminal residue was paramount for both the protein's ability to associate with nsp7 and for boosting its RdRp activity. Moreover, this ‘improved’ recombinant nsp8 was capable of extending primed RNA templates, a property that had gone unnoticed thus far. The latter activity is, however, ∼20-fold weaker than that of the primer-dependent nsp12-RdRp at equal monomer concentrations. Finally, site-directed mutagenesis of conserved D/ExD/E motifs was employed to identify residues crucial for nsp(7+8) RdRp activity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.228991591,0.010368475,-0.123970871,0.126163656,-0.047559706,-0.090422539,0.020249165,-0.02058905,-0.072748719,-0.004444077,0.093776501,0.143922595,-0.081510489,-0.054707211,-0.078010652,-0.048159462,0.108036513,-0.066990877,0.008212204,-0.027844276,0.005164949,-0.016211518,0.073773509,-0.090704162,0.035717929,0.070866713,-0.043119979,0.045507984,0.013580339,0.058499439
Epidemiology of respiratory viral infections in people with acute respiratory tract infections in Africa: the VARIAFRICA systematic review and meta-analysis protocol,"INTRODUCTION: Better characterisation of the epidemiological data on respiratory viral infections among people with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) can help to implement efficient strategies to curb the burden of ARTI in Africa. We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence and factors associated with respiratory viral infection in people of all ages with ARTI residing in Africa. METHODS: This work will include cross-sectional studies published between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2017, without any language restriction, on populations residing in African countries. We will consider studies that reported the prevalence of respiratory viruses in people with ARTI confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction technique. We will be searching PubMed, Embase, African Journals Online, Web of Science, and Global Index Medicus. The selection of relevant studies, extraction of data, and evaluation of the quality of the articles will be carried out independently by two review authors, and the discrepancies will be resolved by consensus or intervention of a third author. The heterogeneity of the studies will be assessed using the χ(2) test on Cochrane’s Q statistic. Publication bias will be assessed by the Egger test. Studies will be pooled using a random-effect meta-analysis model. Results will be presented by age group and sub-region of Africa. Using meta-regression models, we will identify factors associated with viral infections in people with ARTI. DISCUSSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis is based on published data and therefore does not require ethical approval. This work will serve as a basis for the development of strategies for prevention and control ARTI in Africa and will also serve to identify data gaps and guide future investigations. The final report will be published in peer-reviewed journals as a scientific article and presented in workshops, conferences, and scientific conferences.

The Human Cytomegalovirus DNA Polymerase Processivity Factor UL44 Is Modified by SUMO in a DNA-Dependent Manner,"During the replication of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome, the viral DNA polymerase subunit UL44 plays a key role, as by binding both DNA and the polymerase catalytic subunit it confers processivity to the holoenzyme. However, several lines of evidence suggest that UL44 might have additional roles during virus life cycle. To shed light on this, we searched for cellular partners of UL44 by yeast two-hybrid screenings. Intriguingly, we discovered the interaction of UL44 with Ubc9, an enzyme involved in the covalent conjugation of SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-related MOdifier) to cellular and viral proteins. We found that UL44 can be extensively sumoylated not only in a cell-free system and in transfected cells, but also in HCMV-infected cells, in which about 50% of the protein resulted to be modified at late times post-infection, when viral genome replication is accomplished. Mass spectrometry studies revealed that UL44 possesses multiple SUMO target sites, located throughout the protein. Remarkably, we observed that binding of UL44 to DNA greatly stimulates its sumoylation both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we showed that overexpression of SUMO alters the intranuclear distribution of UL44 in HCMV-infected cells, and enhances both virus production and DNA replication, arguing for an important role for sumoylation in HCMV life cycle and UL44 function(s). These data report for the first time the sumoylation of a viral processivity factor and show that there is a functional interplay between the HCMV UL44 protein and the cellular sumoylation system.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.108204611,-0.046046861,-0.017926173,-0.042998712,-0.081628582,0.026908075,0.040098745,-0.027650647,0.042272602,-0.002746823,-0.024239731,-0.020620256,0.002119411,0.043888282,-0.004705013,0.011075296,0.006516968,-0.0353346,-0.010880811,0.030634376,-0.018201371,0.035477572,-0.017130077,-0.018903419,0.018812145,0.010718591,-0.028111088,0.010335691,-0.024848354,0.01783987
A barnavirus sequence mined from a transcriptome of the Antarctic pearlwort Colobanthus quitensis,"Because so few viruses in the family Barnaviridae have been reported, we searched for more of them in public sequence databases. Here, we report the complete coding sequence of Colobanthus quitensis associated barnavirus 1, mined from a transcriptome of the Antarctic pearlwort Colobanthus quitensis. The 4.2-kb plus-strand sequence of this virus encompasses four main open reading frames (ORFs), as expected for barnaviruses, including ORFs for a protease-containing polyprotein, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase whose translation appears to rely on − 1 ribosomal frameshifting, and a capsid protein that is likely to be translated from a subgenomic RNA. The possible derivation of this virus from a fungus associated with C. quitensis is discussed.

Enhancement of safety and immunogenicity of the Chinese Hu191 measles virus vaccine by alteration of the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site in the large polymerase protein,"Abstract The live-attenuated measles virus (MV) vaccine based on the Hu191 strain has played a significant role in controlling measles in China. However, it has considerable adverse effects that may cause public health burden. We hypothesize that the safety and efficacy of MV vaccine can be improved by altering the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site in the conserved region VI of the large polymerase protein. To test this hypothesis, we established an efficient reverse genetics system for the rMV-Hu191 strain and generated two recombinant MV-Hu191 carrying mutations in the SAM binding site. These two mutants grew to high titer in Vero cells, were genetically stable, and were significantly more attenuated in vitro and in vivo compared to the parental rMV-Hu191 vaccine strain. Importantly, both MV-Hu191 mutants triggered a higher neutralizing antibody than rMV-Hu191 vaccine and provided complete protection against MV challenge. These results demonstrate its potential for an improved MV vaccine candidate.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.083797609,-0.031030785,0.003626569,-0.0652944,-0.005895981,0.070957887,-0.033509737,-0.036999526,0.042350379,0.005215823,-0.006467741,0.048311859,-0.051855976,-0.059461545,-0.014586634,-0.018968933,-0.034987068,-0.009424703,-0.043169439,0.010284899,0.07274337,-0.04071257,0.057255218,0.051281165,0.048252832,0.042832977,0.003742609,-0.018037777,-0.028067678,-0.008342418
Signatures of Nucleotide Analog Incorporation by an RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Revealed Using High-Throughput Magnetic Tweezers,"RNA viruses pose a threat to public health that is exacerbated by the dearth of antiviral therapeutics. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) holds promise as a broad-spectrum, therapeutic target because of the conserved nature of the nucleotide-substrate-binding and catalytic sites. Conventional, quantitative, kinetic analysis of antiviral ribonucleotides monitors one or a few incorporation events. Here, we use a high-throughput magnetic tweezers platform to monitor the elongation dynamics of a prototypical RdRp over thousands of nucleotide-addition cycles in the absence and presence of a suite of nucleotide analog inhibitors. We observe multiple RdRp-RNA elongation complexes; only a subset of which are competent for analog utilization. Incorporation of a pyrazine-carboxamide nucleotide analog, T-1106, leads to RdRp backtracking. This analysis reveals a mechanism of action for this antiviral ribonucleotide that is corroborated by cellular studies. We propose that induced backtracking represents a distinct mechanistic class of antiviral ribonucleotides.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.179809355,-0.027450635,-0.06274337,0.096437992,-0.066565595,0.01407552,0.107972767,0.025918959,-0.036654949,0.066196929,0.106127547,0.142718088,-0.073144685,-0.066208915,-0.029741338,-0.034546003,0.007053785,0.028935441,-0.005335287,-0.072230916,0.061950268,-0.035174619,0.042472361,0.015875036,0.024493846,0.026978667,0.055251905,0.003898238,0.08974406,0.04677585
Evidence for Retrovirus and Paramyxovirus Infection of Multiple Bat Species in China,"Bats are recognized reservoirs for many emerging zoonotic viruses of public health importance. Identifying and cataloguing the viruses of bats is a logical approach to evaluate the range of potential zoonoses of bat origin. We characterized the fecal pathogen microbiome of both insectivorous and frugivorous bats, incorporating 281 individual bats comprising 20 common species, which were sampled in three locations of Yunnan province, by combining reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays and next-generation sequencing. Seven individual bats were paramyxovirus-positive by RT-PCR using degenerate primers, and these paramyxoviruses were mainly classified into three genera (Rubulavirus, Henipavirus and Jeilongvirus). Various additional novel pathogens were detected in the paramyxovirus-positive bats using Illumina sequencing. A total of 7066 assembled contigs (≥200 bp) were constructed, and 105 contigs matched eukaryotic viruses (of them 103 belong to 2 vertebrate virus families, 1 insect virus, and 1 mycovirus), 17 were parasites, and 4913 were homologous to prokaryotic microorganisms. Among the 103 vertebrate viral contigs, 79 displayed low identity (<70%) to known viruses including human viruses at the amino acid level, suggesting that these belong to novel and genetically divergent viruses. Overall, the most frequently identified viruses, particularly in bats from the family Hipposideridae, were retroviruses. The present study expands our understanding of the bat virome in species commonly found in Yunnan, China, and provides insight into the overall diversity of viruses that may be capable of directly or indirectly crossing over into humans.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.010119567,0.033965901,0.036341187,0.053466221,0.310118377,0.120884329,0.280405317,0.084278941,-0.159464588,-0.012864568,-0.10510367,-0.129254189,-0.024148092,0.084622305,-0.011642469,0.012322383,0.041484837,0.035166519,-0.000647155,-0.028963017,-0.016584282,0.035212812,-0.022395443,-0.026834992,0.018583677,0.053572348,0.043050243,-0.006403217,-0.005041196,-0.028356118
"First Human Rabies Case in French Guiana, 2008: Epidemiological Investigation and Control","BACKGROUND: Until 2008, human rabies had never been reported in French Guiana. On 28 May 2008, the French National Reference Center for Rabies (Institut Pasteur, Paris) confirmed the rabies diagnosis, based on hemi-nested polymerase chain reaction on skin biopsy and saliva specimens from a Guianan, who had never travelled overseas and died in Cayenne after presenting clinically typical meningoencephalitis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Molecular typing of the virus identified a Lyssavirus (Rabies virus species), closely related to those circulating in hematophagous bats (mainly Desmodus rotundus) in Latin America. A multidisciplinary Crisis Unit was activated. Its objectives were to implement an epidemiological investigation and a veterinary survey, to provide control measures and establish a communications program. The origin of the contamination was not formally established, but was probably linked to a bat bite based on the virus type isolated. After confirming exposure of 90 persons, they were vaccinated against rabies: 42 from the case's entourage and 48 healthcare workers. To handle that emergence and the local population's increased demand to be vaccinated, a specific communications program was established using several media: television, newspaper, radio. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This episode, occurring in the context of a Department far from continental France, strongly affected the local population, healthcare workers and authorities, and the management team faced intense pressure. This observation confirms that the risk of contracting rabies in French Guiana is real, with consequences for population educational program, control measures, medical diagnosis and post-exposure prophylaxis.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.003839897,0.005957194,0.020126225,-0.068463182,0.04881997,0.076657466,0.056587459,0.031296077,-0.017896742,-0.013719531,-0.023908019,-0.005489349,-0.014831773,-0.024864491,0.013122227,0.042102532,-0.015023722,0.007792472,-0.02645985,-0.027736151,0.016550994,-0.016619889,-0.008200352,-0.033725324,0.011639903,0.011586925,-0.008929009,0.007700336,-0.018530345,-0.004988581
"Feline bocavirus-1 associated with outbreaks of hemorrhagic enteritis in household cats: potential first evidence of a pathological role, viral tropism and natural genetic recombination","Feline bocavirus-1 (FBoV-1) was identified in cats from different households with hemorrhagic enteritis during outbreaks of an unusual clinical presentation of feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV) in Thailand. Use of polymerase chain reaction revealed the presence of the FBoV-1 DNA in several tissues, suggesting hematogenous viremia, with the viral nucleic acid, detected by in situ hybridization (ISH), was localized in intestinal cells and vascular endothelium of intestinal mucosa and serosa, and in necrosis areas primarily in various lymph nodes while FPLV-immunohistochemical analysis revealed viral localization only in cryptal cells, neurons, and limited to leukocytes in the mesenteric lymph node. Full-length coding genome analysis of the Thai FBoV-1 strains isolated from moribund cats revealed three distinct strains with a high between-strain genetic diversity, while genetic recombination in one of the three FBoV-1 strains within the NS1 gene. This is the first report identifying natural genetic recombination of the FBoV-1 and describing the pathology and viral tropism of FBoV-1 infection in cats. Although the role of FBoV-1 associated with systemic infection of these cats remained undetermined, a contributory role of enteric infection of FBoV-1 is possible. Synergistic effects of dual infection with FPLV and FBoV-1 are hypothesized, suggesting more likely severe clinical presentations.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.054837587,-0.026631801,0.039218109,-0.164310582,0.058928051,0.05164615,0.040135422,-0.025789242,-0.015083216,-0.045850478,0.269225406,-0.100571401,0.171676808,-0.033180049,-0.040847429,-0.047465615,-0.035867202,0.006176441,-0.036710914,0.11273396,0.038594103,-0.011046409,0.003880712,0.049396626,-0.013866615,-0.012302769,0.001989648,0.034529867,-0.078791892,0.058206521
The R Protein of SARS-CoV: Analyses of Structure and Function Based on Four Complete Genome Sequences of Isolates BJ01-BJ04,"The R (replicase) protein is the uniquely defined non-structural protein (NSP) responsible for RNA replication, mutation rate or fidelity, regulation of transcription in coronaviruses and many other ssRNA viruses. Based on our complete genome sequences of four isolates (BJ01-BJ04) of SARS-CoV from Beijing, China, we analyzed the structure and predicted functions of the R protein in comparison with 13 other isolates of SARS-CoV and 6 other coronaviruses. The entire ORF (open-reading frame) encodes for two major enzyme activities, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and proteinase activities. The R polyprotein undergoes a complex proteolytic process to produce 15 function-related peptides. A hydrophobic domain (HOD) and a hydrophilic domain (HID) are newly identified within NSP1. The substitution rate of the R protein is close to the average of the SARS-CoV genome. The functional domains in all NSPs of the R protein give different phylogenetic results that suggest their different mutation rate under selective pressure. Eleven highly conserved regions in RdRp and twelve cleavage sites by 3CLP (chymotrypsin-like protein) have been identified as potential drug targets.

Translesion polymerase kappa-dependent DNA synthesis underlies replication fork recovery,"DNA replication stress is often defined by the slowing or stalling of replication fork progression leading to local or global DNA synthesis inhibition. Failure to resolve replication stress in a timely manner contribute toward cell cycle defects, genome instability and human disease; however, the mechanism for fork recovery remains poorly defined. Here, we show that the translesion DNA polymerase (Pol) kappa, a DinB orthologue, has a unique role in both protecting and restarting stalled replication forks under conditions of nucleotide deprivation. Importantly, Pol kappa-mediated DNA synthesis during hydroxyurea (HU)-dependent fork restart is regulated by both the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway and PCNA polyubiquitination. Loss of Pol kappa prevents timely rescue of stalled replication forks, leading to replication-associated genomic instability, and a p53-dependent cell cycle defect. Taken together, our results identify a previously unanticipated role for Pol kappa in promoting DNA synthesis and replication stress recovery at sites of stalled forks.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.140932233,-0.05364229,-0.021772347,-0.014213672,-0.105983422,0.002943743,0.060135026,-0.003604122,0.028654744,-0.000457717,-0.001604281,-0.004317245,-0.015802489,0.057255059,-0.016685645,0.071381488,-0.031205691,-0.054984146,-0.039788768,0.010124763,-0.010943184,0.036452312,-0.025492336,-0.012887072,0.013313453,-0.057218293,-0.090316532,0.041661793,-0.033583894,-0.052342196
Transcriptional slippage in the positive-sense RNA virus family Potyviridae,"The family Potyviridae encompasses ∼30% of plant viruses and is responsible for significant economic losses worldwide. Recently, a small overlapping coding sequence, termed pipo, was found to be conserved in the genomes of all potyvirids. PIPO is expressed as part of a frameshift protein, P3N-PIPO, which is essential for virus cell-to-cell movement. However, the frameshift expression mechanism has hitherto remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that transcriptional slippage, specific to the viral RNA polymerase, results in a population of transcripts with an additional “A” inserted within a highly conserved GAAAAAA sequence, thus enabling expression of P3N-PIPO. The slippage efficiency is ∼2% in Turnip mosaic virus and slippage is inhibited by mutations in the GAAAAAA sequence. While utilization of transcriptional slippage is well known in negative-sense RNA viruses such as Ebola, mumps and measles, to our knowledge this is the first report of its widespread utilization for gene expression in positive-sense RNA viruses.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.143405373,-0.05899326,-0.016497931,0.011871848,0.016576414,-0.01855353,-0.027545521,0.01261487,-0.00927917,-0.005397116,-0.039007076,-0.028527901,0.014211119,0.01069725,-0.002411494,-0.030829403,0.01661762,-0.048667436,-0.030199752,-0.020464665,0.01399875,-0.007410378,-0.043610385,0.022809927,-0.089948651,-0.047164471,0.017219532,0.006931941,0.033090184,-0.0652288
Population-Based Pertussis Incidence and Risk Factors in Infants Less Than 6 Months in Nepal,"BACKGROUND: Pertussis is estimated to cause 2 percent of childhood deaths globally and is a growing public health problem in developed countries despite high vaccination coverage. Infants are at greatest risk of morbidity and mortality. Maternal vaccination during pregnancy may be effective to prevent pertussis in young infants, but population-based estimates of disease burden in infants are lacking, particularly in low-income countries. The objective of this study was to estimate the incidence of pertussis in infants less than 6 months of age in Sarlahi District, Nepal. METHODS: Nested within a population-based randomized controlled trial of influenza vaccination during pregnancy, infants were visited weekly from birth through 6 months to assess respiratory illness in the prior week. If any respiratory symptoms had occurred, a nasal swab was collected and tested with a multitarget pertussis polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The prospective cohort study includes infants observed between May 2011 and August 2014. RESULTS: The incidence of PCR-confirmed Bordetella pertussis was 13.3 cases per 1000 infant-years (95% confidence interval, 7.7–21.3) in a cohort of 3483 infants with at least 1 day of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based active home surveillance for respiratory illness, a low risk for pertussis was estimated among infants in rural Nepal. Nepal’s immunization program, which includes a childhood whole cell pertussis vaccine, may be effective in controlling pertussis in infants.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.105575158,-0.055125923,-0.021684159,-0.03889988,-0.00439235,0.01422782,0.021739838,-0.017829503,0.053469921,-0.041526755,0.030484579,0.020574548,-0.064892895,-0.120858475,0.054301679,0.115453271,0.021417147,-0.044812265,0.067204458,-0.050741499,-0.063017318,-0.076467126,-0.048371279,-0.039811621,0.111645863,-0.070683564,0.049517756,0.037522577,0.029154478,-0.099906218
Curing a viral infection by targeting the host: The example of cyclophilin inhibitors,"Abstract Every step of the viral life cycle is dependent on the host, which potentially can be explored for antiviral targets. Historically, however, drug discovery has focused mainly on viral targets, because of their perceived specificity. Efforts to pursue host targets have been largely hampered by concern over potential on-target toxicity, the lack of predictive cell culture and animal models, and the complexity of host–virus interactions. On the other hand, there are distinct advantages of targeting the host, such as creating a high barrier to resistance, providing broad coverage of different genotypes/serotypes and possibly even multiple viruses, and expanding the list of potential targets, when druggable viral targets are limited. Taking hepatitis C virus (HCV) as the example, there are more than 20 inhibitors of the viral protease, polymerase and NS5A protein currently in advanced clinical testing. However, resistance has become a main challenge with these direct-acting antivirals, because HCV, an RNA virus, is notoriously prone to mutation, and a single mutation in the viral target may prevent the binding of an inhibitor, and rendering it ineffective. Host cyclophilin inhibitors have shown promising effects both in vitro and in patients to prevent the emergence of resistance and to cure HCV infection, either alone or in combination with other agents. They are also capable of blocking the replication of a number of other viral pathogens. While the road to developing host-targeting antivirals has been less traveled, and significant challenges remain, delivering the most effective antiviral regimen, which may comprise inhibitors of both host and viral targets, should be well worth the effort.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.101370707,-0.049204189,-0.049068463,0.06917646,-0.158334477,0.110972663,0.160570707,-0.004025298,0.029552163,0.116340914,-0.026474704,0.006166702,0.070627298,0.039354839,-0.014558832,-0.056646316,-0.013275939,0.200249164,0.160702879,0.032280461,-0.058195896,0.064020913,-0.038966366,0.113847357,-0.025559188,-0.049905231,0.080875023,-0.071199082,0.015376349,0.00427507
Seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness against laboratory-confirmed influenza in 2015–2016: a hospital-based test-negative case–control study in Lithuania,"OBJECTIVE: A case–control study was conducted to assess seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness (SIVE) during the 2015–2016 influenza season. METHODS: A study was performed in three departments in Lithuania between 1 December 2015 and 1 May 2016. Data on demographic and clinical characteristics including influenza vaccination status were collected from the patients recommended to receive the seasonal influenza vaccine. Influenza virus infection was confirmed by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Ninety-one (56.4%) of the 163 included subjects were ≥65 years old. Fifteen (9.2%) subjects were vaccinated against influenza at least 2 weeks before the onset of influenza symptoms, 12 of them were ≥65 years old. Of the 72 (44.2%) influenza virus positive cases, 65 (39.9%) were confirmed with influenza A (including 50 cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09), eight (4.9%) were confirmed with influenza B and one was a co-infection. Unadjusted SIVE against any influenza, influenza type A and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was 57% (95% CI −41% to 87%), 52% (95% CI −57% to 85%) and 70% (95% CI −43% to 94%) respectively.

Bat Astrovirus in Mozambique,"Astroviruses (AstVs) are responsible for infection of a large diversity of mammalian and avian species, including bats, aquatic birds, livestock and humans. We investigated AstVs circulation in bats in Mozambique and Mayotte, a small island in the Comoros Archipelago located between east Africa and Madagascar. Biological material was collected from 338 bats and tested for the presence of the AstV RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase gene with a pan-AstV semi-nested polymerase chain reaction assay. None of the 79 samples obtained from Mayotte bats (Pteropus seychellensis comorensis and Chaerephon pusillus) tested positive; however, 20.1% of bats sampled in Mozambique shed AstVs at the time of sampling and significant interspecific variation in the proportion of positive bats was detected. Many AstVs sequences obtained from a given bat species clustered in different phylogenetic lineages, while others seem to reflect some level of host-virus association, but also with AstVs previously reported from Malagasy bats. Our findings support active circulation of a large diversity of AstVs in bats in the western Indian Ocean islands, including the southeastern African coast, and highlight the need for more detailed assessment of its risk of zoonotic transmission to human populations.

Examining the relationship between household air pollution and infant microbial nasal carriage in a Ghanaian cohort,"Abstract Background Pneumonia, a leading cause of childhood mortality, is associated with household air pollution (HAP) exposure. Mechanisms between HAP and pneumonia are poorly understood, but studies suggest that HAP may increase the likelihood of bacterial, instead of viral, pneumonia. We assessed the relationship between HAP and infant microbial nasal carriage among 260 infants participating in the Ghana Randomized Air Pollution and Health Study (GRAPHS). Methods Data are from GRAPHS, a cluster-randomized controlled trial of cookstove interventions (improved biomass or LPG) versus the 3-stone (baseline) cookstove. Infants were surveyed for pneumonia during the first year of life and had routine personal exposure assessments. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from pneumonia cases (n = 130) and healthy controls (n = 130) were analyzed for presence of 22 common respiratory microbes by MassTag polymerase chain reaction. Data analyses included intention-to-treat (ITT) comparisons of microbial species presence by study arm, and exposure-response relationships. Results In ITT analyses, 3-stone arm participants had a higher mean number of microbial species than the LPG (LPG: 2.71, 3-stone: 3.34, p < 0.0001, n = 260). This difference was driven by increased bacterial (p < 0.0001) rather than viral species presence (non-significant). Results were pronounced in pneumonia cases and attenuated in healthy controls. Higher prevalence bacterial species were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Exposure-response relationships did not yield significant associations between measured CO and nasal microbial carriage. Conclusions Our intention-to-treat findings are consistent with a link between HAP and bacterial nasal carriage. No relationships were found for viral carriage. Given the null results in exposure-response analysis, it is likely that a pollutant besides CO is driving these differences.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.068934658,-0.057432188,-0.050973253,-0.100602355,-0.017498097,0.003785692,0.056069065,0.045612399,-0.080262874,0.025912307,-0.023829495,-0.016200535,-0.032152244,-0.052108535,-0.014727962,0.026201366,-0.039037948,-0.033127791,-0.01870411,-0.017915249,-0.056469332,0.067392923,0.036755079,0.028211887,0.046009035,0.017039186,0.026292951,0.011624443,0.040186797,-0.041809869
Viral Metagenomics on Cerebrospinal Fluid,"Identifying the causative pathogen in central nervous system (CNS) infections is crucial for patient management and prognosis. Many viruses can cause CNS infections, yet screening for each individually is costly and time-consuming. Most metagenomic assays can theoretically detect all pathogens, but often fail to detect viruses because of their small genome and low viral load. Viral metagenomics overcomes this by enrichment of the viral genomic content in a sample. VIDISCA-NGS is one of the available workflows for viral metagenomics, which requires only a small input volume and allows multiplexing of multiple samples per run. The performance of VIDISCA-NGS was tested on 45 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with suspected CNS infections in which a virus was identified and quantified by polymerase chain reaction. Eighteen were positive for an RNA virus, and 34 for a herpesvirus. VIDISCA-NGS detected all RNA viruses with a viral load >2 × 10(4) RNA copies/mL (n = 6) and 8 of 12 of the remaining low load samples. Only one herpesvirus was identified by VIDISCA-NGS, however, when withholding a DNase treatment, 11 of 18 samples with a herpesvirus load >10(4) DNA copies/mL were detected. Our results indicate that VIDISCA-NGS has the capacity to detect low load RNA viruses in CSF. Herpesvirus DNA in clinical samples is probably non-encapsidated and therefore difficult to detect by VIDISCA-NGS.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.013448417,-0.027604013,0.033213204,0.02772181,-0.010096206,-0.055306793,0.060154588,0.00932369,-0.050173288,0.066022133,0.041172921,-0.048675555,0.023005785,0.010811267,0.045523911,-0.02437553,-0.043506897,-0.024188281,0.028882125,-0.006584915,-0.018844266,0.047955897,-0.04458046,0.01687599,-0.069592757,-0.055935767,0.000425289,-0.027674165,-0.044652852,0.043186783
Origins and Evolution of the Global RNA Virome,"Viruses with RNA genomes dominate the eukaryotic virome, reaching enormous diversity in animals and plants. The recent advances of metaviromics prompted us to perform a detailed phylogenomic reconstruction of the evolution of the dramatically expanded global RNA virome. The only universal gene among RNA viruses is the gene encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed an iterative computational procedure that alternates the RdRp phylogenetic tree construction with refinement of the underlying multiple-sequence alignments. The resulting tree encompasses 4,617 RNA virus RdRps and consists of 5 major branches; 2 of the branches include positive-sense RNA viruses, 1 is a mix of positive-sense (+) RNA and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses, and 2 consist of dsRNA and negative-sense (−) RNA viruses, respectively. This tree topology implies that dsRNA viruses evolved from +RNA viruses on at least two independent occasions, whereas −RNA viruses evolved from dsRNA viruses. Reconstruction of RNA virus evolution using the RdRp tree as the scaffold suggests that the last common ancestors of the major branches of +RNA viruses encoded only the RdRp and a single jelly-roll capsid protein. Subsequent evolution involved independent capture of additional genes, in particular, those encoding distinct RNA helicases, enabling replication of larger RNA genomes and facilitating virus genome expression and virus-host interactions. Phylogenomic analysis reveals extensive gene module exchange among diverse viruses and horizontal virus transfer between distantly related hosts. Although the network of evolutionary relationships within the RNA virome is bound to further expand, the present results call for a thorough reevaluation of the RNA virus taxonomy.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.247876216,-0.074960995,-0.098473375,0.252916994,0.090810377,-0.104411997,0.042099481,0.077053479,-0.115050703,0.098079237,0.125716944,0.016142661,-0.034226865,0.046120024,0.024879398,-0.033323768,0.013891407,-0.080743497,-0.007084403,-0.001532046,0.017364675,0.01538283,-0.040151121,0.013981882,-0.146433621,-0.053397683,0.05346156,0.004825247,-0.035730735,-0.020281069
Crystal Structure of the Full-Length Japanese Encephalitis Virus NS5 Reveals a Conserved Methyltransferase-Polymerase Interface,"The flavivirus NS5 harbors a methyltransferase (MTase) in its N-terminal ≈265 residues and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) within the C-terminal part. One of the major interests and challenges in NS5 is to understand the interplay between RdRP and MTase as a unique natural fusion protein in viral genome replication and cap formation. Here, we report the first crystal structure of the full-length flavivirus NS5 from Japanese encephalitis virus. The structure completes the vision for polymerase motifs F and G, and depicts defined intra-molecular interactions between RdRP and MTase. Key hydrophobic residues in the RdRP-MTase interface are highly conserved in flaviviruses, indicating the biological relevance of the observed conformation.

Picoliter Well Array Chip-Based Digital Recombinase Polymerase Amplification for Absolute Quantification of Nucleic Acids,"Absolute, precise quantification methods expand the scope of nucleic acids research and have many practical applications. Digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) is a powerful method for nucleic acid detection and absolute quantification. However, it requires thermal cycling and accurate temperature control, which are difficult in resource-limited conditions. Accordingly, isothermal methods, such as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), are more attractive. We developed a picoliter well array (PWA) chip with 27,000 consistently sized picoliter reactions (314 pL) for isothermal DNA quantification using digital RPA (dRPA) at 39°C. Sample loading using a scraping liquid blade was simple, fast, and required small reagent volumes (i.e., <20 μL). Passivating the chip surface using a methoxy-PEG-silane agent effectively eliminated cross-contamination during dRPA. Our creative optical design enabled wide-field fluorescence imaging in situ and both end-point and real-time analyses of picoliter wells in a 6-cm(2) area. It was not necessary to use scan shooting and stitch serial small images together. Using this method, we quantified serial dilutions of a Listeria monocytogenes gDNA stock solution from 9 × 10(-1) to 4 × 10(-3) copies per well with an average error of less than 11% (N = 15). Overall dRPA-on-chip processing required less than 30 min, which was a 4-fold decrease compared to dPCR, requiring approximately 2 h. dRPA on the PWA chip provides a simple and highly sensitive method to quantify nucleic acids without thermal cycling or precise micropump/microvalve control. It has applications in fast field analysis and critical clinical diagnostics under resource-limited settings.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.008892709,0.04115696,0.192844316,0.008554575,-0.07821334,-0.023760936,0.046867034,0.0189635,-0.017998363,-0.01981722,-0.086468459,0.030537094,0.013759368,-0.131989385,-0.04089152,0.085987566,-0.096390503,-0.037832971,0.029502059,0.106671941,-0.035602765,-0.066600158,0.021176926,-0.077126208,-0.066004404,-0.008201278,-0.043841125,0.063033344,-0.030250138,0.028199885
The Effect of Steroid Use in Hospitalized Adults With Respiratory Syncytial Virus-Related Illness,"Rationale Systemic glucocorticosteroids (steroids) are commonly prescribed for patients with exacerbations of COPD during acute viral infections such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The effects of short-term high-dose steroid treatment on viral load and adaptive immunity to RSV have not been examined in adults. Objectives The objectives of this study were to measure peak viral load and duration of viral shedding, serum and nasal cytokines, RSV-specific antibody response, and lymphocyte subsets in patients admitted to the hospital with RSV infection and to compare patients treated with steroids to patients untreated with steroids. Methods Hospitalized adults who tested positive for RSV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on admission had respiratory samples collected for quantitative RT-PCR and cytokine analysis. Serum and nasal secretions were tested for RSV antibody and lymphocyte subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry at 2 days, 2 weeks, and 1 month. Main Results Thirty-three of 50 (66%) patients hospitalized with RSV received systemic steroids for a mean duration of 11 days. Those who received steroids more frequently wheezed and were less often febrile. There were no serious adverse events related to steroids and no significant differences in peak viral load, duration of RSV shedding, nasal cytokines, or lymphocyte subsets in patients treated with steroids and patients untreated with steroids. Antibody responses to RSV were slightly blunted in the steroid-treated group. Conclusions Short courses of systemic steroids in patients hospitalized with RSV infection did not affect viral load or shedding. Humoral immunity may be mildly diminished, and thus potential benefits of systemic steroids must be balanced against potential risks.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.151793791,-0.059391016,-0.057506756,-0.052100853,-0.04516486,-0.073924563,0.004571184,-0.026331552,0.001978776,-0.046833639,0.027988775,-0.06604191,-0.099259832,0.055146103,-0.083444818,-0.020247386,0.004647922,0.07530146,-0.020725129,-0.002590147,0.016640913,-0.143220835,-0.040902536,-0.036153969,0.049193483,-0.128995896,0.22207008,0.040139082,-0.063339864,0.110225495
Reprogramming cellular events by poly(ADP-ribose)-binding proteins,"Abstract Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is a posttranslational modification catalyzed by the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). These enzymes covalently modify glutamic, aspartic and lysine amino acid side chains of acceptor proteins by the sequential addition of ADP-ribose (ADPr) units. The poly(ADP-ribose) (pADPr) polymers formed alter the physico-chemical characteristics of the substrate with functional consequences on its biological activities. Recently, non-covalent binding to pADPr has emerged as a key mechanism to modulate and coordinate several intracellular pathways including the DNA damage response, protein stability and cell death. In this review, we describe the basis of non-covalent binding to pADPr that has led to the emerging concept of pADPr-responsive signaling pathways. This review emphasizes the structural elements and the modular strategies developed by pADPr-binding proteins to exert a fine-tuned control of a variety of pathways. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reactions are highly regulated processes, both spatially and temporally, for which at least four specialized pADPr-binding modules accommodate different pADPr structures and reprogram protein functions. In this review, we highlight the role of well-characterized and newly discovered pADPr-binding modules in a diverse set of physiological functions.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.126278371,-0.032458728,-0.016809989,-0.062276785,-0.090821922,0.047789756,0.058355685,-0.032148324,0.048728106,-0.008687556,-0.067366866,0.038328429,0.006225192,-0.050955948,-0.051430383,-0.021485469,0.056002778,-0.046803074,-0.05929919,0.01563451,-0.023350129,0.008997674,-0.026185223,-0.066415566,0.063872231,0.027634859,-0.066877949,0.031826944,0.046840362,-0.06403038
Multiplex isothermal solid-phase recombinase polymerase amplification for the specific and fast DNA-based detection of three bacterial pathogens,"We report on the development of an on-chip RPA (recombinase polymerase amplification) with simultaneous multiplex isothermal amplification and detection on a solid surface. The isothermal RPA was applied to amplify specific target sequences from the pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Salmonella enterica and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) using genomic DNA. Additionally, a positive plasmid control was established as an internal control. The four targets were amplified simultaneously in a quadruplex reaction. The amplicon is labeled during on-chip RPA by reverse oligonucleotide primers coupled to a fluorophore. Both amplification and spatially resolved signal generation take place on immobilized forward primers bount to expoxy-silanized glass surfaces in a pump-driven hybridization chamber. The combination of microarray technology and sensitive isothermal nucleic acid amplification at 38 °C allows for a multiparameter analysis on a rather small area. The on-chip RPA was characterized in terms of reaction time, sensitivity and inhibitory conditions. A successful enzymatic reaction is completed in <20 min and results in detection limits of 10 colony-forming units for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica and 100 colony-forming units for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The results show this method to be useful with respect to point-of-care testing and to enable simplified and miniaturized nucleic acid-based diagnostics.

The First Detection of Equine Coronavirus in Adult Horses and Foals in Ireland,"The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of equine coronavirus (ECoV) in clinical samples submitted to a diagnostic laboratory in Ireland. A total of 424 clinical samples were examined from equids with enteric disease in 24 Irish counties between 2011 and 2015. A real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect ECoV RNA. Nucleocapsid, spike and the region from the p4.7 to p12.7 genes of positive samples were sequenced, and sequence and phylogenetic analyses were conducted. Five samples (1.2%) collected in 2011 and 2013 tested positive for ECoV. Positive samples were collected from adult horses, Thoroughbred foals and a donkey foal. Sequence and/or phylogenetic analysis showed that nucleocapsid, spike and p12.7 genes were highly conserved and were closely related to ECoVs identified in other countries. In contrast, the region from p4.7 and the non-coding region following the p4.7 gene had deletions or insertions. The differences in the p4.7 region between the Irish ECoVs and other ECoVs indicated that the Irish viruses were distinguishable from those circulating in other countries. This is the first report of ECoV detected in both foals and adult horses in Ireland.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.009557862,0.006348433,0.059968747,-0.059290891,0.130081421,-0.012856558,-0.038430695,0.009670758,-0.020614794,-0.031503156,0.012005356,0.033245778,-0.008477222,-0.017800825,0.025331631,-0.053023786,0.014696311,-0.008566555,0.007124404,-0.046322228,0.029032525,0.024145138,-0.057655281,0.011137291,0.007581316,-0.033521782,-0.024288611,0.015281115,0.015879602,-0.01955459
Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Viral RNA Polymerases Link Conserved and Correlated Motions of Functional Elements to Fidelity,"Abstract The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is essential for multiplication of all RNA viruses. The sequence diversity of an RNA virus population contributes to its ability to infect the host. This diversity emanates from errors made by the RdRp during RNA synthesis. The physical basis for RdRp fidelity is unclear but is linked to conformational changes occurring during the nucleotide-addition cycle. To understand RdRp dynamics that might influence RdRp function, we have analyzed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations on the nanosecond timescale of four RdRps from the picornavirus family that exhibit 30–74% sequence identity. Principal component analysis showed that the major motions observed during the simulations derived from conserved structural motifs and regions of known function. The dynamics of residues participating in the same biochemical property, for example, RNA binding, nucleotide binding or catalysis, were correlated even when spatially distant on the RdRp structure. The conserved and correlated dynamics of functional structural elements suggest coevolution of dynamics with structure and function of the RdRp. Crystal structures of all picornavirus RdRps exhibit a template–nascent RNA duplex channel too small to fully accommodate duplex RNA. Simulations revealed opening and closing motions of the RNA and nucleoside triphosphate channels, which might be relevant to nucleoside triphosphate entry, inorganic pyrophosphate exit and translocation. A role for nanosecond timescale dynamics in RdRp fidelity is supported by the altered dynamics of the high-fidelity G64S derivative of PV RdRp relative to wild-type enzyme.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.242928039,-0.044680382,-0.101980679,0.146814013,-0.006152174,-0.066380447,0.099009938,0.044580586,-0.109319122,0.06311043,0.164717374,0.199071306,-0.139072529,-0.082154871,-0.058026696,-0.03093631,0.039776306,-0.056132809,-0.082494952,-0.098308384,0.117730733,-0.075182982,0.078154253,-0.003094072,-0.023448796,0.045116613,0.04291596,0.024630496,0.04831777,0.007911582
A duplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection of California serogroup and Cache Valley viruses,"Abstract A duplex TaqMan real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed for the detection of California (CAL) serogroup viruses and Cache Valley virus (CVV), for use in human surveillance. The targets selected for the assay were the sequences encoding the nucleocapsid protein of CAL and the G1 glycoprotein of CVV. Conserved regions were selected by aligning genetic sequences from various strains available in the GenBank database. Primers and probes were selected in conserved regions. The assay sensitivity was 75 gene copies (gc)/reaction for CAL serogroup viruses and 30 gc/reaction for CVV. The performance of the assay was linear over at least 6 log10 gc. The assay was specific, given that it did not cross-react with a variety of pathogens. It did, however, detect 11 viruses within the CAL serogroup and 12 CVV isolates. The use of an internal control ensured that possible inefficiency in nucleic acid extraction or PCR inhibition would be detected.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.006461026,0.036556572,0.164977513,0.039184296,0.029826247,0.00340055,-0.003707579,-0.021690633,0.007134626,-0.002301935,-0.036952638,0.006747797,0.00278574,-0.014721161,-0.013060041,-0.051537351,0.013259278,-0.027461651,0.02696403,-0.015483455,0.050890305,0.01571649,0.045432429,0.022843174,-0.048697738,0.030958848,0.043192145,-0.000564783,0.001190386,0.030731671
Validation of assays to monitor immune responses in the Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus),"Abstract The Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) is a valuable but under-utilized animal model for studies of human viral pathogens such as bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, flaviviruses, henipaviruses, and SARS-coronavirus. A lack of suitable reagents and specific assays for monitoring host responses has limited the use of this animal model to clinical observations, pathology and humoral immune responses. The objective of this study was to establish and validate assays to monitor host immune responses in the hamster including important pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory and innate immune responses, as well as markers of apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell junction integrity and coagulation. Commercially available mouse and rat ELISA and luminex panels were screened for potential cross-reactivity, but were found to be of limited value for studying host responses in hamsters. Subsequently, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays for the detection of 51 immune-related and four internal reference genes were developed. To validate the immune-related assays, hamsters were infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Indiana species, or treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and host immune responses were monitored in selected organs. Ribosomal protein L18 was identified as the most stable internal reference gene. In conclusion, these new assays will greatly improve the use of the hamster as an important small animal model in infectious disease research.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.04937024,0.038809361,0.038236243,-0.054503996,-0.067400402,0.073923116,0.068208604,-0.063832871,0.044050682,0.01471061,-0.070108671,-0.06188945,0.043749038,0.047068735,-0.004138482,-0.006763202,-0.023824165,-0.029564284,-0.031920872,-0.032899664,0.027874151,-0.005785113,0.004862867,-0.003636587,-0.044375592,-0.032063207,0.050134702,-0.027755231,0.036194091,-0.034069112
Evaluation of real-time RT-PCR for the quantification of FCoV shedding in the faeces of domestic cats,"Faecal samples were taken from cats living in multi-cat households with endemic feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection. Total RNA was extracted from faecal suspensions and FCoV RNA was quantified using a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The real-time RT-PCR threshold cycle (C T) values were consistently high suggesting that the samples contained very little viral RNA. However, experiments in which RNA extracted from FCoV-infected cell culture supernatants was combined with RNA extracted from faecal suspensions revealed the presence of faecal factors that significantly inhibited the reverse transcription reaction. Consequently, three methods of RNA extraction were investigated and RNA dilution was undertaken to investigate whether the effects of the faecal inhibitors could be reduced. Our results show that using the QIAgen RNA mini kit for RNA extraction and dilution of the RNA samples helps to reduce the inhibitory effects. However, because the extent of the inhibitory effects varied between faecal samples, accurate quantification proved difficult. We, therefore, conclude that although real-time RT-PCR provides an excellent method for detecting the presence of viral shedding, quantification of FCoV RNA in faecal material has to take into account the possible effects of RT-PCR inhibitors. It is, therefore, essential that all new assays, and the methods of sample preparation, are carefully evaluated before being used in a clinical setting.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.073270347,0.049000724,0.127761426,0.062137763,-0.013759129,-0.084218623,0.009146749,0.015204884,-0.057858184,-0.065152991,0.252223158,-0.067378805,0.065177232,0.10746208,-0.028864679,-0.008947664,0.037854079,0.017218857,0.040964002,-0.042767274,-0.037387238,0.050673656,0.00340317,-0.012271219,-0.044500739,-0.020364245,0.044468312,-0.022554036,0.049479942,0.023335273
Antiviral Drugs for Viruses Other Than Human Immunodeficiency Virus,"Abstract Most viral diseases, with the exception of those caused by human immunodeficiency virus, are self-limited illnesses that do not require specific antiviral therapy. The currently available antiviral drugs target 3 main groups of viruses: herpes, hepatitis, and influenza viruses. With the exception of the antisense molecule fomivirsen, all antiherpes drugs inhibit viral replication by serving as competitive substrates for viral DNA polymerase. Drugs for the treatment of influenza inhibit the ion channel M2 protein or the enzyme neuraminidase. Combination therapy with Interferon-α and ribavirin remains the backbone treatment for chronic hepatitis C; the addition of serine protease inhibitors improves the treatment outcome of patients infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 1. Chronic hepatitis B can be treated with interferon or a combination of nucleos(t)ide analogues. Notably, almost all the nucleos(t) ide analogues for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B possess anti-human immunodeficiency virus properties, and they inhibit replication of hepatitis B virus by serving as competitive substrates for its DNA polymerase. Some antiviral drugs possess multiple potential clinical applications, such as ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C and respiratory syncytial virus and cidofovir for the treatment of cytomegalovirus and other DNA viruses. Drug resistance is an emerging threat to the clinical utility of antiviral drugs. The major mechanisms for drug resistance are mutations in the viral DNA polymerase gene or in genes that encode for the viral kinases required for the activation of certain drugs such as acyclovir and ganciclovir. Widespread antiviral resistance has limited the clinical utility of M2 inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of influenza infections.

The methyltransferase domain of dengue virus protein NS5 ensures efficient RNA synthesis initiation and elongation by the polymerase domain,"Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) responsible for the replication of single-strand RNA virus genomes exert their function in the context of complex replication machineries. Within these replication complexes the polymerase activity is often highly regulated by RNA elements, proteins or other domains of multi-domain polymerases. Here, we present data of the influence of the methyltransferase domain (NS5-MTase) of dengue virus (DENV) protein NS5 on the RdRp activity of the polymerase domain (NS5-Pol). The steady-state polymerase activities of DENV-2 recombinant NS5 and NS5-Pol are compared using different biochemical assays allowing the dissection of the de novo initiation, transition and elongation steps of RNA synthesis. We show that NS5-MTase ensures efficient RdRp activity by stimulating the de novo initiation and the elongation phase. This stimulation is related to a higher affinity of NS5 toward the single-strand RNA template indicating NS5-MTase either completes a high-affinity RNA binding site and/or promotes the correct formation of the template tunnel. Furthermore, the NS5-MTase increases the affinity of the priming nucleotide ATP upon de novo initiation and causes a higher catalytic efficiency of the polymerase upon elongation. The complex stimulation pattern is discussed under the perspective that NS5 adopts several conformations during RNA synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.211356178,-0.055554648,-0.072339164,0.099424534,-0.075093969,-0.068111791,0.053094686,0.023999743,-0.042162371,0.005266469,0.076523732,0.092569551,-0.086342182,-0.000227719,-0.054192252,0.003860188,0.05371831,-0.054844211,-0.02573856,-0.020194823,-0.013505706,0.002613882,-0.00041814,-0.081306214,0.053977558,0.054892353,-0.031894348,0.015396989,0.030492984,0.045262384
"POLD1: Central mediator of DNA replication and repair, and implication in cancer and other pathologies","Abstract The evolutionarily conserved human polymerase delta (POLD1) gene encodes the large p125 subunit which provides the essential catalytic activities of polymerase δ (Polδ), mediated by 5′–3′ DNA polymerase and 3′–5′ exonuclease moieties. POLD1 associates with three smaller subunits (POLD2, POLD3, POLD4), which together with Replication Factor C and Proliferating Nuclear Cell Antigen constitute the polymerase holoenzyme. Polδ function is essential for replication, with a primary role as the replicase for the lagging strand. Polδ also has an important proofreading ability conferred by the exonuclease activity, which is critical for ensuring replicative fidelity, but also serves to repair DNA lesions arising as a result of exposure to mutagens. Polδ has been shown to be important for multiple forms of DNA repair, including nucleotide excision repair, double strand break repair, base excision repair, and mismatch repair. A growing number of studies in the past decade have linked germline and sporadic mutations in POLD1 and the other subunits of Polδ with human pathologies. Mutations in Polδ in mice and humans lead to genomic instability, mutator phenotype and tumorigenesis. The advent of genome sequencing techniques has identified damaging mutations in the proofreading domain of POLD1 as the underlying cause of some inherited cancers, and suggested that mutations in POLD1 may influence therapeutic management. In addition, mutations in POLD1 have been identified in the developmental disorders of mandibular hypoplasia, deafness, progeroid features and lipodystrophy and atypical Werner syndrome, while changes in expression or activity of POLD1 have been linked to senescence and aging. Intriguingly, some recent evidence suggests that POLD1 function may also be altered in diabetes.

Development of a Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Assay for Detection of Epidemic Human Noroviruses,"Human norovirus is a leading cause of viral gastroenteritis worldwide. Rapid detection could facilitate control, however widespread point-of-care testing is infrequently done due to the lack of robust and portable methods. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is a novel isothermal method which rapidly amplifies and detects nucleic acids using a simple device in near real-time. An RT-RPA assay targeting a recent epidemic human norovirus strain (GII.4 New Orleans) was developed and evaluated in this study. The assay successfully detected purified norovirus RNA from multiple patient outbreak isolates and had a limit of detection of 3.40 ± 0.20 log(10) genomic copies (LGC), which is comparable to most other reported isothermal norovirus amplification methods. The assay also detected norovirus in directly boiled stool, and displayed better resistance to inhibitors than a commonly used RT-qPCR assay. The assay was specific, as it did not amplify genomes from 9 non-related enteric viruses and bacteria. The assay detected norovirus in some samples in as little as 6 min, and the entire detection process can be performed in less than 30 min. The reported RT-RPA method shows promise for sensitive point-of-care detection of epidemic human norovirus, and is the fastest human norovirus amplification method to date.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.020062846,0.092868796,0.274760196,0.098683492,-0.05210244,-0.052948268,0.078842449,0.025620304,-0.017735271,-0.040425376,-0.064614983,0.085869243,-0.034580493,-0.061559905,-0.040446334,0.02825644,-0.073869116,-0.014312093,0.114014489,0.202843975,0.063812539,0.023353996,-0.040904223,0.044850865,-0.061906906,0.021313201,0.040859854,0.051856946,0.058797774,-0.01184554
Antibiotic Discontinuation Rates Associated with Positive Respiratory Viral Panel and Low Procalcitonin Results in Proven or Suspected Respiratory Infections,"INTRODUCTION: The differentiation of viral from bacterial pneumonia is important in determining whether antibiotics are appropriate for treatment of these infections. Advances in diagnostic technologies such as respiratory panels (RP) utilizing polymerase chain reactions to detect viruses and determination of procalcitonin (PCT) concentrations may aid in this differentiation. However, some studies have shown limited impact for this purpose and thus continuation of antibiotics despite results suggesting viral infection. Our objective was to characterize clinician-prescribing behavior at our institution once RP and/or PCT results were known and suggestive of a viral respiratory infection. METHODS: This retrospective analysis was based upon records of hospitalized patients in whom proven or possible respiratory infections as indicated by RP testing, respiratory bacterial culture or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 9th revision codes for acute infectious respiratory illness was documented. Patients evaluated were required to have a RP or PCT within the first 72 h of presentation. Drug orders were evaluated for discontinuation of antibiotic therapy within 48 h of a procalcitonin of <0.25 μg/mL, a positive viral RP result, or both. RESULTS: Of 4869 patients with PCT and/or RP results, 2031 were included. PCT and RP testing were obtained in 503 and 1823 patients, respectively, with 295 patients having both. Results of these tests suggested 789 patients were potential candidates for antibiotic avoidance. These included 219 with a PCT <0.25 μg/mL, 601 with a positive viral RP result, and 31 with both. Antibiotics were administered to 307 patients (39%) within the first 72 h. In these, antibiotics were discontinued within 48 h of laboratory results availability. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that positive viral RP and low PCT results are infrequently associated with discontinuation of antibiotic therapy in proven or possible respiratory infections at our institution. Direct interventions with clinicians are likely needed to correct this behavior and decrease unnecessary antibiotic use.

Evaluation of the Antiviral Potential of Halogenated Dihydrorugosaflavonoids and Molecular Modeling with nsP3 Protein of Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV),"[Image: see text] Antiviral therapy is crucial for the circumvention of viral epidemics. The unavailability of a specific antiviral drug against the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) disease has created an alarming situation to identify or develop potent chemical molecules for remedial management of CHIKV. In the present investigation, in silico studies of dihydrorugosaflavonoid derivatives (5a–f) with non-structural protein-3 (nsP3) were carried out. nsP3 replication protein has recently been considered as a possible antiviral target in which crucial inhibitors fit into the adenosine-binding pocket of the macrodomain. The 4′-halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids displayed intrinsic binding with the nsp3 macrodomain (PDB ID: 3GPO) of CHIKV. Compounds 5c and 5d showed docking scores of −7.54 and −6.86 kcal mol(–1), respectively. Various in vitro assays were performed to confirm their (5a–f) antiviral potential against CHIKV. The non-cytotoxic dose was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and was found to be <100 μM. The compounds 5c and 5d showed their inhibitory potential for CHIKV, which was determined through cytopathic effect assay and plaque reduction assay, which show inhibition up to 95 and 92% for 70 μM concentration of the compounds, respectively. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay result confirmed the ability of 5c and 5d to reduce the viral RNA level at 70 μM concentration of compounds to nearly 95 and 93% concentration, respectively, in cells with CHIKV infection. Further, the CHIKV-inhibitory capacity of these compounds was corroborated by execution of immunofluorescence assay. The executed work will be meaningful for the future research of studied dihydrorugosaflavonoids against prime antiviral entrants, leading to remedial management to preclude CHIKV infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.060714,0.00156685,0.029825653,-0.013945488,-0.12168082,0.056778642,0.063729582,-0.021381969,0.041272941,-0.018687666,-0.003782519,0.04571577,-0.034276087,0.008544398,-0.03096549,-0.008428665,-0.006340469,0.070423564,0.10641489,0.014718774,-0.001604365,0.029972864,0.018650041,0.04254623,0.022371168,0.053612965,0.056695378,-0.056744023,0.038448008,0.005546745
Viral Macrodomains: Unique Mediators of Viral Replication and Pathogenesis,"Viruses from the Coronaviridae, Togaviridae, and Hepeviridae families ​all contain genes that encode a conserved protein domain, called a macrodomain; however, the role of this domain during infection has remained enigmatic. The recent discovery that mammalian macrodomain proteins enzymatically remove ADP-ribose, a common post-translation modification, from proteins has led to an outburst of studies describing both the enzymatic activity and function of viral macrodomains. These new studies have defined these domains as de-ADP-ribosylating enzymes, which indicates that these viruses have evolved to counteract antiviral ADP-ribosylation, likely mediated by poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs). Here, we comprehensively review this rapidly expanding field, describing the structures and enzymatic activities of viral macrodomains, and discussing their roles in viral replication and pathogenesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.125756054,-0.057686384,-0.055427972,0.002796958,-0.075904742,0.035715584,0.078629379,-0.023870082,0.033241199,0.025070279,-0.043137939,0.016390005,0.023285763,-0.021380774,-0.036009781,-0.059995741,0.072678969,-0.044838215,-0.042316088,0.062544228,-0.043812033,0.046121875,-0.059083645,-0.027147905,0.06605873,0.034268865,-0.028409295,0.011056877,0.034747016,-0.068531187
Influence of age and body condition on astrovirus infection of bats in Singapore: An evolutionary and epidemiological analysis,"Bats are unique mammals that are reservoirs of high levels of virus diversity. Although several of these viruses are zoonotic, the majority are not. Astroviruses, transmitted fecal-orally, are commonly detected in a wide diversity of bat species, are prevalent at high rates and are not thought to directly infect humans. These features make astroviruses useful in examining virus evolutionary history, epidemiology in the host, and temporal shedding trends. Our study screened for the presence of astroviruses in bats in Singapore, reconstructed the phylogenetic relations of the polymerase genes and tested for population characteristics associated with infection. Of the seven species screened, astroviruses were detected in Rhinolophus lepidus and Eonycteris spelaea. The R. lepidus sequences grouped with other Rhinolophus astrovirus sequences from China and Laos, while the Eoncyteris sequences formed a distinct clade with astroviruses from Rousettus spp. in Laos and Pteropus giganteus in Bangladesh, but not with other E. spelaea sequences. Longitudinal collections of Eonycteris feces demonstrated variable shedding. Juvenile status of bats was a risk factor for astroviruses. This study highlights the diversity of astroviruses in nectivorous and insectivorous bats in Singapore and provides a predictive framework for understanding astrovirus infection in these bats. It also suggests that in addition to host phylogenetic relatedness, host ecology, such as roosting behavior, may drive co-infections, virus maintenance and spillover.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.043900412,-0.000413146,-0.014623544,-0.056962258,0.229937572,0.122438003,0.216201848,0.052108552,-0.095807041,-0.039201918,-0.063239257,-0.096069797,-0.027775456,0.036219447,0.0048245,0.048939184,-7.43E-05,0.031582167,-0.015213462,0.004469088,0.000333929,0.001750744,-0.046582387,-0.01604083,0.000242651,-0.013942717,0.023886139,-0.009698153,-0.012925082,0.014296877
Comparative evaluation of commercially available manual and automated nucleic acid extraction methods for rotavirus RNA detection in stools,"Abstract Rotaviruses are a major cause of viral gastroenteritis in children. For accurate and sensitive detection of rotavirus RNA from stool samples by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the extraction process must be robust. However, some extraction methods may not remove the strong RT-PCR inhibitors known to be present in stool samples. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the performance of six extraction methods used commonly for extraction of rotavirus RNA from stool, which have never been formally evaluated: the MagNA Pure Compact, KingFisher Flex and NucliSENS® easyMAG® instruments, the NucliSENS® miniMAG® semi-automated system, and two manual purification kits, the QIAamp Viral RNA kit and a modified RNaid® kit. Using each method, total nucleic acid or RNA was extracted from eight rotavirus-positive stool samples with enzyme immunoassay optical density (EIA OD) values ranging from 0.176 to 3.098. Extracts prepared using the MagNA Pure Compact instrument yielded the most consistent results by qRT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR. When extracts prepared from a dilution series were extracted by the 6 methods and tested, rotavirus RNA was detected in all samples by qRT-PCR but by conventional RT-PCR testing, only the MagNA Pure Compact and KingFisher Flex extracts were positive in all cases. RT-PCR inhibitors were detected in extracts produced with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit. The findings of this study should prove useful for selection of extraction methods to be incorporated into future rotavirus detection and genotyping protocols.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.006304258,0.061045058,0.174688804,0.092269037,-0.002975299,-0.099340017,0.00342007,0.004505402,-0.059282479,0.008143201,0.082016235,0.003575498,-0.037990636,0.090228681,0.038182047,-0.021704615,0.042584524,0.005349657,-3.39E-05,-0.135474755,-0.043803918,0.102353826,-0.031885121,-0.017943483,0.013840755,-0.024871435,0.033741609,-0.070967236,0.032988057,0.033485956
Detection of respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens causing pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in Beijing using real-time PCR,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the etiology and prevalence of pediatric CAP in Beijing using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. METHODS: Between February 15, 2011 and January 18, 2012, 371 pediatric patients with CAP were enrolled at Beijing Children's Hospital. Sixteen respiratory viruses and two bacteria were detected from tracheal aspirate specimens using commercially available multiplex real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) kits. RESULTS: A single viral pathogen was detected in 35.3% of enrolled patients, multiple viruses in 11.6%, and virus/bacteria coinfection in 17.8%. In contrast, only 6.5% of patients had a single bacterial pathogen and 2.2% were infected with multiple bacteria. The etiological agent was unknown for 26.7% of patients. The most common viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (43.9%), rhinovirus (14.8%), parainﬂuenza virus (9.4%), and adenovirus (8.6%). In patients under three years of age, RSV (44.6%), rhinovirus (12.8%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.9%) were the most frequent pathogens. In children aged 3–7 years, S. pneumoniae (38.9%), RSV (30.6%), Haemophilus inﬂuenzae (19.4%), and adenovirus (19.4%) were most prevalent. Finally in children over seven years, RSV (47.3%), S. pneumoniae (41.9%), and rhinovirus (21.5%) infections were most frequent. CONCLUSIONS: Viral pathogens, specifically RSV, were responsible for the majority of CAP in pediatric patients. However, both S. pneumoniae and H. inﬂuenzae contributed as major causes of disease.

Conserved presence of G-quadruplex forming sequences in the Long Terminal Repeat Promoter of Lentiviruses,"G-quadruplexes (G4s) are secondary structures of nucleic acids that epigenetically regulate cellular processes. In the human immunodeficiency lentivirus 1 (HIV-1), dynamic G4s are located in the unique viral LTR promoter. Folding of HIV-1 LTR G4s inhibits viral transcription; stabilization by G4 ligands intensifies this effect. Cellular proteins modulate viral transcription by inducing/unfolding LTR G4s. We here expanded our investigation on the presence of LTR G4s to all lentiviruses. G4s in the 5′-LTR U3 region were completely conserved in primate lentiviruses. A G4 was also present in a cattle-infecting lentivirus. All other non-primate lentiviruses displayed hints of less stable G4s. In primate lentiviruses, the possibility to fold into G4s was highly conserved among strains. LTR G4 sequences were very similar among phylogenetically related primate viruses, while they increasingly differed in viruses that diverged early from a common ancestor. A strong correlation between primate lentivirus LTR G4s and Sp1/NFκB binding sites was found. All LTR G4s folded: their complexity was assessed by polymerase stop assay. Our data support a role of the lentiviruses 5′-LTR G4 region as control centre of viral transcription, where folding/unfolding of G4s and multiple recruitment of factors based on both sequence and structure may take place.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.057497316,-0.030054348,0.007215942,-0.049132763,-0.012689821,0.019110841,0.025076721,-0.002824249,0.007020488,-0.012334846,-0.0177074,0.017192958,-0.006487119,-0.032372355,-0.001007951,0.003885379,0.003978825,-0.007005521,-0.028045986,-0.004838511,-0.003254439,0.00529477,-0.033334287,0.012674855,0.007017412,-0.016178627,-0.010647849,-0.009278431,0.026001532,0.002156828
Survey and Visual Detection of Zaire ebolavirus in Clinical Samples Targeting the Nucleoprotein Gene in Sierra Leone,"Ebola virus (EBOV) can lead to severe hemorrhagic fever with a high risk of death in humans and other primates. To guide treatment and prevent spread of the viral infection, a rapid and sensitive detection method is required for clinical samples. Here, we described and evaluated a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method to detect Zaire ebolavirus using the nucleoprotein gene (NP) as a target sequence. Two different techniques were used, a calcein/Mn(2+) complex chromogenic method and real-time turbidity monitoring. The RT-LAMP assay detected the NP target sequence with a limit of 4.56 copies/μL within 45 min under 61°C, a similar even or increase in sensitivity than that of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Additionally, all pseudoviral particles or non- Zaire EBOV genomes were negative for LAMP detection, indicating that the assay was highly specific for EBOV. To appraise the availability of the RT-LAMP method for use in clinical diagnosis of EBOV, of 417 blood or swab samples collected from patients with clinically suspected infections in Sierra Leone, 307 were identified for RT-LAMP-based surveillance of EBOV. Therefore, the highly specific and sensitive RT-LAMP method allows the rapid detection of EBOV, and is a suitable tool for clinical screening, diagnosis, and primary quarantine purposes.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.051803827,0.120014614,0.32115851,0.102532056,-0.072328961,-0.073583648,0.006069743,0.01471766,-0.022468985,-0.04309267,-0.048808616,0.018379515,-0.016155967,0.050456797,-0.086268975,0.041107475,0.041143491,0.090323403,-0.15390753,0.020097375,-0.112442196,-0.058710187,-0.11769969,0.204106088,0.134355491,0.018007395,-0.049399378,0.08496291,-0.052828175,0.006125212
The impact of rapid molecular diagnostic testing for respiratory viruses on outcomes for emergency department patients,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) in emergency departments (EDs) is associated with better patient and laboratory outcomes than standard multiplex PCR testing. DESIGN, SETTING: A before‐and‐after study in four metropolitan EDs in New South Wales. PARTICIPANTS: 1491 consecutive patients tested by standard multiplex PCR during July–December 2016, and 2250 tested by rapid PCR during July–December 2017. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital admissions; ED length of stay (LOS); test turnaround time; patient receiving test result before leaving the ED; ordering of other laboratory tests. RESULTS: Compared with those tested by standard PCR, fewer patients tested by rapid PCR were admitted to hospital (73.3% v 77.7%; P < 0.001) and more received their test results before leaving the ED (67.4% v 1.3%; P < 0.001); the median test turnaround time was also shorter (2.4 h [IQR, 1.6–3.9 h] v 26.7 h [IQR, 21.2–37.8 h]). The proportion of patients admitted to hospital was also lower in the rapid PCR group for both children under 18 (50.6% v 66.6%; P < 0.001) and patients over 60 years of age (84.3% v 91.8%; P < 0.001). Significantly fewer blood culture, blood gas, sputum culture, and respiratory bacterial and viral serology tests were ordered for patients tested by rapid PCR. ED LOS was similar for the rapid (7.4 h; IQR, 5.0–12.9 h) and standard PCR groups (6.5 h; IQR, 4.2–11.9 h; P = 0.27). CONCLUSION: Rapid PCR testing of ED patients for influenza virus and RSV was associated with better outcomes on a range of indicators, suggesting benefits for patients and the health care system.

Immunogenicity of adenovirus-vector vaccine targeting hepatitis B virus: non-clinical safety assessment in non-human primates,"BACKGROUND: A new promising therapeutic approach has emerged for patients chronically infected by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the development of a non-replicative adenovirus vector vaccine candidate (Ad-HBV). The vaccine encodes a fusion protein composed of a truncated HBV core protein, mutated polymerase protein, and two envelope domains. In this study, we assessed the immunogenicity of Ad-HBV administered to cynomolgus monkeys during a non-clinical safety assessment. METHODS: The virus was subcutaneously administered at 1.0 × 10(9) viral particles (VP)/animal (low-dose group), 1.0 × 10(10) VP/animal (mid-dose group), and 1.0 × 10(11) VP/animal (high-dose group); the control groups were administered an Ad5-null virus (1.0 × 10(11) VP/animal) and saline only. RESULTS: Except for inflammatory cell infiltration under the skin at the injection sites and transient elevation of body temperature and serum albumin, no Ad-HBV-related toxic effects were noted in any treatment group. Moreover, interferon (IFN)-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assays showed that Ad-HBV induced the targeting of T cells to a broad spectrum of HBV-specific epitopes spanning all three of the selected HBV immunogens (core, polymerase, and envelope domains) in a dose-dependent manner. Although anti-Ad antibody was produced in all groups (except for the saline control), the antibody titers were significantly lower in the high-dose Ad-HBV group than in the group that received the same dose of the Ad-null empty vector. In addition, the IFN-γ and IL-2 expression levels in the liver were significantly improved for the mid-dose, high-dose, and Ad-null control group (p < 0.05), but not for the low-dose group. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, this safety assessment indicates that the Ad-HBV candidate vaccine is a potent specific immunotherapeutic agent, supporting its further clinical development as an anti-HBV infection vaccine.

Human virome in nasopharynx and tracheal secretion samples,"BACKGROUND: In Brazil the implementation of the Sentinel Surveillance System of Influenza began in 2000. Central public health laboratories use reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for diagnosis of respiratory viruses, but this protocol identifies only specific targets, resulted in inconclusive diagnosis for many samples. Thus, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) would be complementary method in the identification of pathogens in inconclusive samples for RT-qPCR or other specific detection protocols. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to detect unidentified viruses using HTS approach in negative samples of nasopharynx/tracheal secretions by the standard RT-qPCR collected in the Federal District, Brazil. METHODS: Nucleic acids were extracted from samples collected in winter period of 2016 and subjected to HTS. The results were confirmed by the multiplex PR21 RT-qPCR, which identifies 21 respiratory pathogens. FINDINGS: The main viruses identified by HTS were of families Herpesviridae, Coronaviridae, Parvoviridae and Picornaviridae, with the emphasis on rhinoviruses. The presence of respiratory viruses in the samples was confirmed by the PR21 multiplex RT-qPCR. Coronavirus, enterovirus, bocavirus and rhinovirus were found by multiplex RT-qPCR as well as by HTS analyses. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Wide virus diversity was found by different methodologies and high frequency of rhinovirus occurrence was confirmed in population in winter, showing its relevance for public health.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.127403268,0.032404363,0.158614284,0.108180635,0.057868338,-0.004649218,0.014044587,0.005879652,-0.022971552,0.015341146,0.0167228,-0.008310352,-0.00071623,0.044165816,0.060396554,-0.047600585,0.047392479,-0.055609102,-0.008919266,-0.043261928,-0.022102452,0.009980641,-0.061658947,0.073509317,0.044326044,0.023927863,0.020738322,0.026830356,0.037324005,-0.097390925
Intense circulation of A/H5N1 and other avian influenza viruses in Cambodian live-bird markets with serological evidence of sub-clinical human infections,"Surveillance for avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in poultry and environmental samples was conducted in four live-bird markets in Cambodia from January through November 2013. Through real-time RT-PCR testing, AIVs were detected in 45% of 1048 samples collected throughout the year. Detection rates ranged from 32% and 18% in duck and chicken swabs, respectively, to 75% in carcass wash water samples. Influenza A/H5N1 virus was detected in 79% of samples positive for influenza A virus and 35% of all samples collected. Sequence analysis of full-length haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from A/H5N1 viruses, and full-genome analysis of six representative isolates, revealed that the clade 1.1.2 reassortant virus associated with Cambodian human cases during 2013 was the only A/H5N1 virus detected during the year. However, multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of HA and NA genes revealed co-circulation of at least nine low pathogenic AIVs from HA1, HA2, HA3, HA4, HA6, HA7, HA9, HA10 and HA11 subtypes. Four repeated serological surveys were conducted throughout the year in a cohort of 125 poultry workers. Serological testing found an overall prevalence of 4.5% and 1.8% for antibodies to A/H5N1 and A/H9N2, respectively. Seroconversion rates of 3.7 and 0.9 cases per 1000 person-months participation were detected for A/H5N1 and A/H9N2, respectively. Peak AIV circulation was associated with the Lunar New Year festival. Knowledge of periods of increased circulation of avian influenza in markets should inform intervention measures such as market cleaning and closures to reduce risk of human infections and emergence of novel AIVs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.09960025,-0.042353154,0.062275091,0.076923387,0.091926174,0.166383279,-0.067437008,-0.018419381,-0.00839412,-0.004432646,0.032634042,0.009064558,-0.006243606,0.020220953,0.030890639,0.000454319,0.005151891,-0.050409626,0.009767172,-0.044189572,0.014725041,0.02866608,-0.032165924,0.05326385,-0.027896513,0.006487432,0.001430853,0.017747884,0.023196494,-0.041599068
Identification of enteric viruses circulating in a dog population with low vaccine coverage,"Although the use of vaccines has controlled enteric diseases in dogs in many developed countries, vaccine coverage is still under optimal situation in Brazil. There is a large population of nonimmunized dogs and few studies about the identification of the viruses associated with diarrhea. To address this situation, stool samples from 325 dogs were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction for the detection of common enteric viruses such as Canine adenovirus (CAdV), Canine coronavirus (CCoV), Canine distemper virus (CDV), Canine rotavirus (CRV) and Carnivorous protoparvovirus 1 (canine parvovirus 2; CPV-2). At least one of these species was detected in 56.6% (184/325) of the samples. The viruses detected most frequently in either diarrheic or nondiarrheic dog feces were CPV-2 (54.3% of the positive samples), CDV (45.1%) and CCoV (30.4%), followed by CRV (8.2%) and CAdV (4.9%). Only one agent was detected in the majority of the positive samples (63%), but co-infections were present in 37% of the positive samples and mainly included CDV and CPV-2. The data presented herein can improve the clinical knowledge in regions with low vaccine coverage and highlight the need to improve the methods used to control these infectious diseases in domestic dogs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.043560696,-0.004583477,0.11841098,-0.06548473,0.088163881,0.013227986,0.051267776,-0.005999672,-0.045105525,0.004636738,0.083346536,0.049043286,-0.039913787,-0.058210268,0.115507783,-0.068939607,-0.043997739,-0.108214378,0.159142034,0.000155331,0.276242857,0.187240865,-0.151492097,-0.010857274,0.254746941,-0.205377294,-0.138178468,-0.030325436,-0.080986184,0.096842241
"Characterization of G-Quadruplex Motifs in espB, espK, and cyp51 Genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as Potential Drug Targets","G-quadruplex structure forming motifs are among the most studied evolutionarily conserved drug targets that are present throughout the genome of different organisms and susceptible to influencing various biological processes. Here we report highly conserved potential G-quadruplex motifs (PGQs) in three essential genes (espK, espB, and cyp51) among 160 strains of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome. Products of these genes are involved in pathways that are responsible for virulence determination of bacteria inside the host cell and its survival by maintaining membrane fluidity. The espK and espB genes are essential players that prevent the formation of mature phagolysosome and antigen presentation by host macrophages. The cyp51 is another PGQ-possessing gene involved in sterol biosynthesis pathway and membrane formation. In the present study, we revealed the formation of stable intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex structures by Mycobacterium PGQs using a combination of techniques (NMR, circular dichroism [CD], and gel electrophoresis). Next, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and CD melting analysis demonstrated that a well-known G-quadruplex ligand, TMPyP4, binds to and stabilizes these PGQ motifs. Finally, polymerase inhibition and qRT-PCR assays highlight the biological relevance of PGQ-possessing genes in this pathogen and demonstrate that G-quadruplexes are potential drug targets for the development of effective anti-tuberculosis therapeutics.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.105332202,-0.012252196,0.024176286,-0.053570027,-0.039436842,0.05775109,0.049293278,-0.013790345,0.02846428,0.013655042,-0.070768463,0.0033644,0.024881902,-0.025245463,-0.018372071,-0.03332745,0.006183123,0.004299326,-0.039669821,-0.02455078,0.005405322,0.031297812,-0.026675295,0.020718094,-0.021010245,-0.039933396,0.020583479,0.019076821,0.064111462,-0.021211875
"Fidelity Variants of RNA Dependent RNA Polymerases Uncover an Indirect, Mutagenic Activity of Amiloride Compounds","In a screen for RNA mutagen resistance, we isolated a high fidelity RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) variant of Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3). Curiously, this variant A372V is also resistant to amiloride. We hypothesize that amiloride has a previously undescribed mutagenic activity. Indeed, amiloride compounds increase the mutation frequencies of CVB3 and poliovirus and high fidelity variants of both viruses are more resistant to this effect. We hypothesize that this mutagenic activity is mediated through alterations in intracellular ions such as Mg(2+) and Mn(2+), which in turn increase virus mutation frequency by affecting RdRp fidelity. Furthermore, we show that another amiloride-resistant RdRp variant, S299T, is completely resistant to this mutagenic activity and unaffected by changes in ion concentrations. We show that RdRp variants resist the mutagenic activity of amiloride via two different mechanisms: 1) increased fidelity that generates virus populations presenting lower basal mutation frequencies or 2) resisting changes in divalent cation concentrations that affect polymerase fidelity. Our results uncover a new antiviral approach based on mutagenesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.131365066,-0.041003255,-0.047603865,0.047804008,-0.061359793,0.03120713,0.100019396,0.011069996,-0.045212693,0.054735215,0.111660888,0.14190155,-0.110155922,-0.041911275,-0.016766005,0.018820187,-0.009977494,-0.017741216,-0.050098592,-0.056446476,0.118783372,-0.09700429,0.103616242,0.074733611,-0.014950369,0.092394401,0.03918146,-0.035446521,-0.049303044,-0.05534578
Development and Evaluation of Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay for Rapid and Real-Time Detection of the Swine-Origin Influenza A H1N1 Virus,"The recent emergence of the swine-origin influenza A H1N1 virus (S-OIV) poses a serious global health threat. Rapid detection and differentiation of S-OIV from seasonal influenza is crucial for patient management and control of the epidemics. A one-step, single-tube accelerated and quantitative S-OIV-specific H1 reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RTLAMP) assay for clinical diagnosis of S-OIV by targeting the H1 gene is reported in this article. A comparative evaluation of the H1-specific RTLAMP assay vis-à-vis the World Health Organization-approved real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR), involving 239 acute-phase throat swab samples, demonstrated exceptionally higher sensitivity by picking up all of the 116 H1N1-positive cases and 36 additional positive cases among the negatives that were sequence-confirmed as S-OIV H1N1. None of the real-time RTPCR-positive samples were missed by the RTLAMP system. The comparative analysis revealed that S-OIV RTLAMP was up to tenfold more sensitive than the World Health Organization real-time RTPCR; it had a detection limit of 0.1 tissue culture infectious dosage of 50/ml. One of the most attractive features of this isothermal gene amplification assay is that it seems to have an advantage in monitoring gene amplification by means of SYBR Green I dye-mediated naked-eye visualization within 30 minutes compared to 2 to 3 hours for a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. This suggests that the RTLAMP assay is a valuable tool for rapid, real-time detection and quantification of S-OIV in acute-phase throat swab samples without requiring sophisticated equipment.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.082792499,0.078696066,0.209457253,0.097071937,-0.039979571,0.05757633,-0.07168378,0.025744505,-0.017194896,-0.069935109,-0.049364434,0.010316864,0.002137077,-0.021616451,-0.016019866,0.00599818,-0.014536023,-0.01197448,0.010165428,-0.021079241,-0.014727,-0.014382913,-0.027050683,-0.050878768,-0.086094208,0.028298635,-0.035519733,0.068750186,-0.011365491,0.007463603
Influenza A Virus Assembly Intermediates Fuse in the Cytoplasm,"Reassortment of influenza viral RNA (vRNA) segments in co-infected cells can lead to the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential. Replication of influenza vRNA occurs in the nucleus of infected cells, while progeny virions bud from the plasma membrane. However, the intracellular mechanics of vRNA assembly into progeny virions is not well understood. Here we used recent advances in microscopy to explore vRNA assembly and transport during a productive infection. We visualized four distinct vRNA segments within a single cell using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and observed that foci containing more than one vRNA segment were found at the external nuclear periphery, suggesting that vRNA segments are not exported to the cytoplasm individually. Although many cytoplasmic foci contain multiple vRNA segments, not all vRNA species are present in every focus, indicating that assembly of all eight vRNA segments does not occur prior to export from the nucleus. To extend the observations made in fixed cells, we used a virus that encodes GFP fused to the viral polymerase acidic (PA) protein (WSN PA-GFP) to explore the dynamics of vRNA assembly in live cells during a productive infection. Since WSN PA-GFP colocalizes with viral nucleoprotein and influenza vRNA segments, we used it as a surrogate for visualizing vRNA transport in 3D and at high speed by inverted selective-plane illumination microscopy. We observed cytoplasmic PA-GFP foci colocalizing and traveling together en route to the plasma membrane. Our data strongly support a model in which vRNA segments are exported from the nucleus as complexes that assemble en route to the plasma membrane through dynamic colocalization events in the cytoplasm.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.073857877,-0.058152781,-0.018178453,-0.01531702,-0.05565821,0.07675511,0.005809824,-0.006591524,0.013570024,-0.0360753,-0.007404693,-0.013567228,-0.017236866,0.032015066,0.036066979,0.054114753,0.039153524,-0.035837394,-0.027209074,0.01125502,0.003360276,0.032435582,-0.013631377,-0.029919718,-0.000307735,-0.006145586,-0.023382518,0.010151841,-0.031084235,0.038511396
Self-Swabbing for Virological Confirmation of Influenza-Like Illness Among an Internet-Based Cohort in the UK During the 2014-2015 Flu Season: Pilot Study,"BACKGROUND: Routine influenza surveillance, based on laboratory confirmation of viral infection, often fails to estimate the true burden of influenza-like illness (ILI) in the community because those with ILI often manage their own symptoms without visiting a health professional. Internet-based surveillance can complement this traditional surveillance by measuring symptoms and health behavior of a population with minimal time delay. Flusurvey, the UK’s largest crowd-sourced platform for surveillance of influenza, collects routine data on more than 6000 voluntary participants and offers real-time estimates of ILI circulation. However, one criticism of this method of surveillance is that it is only able to assess ILI, rather than virologically confirmed influenza. OBJECTIVE: We designed a pilot study to see if it was feasible to ask individuals from the Flusurvey platform to perform a self-swabbing task and to assess whether they were able to collect samples with a suitable viral content to detect an influenza virus in the laboratory. METHODS: Virological swabbing kits were sent to pilot study participants, who then monitored their ILI symptoms over the influenza season (2014-2015) through the Flusurvey platform. If they reported ILI, they were asked to undertake self-swabbing and return the swabs to a Public Health England laboratory for multiplex respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction testing. RESULTS: A total of 700 swab kits were distributed at the start of the study; from these, 66 participants met the definition for ILI and were asked to return samples. In all, 51 samples were received in the laboratory, 18 of which tested positive for a viral cause of ILI (35%). CONCLUSIONS: This demonstrated proof of concept that it is possible to apply self-swabbing for virological laboratory testing to an online cohort study. This pilot does not have significant numbers to validate whether Flusurvey surveillance accurately reflects influenza infection in the community, but highlights that the methodology is feasible. Self-swabbing could be expanded to larger online surveillance activities, such as during the initial stages of a pandemic, to understand community transmission or to better assess interseasonal activity.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.113063182,-0.056392891,-0.001515149,0.105989336,-0.006660554,0.187699288,-0.078631015,0.010340836,-0.008014732,-0.079132135,0.016032137,-0.003020685,-0.00443122,-0.051472036,0.023601016,0.009438044,-0.014762218,-0.074706232,0.030488196,-0.070428642,-0.024455587,-0.051762318,-0.02000633,-0.074683258,0.042365671,-0.006303173,-0.018173297,0.066580249,0.025253852,-0.027218199
An eco-epidemiological study of Morbilli-related paramyxovirus infection in Madagascar bats reveals host-switching as the dominant macro-evolutionary mechanism,"An eco-epidemiological investigation was carried out on Madagascar bat communities to better understand the evolutionary mechanisms and environmental factors that affect virus transmission among bat species in closely related members of the genus Morbillivirus, currently referred to as Unclassified Morbilli-related paramyxoviruses (UMRVs). A total of 947 bats were investigated originating from 52 capture sites (22 caves, 18 buildings, and 12 outdoor sites) distributed over different bioclimatic zones of the island. Using RT-PCR targeting the L-polymerase gene of the Paramyxoviridae family, we found that 10.5% of sampled bats were infected, representing six out of seven families and 15 out of 31 species analyzed. Univariate analysis indicates that both abiotic and biotic factors may promote viral infection. Using generalized linear modeling of UMRV infection overlaid on biotic and abiotic variables, we demonstrate that sympatric occurrence of bats is a major factor for virus transmission. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that all paramyxoviruses infecting Malagasy bats are UMRVs and showed little host specificity. Analyses using the maximum parsimony reconciliation tool CoRe-PA, indicate that host-switching, rather than co-speciation, is the dominant macro-evolutionary mechanism of UMRVs among Malagasy bats.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.064372165,0.034159371,-0.000130577,-0.024432401,0.265169216,0.141644925,0.265215483,0.075391398,-0.109474605,-0.076446125,-0.124195466,-0.142066282,-0.064340381,0.116605375,-0.044971631,0.068542552,0.035161254,0.039244313,0.000702809,0.010696898,-0.034681582,0.015853015,-0.024169144,-0.067220309,0.023633712,0.033611743,0.03633574,-0.00382339,-0.005780772,0.043068043
Development and characterization of a new cell line derived from European eel Anguilla anguilla kidney,"A new cell line derived from the kidney of European eel, Anguilla anguilla, has been established and characterized. This cell line, designated as EK (eel kidney), has been maintained in Leibovitz's L-15 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for over 24 months, and subcultured more than 60 times. This cell line consists predominantly of fibroblast-like cells, and can grow at 15–37°C under an optimum temperature of 26°C. The origin of this cell line was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and 18s recombinant (r)RNA sequencing. The chromosome analysis of EK cells at passage 58 revealed an ananeuploid karyotype. The EK cells were successfully transfected with the Pegfp-N1 plasmid, suggesting its potential in genetic studies. The susceptibility test showed a significant cytopathic effect (CPE) in EK cells for Rana grylio virus, and the viral replication was evidenced with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. After poly (I:C) stimulation, the expression of the immune-related molecules including interferon regulatory factor-3 (irf3), interferon regulatory factor-7 (irf7) and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) were significantly upregulated in EK cells, while the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF-β) was downregulated.

Alu RNA regulates the cellular pool of active ribosomes by targeted delivery of SRP9/14 to 40S subunits,"The human genome contains about 1.5 million Alu elements, which are transcribed into Alu RNAs by RNA polymerase III. Their expression is upregulated following stress and viral infection, and they associate with the SRP9/14 protein dimer in the cytoplasm forming Alu RNPs. Using cell-free translation, we have previously shown that Alu RNPs inhibit polysome formation. Here, we describe the mechanism of Alu RNP-mediated inhibition of translation initiation and demonstrate its effect on translation of cellular and viral RNAs. Both cap-dependent and IRES-mediated initiation is inhibited. Inhibition involves direct binding of SRP9/14 to 40S ribosomal subunits and requires Alu RNA as an assembly factor but its continuous association with 40S subunits is not required for inhibition. Binding of SRP9/14 to 40S prevents 48S complex formation by interfering with the recruitment of mRNA to 40S subunits. In cells, overexpression of Alu RNA decreases translation of reporter mRNAs and this effect is alleviated with a mutation that reduces its affinity for SRP9/14. Alu RNPs also inhibit the translation of cellular mRNAs resuming translation after stress and of viral mRNAs suggesting a role of Alu RNPs in adapting the translational output in response to stress and viral infection.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.121575181,-0.059432469,-0.037835399,-0.027570296,-0.066035548,-0.01576545,-0.009645306,0.005874793,0.016004095,-0.025542924,-0.036694516,-0.03402355,0.004946832,0.038753743,-0.014420711,0.018235347,0.005182163,-0.029494921,-0.026263995,0.018466131,-0.02385413,0.045516937,-0.021701508,-0.007598863,0.020556359,-0.060141944,-0.023813291,0.01106094,0.067059735,0.015468638
Selective Bottlenecks Shape Evolutionary Pathways Taken during Mammalian Adaptation of a 1918-like Avian Influenza Virus,"Summary Avian influenza virus reassortants resembling the 1918 human pandemic virus can become transmissible among mammals by acquiring mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) and polymerase. Using the ferret model, we trace the evolutionary pathway by which an avian-like virus evolves the capacity for mammalian replication and airborne transmission. During initial infection, within-host HA diversity increased drastically. Then, airborne transmission fixed two polymerase mutations that do not confer a detectable replication advantage. In later transmissions, selection fixed advantageous HA1 variants. Transmission initially involved a “loose” bottleneck, which became strongly selective after additional HA mutations emerged. The stringency and evolutionary forces governing between-host bottlenecks may therefore change throughout host adaptation. Mutations occurred in multiple combinations in transmitted viruses, suggesting that mammalian transmissibility can evolve through multiple genetic pathways despite phenotypic constraints. Our data provide a glimpse into avian influenza virus adaptation in mammals, with broad implications for surveillance on potentially zoonotic viruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.048974268,-0.063097582,-0.032426299,0.073207112,0.018744294,0.211631343,0.033392407,0.007155969,-0.001964939,0.015836703,0.019321278,-0.025774873,0.001518556,0.031651288,0.03966194,0.028325349,-0.020010375,-0.044831252,-0.047949169,0.042019275,0.047880516,-0.001053474,-0.03783801,0.074873251,-0.079272171,-0.011186082,0.016006921,-0.00882136,-0.058528406,-0.076855027
Asthmatics with exacerbation during acute respiratory illness exhibit unique transcriptional signatures within the nasal mucosa,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory illness is the leading cause of asthma exacerbations yet the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. To address the deficiencies in our understanding of the molecular events characterizing acute respiratory illness-induced asthma exacerbations, we undertook a transcriptional profiling study of the nasal mucosa over the course of acute respiratory illness amongst individuals with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis and no underlying respiratory disease. METHODS: Transcriptional profiling experiments were performed using the Agilent Whole Human Genome 4X44K array platform. Time point-based microarray and principal component analyses were conducted to identify and distinguish acute respiratory illness-associated transcriptional profiles over the course of our study. Gene enrichment analysis was conducted to identify biological processes over-represented within each acute respiratory illness-associated profile, and gene expression was subsequently confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: We found that acute respiratory illness is characterized by dynamic, time-specific transcriptional profiles whose magnitudes of expression are influenced by underlying respiratory disease and the mucosal repair signature evoked during acute respiratory illness. Most strikingly, we report that people with asthma who experience acute respiratory illness-induced exacerbations are characterized by a reduced but prolonged inflammatory immune response, inadequate activation of mucosal repair, and the expression of a newly described exacerbation-specific transcriptional signature. CONCLUSION: Findings from our study represent a significant contribution towards clarifying the complex molecular interactions that typify acute respiratory illness-induced asthma exacerbations.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.111319719,-0.033977724,-0.069959026,-0.046120885,-0.024890302,-0.03658086,0.038682532,-0.064686793,0.073281937,0.019485384,-0.064053071,-0.056462009,0.022605912,0.019890506,0.017325498,-0.002224173,0.00884403,-0.129856123,0.014255752,-0.056102275,0.037328417,-0.205488604,-0.076025992,0.026051644,-0.009554535,0.040102176,-0.102232767,0.022785327,0.130643618,0.009592526
"Field-deployable, quantitative, rapid identification of active Ebola virus infection in unprocessed blood","The West African Ebola virus outbreak underlined the importance of delivering mass diagnostic capability outside the clinical or primary care setting in effectively containing public health emergencies caused by infectious disease. Yet, to date, there is no solution for reliably deploying at the point of need the gold standard diagnostic method, real time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), in a laboratory infrastructure-free manner. In this proof of principle work, we demonstrate direct performance of RT-qPCR on fresh blood using far-red fluorophores to resolve fluorogenic signal inhibition and controlled, rapid freeze/thawing to achieve viral genome extraction in a single reaction chamber assay. The resulting process is entirely free of manual or automated sample pre-processing, requires no microfluidics or magnetic/mechanical sample handling and thus utilizes low cost consumables. This enables a fast, laboratory infrastructure-free, minimal risk and simple standard operating procedure suited to frontline, field use. Developing this novel approach on recombinant bacteriophage and recombinant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; Lentivirus), we demonstrate clinical utility in symptomatic EBOV patient screening using live, infectious Filoviruses and surrogate patient samples. Moreover, we evidence assay co-linearity independent of viral particle structure that may enable viral load quantification through pre-calibration, with no loss of specificity across an 8 log-linear maximum dynamic range. The resulting quantitative rapid identification (QuRapID) molecular diagnostic platform, openly accessible for assay development, meets the requirements of resource-limited countries and provides a fast response solution for mass public health screening against emerging biosecurity threats.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.010904516,0.065564775,0.168352554,0.048877021,-0.089425314,0.009793004,0.047151437,0.020266074,0.007204005,0.038836597,-0.023214846,-0.023048583,0.052341469,-0.051484201,-0.00295481,0.011531944,-0.049377448,0.0144976,-0.045384249,-0.002793825,-0.032648735,-0.00701675,-0.02378968,-0.032967229,-0.040433647,0.009342318,0.046272202,-0.011448835,-0.03686382,0.029387101
Influenza A Virus Polymerase Recruits the RNA Helicase DDX19 to Promote the Nuclear Export of Viral mRNAs,"Enhancing the knowledge of host factors that are required for efficient influenza A virus (IAV) replication is essential to address questions related to pathogenicity and to identify targets for antiviral drug development. Here we focused on the interplay between IAV and DExD-box RNA helicases (DDX), which play a key role in cellular RNA metabolism by remodeling RNA-RNA or RNA-protein complexes. We performed a targeted RNAi screen on 35 human DDX proteins to identify those involved in IAV life cycle. DDX19 was a major hit. In DDX19-depleted cells the accumulation of viral RNAs and proteins was delayed, and the production of infectious IAV particles was strongly reduced. We show that DDX19 associates with intronless, unspliced and spliced IAV mRNAs and promotes their nuclear export. In addition, we demonstrate an RNA-independent association between DDX19 and the viral polymerase, that is modulated by the ATPase activity of DDX19. Our results provide a model in which DDX19 is recruited to viral mRNAs in the nucleus of infected cells to enhance their nuclear export. Information gained from this virus-host interaction improves the understanding of both the IAV replication cycle and the cellular function of DDX19.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.181963383,-0.083188253,-0.082154362,0.086802782,-0.110557923,0.036115608,0.032399445,-0.002829469,0.01946828,0.017640203,0.020393058,-0.042937207,-0.00562276,0.121028897,0.02551712,0.031002586,-0.020306534,-0.02372002,-0.003382072,0.056029774,-0.039043878,0.073764382,-0.041977274,-0.048894738,0.010707201,-0.028568042,0.026199954,-0.003337196,0.012396419,0.049278267
An RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene in bat genomes derived from an ancient negative-strand RNA virus,"Endogenous bornavirus-like L (EBLL) elements are inheritable sequences derived from ancient bornavirus L genes that encode a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in many eukaryotic genomes. Here, we demonstrate that bats of the genus Eptesicus have preserved for more than 11.8 million years an EBLL element named eEBLL-1, which has an intact open reading frame of 1,718 codons. The eEBLL-1 coding sequence revealed that functional motifs essential for mononegaviral RdRp activity are well conserved in the EBLL-1 genes. Genetic analyses showed that natural selection operated on eEBLL-1 during the evolution of Eptesicus. Notably, we detected efficient transcription of eEBLL-1 in tissues from Eptesicus bats. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report showing that the eukaryotic genome has gained a riboviral polymerase gene from an ancient virus that has the potential to encode a functional RdRp.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.203900395,-0.028313494,-0.068145471,0.063506547,0.163875863,-0.007545648,0.078011965,0.051052222,-0.089927834,-0.021410507,-0.012014005,0.027779545,-0.063486729,-0.040801993,-0.074953758,-0.047074355,0.06319358,-0.014184725,-0.036165323,-0.060496648,0.034976641,-0.028161063,0.010403193,-0.034018274,-0.06231187,0.006081436,0.043189641,0.043086006,0.059538962,0.016376789
A unique intra-molecular fidelity-modulating mechanism identified in a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,"Typically not assisted by proofreading, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) encoded by the RNA viruses may need to independently control its fidelity to fulfill virus viability and fitness. However, the precise mechanism by which the RdRP maintains its optimal fidelity level remains largely elusive. By solving 2.1–2.5 Å resolution crystal structures of the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) NS5B, an RdRP with a unique naturally fused N-terminal domain (NTD), we identified high-resolution intra-molecular interactions between the NTD and the RdRP palm domain. In order to dissect possible regulatory functions of NTD, we designed mutations at residues Y471 and E472 to perturb key interactions at the NTD–RdRP interface. When crystallized, some of these NS5B interface mutants maintained the interface, while the others adopted an ‘open’ conformation that no longer retained the intra-molecular interactions. Data from multiple in vitro RdRP assays indicated that the perturbation of the NTD–RdRP interactions clearly reduced the fidelity level of the RNA synthesis, while the processivity of the NS5B elongation complex was not affected. Collectively, our work demonstrates an explicit and unique mode of polymerase fidelity modulation and provides a vivid example of co-evolution in multi-domain enzymes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.192773915,-0.039840375,-0.079888996,0.110013935,-0.050331994,-0.037211992,0.099526936,0.035117819,-0.073790392,0.055586655,0.132365264,0.183841167,-0.12471034,-0.080210444,-0.048845725,-0.029868769,0.049343811,-0.05447609,-0.066072515,-0.088054417,0.087500757,-0.094500223,0.102864155,-0.019024647,-0.018938728,0.071226109,0.021628008,0.008963526,0.003740674,-0.050520661
Effectiveness of Patient-Collected Swabs for Influenza Testing,"Abstract Objective To compare the effectiveness of self-collected and health care worker (HCW)–collected nasal swabs for detection of influenza viruses and determine the patients' preference for type of collection. Patients and Methods We enrolled adult patients presenting with influenzalike illness to the Emergency Department at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, from January 28, 2011, through April 30, 2011. Patients self-collected a midturbinate nasal flocked swab from their right nostril following written instructions. A second swab was then collected by an HCW from the left nostril. Swabs were tested for influenza A and B viruses by real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, and percent concordance between collection methods was determined. Results Of the 72 paired specimens analyzed, 25 were positive for influenza A or B RNA by at least one of the collection methods (34.7% positivity rate). When the 14 patients who had prior health care training were excluded, the qualitative agreement between collection methods was 94.8% (55 of 58). Two of the 58 specimens (3.4%) from patients without health care training were positive only by HCW collection, and 1 of 58 (1.7%) was positive only by patient self-collection. A total of 53.4% of patients (31 of 58) preferred the self-collection method over the HCW collection, and 25.9% (15 of 58) had no preference. Conclusion Self-collected midturbinate nasal swabs provide a reliable alternative to HCW collection for influenza A and B virus real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.162396427,-0.02379925,-0.022990862,0.010642123,-0.023237454,0.050851095,-0.11150387,0.076980113,-0.126464195,-0.027435022,0.002566298,0.03855467,-0.01985179,0.038664246,0.006487353,0.002064938,0.011494251,-0.04249262,0.053449508,-0.057198591,0.004657573,-0.050638325,-0.030070981,-0.063656475,0.003115769,0.005893373,-0.013952891,0.024850005,-0.040538594,-0.046780137
Selective Degradation of Host RNA Polymerase II Transcripts by Influenza A Virus PA-X Host Shutoff Protein,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) inhibit host gene expression by a process known as host shutoff. Host shutoff limits host innate immune responses and may also redirect the translation apparatus to the production of viral proteins. Multiple IAV proteins regulate host shutoff, including PA-X, a ribonuclease that remains incompletely characterized. We report that PA-X selectively targets host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcribed mRNAs, while sparing products of Pol I and Pol III. Interestingly, we show that PA-X can also target Pol II-transcribed RNAs in the nucleus, including non-coding RNAs that are not destined to be translated, and reporter transcripts with RNA hairpin structures that block ribosome loading. Transcript degradation likely occurs in the nucleus, as PA-X is enriched in the nucleus and its nuclear localization correlates with reduction in target RNA levels. Complete degradation of host mRNAs following PA-X-mediated endonucleolytic cleavage is dependent on the host 5’->3’-exonuclease Xrn1. IAV mRNAs are structurally similar to host mRNAs, but are synthesized and modified at the 3’ end by the action of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex. Infection of cells with wild-type IAV or a recombinant PA-X-deficient virus revealed that IAV mRNAs resist PA-X-mediated degradation during infection. At the same time, loss of PA-X resulted in changes in the synthesis of select viral mRNAs and a decrease in viral protein accumulation. Collectively, these results significantly advance our understanding of IAV host shutoff, and suggest that the PA-X causes selective degradation of host mRNAs by discriminating some aspect of Pol II-dependent RNA biogenesis in the nucleus.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.173463837,-0.078291184,-0.056624646,0.026377916,-0.080823955,0.060642933,0.029865027,0.002327344,0.024882707,-0.029419452,-0.042054212,-0.072810942,-0.002069344,0.130104067,-0.009296723,0.039098519,-0.004158737,-0.076654592,-0.066094372,0.031332676,0.007427877,0.075735254,-0.064304273,0.00545136,-0.013050141,-0.084283365,0.020266211,0.01076164,0.047052872,0.0086028
Coronavirus disease-2019: is fever an adequate screening for the returning travelers?,"On Thursday, 30 January 2020, World Health Organization declared Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Since its identification in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People’s Republic of China, the number of cases imported into other countries is increasing, and the epidemiological map is changing rapidly. On the other hand, body temperature screening (fever) is the major test performed at points of entry, i.e., airports, in the returning travelers in most of the countries with limited resources. However, the recent report on asymptomatic contact transmission of COVID-19 and travelers who passed the symptoms-based screening and tested positive for COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) challenges this approach as body temperature screening may miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel. On this note, travel restrictions to and from high risk areas and/or 14 days quarantine of travelers coming from high risk areas are recommended to prevent possible importation of COVID-19. Currently, RT-PCR is a reliable test in detecting both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.054329915,0.075010852,0.041527566,-0.053230945,-0.035988907,0.024563753,-0.008949133,0.06792052,-0.028991609,-0.022614759,0.033015971,0.04862532,-0.017781719,-0.031563606,0.028997632,0.042359379,-0.036388822,0.109704922,-0.057789791,-0.073212,-0.067970283,0.081230422,-0.230988961,-0.100054139,0.042967167,0.165012409,0.178556811,0.040690941,0.052414051,-0.075858677
The NF-κB-dependent and -independent transcriptome and chromatin landscapes of human coronavirus 229E-infected cells,"Coronavirus replication takes place in the host cell cytoplasm and triggers inflammatory gene expression by poorly characterized mechanisms. To obtain more insight into the signals and molecular events that coordinate global host responses in the nucleus of coronavirus-infected cells, first, transcriptome dynamics was studied in human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E)-infected A549 and HuH7 cells, respectively, revealing a core signature of upregulated genes in these cells. Compared to treatment with the prototypical inflammatory cytokine interleukin(IL)-1, HCoV-229E replication was found to attenuate the inducible activity of the transcription factor (TF) NF-κB and to restrict the nuclear concentration of NF-κB subunits by (i) an unusual mechanism involving partial degradation of IKKβ, NEMO and IκBα and (ii) upregulation of TNFAIP3 (A20), although constitutive IKK activity and basal TNFAIP3 expression levels were shown to be required for efficient virus replication. Second, we characterized actively transcribed genomic regions and enhancers in HCoV-229E-infected cells and systematically correlated the genome-wide gene expression changes with the recruitment of Ser5-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II and prototypical histone modifications (H3K9ac, H3K36ac, H4K5ac, H3K27ac, H3K4me1). The data revealed that, in HCoV-infected (but not IL-1-treated) cells, an extensive set of genes was activated without inducible p65 NF-κB being recruited. Furthermore, both HCoV-229E replication and IL-1 were shown to upregulate a small set of genes encoding immunomodulatory factors that bind p65 at promoters and require IKKβ activity and p65 for expression. Also, HCoV-229E and IL-1 activated a common set of 440 p65-bound enhancers that differed from another 992 HCoV-229E-specific enhancer regions by distinct TF-binding motif combinations. Taken together, the study shows that cytoplasmic RNA viruses fine-tune NF-κB signaling at multiple levels and profoundly reprogram the host cellular chromatin landscape, thereby orchestrating the timely coordinated expression of genes involved in multiple signaling, immunoregulatory and metabolic processes.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.126745447,-0.05609707,-0.05929612,-0.079408503,0.004573476,0.000775608,0.053613799,-0.074679415,0.146711401,-0.108353554,-0.093014191,0.181325694,0.200938972,0.277499923,-0.025900542,0.069097985,-0.032852665,-0.102057144,-0.059749516,-0.017887581,0.012721751,-0.02816994,0.065699708,-0.039110251,-0.041881744,-0.075048286,0.07908173,0.070416741,0.028216568,-0.013738181
Pelargonium sidoides radix extract EPs 7630 reduces rhinovirus infection through modulation of viral binding proteins on human bronchial epithelial cells,"Bronchial epithelial cells are the first target cell for rhinovirus infection. The course of viral infections in patients with acute bronchitis, asthma and COPD can be improved by oral application of Pelargonium sidoides radix extract; however, the mechanism is not well understood. This study investigated the in vitro effect of Pelargonium sidoides radix extract (EPs 7630) on the expression of virus binding cell membrane and host defence supporting proteins on primary human bronchial epithelial cells (hBEC). Cells were isolated from patients with severe asthma (n = 6), moderate COPD (n = 6) and non-diseased controls (n = 6). Protein expression was determined by Western-blot and immunofluorescence. Rhinovirus infection was determined by immunofluorescence as well as by polymerase chain reaction. Cell survival was determined by manual cell count after live/death immunofluorescence staining. All parameters were determined over a period of 3 days. The results show that EPs 7630 concentration-dependently and significantly increased hBEC survival after rhinovirus infection. This effect was paralleled by decreased expression of the inducible co-stimulator (ICOS), its ligand ICOSL and cell surface calreticulin (C1qR). In contrast, EPs 7630 up-regulated the expression of the host defence supporting proteins β-defensin-1 and SOCS-1, both in rhinovirus infected and un-infected hBEC. The expression of other virus interacting cell membrane proteins such as MyD88, TRL2/4 or ICAM-1 was not altered by EPs 7630. The results indicate that EPs 7630 may reduce rhinovirus infection of human primary BEC by down-regulating cell membrane docking proteins and up-regulating host defence proteins.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.049282691,-0.06790602,-0.069971258,-0.119838325,-0.125060084,0.032876382,0.029112432,-0.06788281,0.064986323,0.002463732,-0.097693635,-0.103998362,0.012465553,0.171928099,-0.001860056,-0.021962192,0.060895986,-0.096006999,0.032731222,0.016116449,0.02802326,-0.058887724,0.000520053,0.017913786,0.008576286,0.07065482,-0.009136186,0.038202405,-0.059008816,0.014764557
Feline calicivirus and other respiratory pathogens in cats with Feline calicivirus-related symptoms and in clinically healthy cats in Switzerland,"BACKGROUND: Cats with feline calicivirus (FCV)-related symptoms are commonly presented to veterinary practitioners. Various clinical manifestations have been attributed to FCV, i.e. upper respiratory tract disease (URTD), oral ulcerations, gingivostomatitis, limping syndrome and virulent systemic disease. Additionally, healthy cats can shed FCV. The aims of this study were 1) to investigate the frequency of FCV in cats with FCV-related symptoms and in healthy cats in Switzerland, 2) to assess risk and protective factors for infection, such as signalment, housing conditions, vaccination, and co-infection with URTD-associated pathogens, and 3) to address the association between clinical symptoms and FCV infection. RESULTS: Oropharyngeal, nasal and conjunctival swabs were collected in 24 veterinary practices from 200 FCV-suspect and 100 healthy cats originating from 19 cantons of Switzerland. The samples were tested for FCV using virus isolation and reverse-transcription real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and for feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1), Mycoplasma felis, Chlamydophila felis, Bordetella bronchiseptica using real-time qPCR. Within the two populations (FCV-suspect/healthy), the observed PCR prevalences were: FCV 45 %/8 %, FHV-1 20 %/9 %, C. felis 8 %/1 %, B. bronchiseptica 4 %/2 %, M. felis 47 %/31 % and any co-infections thereof 40 %/14 %. Based on multivariable regression models amongst FCV-suspect cats (odds ratio [95 % confidence interval]), co-infection with M. felis (1.75 [0.97; 3.14]), group housing (2.11 [1.02; 4.34]) and intact reproductive status (1.80 [0.99; 3.28]) were found to be risk factors for FCV infection. In healthy cats, intact reproductive status (22.2 [1.85; 266.7]) and group housing (46.4 [5.70; 377.7]) were found to be associated with FCV infection. Based on an univariable approach, FCV-suspect cats were found to be significantly less often FCV-positive when vaccinated (0.48 [0.24; 0.94]). Oral ulcerations, salivation, gingivitis and stomatitis, but not classical signs of URTD were significantly associated with FCV infection (all p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: FCV was detected in less than half of the cats that were judged FCV-suspect by veterinary practitioners. For a clinical diagnosis, FCV-related symptoms should be revisited. FCV infection was present in some healthy cats, underlining the importance of asymptomatic carriers in FCV epidemiology. To reduce FCV-related problems in multi-cat environments, reduction of group size in addition to the generally recommended vaccination are advocated.

Recent advances in lab-on-a-chip technologies for viral diagnosis,"Abstract The global risk of viral disease outbreaks emphasizes the need for rapid, accurate, and sensitive detection techniques to speed up diagnostics allowing early intervention. An emerging field of microfluidics also known as the lab-on-a-chip (LOC) or micro total analysis system includes a wide range of diagnostic devices. This review briefly covers both conventional and microfluidics-based techniques for rapid viral detection. We first describe conventional detection methods such as cell culturing, immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These methods often have limited speed, sensitivity, or specificity and are performed with typically bulky equipment. Here, we discuss some of the LOC technologies that can overcome these demerits, highlighting the latest advances in LOC devices for viral disease diagnosis. We also discuss the fabrication of LOC systems to produce devices for performing either individual steps or virus detection in samples with the sample to answer method. The complete system consists of sample preparation, and ELISA and RT-PCR for viral-antibody and nucleic acid detection, respectively. Finally, we formulate our opinions on these areas for the future development of LOC systems for viral diagnostics.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.033238553,0.069631901,0.244904001,0.081089075,-0.09872162,-0.020803944,0.0786081,0.007136811,-0.006988799,0.076758485,-0.044799356,-0.023320584,0.079235384,-0.0734389,0.006683144,-0.002558478,-0.017232339,-0.001581207,-0.094598488,-0.025419514,-0.074743192,-0.042703125,0.014297477,-0.039876755,0.010493676,-0.021085181,0.018806847,-0.040753766,-0.064954078,0.065834424
Studying copy number variations using a nanofluidic platform,"Copy number variations (CNVs) in the human genome are conventionally detected using high-throughput scanning technologies, such as comparative genomic hybridization and high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays, or relatively low-throughput techniques, such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All these approaches are limited in resolution and can at best distinguish a twofold (or 50%) difference in copy number. We have developed a new technology to study copy numbers using a platform known as the digital array, a nanofluidic biochip capable of accurately quantitating genes of interest in DNA samples. We have evaluated the digital array's performance using a model system, to show that this technology is exquisitely sensitive, capable of differentiating as little as a 15% difference in gene copy number (or between 6 and 7 copies of a target gene). We have also analyzed commercial DNA samples for their CYP2D6 copy numbers and confirmed that our results were consistent with those obtained independently using conventional techniques. In a screening experiment with breast cancer and normal DNA samples, the ERBB2 gene was found to be amplified in about 35% of breast cancer samples. The use of the digital array enables accurate measurement of gene copy numbers and is of significant value in CNV studies.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.024293675,0.011413969,0.112214464,-0.038137886,0.005246845,0.001818055,0.017300801,-0.017179894,0.003230074,0.012677222,-0.039327991,-0.009099678,0.018960838,-0.041676571,0.007629255,0.010707561,-0.041021972,-0.026650053,-0.008375357,-0.080536762,0.006317006,-0.006312934,0.033710992,0.00547818,-0.058820772,-0.04818536,-0.018964989,-0.001799252,-0.020209883,0.010856534
A Retrospective Study Investigating Risks of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Mortality Following Human Metapneumovirus Infection in Hospitalized Adults,"BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a relatively recently identified respiratory virus that induces respiratory symptoms similar to those of respiratory syncytial virus infection in children. The characteristics of hMPV-infected adults are unclear because few cases have been reported. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of hospitalized adult patients with a positive multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay result from 2012 to 2016 at a single tertiary referral hospital in South Korea. We analyzed clinical characteristics of the enrolled patients and divided patients into an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) group and a non-ARDS group. RESULTS: In total, 110 adults were reviewed in this study. Their mean age was 61.4 years, and the majority (n = 105, 95.5%) had comorbidities or were immunocompromised. Most of the patients had pneumonia on chest X-ray (n = 88, 93.6%), 22 (20.0%) had ARDS, and 12 (10.9%) expired during hospitalization. The mortality rate for patients with ARDS was higher than that of the other patients (36.4% vs. 5.7%, P = 0.001). The risk factor for hMPV-associated ARDS was heart failure (odds ratio, 5.24; P = 0.044) and laboratory values were increased blood urea nitrogen and increased C-reactive protein. The acquisition site of infection was divided into community vs. nosocomial; 43 patients (39.1%) had a nosocomial infection. The risk factors for nosocomial infection were an immunocompromised state, malignancy and immunosuppressive treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that hMPV is one of the important respiratory pathogens important respiratory pathogen that causes pneumonia/ARDS in elderly, immunocompromised individuals and that it may be transmitted via the nosocomial route.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.241747334,-0.062236729,-0.132316023,-0.063223447,-0.030077314,-0.105852141,-0.031231518,0.045246557,-0.028511113,-0.007253165,-0.032624609,0.001208225,-0.059246463,0.067886008,-0.114738325,-0.03274599,0.006512405,0.131362364,-0.065314337,0.109643658,0.101261634,-0.023353868,-0.007478218,-0.06351373,-0.043331082,0.00434646,-0.120586309,-0.103047313,-0.05557245,-0.056400355
Phenotypic and Genetic Characterization of Avian Influenza H5N2 Viruses with Intra- and Inter-Duck Variations in Taiwan,"BACKGROUND: Human infections with avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have frequently raised global concerns of emerging, interspecies-transmissible viruses with pandemic potential. Waterfowl, the predominant reservoir of influenza viruses in nature, harbor precursors of different genetic lineages that have contributed to novel pandemic influenza viruses in the past. METHODS: Two duck influenza H5N2 viruses, DV518 and DV413, isolated through virological surveillance at a live-poultry market in Taiwan, showed phylogenetic relatedness but exhibited different replication capabilities in mammalian Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. This study characterizes the replication properties of the two duck H5N2 viruses and the determinants involved. RESULTS: The DV518 virus replicated more efficiently than DV413 in both MDCK and chicken DF1 cells. Interestingly, the infection of MDCK cells by DV518 formed heterogeneous plaques with great differences in size [large (L) and small (S)], and the two viral strains (p518-L and p518-S) obtained from plaque purification exhibited distinguishable replication kinetics in MDCK cells. Nonetheless, both plaque-purified DV518 strains still maintained their growth advantages over the plaque-purified p413 strain. Moreover, three amino acid substitutions in PA (P224S), PB2 (E72D), and M1 (A128T) were identified in intra-duck variations (p518-L vs p518-S), whereas other changes in HA (N170D), NA (I56T), and NP (Y289H) were present in inter-duck variations (DV518 vs DV413). Both p518-L and p518-S strains had the N170D substitution in HA, which might be related to their greater binding to MDCK cells. Additionally, polymerase activity assays on 293T cells demonstrated the role of vRNP in modulating the replication capability of the duck p518-L viruses in mammalian cells. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that intra-host phenotypic variation occurs even within an individual duck. In view of recent human infections by low pathogenic AIVs, this study suggests possible determinants involved in the stepwise selection of virus variants from the duck influenza virus population which may facilitate inter-species transmission.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.040335353,-0.089863727,-0.020480622,0.075288714,0.01748947,0.203669794,-0.008334608,-0.026028035,0.007003289,0.01190047,-0.000718548,-0.015430861,0.007344188,0.057286722,0.030337518,0.003574231,-0.023309575,-0.053721448,-0.000752232,0.028418487,0.073307809,0.024468343,0.003269689,0.064908338,-0.012638832,0.018888214,-0.007773541,0.011196986,-0.074914068,-0.002583145
Genomic RNA sequence of feline coronavirus strain FCoV C1Je,"This paper reports the first genomic RNA sequence of a field strain feline coronavirus (FCoV). Viral RNA was isolated at post mortem from the jejunum and liver of a cat with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). A consensus sequence of the jejunum-derived genomic RNA (FCoV C1Je) was determined from overlapping cDNA fragments produced by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification. RT-PCR products were sequenced by a reiterative sequencing strategy and the genomic RNA termini were determined using a rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR strategy. The FCoV C1Je genome was found to be 29,255 nucleotides in length, excluding the poly(A) tail. Comparison of the FCoV C1Je genomic RNA sequence with that of the laboratory strain FCoV FIP virus (FIPV) 79-1146 showed that both viruses have a similar genome organisation and predictions made for the open reading frames and cis-acting elements of the FIPV 79-1146 genome hold true for FCoV C1Je. In addition, the sequence of the 3′-proximal third of the liver derived genomic RNA (FCoV C1Li), which encompasses the structural and accessory protein genes of the virus, was also determined. Comparisons of the enteric (jejunum) and non-enteric (liver) derived viral RNA sequences revealed 100% nucleotide identity, a finding that questions the well accepted ‘internal mutation theory’ of FIPV pathogenicity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.154434746,-0.009827393,0.073285947,-0.006846241,0.085661652,-0.079593503,-0.091594445,0.021001147,-0.050394525,-0.087528748,0.226506507,-0.091480148,0.157932231,-0.043611899,-0.060271734,-0.042881763,0.026600741,0.045196776,-0.013289335,0.035717911,-0.036949103,0.003085104,0.004749991,0.052568633,-0.073227939,-0.02342679,0.037444745,0.001876639,0.009764639,0.030471934
Analysis of the Potential for N(4)-Hydroxycytidine To Inhibit Mitochondrial Replication and Function,"N(4)-Hydroxycytidine (NHC) is an antiviral ribonucleoside analog that acts as a competitive alternative substrate for virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. It exhibits measurable levels of cytotoxicity, with 50% cytotoxic concentration values ranging from 7.5 μM in CEM cells and up to >100 μM in other cell lines. The mitochondrial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (POLRMT) has been shown to incorporate some nucleotide analogs into mitochondrial RNAs, resulting in substantial mitochondrial toxicity. NHC was tested in multiple assays intended to determine its potential to cause mitochondrial toxicity. NHC showed similar cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells incubated in a glucose-free and glucose-containing media, suggesting that NHC does not impair mitochondrial function in this cell line based on the Crabtree effect. We demonstrate that the 5′-triphosphate of NHC can be used by POLRMT for incorporation into nascent RNA chain but does not cause immediate chain termination. In PC-3 cells treated with NHC, the 50% inhibitory concentrations of mitochondrial protein expression inhibition were 2.7-fold lower than those for nuclear-encoded protein expression, but this effect did not result in selective mitochondrial toxicity. A 14-day incubation of HepG2 cells with NHC had no effect on mitochondrial DNA copy number or extracellular lactate levels. In CEM cells treated with NHC at 10 μM, a slight decrease (by ∼20%) in mitochondrial DNA copy number and a corresponding slight increase in extracellular lactate levels were detected, but these effects were not enhanced by an increase in NHC treatment concentration. In summary, the results indicate that mitochondrial impairment by NHC is not the main contributor to the compound’s observed cytotoxicity in these cell lines.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.102146277,-0.033591124,-0.007299,-0.053681722,-0.085402463,0.030845205,0.031314547,-0.021940938,0.030961914,-0.02295371,-0.010237074,-0.002740438,-0.02341472,0.046752462,0.004318918,0.025511302,-0.019006273,0.021207499,0.046024136,-0.041946688,0.011396637,-0.010816733,0.038422105,-0.000823047,-0.005012164,0.006622275,-0.014641748,0.027313357,-0.00694311,-0.009571929
Stimulation of stop codon readthrough: frequent presence of an extended 3′ RNA structural element,"In Sindbis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis and related alphaviruses, the polymerase is translated as a fusion with other non-structural proteins via readthrough of a UGA stop codon. Surprisingly, earlier work reported that the signal for efficient readthrough comprises a single cytidine residue 3′-adjacent to the UGA. However, analysis of variability at synonymous sites revealed strikingly enhanced conservation within the ∼150 nt 3′-adjacent to the UGA, and RNA folding algorithms revealed the potential for a phylogenetically conserved stem–loop structure in the same region. Mutational analysis of the predicted structure demonstrated that the stem–loop increases readthrough by up to 10-fold. The same computational analysis indicated that similar RNA structures are likely to be relevant to readthrough in certain plant virus genera, notably Furovirus, Pomovirus, Tobravirus, Pecluvirus and Benyvirus, as well as the Drosophilia gene kelch. These results suggest that 3′ RNA stimulatory structures feature in a much larger proportion of readthrough cases than previously anticipated, and provide a new criterion for assessing the large number of cellular readthrough candidates that are currently being revealed by comparative sequence analysis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.132622668,-0.035290103,-0.01758355,-0.010745615,0.028480116,-0.026702879,-0.025100201,0.024623334,-0.022548104,-0.039327297,-0.031428979,0.023444454,-0.008421726,-0.079129136,-0.03287358,-0.014427796,0.019923708,0.00493153,-0.048081784,-0.03229451,-0.00962518,-0.016597329,-0.069592884,0.019120648,-0.042013785,-0.054984118,-0.006691633,0.035402937,0.073578034,-0.04983816
Dispersion of the HIV-1 Epidemic in Men Who Have Sex with Men in the Netherlands: A Combined Mathematical Model and Phylogenetic Analysis,"BACKGROUND: The HIV-1 subtype B epidemic amongst men who have sex with men (MSM) is resurgent in many countries despite the widespread use of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). In this combined mathematical and phylogenetic study of observational data, we aimed to find out the extent to which the resurgent epidemic is the result of newly introduced strains or of growth of already circulating strains. METHODS AND FINDINGS: As of November 2011, the ATHENA observational HIV cohort of all patients in care in the Netherlands since 1996 included HIV-1 subtype B polymerase sequences from 5,852 patients. Patients who were diagnosed between 1981 and 1995 were included in the cohort if they were still alive in 1996. The ten most similar sequences to each ATHENA sequence were selected from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database, and a phylogenetic tree was created of a total of 8,320 sequences. Large transmission clusters that included ≥10 ATHENA sequences were selected, with a local support value ≥ 0.9 and median pairwise patristic distance below the fifth percentile of distances in the whole tree. Time-varying reproduction numbers of the large MSM-majority clusters were estimated through mathematical modeling. We identified 106 large transmission clusters, including 3,061 (52%) ATHENA and 652 Los Alamos sequences. Half of the HIV sequences from MSM registered in the cohort in the Netherlands (2,128 of 4,288) were included in 91 large MSM-majority clusters. Strikingly, at least 54 (59%) of these 91 MSM-majority clusters were already circulating before 1996, when cART was introduced, and have persisted to the present. Overall, 1,226 (35%) of the 3,460 diagnoses among MSM since 1996 were found in these 54 long-standing clusters. The reproduction numbers of all large MSM-majority clusters were around the epidemic threshold value of one over the whole study period. A tendency towards higher numbers was visible in recent years, especially in the more recently introduced clusters. The mean age of MSM at diagnosis increased by 0.45 years/year within clusters, but new clusters appeared with lower mean age. Major strengths of this study are the high proportion of HIV-positive MSM with a sequence in this study and the combined application of phylogenetic and modeling approaches. Main limitations are the assumption that the sampled population is representative of the overall HIV-positive population and the assumption that the diagnosis interval distribution is similar between clusters. CONCLUSIONS: The resurgent HIV epidemic amongst MSM in the Netherlands is driven by several large, persistent, self-sustaining, and, in many cases, growing sub-epidemics shifting towards new generations of MSM. Many of the sub-epidemics have been present since the early epidemic, to which new sub-epidemics are being added.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.006127499,-0.020220533,-0.006879611,-0.085333454,0.028817657,0.026490717,0.002011425,0.028867359,-0.016990164,-0.00506424,-0.011371289,0.048130117,-0.015137947,-0.054741519,0.009297654,0.018979067,-0.007749538,0.040671017,-0.017853651,0.005477275,0.013018789,-0.004157788,-0.035301999,0.014488318,-0.009809274,-0.024364984,0.017885309,-0.006947903,0.003165153,0.018572731
"Anti-HCV, nucleotide inhibitors, repurposing against COVID-19","Abstract Aims A newly emerged Human Coronavirus (HCoV) is reported two months ago in Wuhan, China (COVID-19). Until today >2700 deaths from the 80,000 confirmed cases reported mainly in China and 40 other countries. Human to human transmission is confirmed for COVID-19 by China a month ago. Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) reports, SARS HCoV is responsible for >8000 cases with confirmed 774 deaths. Additionally, MERS HCoV is responsible for 858 deaths out of about 2500 reported cases. The current study aims to test anti-HCV drugs against COVID-19 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Materials and methods In this study, sequence analysis, modeling, and docking are used to build a model for Wuhan COVID-19 RdRp. Additionally, the newly emerged Wuhan HCoV RdRp model is targeted by anti-polymerase drugs, including the approved drugs Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin. Key findings The results suggest the effectiveness of Sofosbuvir, IDX-184, Ribavirin, and Remidisvir as potent drugs against the newly emerged HCoV disease. Significance The present study presents a perfect model for COVID-19 RdRp enabling its testing in silico against anti-polymerase drugs. Besides, the study presents some drugs that previously proved its efficiency against the newly emerged viral infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.020344759,0.055729873,-0.098822998,-0.015635793,-0.003468084,0.025084812,0.068657285,0.019450612,0.048232071,-0.027199587,0.041327078,0.281668613,0.092460086,0.021055986,-0.001070751,0.021984598,-0.053831092,0.107249375,-0.018565641,-0.049831939,-0.018327836,0.053675596,-0.079619568,-0.055109798,0.017868858,0.110268188,0.141791098,0.061420312,0.081124283,0.017577333
"Initial performance evaluation of a spotted array Mobile Analysis Platform (MAP) for the detection of influenza A/B, RSV, and MERS coronavirus","Abstract Clinical samples were evaluated with the Mobile Analysis Platform (MAP) to determine platform performance for detecting respiratory viruses in samples previously characterized using clinical reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays. The percent agreement between MAP and clinical results was 97% for influenza A (73/75), 100% (21/21) for influenza B, 100% (6/6) for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and 80% (4/5) for negative specimens.

Preliminary Study on Detecting the SARS-CoV Specific Target cDNA Fragments by Multiplex PCR,"The multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was applied to detect the SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus) specific target cDNA fragments in the present study. The target cDNA fragments of SARS-CoV were synthesized artificially according to the genome sequence of SARS-CoV in GenBank submitted by The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and were used as simulated positive samples. Five primers recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) were used to amplify the fragments by single PCR and multiplex PCR. Three target cDNA fragments (121, 182 and 302 bp), as well as the three different combinations of any two of these fragments, were amplified by single PCR. The combination of these three fragments was amplified by multiplex PCR. The results indicated that the multiplex PCR technique could be applied to detect the SARS-CoV specific target cDNA fragments successfully.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.011597508,0.30772867,-0.030131552,0.031230971,0.023657057,-0.023167998,-0.078285162,-0.121345316,-0.006420841,0.014057991,-0.012211021,-0.047366399,0.048704731,-0.022841662,0.05685637,-0.004771642,0.007637426,-0.016190004,-0.001737019,-0.086219856,-0.004786207,0.032334797,0.06677691,0.005329343,-0.004578795,-0.020706548,-0.002863855,-0.027107276,0.005841166,0.059154647
Structural characterization of recombinant IAV polymerase reveals a stable complex between viral PA-PB1 heterodimer and host RanBP5,"The genome of influenza A virus (IAV) comprises eight RNA segments (vRNA) which are transcribed and replicated by the heterotrimeric IAV RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp). RdRp consists of three subunits (PA, PB1 and PB2) and binds both the highly conserved 3′- and 5′-ends of the vRNA segment. The IAV RdRp is an important antiviral target, but its structural mechanism has remained largely elusive to date. By applying a polyprotein strategy, we produced RdRp complexes and define a minimal human IAV RdRp core complex. We show that PA-PB1 forms a stable heterodimeric submodule that can strongly interact with 5′-vRNA. In contrast, 3′-vRNA recognition critically depends on the PB2 N-terminal domain. Moreover, we demonstrate that PA-PB1 forms a stable and stoichiometric complex with host nuclear import factor RanBP5 that can be modelled using SAXS and we show that the PA-PB1-RanPB5 complex is no longer capable of 5′-vRNA binding. Our results provide further evidence for a step-wise assembly of IAV structural components, regulated by nuclear transport mechanisms and host factor binding.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.150362875,-0.052987516,-0.06230104,0.06454702,-0.067352444,0.068010082,0.043041774,0.005044552,-0.020658623,-0.016839899,0.04047049,0.085229113,-0.070796794,0.003613811,-0.034305277,-0.001171922,0.04213266,-0.062369009,-0.047651644,-0.024248175,0.041713349,0.001143173,0.02634532,-0.048257834,0.001968631,0.029807169,0.008297543,0.029379744,0.046091025,0.053395841
Human herpesvirus 6A induces apoptosis of HSB-2 cells via a mitochondrion-related caspase pathway(),"Apoptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of viral infections. In this study, we investigated the cell death processes during productive HHV-6A infection and the underlying mechanisms. Annexin V-PI staining and electron microscopy indicated that HHV-6A is a strong inducer of apoptosis. HHV-6A infection decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential and led to morphological changes of mitochondria. The cell death was associated with activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of DNA repair enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, which is known to be an important substrate for activated caspase-3. Caspase-9 was activated significantly in HHV-6A-infected cells, whereas caspase-8 was not activated obviously. Moreover, HHV-6A infection upregulated Bax and downregulated Bcl-2. This is the first demonstration of mitochondrion-mediated, caspase-dependent apoptosis in HHV-6A-infected cells.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.058343989,-0.033057938,-0.007779567,-0.112876116,-0.075880775,0.047416893,0.050084429,-0.033705279,0.054645326,-0.016648617,-0.028232167,-0.011633821,-0.011181044,0.049667599,0.004126527,0.040208202,0.001158636,-0.02229427,-0.009906717,-0.00298891,0.020882301,-0.00309474,-0.001688644,-0.020036145,0.046568361,0.012176801,-0.067387917,0.035228864,-0.008776339,-0.049035881
A duplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection of St. Louis encephalitis and eastern equine encephalitis viruses,"Abstract A duplex TaqMan real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed for the detection of St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), for use in human and vector surveillance. The respective targets selected for the assay were the conserved NS5 and E1 genes of the 2 viruses. Because of the insufficient number of NS5 sequences from SLEV strains in the GenBank database, we determined the sequence of an approximately 1-kb region for each of 25 strains of SLEV to select primers and probes in a conserved region. Our assay has a sensitivity of 5 gene copies (gc)/reaction for EEEV and 10 gc/reaction for SLEV, and its performance is linear for at least 6 log10 gc. The assay is specific and detected all strains of SLEV (69) and EEEV (12) that were tested.

Tick-borne encephalitis virus inhibits rRNA synthesis and host protein production in human cells of neural origin,"Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a member of the genus Flavivirus (Flaviviridae), is a causative agent of a severe neuroinfection. Recently, several flaviviruses have been shown to interact with host protein synthesis. In order to determine whether TBEV interacts with this host process in its natural target cells, we analysed de novo protein synthesis in a human cell line derived from cerebellar medulloblastoma (DAOY HTB-186). We observed a significant decrease in the rate of host protein synthesis, including the housekeeping genes HPRT1 and GAPDH and the known interferon-stimulated gene viperin. In addition, TBEV infection resulted in a specific decrease of RNA polymerase I (POLR1) transcripts, 18S and 28S rRNAs and their precursor, 45-47S pre-rRNA, but had no effect on the POLR3 transcribed 5S rRNA levels.

Efficient Structure Resonance Energy Transfer from Microwaves to Confined Acoustic Vibrations in Viruses,"Virus is known to resonate in the confined-acoustic dipolar mode with microwave of the same frequency. However this effect was not considered in previous virus-microwave interaction studies and microwave-based virus epidemic prevention. Here we show that this structure-resonant energy transfer effect from microwaves to virus can be efficient enough so that airborne virus was inactivated with reasonable microwave power density safe for the open public. We demonstrate this effect by measuring the residual viral infectivity of influenza A virus after illuminating microwaves with different frequencies and powers. We also established a theoretical model to estimate the microwaves power threshold for virus inactivation and good agreement with experiments was obtained. Such structure-resonant energy transfer induced inactivation is mainly through physically fracturing the virus structure, which was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. These results provide a pathway toward establishing a new epidemic prevention strategy in open public for airborne virus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.037129646,-0.039844317,0.010883613,0.014547155,-0.025473993,0.073618383,-0.007868305,-0.008679486,0.014772247,-0.007639094,-0.015531744,-0.019022101,-0.005680675,-0.028805584,0.041958725,0.002619148,0.002534197,-0.010703424,-0.015479275,0.006322681,-0.009017959,-0.024169089,0.008073917,0.009910138,-0.011396072,0.01780447,0.023223611,0.014491111,0.003207519,-0.024960111
Intracellular Crosslinking of Filoviral Nucleoproteins with Xintrabodies Restricts Viral Packaging,"Viruses assemble large macromolecular repeat structures that become part of the infectious particles or virions. Ribonucleocapsids (RNCs) of negative strand RNA viruses are a prime example where repetition of nucleoprotein (NP) along the genome creates a core polymeric helical scaffold that accommodates other nucleocapsid proteins including viral polymerase. The RNCs are transported through the cytosol for packaging into virions through association with viral matrix proteins at cell membranes. We hypothesized that RNC would be ideal targets for crosslinkers engineered to promote aberrant protein–protein interactions, thereby blocking their orderly transport and packaging. Previously, we had generated single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) against Filoviruses that have all targeted highly conserved C-terminal regions of NP known to be repetitively exposed along the length of the RNCs of Marburgvirus (MARV) and Ebolavirus (EBOV). Our crosslinker design consisted of dimeric sdAb expressed intracellularly, which we call Xintrabodies (X- for crosslinking). Electron microscopy of purified NP polymers incubated with purified sdAb constructs showed NP aggregation occurred in a genus-specific manner with dimeric and not monomeric sdAb. A virus-like particle (VLP) assay was used for initial evaluation where we found that dimeric sdAb inhibited NP incorporation into VP40-based VLPs whereas monomeric sdAb did not. Inhibition of NP packaging was genus specific. Confocal microscopy revealed dimeric sdAb was diffuse when expressed alone but focused on pools of NP when the two were coexpressed, while monomeric sdAb showed ambivalent partition. Infection of stable Vero cell lines expressing dimeric sdAb specific for either MARV or EBOV NP resulted in smaller plaques and reduced progeny of cognate virus relative to wild-type Vero cells. Though the impact was marginal at later time-points, the collective data suggest that viral replication can be reduced by crosslinking intracellular NP using relatively small amounts of dimeric sdAb to restrict NP packaging. The stoichiometry and ease of application of the approach would likely benefit from transitioning away from intracellular expression of crosslinking sdAb to exogenous delivery of antibody. By retuning sdAb specificity, the approach of crosslinking highly conserved regions of assembly critical proteins may well be applicable to inhibiting replication processes of a broad spectrum of viruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.093902462,-0.033236753,0.000232281,-0.019069759,-0.047288568,0.029340296,0.014785475,-0.015264777,0.023896478,-0.011411048,-0.026703603,-0.012148556,-0.003248218,0.009897442,0.006820848,-0.006083348,0.007784622,-0.0232438,-0.011026659,0.000568641,-0.003576979,0.010766076,-0.011019274,-0.015777028,0.029994173,0.035671053,0.00593207,-0.012333151,-0.046679618,0.007757617
X-ray structure and activities of an essential Mononegavirales L-protein domain,"The L protein of mononegaviruses harbours all catalytic activities for genome replication and transcription. It contains six conserved domains (CR-I to -VI; Fig. 1a). CR-III has been linked to polymerase and polyadenylation activity, CR-V to mRNA capping and CR-VI to cap methylation. However, how these activities are choreographed is poorly understood. Here we present the 2.2-Å X-ray structure and activities of CR-VI+, a portion of human Metapneumovirus L consisting of CR-VI and the poorly conserved region at its C terminus, the +domain. The CR-VI domain has a methyltransferase fold, which besides the typical S-adenosylmethionine-binding site ((SAM)P) also contains a novel pocket ((NS)P) that can accommodate a nucleoside. CR-VI lacks an obvious cap-binding site, and the (SAM)P-adjoining site holding the nucleotides undergoing methylation ((SUB)P) is unusually narrow because of the overhanging +domain. CR-VI+ sequentially methylates caps at their 2′O and N7 positions, and also displays nucleotide triphosphatase activity.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.087074282,-0.038274071,-0.021863256,-0.044989684,-0.028790431,0.000886118,0.00263469,0.00282127,-0.003300528,-0.028690958,-0.028400261,0.051186732,-0.018079778,-0.055030722,-0.046277449,-0.023292659,0.032259629,-2.35E-06,-0.036979822,0.005911251,0.016129751,0.014595327,0.050926899,0.005267437,0.069642085,0.003397838,-0.058535427,0.024657583,0.089707751,-0.031230324
"Severity of Pneumonia in Under 5-Year-Old Children from Developing Countries: A Multicenter, Prospective, Observational Study","Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children. The objectives were to evaluate the microbiological agents linked with hypoxemia in hospitalized children with pneumonia from developing countries, to identify predictors of hypoxemia, and to characterize factors associated with in-hospital mortality. A multicenter, observational study was conducted in five hospitals, from India (Lucknow, Vadu), Madagascar (Antananarivo), Mali (Bamako), and Paraguay (San Lorenzo). Children aged 2–60 months with radiologically confirmed pneumonia were enrolled prospectively. Respiratory and whole blood specimens were collected, identifying viruses and bacteria by real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Microbiological agents linked with hypoxemia at admission (oxygen saturation < 90%) were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression, and factors associated with 14-day in-hospital mortality were assessed by bivariate Cox regression. Overall, 405 pneumonia cases (3,338 hospitalization days) were analyzed; 13 patients died within 14 days of hospitalization. Hypoxemia prevalence was 17.3%. Detection of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in respiratory samples was independently associated with increased risk of hypoxemia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.4, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.0–5.8 and aOR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1–5.3, respectively). Lower chest indrawing and cyanosis were predictive of hypoxemia (positive likelihood ratios = 2.3 and 2.4, respectively). Predictors of death were Streptococcus pneumoniae detection by blood PCR (crude hazard ratio [cHR] = 4.6, 95% CI = 1.5–14.0), procalcitonin ≥ 50 ng/mL (cHR = 22.4, 95% CI = 7.3–68.5) and hypoxemia (cHR = 4.8, 95% CI = 1.6–14.4). These findings were consistent on bivariate analysis. hMPV and RSV in respiratory samples were linked with hypoxemia, and S. pneumoniae in blood was associated with increased risk of death among hospitalized children with pneumonia in developing countries.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.209492065,-0.088588538,-0.066027833,-0.055317665,-0.00081195,-0.081251061,0.005922771,-0.026491737,-0.015713512,-0.084486827,0.010709576,0.029563549,-0.11792506,-0.068124457,-0.113162012,0.073426884,-0.084536563,-0.001798944,-0.013322829,-0.005158092,-0.131425859,0.154726348,0.09640716,0.036320108,0.011006599,-0.044243223,-0.008860851,-0.20084356,-0.059106202,-0.064051156
Limited Utility of Polymerase Chain Reaction in Induced Sputum Specimens for Determining the Causes of Childhood Pneumonia in Resource-Poor Settings: Findings From the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) Study,"BACKGROUND. Sputum examination can be useful in diagnosing the cause of pneumonia in adults but is less well established in children. We sought to assess the diagnostic utility of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of respiratory viruses and bacteria in induced sputum (IS) specimens from children hospitalized with severe or very severe pneumonia. METHODS. Among children aged 1–59 months, we compared organism detection by multiplex PCR in IS and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens. To assess whether organism presence or density in IS specimens was associated with chest radiographic evidence of pneumonia (radiographic pneumonia), we compared prevalence and density in IS specimens from children with radiographic pneumonia and children with suspected pneumonia but without chest radiographic changes or clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of pneumonia (nonpneumonia group). RESULTS. Among 4232 cases with World Health Organization–defined severe or very severe pneumonia, we identified 1935 (45.7%) with radiographic pneumonia and 573 (13.5%) with nonpneumonia. The organism detection yield was marginally improved with IS specimens (96.2% vs 92.4% for NP/OP specimens for all viruses combined [P = .41]; 96.9% vs 93.3% for all bacteria combined [P = .01]). After accounting for presence in NP/OP specimens, no organism was detected more frequently in the IS specimens from the radiographic pneumonia compared with the nonpneumonia cases. Among high-quality IS specimens, there were no statistically significant differences in organism density, except with cytomegalovirus, for which there was a higher quantity in the IS specimens from cases with radiographic pneumonia compared with the nonpneumonia cases (median cycle threshold value, 27.9 vs 28.5, respectively; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS. Using advanced molecular methods with IS specimens provided little additional diagnostic information beyond that obtained with NP/OP swab specimens.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.15906987,-0.032371098,-0.025853604,-0.04848311,-0.019563122,-0.064439902,0.003173268,0.016050659,-0.069130456,0.013075159,-0.023782479,0.015139329,-0.026665077,-0.057350255,-0.041291822,0.008226717,-0.051957634,0.011461374,-0.045540636,-0.035815812,-0.067563583,0.162006164,0.066087372,-0.014565704,0.016540936,0.06305388,0.02581015,-0.004927525,-0.009282564,-0.051219856
Phylogeny of bovine norovirus in Egypt based on VP2 gene,"Bovine norovirus (BNoV) has emerged as a viral pathogen that causes a gastrointestinal illness and diarrhea in cattle. Despite its worldwide distribution, very little information is known about BNoV in Africa. In this study, BNoV was detected in 27.6% (8/29) of tested fecal materials, collected from sporadic cases of diarrheic calves, using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and primers that target RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene. Additionally, one primer pair was designed to flank the BNoV-VP2 (small capsid protein) gene for molecular analysis. Study VP2 sequences were phylogenetically-related to BNoV-GIII.2 (Newbury2-like) genotype, which is highly prevalent all over the world. However, they were separated within the cluster and one strain (41FR) grouped with recombinant GIII.P1/GIII.2 strains. Compared to reference VP2 sequences, 14 amino acid substitution mutations were found to be unique to our strains. The study confirms that BNoV is currently circulating among diarrheic calves of Egypt and also characterizes its ORF3 (VP2) genetically. The status of BNoV should be continuously evaluated in Egypt for effective prevention and control.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.056396744,-0.004360382,0.067808069,-0.052604955,0.093387249,0.017450235,-0.024411446,-0.012453797,-0.000579248,-0.00546505,0.009003238,0.07245075,-0.043497732,-0.027392982,0.030771047,-0.075322953,-0.011896511,0.014304483,0.012186266,-0.026704711,0.042034785,0.038769981,-0.057740261,0.048110097,0.032970097,-0.031271644,0.022055912,-0.049353347,0.028110466,0.054312319
Comparative evaluation of a laboratory-developed real-time PCR assay and RealStar® Adenovirus PCR Kit for quantitative detection of human adenovirus,"BACKGROUND: Human adenoviruses are common causes of community-acquired respiratory tract and enteric infections. Severe disseminated infections with high mortality rates may be seen in immunocompromised individuals. An accurate and cost-effective quantitative assay is essential not only for laboratory diagnosis of adenoviral infections, but also for monitoring of response to antiviral treatment. The diagnostic performance of an in-house quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay was compared to a commercial system. METHODS: The analytical sensitivity, specificity, linearity, precision and accuracy of an in-house adenovirus quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay were evaluated against the RealStar® Adenovirus PCR Kit (Altona Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany), using 122 clinical specimens and 18 proficiency testing samples. RESULTS: Linear regression analysis of the quantitative results by the in-house assay showed the dynamic range from 2.60 to 9 log(10) (plasma) and 2.94 to 9 log(10) (viral transport medium) copies/mL, with the coefficient of determination (R(2)) of 0.996 and 0.998, respectively. A dilution series demonstrated the limits of detection and lower limits of quantification for plasma were 2.06 log(10) and 2.60 log(10) copies/mL and those for viral transport medium were 2.31 log(10) and 2.94 log(10) copies/mL respectively. The precision of the in-house assay was highly reproducible among runs with coefficients of variance ranging from 0.07 to 3.21% for plasma and 0.17% to 2.11% for viral transport medium. A comparison of 52 matched samples showed an excellent correlation between the quantitative viral loads measured by the in-house assay and the RealStar® Adenovirus PCR Kit (R(2) = 0.984), with an average bias of − 0.16 log(10) copies/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The in-house adenovirus assay is a sensitive and reliable assay with lower cost for the detection and quantification of adenoviral DNA when compared to the RealStar® Adenovirus PCR Kit.

"Probable person to person transmission of novel avian influenza A (H7N9) virus in Eastern China, 2013: epidemiological investigation","Objective To determine whether the novel avian influenza H7N9 virus can transmit from person to person and its efficiency. Design Epidemiological investigations conducted after a family cluster of two patients with avian H7N9 in March 2013. Setting Wuxi, Eastern China. Participants Two patients, their close contacts, and relevant environments. Samples from the patients and environments were collected and tested by real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), viral culture, and haemagglutination inhibition assay. Any contacts who became ill had samples tested for avian H7N9 by rRT-PCR. Paired serum samples were obtained from contacts for serological testing by haemagglutination inhibition assays. Main outcomes measures Clinical data, history of exposure before the onset of illnesses, and results of laboratory testing of pathogens and further analysis of sequences and phylogenetic tree to isolated strains. Results The index patient became ill five to six days after his last exposure to poultry. The second patient, his daughter aged 32, who provided unprotected bedside care in the hospital, had no known exposure to poultry. She developed symptoms six days after her last contact with her father. Two strains were isolated successfully from the two patients. Genome sequence and analyses of phylogenetic trees showed that both viruses were almost genetically identical. Forty three close contacts of both patients were identified. One had mild illness but had negative results for avian H7N9 by rRT-PCR. All 43 close contacts tested negative for haemagglutination inhibition antibodies specific for avian H7N9. Conclusions The infection of the daughter probably resulted from contact with her father (the index patient) during unprotected exposure, suggesting that in this cluster the virus was able to transmit from person to person. The transmissibility was limited and non-sustainable.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.090641393,0.033224227,0.009127104,-0.043218974,0.022075188,0.081819484,-0.085222306,0.102645222,-0.053414276,0.040007217,0.009222767,0.028134451,-0.018368131,0.041804856,0.005695881,-0.008071414,0.002279038,0.018999583,0.006989368,-0.022479992,0.047686959,-0.006074206,-0.073022068,-0.035342854,-0.05984815,0.009762701,0.017949741,0.006308745,-0.034887179,0.019944459
Possible role of highly activated mucosal NK cells against viral respiratory infections in children undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation,"Infection is the leading cause of non-relapse-related mortality after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Altered functions of immune cells in nasal secretions may influence post HSCT susceptibility to viral respiratory infections. In this prospective study, we determined T and NK cell numbers together with NK activation status in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) in HSCT recipients and healthy controls using multiparametric flow cytometry. We also determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the presence of 16 respiratory viruses. Samples were collected pre-HSCT, at day 0, +10, +20 and +30 after HSCT. Peripheral blood (PB) was also analyzed to determine T and NK cell numbers. A total of 27 pediatric HSCT recipients were enrolled and 16 of them had at least one viral detection (60%). Rhinovirus was the most frequent pathogen (84% of positive NPAs). NPAs of patients contained fewer T and NK cells compared to healthy controls (p = 0.0132 and p = 0.120, respectively). Viral PCR + patients showed higher NK cell number in their NPAs. The activating receptors repertoire expressed by NK cells was also higher in NPA samples, especially NKp44 and NKp46. Our study supports NK cells relevance for the immune defense against respiratory viruses in HSCT recipients.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.065347222,-0.047318434,-0.015600371,-0.069843349,-0.03696372,-0.030973573,0.026824912,-0.009918585,-0.001565911,0.017231629,-0.011971317,-0.046241038,0.009424433,0.088387477,0.023606899,-0.011363779,0.014001746,-0.068688259,0.045285792,-0.0148623,0.018393872,-0.024345853,-0.003995563,0.026372327,0.000536145,-0.010399371,-0.014838525,0.002431312,-0.031284062,-0.049841567
Proofreading-Deficient Coronaviruses Adapt for Increased Fitness over Long-Term Passage without Reversion of Exoribonuclease-Inactivating Mutations,"The coronavirus (CoV) RNA genome is the largest among the single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses. CoVs encode a proofreading 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV high-fidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold-decreased fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogues. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in parallel with wild-type MHV (WT-MHV). Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated enhanced replication and increased competitive fitness without reversion at the ExoN(-) active site. Furthermore, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 was less susceptible than MHV-ExoN(-) P3 to multiple nucleoside analogues, suggesting that MHV-ExoN(-) was under selection for increased replication fidelity. We subsequently identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially accounted for the reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogues. Our results suggest that increased replication fidelity is selected in ExoN(-) CoVs and that there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) reversion. These results also support the hypothesis that high-fidelity replication is linked to CoV fitness and indicate that multiple replicase proteins could compensate for ExoN functions during replication.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.136200262,0.046470928,-0.101658993,0.037327698,-0.016440239,-0.027633103,0.022390791,0.021067333,0.003292606,-0.016825109,0.055817999,0.021427161,-0.056881653,-0.001627464,0.036470404,0.089970444,-0.061562474,-0.009576219,-0.040034597,-0.010815958,0.09072501,-0.079831757,0.141248161,0.109568863,0.100105648,0.15942835,-0.028639514,-0.100174711,-0.101296407,-0.133657242
A system for production of defective interfering particles in the absence of infectious influenza A virus,"Influenza A virus (IAV) infection poses a serious health threat and novel antiviral strategies are needed. Defective interfering particles (DIPs) can be generated in IAV infected cells due to errors of the viral polymerase and may suppress spread of wild type (wt) virus. The antiviral activity of DIPs is exerted by a DI genomic RNA segment that usually contains a large deletion and suppresses amplification of wt segments, potentially by competing for cellular and viral resources. DI-244 is a naturally occurring prototypic segment 1-derived DI RNA in which most of the PB2 open reading frame has been deleted and which is currently developed for antiviral therapy. At present, coinfection with wt virus is required for production of DI-244 particles which raises concerns regarding biosafety and may complicate interpretation of research results. Here, we show that cocultures of 293T and MDCK cell lines stably expressing codon optimized PB2 allow production of DI-244 particles solely from plasmids and in the absence of helper virus. Moreover, we demonstrate that infectivity of these particles can be quantified using MDCK-PB2 cells. Finally, we report that the DI-244 particles produced in this novel system exert potent antiviral activity against H1N1 and H3N2 IAV but not against the unrelated vesicular stomatitis virus. This is the first report of DIP production in the absence of infectious IAV and may spur efforts to develop DIPs for antiviral therapy.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.121440571,-0.066551454,-0.01934352,0.038878212,-0.061773322,0.043752449,-0.081744847,0.031731897,0.02173726,-0.041067474,-0.002868432,-0.087064763,0.031565133,0.042321853,0.147133383,0.124732692,-0.155990752,0.116678215,0.022881913,0.018850815,0.055232638,-0.000377759,0.065984669,0.00896872,0.079738495,0.100811249,0.043198835,-0.024718946,0.037215739,0.017946459
Respiratory viruses from hospitalized children with severe pneumonia in the Philippines,"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia remains a leading cause of child death in developing countries. The viruses in severe pneumonia remain poorly defined. METHODS: The study was conducted at the Eastern Visayas Regional Medical Center in Tacloban City, Philippines from May 2008 to May 2009. Patients aged 8 days to 13 years old who were admitted to the Department of Pediatrics with severe pneumonia were enrolled for the study. Upon admission, polymerase chain reaction was performed using nasopharyngeal swabs and blood cultures to detect respiratory viruses and bacteria, respectively. RESULT: Among the 819 patients enrolled, at least one virus was detected in 501 cases (61.2%). In addition, 423 cases were positive for a single virus while bacteria were detected in the blood culture sample of 31 cases. The most commonly detected viruses were human rhinoviruses (n = 189), including types A (n = 103), B (n = 17), and C (n = 69), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n = 165). Novel viruses such as human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus NL63, human bocavirus, and human polyomaviruses WU and KI were also detected. There were 70 deaths, and one or more viruses were detected in 35 (50%) of these cases. Positivity only for influenza A virus (OR = 4.3, 95% CI = 1.3-14.6) was significantly associated with fatal outcome. From the blood culture, Burkholderia cepacia group (n = 9), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 4), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 4), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 1), and Salmonella C1 (n = 1) were also isolated. CONCLUSION: Viruses were commonly detected in children with severe pneumonia in the Philippines. Hence, viral etiologies should be considered while developing better effective strategies to reduce child pneumonia-related deaths in developing countries.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.236739184,-0.097768854,-0.108969891,0.01451259,0.030831769,-0.013525441,0.006868929,0.025985971,-0.08744291,0.034500464,-0.015181866,-0.010519013,0.00730816,-0.016933676,-0.027066307,-0.019741535,-0.046465499,-0.005777819,-0.003516651,0.059086471,-0.03830451,0.151485873,0.066700462,0.0908279,0.000322325,0.042362523,0.030840426,0.043065333,-0.044379198,-0.100378419
Identification of Cis-Acting Elements on Positive-Strand Subgenomic mRNA Required for the Synthesis of Negative-Strand Counterpart in Bovine Coronavirus,"It has been demonstrated that, in addition to genomic RNA, sgmRNA is able to serve as a template for the synthesis of the negative-strand [(−)-strand] complement. However, the cis-acting elements on the positive-strand [(+)-strand] sgmRNA required for (−)-strand sgmRNA synthesis have not yet been systematically identified. In this study, we employed real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to analyze the cis-acting elements on bovine coronavirus (BCoV) sgmRNA 7 required for the synthesis of its (−)-strand counterpart by deletion mutagenesis. The major findings are as follows. (1) Deletion of the 5'-terminal leader sequence on sgmRNA 7 decreased the synthesis of the (−)-strand sgmRNA complement. (2) Deletions of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) bulged stem-loop showed no effect on (−)-strand sgmRNA synthesis; however, deletion of the 3' UTR pseudoknot decreased the yield of (−)-strand sgmRNA. (3) Nucleotides positioned from −15 to −34 of the sgmRNA 7 3'-terminal region are required for efficient (−)-strand sgmRNA synthesis. (4) Nucleotide species at the 3'-most position (−1) of sgmRNA 7 is correlated to the efficiency of (−)-strand sgmRNA synthesis. These results together suggest, in principle, that the 5'- and 3'-terminal sequences on sgmRNA 7 harbor cis-acting elements are critical for efficient (−)-strand sgmRNA synthesis in BCoV.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.115768115,-0.041881506,-0.00855117,-0.010795472,-0.004544365,-0.064001983,-0.048331338,0.037650361,-0.028420004,-0.050434218,0.016859044,0.017090388,-0.02162248,-0.012409757,0.024520777,0.068464153,-0.021383343,0.01394003,-0.002109249,-0.049350443,-0.024701958,-0.00595429,-0.047269269,-0.05117775,-0.002156974,-0.072385022,-0.086951907,0.031643456,0.099056772,-0.013259559
A novel quantitative PCR mediated by high-fidelity DNA polymerase,"The biggest challenge for accurate diagnosis of viral infectious disease is the high genetic variability of involved viruses, which affects amplification efficiency and results in low sensitivity and narrow spectrum. Here, we developed a new simple qPCR mediated by high-fidelity (HF) DNA polymerase. The new method utilizes an HFman probe and one primer. Fluorescent signal was generated from the 3′–5′ hydrolysis of HFman probe by HF DNA polymerase before elongation initiation. Mismatches between probe/primer and template have less influence on the amplification efficiency of the new method. The new qPCR exhibited higher sensitivity and better adaptability to sequence variable templates than the conventional TaqMan probe based-qPCR in quantification of HIV-1 viral load. Further comparison with COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test (v2.0) showed a good correlation coefficient (R(2) = 0.79) between both methods in quantification of HIV-1 viral load among 21 clinical samples. The characteristics of tolerance to variable templates and one probe-one primer system imply that the probe/primer design for the new method will be easier and more flexible than the conventional method for highly heterogeneous viruses. Therefore, the HF DNA polymerase-mediated qPCR method is a simple, sensitive and promising approach for the development of diagnostics for viral infectious diseases.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.033393585,0.028022183,0.152466026,0.040041072,-0.070777071,-0.016199306,0.0632607,-0.011380577,-0.023367521,0.051106455,-0.019790661,0.00082982,0.034172068,-0.058565094,-0.007710304,0.019575527,-0.043334494,-0.012320816,-0.046796651,-0.010871106,-0.046787368,-0.010856189,-0.005557851,0.050339198,-0.033809274,-0.054043093,-0.039101344,0.00200641,-0.051399506,0.064279442
Hsp70 Isoforms Are Essential for the Formation of Kaposi’s Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus Replication and Transcription Compartments,"Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic herpesvirus associated with various AIDS-related malignancies. Like other herpesviruses, multiple processes required for KSHV lytic replication, including viral transcription, viral DNA synthesis and capsid assembly occur in virus-induced intranuclear structures, termed replication and transcription compartments (RTCs). Here we utilised a novel methodology, combining subcellular fractionation and quantitative proteomics, to identify cellular proteins which are recruited to KSHV-induced RTCs and thus play a key role in KSHV lytic replication. We show that several isoforms of the HSP70 chaperone family, Hsc70 and iHsp70, are redistributed from the cytoplasm into the nucleus coinciding with the initial formation of KSHV-induced RTCs. We demonstrate that nuclear chaperone foci are dynamic, initially forming adjacent to newly formed KSHV RTCs, however during later time points the chaperones move within KSHV RTCs and completely co-localise with actively replicating viral DNA. The functional significance of Hsp70 isoforms recruitment into KSHV RTCs was also examined using the specific Hsp70 isoform small molecule inhibitor, VER-155008. Intriguingly, results highlight an essential role of Hsp70 isoforms in the KSHV replication cycle independent of protein stability and maturation. Notably, inhibition of Hsp70 isoforms precluded KSHV RTC formation and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) relocalisation to the viral genome leading to the abolishment of global KSHV transcription and subsequent viral protein synthesis and DNA replication. These new findings have revealed novel mechanisms that regulate KSHV lytic replication and highlight the potential of HSP70 inhibitors as novel antiviral agents.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.107465994,-0.043306156,-0.021800755,-0.021122772,-0.085631912,0.01839947,0.053592412,-0.009025586,0.025515693,0.004631708,-0.013658447,-0.015571162,-0.001613915,0.039675749,0.00120601,0.021417999,-0.003073261,-0.025430793,-0.019914462,0.017884074,-0.025376287,0.048367832,-0.058070739,-0.019215105,0.02084438,-0.026257549,-0.017415548,-0.000966894,0.010888911,0.010497616
New Adenovirus Groups in Western Palaearctic Bats,"In the context of long-term screening for viruses on Western Palaearctic bats, we tested for the presence of adenovirus 1392 oropharyngeal swabs and 325 stool samples taken from 27 bat species. Adenoviruses were detected in 12 species of the Vespertilionidae and the Rhinolophidae families. Fifty positive respiratory and 26 positive stool samples were studied. Phylogenetic analyses of partial hexon protein and partial DNA-dependent DNA polymerase genes indicate that all these bat adenoviruses belong to the genus Mastadenovirus but without constituting a monophyletic cluster. According to genetic identities, the new groups are distinct to the previously described Bat mastadenovirus A and B species and contribute with potentially new members. Our data support that diversity of bat mastadenovirus is host-dependent and increase the knowledge of potentially pathogenic virus from bats. Due to the active role of bats as viral reservoirs, the characterization of these viruses is relevant for Public Health.",0,0,1,0,0,0,-0.043394172,0.025051676,-0.026755855,-0.005026459,0.322339555,0.13215526,0.305409124,0.079444434,-0.155324523,-0.047931596,-0.117512153,-0.137465849,-0.034457192,0.078605833,-0.0350102,0.037284344,0.023061841,0.012326509,0.03922147,-0.034040117,-0.04009285,0.029646419,-0.02383278,-0.0668666,0.008780109,0.031123627,-0.005055803,0.02777214,-0.044244197,0.009260762
Highly similar structural frames link the template tunnel and NTP entry tunnel to the exterior surface in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases,"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is essential to viral replication and is therefore one of the primary targets of countermeasures against these dangerous infectious agents. Development of broad-spectrum therapeutics targeting polymerases has been hampered by the extreme sequence variability of these sequences. RdRps range in length from 400–800 residues, yet contain only ∼20 residues that are conserved in most species. In this study, we made structure-based comparisons that are independent of sequence composition using a recently developed algorithm. We identified residue-to-residue correspondences of multiple protein structures and created (two-dimensional) structure-based alignment maps of 37 polymerase structures that provide both sequence and structure details. Using these maps, we determined that ∼75% of each polymerase species consists of seven protein segments, each of which has high structural similarity to segments in other species, though they are widely divergent in sequence composition and order. We define each of these segments as a ‘homomorph’, and each includes (though most are much larger than) the well-known conserved polymerase motifs. All homomorphs contact the template tunnel or nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) entry tunnel and the exterior of the protein, suggesting they constitute a structural and functional skeleton common among the polymerases.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.189554133,-0.036727837,-0.043763086,0.045797772,0.035177384,-0.02433101,0.043653022,0.027695019,-0.046339907,0.017613127,-0.013508445,0.06007608,-0.005455154,-0.126416243,-0.061245178,-0.072804912,0.045109605,0.010454157,-0.024382235,-0.02869477,0.001821022,-0.013726091,-0.030521479,-0.010012858,0.002877132,0.006405751,0.030099468,0.004759057,0.065125543,0.041175454
Case report: Detection of the Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) in nasal secretions of a dead human,"The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been recognized as a highly pathogenic virus that infects the human respiratory tract and has high morbidity and mortality. The MERS-CoV is a huge burden on Saudi Arabian health-care facilities, causing approximately 40% mortality. The transmission mechanism of the virus is still not well understood. Therefore, the prevention of any route of transmission is the best measure to arrest the spread of this disease.

Duration of quarantine in hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection: a question needing an answer,"In December 2019 a new form of pneumonia was observed in the Chinese province of Hubei.[1] The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was subsequently identified as responsible of this condition, defined coronavirus disease (COVID-19).[2] The virus has now spread outside Chinese borders with 82,297 cases and 2,804 deaths worldwide at the 26th of February.[3] After infection, symptoms appear after an incubation time of 3-5 days, with 80% of those infected developing a mild disease, 15% a severe disease and 5% will require support in intensive care unit (ICU).[4] Overall, the estimated case-fatality rate is comprised between 0.4% and 2.9% and the basic reproduction number is approximately 3.28.[4,5] SARS-CoV-2 is a new pathogen for humankind and any type of immune protection exist, thus everybody can be potentially infected. Moreover, no primary prophylaxis measures (vaccination) nor effective treatments are available. If the above represented percentages are applied to the worldwide populations, it appears clear why any measure should be considered to avoid a further diffusion of the virus and prevent the saturation and collapse of health systems and the most catastrophic pandemic since 1919 Spanish flu. Isolation of those affected and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) are the mainstay to block transmission of this pathogen, which is presumed through respiratory droplets. A 14 days quarantine is applied to subjects coming from endemic areas or who had contact with confirmed cases. It is assumed that, if in this period the subject does not develop any sign or symptoms compatible with COVID-19, he is not infected and thus the quarantine can be removed, and the subject returned to the community. Domiciliary quarantine of 14 days since a positive test is applied also for patients with a diagnosed mild disease who did not need medical support. These rules are effective in controlling infections in the community, but several doubts arise when it is necessary to transpose them in the hospital setting. Hospitals are indeed a delicate place in epidemics: they collect fragile persons who can be exposed to the virus and are subsequently readmitted to the community thus spreading the infection. Indeed, the ongoing outbreak in Northern Italy has been linked to a single infected patient who accessed to a community hospital where he transmitted the virus to several other patients and health-care operators.[6] Moreover, the isolation of patients in the hospital setting impose a significant burden in terms of PPE used by the health-care operators, space dedicated and time employed in their management. Even more complex is the situation of patients in ICU, where viral spreading is facilitated by endotracheal tubes and manoeuvres performed on the respiratory tract. Therefore, a clear definition of the infectiousness timing and intensity of viral spreading is mandatory to alleviate the burden on the health-care system. Unfortunately, the data available on the topic are scarce and composed only of measurements of viral shedding, without an assessment of the infectivity. Kim et al.[7] assessed the viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in upper and lower respiratory tract materials in the first two confirmed patients in Korea. They employed real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 and converted cycle threshold (CT) values of rRT-PCR into RNA copy number. The detection limit of rRT-PCR was 2,690 copies/mL. Overall, viral load above detection limit was detected until 14 and 25 days after symptoms onset and for 13 and 11 days after the first detection, respectively.[7] Of note, both patients received treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir. Instead, Zou and colleagues analysed viral load in repeated nasal and throat swabs obtained from the 17 symptomatic patients.[8] They also employed rRT-PCR and considered a CT of 40 as detection limit. Higher viral loads were observed in nasal swabs and in samples collected soon after symptoms onset. Overall, only two patients prese ted positive samples, and only in nasal swab, 14 days after symptoms onset, and with low viral load. In conclusion, a larger amount of data about duration of viral spreading and infectivity in hospitalized patients, especially in ICU, is badly needed to better define quarantine period and avoid nosocomial transmission. Before their availability, the canonical 14 days period of quarantine should be respected.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0.195019774,0.168337742,-0.117553315,-0.025042571,-0.072579161,-0.033828995,-0.060540702,0.059947305,-0.074712736,0.058160885,0.023950598,-0.024225456,0.006128093,0.037604696,0.032569739,0.004362921,-0.026251775,0.020198721,0.014025966,0.015157233,-0.03803134,0.003249852,-0.123492011,-0.051019009,-0.029829266,0.034596192,0.067290846,-0.007794315,-0.041272953,0.015126152
A case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis following Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection,"We report a case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) secondary to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection that failed to improve with methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG); who responded with plasmapheresis. A 21- year- old female with an unremarkable medical history, initially presented to an outside hospital with fever and an influenza-like illness and was subsequently intubated for worsening sensorium. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was suggestive of ADEM or vasculitis for which she received five days of pulse steroids and IVIG. She showed no signs of improvement and was transferred to our hospital for plasmapheresis. Her work up revealed an elevated IgM antibody and positive sputum for Mycoplasma pneumonia by polymerase chain reaction, suggesting the pathogen as the culprit for her ADEM. Intravenous azithromycin and daily plasmapheresis were initiated for seven consecutive days. Following commencement of her treatment, the patient experienced good recovery and was subsequently extubated. She continued to improve with physical therapy and gained mobility, with the help of a walker. Patients commonly present with ADEM following viral infection or vaccination and less frequently post bacterial infection. The current treatment of ADEM due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae is based on limited case reports.

Discovery of Metal Ions Chelator Quercetin Derivatives with Potent Anti-HCV Activities,"Analogues or isosteres of α,γ-diketoacid (DKA) 1a show potent inhibition of hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B polymerase through chelation of the two magnesium ions at the active site. The anti-HCV activity of the flavonoid quercetin (2) could partly be attributed to it being a structural mimic of DKAs. In order to delineate the structural features required for the inhibitory effect and improve the anti-HCV potency, two novel types of quercetin analogues, 7-O-arylmethylquercetins and quercetin-3-O-benzoic acid esters, were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their anti-HCV properties in cell-based assays. Among the 38 newly synthesized compounds, 7-O-substituted derivative 3i and 3-O-substituted derivative 4f were found to be the most active in the corresponding series (EC(50) = 3.8 μM and 9.0 μΜ, respectively).

BCX4430 – A broad-spectrum antiviral adenosine nucleoside analog under development for the treatment of Ebola virus disease,"Summary The adenosine nucleoside analog BCX4430 is a direct-acting antiviral drug under investigation for the treatment of serious and life-threatening infections from highly pathogenic viruses, such as the Ebola virus. Cellular kinases phosphorylate BCX4430 to a triphosphate that mimics ATP; viral RNA polymerases incorporate the drug's monophosphate nucleotide into the growing RNA chain, causing premature chain termination. BCX4430 is active in vitro against many RNA viral pathogens, including the filoviruses and emerging infectious agents such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In vivo, BCX4430 is active after intramuscular, intraperitoneal, and oral administration in a variety of experimental infections. In nonclinical studies involving lethal infections with Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Rift Valley fever virus, and Yellow Fever virus, BCX4430 has demonstrated pronounced efficacy. In experiments conducted in several models, both a reduction in the viral load and an improvement in survival were found to be related to the dose of BCX4430.

Current and future antiviral therapy of severe seasonal and avian influenza,"Abstract The currently circulating H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes of influenza A virus cause a transient, febrile upper respiratory illness in most adults and children (“seasonal influenza”), but infants, the elderly, immunodeficient and chronically ill persons may develop life-threatening primary viral pneumonia or complications such as bacterial pneumonia. By contrast, avian influenza viruses such as the H5N1 virus that recently emerged in Southeast Asia can cause severe disease when transferred from domestic poultry to previously healthy people (“avian influenza”). Most H5N1 patients present with fever, cough and shortness of breath that progress rapidly to adult respiratory distress syndrome. In seasonal influenza, viral replication remains confined to the respiratory tract, but limited studies indicate that H5N1 infections are characterized by systemic viral dissemination, high cytokine levels and multiorgan failure. Gastrointestinal infection and encephalitis also occur. The licensed anti-influenza drugs (the M2 ion channel blockers, amantadine and rimantadine, and the neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir) are beneficial for uncomplicated seasonal influenza, but appropriate dosing regimens for severe seasonal or H5N1 viral infections have not been defined. Treatment options may be limited by the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viruses. Ribavirin has also been used to a limited extent to treat influenza. This article reviews licensed drugs and treatments under development, including high-dose oseltamivir; parenterally administered neuraminidase inhibitors, peramivir and zanamivir; dimeric forms of zanamivir; the RNA polymerase inhibitor T-705; a ribavirin prodrug, viramidine; polyvalent and monoclonal antibodies; and combination therapies.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.112626316,-0.108663337,-0.089625381,0.169918404,-0.083205424,0.290802851,-0.059651922,0.003210007,-0.002704186,0.001831084,0.018079684,0.009035289,0.055122683,-0.004542568,-0.009359343,-0.0010924,-0.033999624,0.085458084,0.004098596,0.059505,0.006730728,0.012802416,-0.04670832,0.059705699,0.011950191,-0.010088221,-0.010202522,-0.032734448,0.095127349,0.022714148

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry for identifying acute viral upper respiratory tract infections,"Abstract Diagnosis of respiratory viruses traditionally relies on culture or antigen detection. We aimed to demonstrate capacity of the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RT-PCR/ESI-MS) platform to identify clinical relevant respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples and compare the diagnostic performance characteristics relative to conventional culture- and antigen-based methods. An RT-PCR/ESI-MS respiratory virus surveillance kit designed to detect respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1–4, Adenoviridae types A–F, Coronaviridae, human bocavirus, and human metapneumovirus was evaluated using both mock-ups and frozen archived NPA (N = 280), 95 of which were positive by clinical virology methods. RT-PCR/ESI-MS detected 74/95 (77.9%) known positive samples and identified an additional 13/185 (7%) from culture-negative samples.

Therapeutic Efficacy of the Small Molecule GS-5734 against Ebola Virus in Rhesus Monkeys,"The most recent Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa – unprecedented in the number of cases and fatalities, geographic distribution, and number of nations affected – highlights the need for safe, effective, and readily available antiviral agents for treatment and prevention of acute Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) or sequelae(1). No antiviral therapeutics have yet received regulatory approval or demonstrated clinical efficacy. Here we describe the discovery of a novel anti-EBOV small molecule antiviral, GS-5734, a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog. GS-5734 exhibits antiviral activity against multiple variants of EBOV in cell-based assays. The pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) is efficiently formed in multiple human cell types incubated with GS-5734 in vitro, and the NTP acts as an alternate substrate and RNA-chain terminator in primer-extension assays utilizing a surrogate respiratory syncytial virus RNA polymerase. Intravenous administration of GS-5734 to nonhuman primates resulted in persistent NTP levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (half-life = 14 h) and distribution to sanctuary sites for viral replication including testes, eye, and brain. In a rhesus monkey model of EVD, once daily intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg GS-5734 for 12 days resulted in profound suppression of EBOV replication and protected 100% of EBOV-infected animals against lethal disease, ameliorating clinical disease signs and pathophysiological markers, even when treatments were initiated three days after virus exposure when systemic viral RNA was detected in two of six treated animals. These results provide the first substantive, post-exposure protection by a small-molecule antiviral compound against EBOV in nonhuman primates. The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of GS-5734 in vitro against other pathogenic RNA viruses – including filoviruses, arenaviruses, and coronaviruses – suggests the potential for expanded indications. GS-5734 is amenable to large-scale manufacturing, and clinical studies investigating the drug safety and pharmacokinetics are ongoing.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.06623227,-0.022203509,-0.032192826,0.000436508,-0.092596795,0.060470277,0.081385859,0.007743985,0.02693961,0.027306021,0.048647031,0.012891731,0.011749,0.003979938,0.019632617,0.000827016,-0.037838876,0.099891706,0.04497542,-0.002446847,-0.002043597,-0.012734009,-0.024498467,0.03946107,0.032698269,0.006484075,0.017254771,-0.001839553,0.02308067,-0.015262327
A Field-Deployable Reverse Transcription Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Assay for Rapid Detection of the Chikungunya Virus,"BACKGROUND: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus currently transmitted in about 60 countries. CHIKV causes acute flu-like symptoms and in many cases prolonged musculoskeletal and joint pain. Detection of the infection is mostly done using RT-RCR or ELISA, which are not suitable for point-of-care diagnosis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, a reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay for the detection of the CHIKV was developed. The assay sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reactivity were tested. CHIKV RT-RPA assay detected down to 80 genome copies/reaction in a maximum of 15 minutes. It successfully identified 18 isolates representing the three CHIKV genotypes. No cross-reactivity was detected to other alphaviruses and arboviruses except O'nyong'nyong virus, which could be differentiated by a modified RPA primer pair. Seventy-eight samples were screened both by RT-RPA and real-time RT-PCR. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the CHIKV RT-RPA assay were determined at 100%. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The developed RT-RPA assay represents a promising method for the molecular detection of CHIKV at point of need.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.045032877,0.105584797,0.295398231,0.088037628,-0.050706551,-0.063294783,0.022830823,0.014485594,-0.010156702,-0.110124258,-0.049480649,0.064917803,-0.082816096,0.003059988,-0.081978038,0.085422902,-0.013249406,-0.052602775,0.153581458,0.235751879,0.088961879,0.012557974,-0.03389253,0.010621543,-0.047333716,0.107108723,0.09438091,0.020128805,0.086588261,-0.058323434
Hepatitis C Virus RNA Replication Depends on Specific Cis- and Trans-Acting Activities of Viral Nonstructural Proteins,"Many positive-strand RNA viruses encode genes that can function in trans, whereas other genes are required in cis for genome replication. The mechanisms underlying trans- and cis-preferences are not fully understood. Here, we evaluate this concept for hepatitis C virus (HCV), an important cause of chronic liver disease and member of the Flaviviridae family. HCV encodes five nonstructural (NS) genes that are required for RNA replication. To date, only two of these genes, NS4B and NS5A, have been trans-complemented, leading to suggestions that other replicase genes work only in cis. We describe a new quantitative system to measure the cis- and trans-requirements for HCV NS gene function in RNA replication and identify several lethal mutations in the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B genes that can be complemented in trans, alone or in combination, by expressing the NS3–5B polyprotein from a synthetic mRNA. Although NS5B RNA binding and polymerase activities can be supplied in trans, NS5B protein expression was required in cis, indicating that NS5B has a cis-acting role in replicase assembly distinct from its known enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the RNA binding and NTPase activities of the NS3 helicase domain were required in cis, suggesting that these activities play an essential role in RNA template selection. A comprehensive complementation group analysis revealed functional linkages between NS3-4A and NS4B and between NS5B and the upstream NS3–5A genes. Finally, NS5B polymerase activity segregated with a daclatasvir-sensitive NS5A activity, which could explain the synergy of this antiviral compound with nucleoside analogs in patients. Together, these studies define several new aspects of HCV replicase structure-function, help to explain the potency of HCV-specific combination therapies, and provide an experimental framework for the study of cis- and trans-acting activities in positive-strand RNA virus replication more generally.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.185770826,-0.061551621,-0.064873685,0.037189832,-0.075769576,-0.032376421,0.021230057,0.023655685,0.001054678,-0.001044281,0.007863507,0.066876393,-0.006945046,0.067992724,-0.027317287,-0.028801521,0.033849346,0.142226888,0.194420366,-0.094228452,-0.057722696,0.006000496,0.038795291,0.004514135,-0.060326363,-0.077170896,-0.074775691,0.059894921,-0.017907567,-0.068994543
Molecular epidemiology of human rhinovirus infections in the pediatric emergency department,"Abstract Background Human rhinovirus (HRV) infections are highly prevalent, genetically diverse, and associated with both mild upper respiratory tract and more severe lower tract illnesses (LRTI). Objective To characterize the molecular epidemiology of HRV infections in young children seeking acute medical care. Study design Nasal swabs collected from symptomatic children <3 years of age receiving care in the Emergency and Urgent Care Departments at Seattle Children's Hospital were analyzed by a rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system (FilmArray®) for multiple viruses including HRV/enterovirus. HRV-positive results were confirmed by laboratory-developed real-time reverse transcription PCR (LD-PCR). Clinical data were collected by chart review. A subset of samples was selected for sequencing using the 5′ noncoding region. Associations between LRTI and HRV species and genotypes were estimated using logistic regression analysis. Results Of 595 samples with HRV/enterovirus detected by FilmArray, 474 (80%) were confirmed as HRV by LD-PCR. 211 (96%) of 218 selected samples were sequenced; HRV species A, B, and C were identified in 133 (63%), 6 (3%), and 72 (34%), respectively. LRTI was more common in HRV-C than HRV-A illness episodes (adjusted OR [95% CI] 2.35[1.03–5.35). Specific HRV-A and HRV-C genotypes detected in multiple patients were associated with a greater proportion of LRTI episodes. In 18 patients with >1 HRV-positive illness episodes, a distinct genotype was detected in each. Conclusion Diverse HRV genotypes circulated among symptomatic children during the study period. We found an association between HRV-C infections and LRTI in this patient population and evidence of association between specific HRV genotypes and LRTI.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.152374768,-0.065014549,-0.02363592,-0.045172784,0.060450654,-0.098726086,0.068235257,-0.041699033,0.028556648,-0.008533281,0.003463465,-0.001888637,-0.051125293,-0.001125668,0.023965469,0.023818811,-0.013886393,-0.043505342,0.089724615,-0.11518087,-0.014494466,-0.104881369,-0.115773146,0.135754059,-0.14730286,0.174965272,-0.132034712,-0.035276834,0.169120361,0.347142584
Impact of Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction Testing for Respiratory Pathogens on Healthcare Resource Utilization for Pediatric Inpatients,"Objective To assess whether multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) vs non-mPCR testing impacts the use of antibiotics, chest radiographs, and isolation precautions. Study design We retrospectively compared use of antibiotics, chest radiographs, and isolation precautions for patients <18 years old (excluding neonates) hospitalized at a tertiary referral center tested for respiratory pathogens in the emergency department or during the first 2 hospital days, during 2 periods: June 2010-June 2012 (non-mPCR group) vs October 2012-May 2014 (mPCR group). Results Subjects (n = 2430) in the mPCR group were older, had more complex chronic conditions, and were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit more often compared with the non-mPCR (n = 2349) group. Subjects in the mPCR group had more positive tests (42.4% vs 14.4%, P < .01), received fewer days of antibiotics (4 vs 5 median antibiotic days, P < .01), fewer chest radiographs performed, (59% vs 78%, P < .01), and were placed in isolation longer (20 vs 0 median isolation-hours, P < .01) compared with the non-mPCR group. In multivariable regression, patients tested with mPCR were less likely to receive antibiotics for ≥2 days (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.5-0.6), chest radiographs at admission (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.4), and more likely to be in isolation for ≥2 days (OR 2.4, 95% CI 2.1-2.8) compared with the non-mPCR group. Conclusions Use of mPCR testing for respiratory viruses among hospitalized patients was significantly associated with decreased healthcare resource utilization, including decreased use of antibiotics and chest radiographs, and increased use of isolation precautions.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.093483659,-0.035288101,-0.045884855,-0.116422756,-0.028783721,-0.013952286,-0.019237874,0.052328853,-0.08915051,-0.02757248,-0.008014361,0.044950883,-0.0621965,-0.019382366,-0.045912693,0.050944272,-0.024897918,-0.008923598,0.017789946,0.000601153,-0.06181836,-0.039881846,-0.032448749,-0.017159268,0.00158564,-0.02544948,-0.016654174,-0.112004595,-0.050992768,-0.02521996
Divergent Sapovirus Strains and Infection Prevalence in Wild Carnivores in the Serengeti Ecosystem: A Long-Term Study,"The genus Sapovirus, in the family Caliciviridae, includes enteric viruses of humans and domestic animals. Information on sapovirus infection of wildlife is limited and is currently lacking for any free-ranging wildlife species in Africa. By screening a large number of predominantly fecal samples (n = 631) obtained from five carnivore species in the Serengeti ecosystem, East Africa, sapovirus RNA was detected in the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta, family Hyaenidae), African lion (Panthera leo, family Felidae), and bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis, family Canidae), but not in golden or silver-backed jackals (Canis aureus and C. mesomelas, respectively, family Canidae). A phylogenetic analysis based on partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene sequences placed the sapovirus strains from African carnivores in a monophyletic group. Within this monophyletic group, sapovirus strains from spotted hyenas formed one independent sub-group, and those from bat-eared fox and African lion a second sub-group. The percentage nucleotide similarity between sapoviruses from African carnivores and those from other species was low (< 70.4%). Long-term monitoring of sapovirus in a population of individually known spotted hyenas from 2001 to 2012 revealed: i) a relatively high overall infection prevalence (34.8%); ii) the circulation of several genetically diverse variants; iii) large fluctuations in infection prevalence across years, indicative of outbreaks; iv) no significant difference in the likelihood of infection between animals in different age categories. The likelihood of sapovirus infection decreased with increasing hyena group size, suggesting an encounter reduction effect, but was independent of socially mediated ano-genital contact, or the extent of the area over which an individual roamed.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.060934598,-0.010753767,-0.016861171,-0.052006343,0.142899928,0.03824927,0.100969038,0.05065165,-0.055940193,-0.020599361,0.003752725,0.005523382,-0.043709775,-0.00810549,-0.004649882,-0.000587981,-0.017730513,0.012201825,0.002302715,0.00344818,0.017063089,-0.015453815,-0.045573988,-0.004360939,-0.001613677,-0.032358336,-0.01021978,-0.006421913,-0.019974388,0.019112793
"A Simple, Inexpensive Device for Nucleic Acid Amplification without Electricity—Toward Instrument-Free Molecular Diagnostics in Low-Resource Settings","BACKGROUND: Molecular assays targeted to nucleic acid (NA) markers are becoming increasingly important to medical diagnostics. However, these are typically confined to wealthy, developed countries; or, to the national reference laboratories of developing-world countries. There are many infectious diseases that are endemic in low-resource settings (LRS) where the lack of simple, instrument-free, NA diagnostic tests is a critical barrier to timely treatment. One of the primary barriers to the practicality and availability of NA assays in LRS has been the complexity and power requirements of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrumentation (another is sample preparation). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this article, we investigate the hypothesis that an electricity-free heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays. We assess the heater's equivalence to commercially available PCR instruments through the characterization of the temperature profiles produced, and a minimal method comparison. Versions of the prototype for several different isothermal techniques are presented. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that an electricity-free heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays, and that the results of those assays are not significantly different from ones incubated in parallel in commercially available PCR instruments. These results clearly suggest the potential of the non-instrumented nucleic acid amplification (NINA) heater for molecular diagnostics in LRS. When combined with other innovations in development that eliminate power requirements for sample preparation, cold reagent storage, and readout, the NINA heater will comprise part of a kit that should enable electricity-free NA testing for many important analytes.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.00653888,0.044138551,0.155802682,0.006014044,-0.076345837,0.024799957,0.06125289,0.009814887,0.001966339,0.034881279,-0.054981318,0.009970479,0.065548053,-0.118465964,-0.016436108,0.042461599,-0.056604689,0.011839208,-0.05600401,-0.038389041,-0.036509129,-0.064617187,0.029434566,-0.084644165,-0.0090647,-0.004675821,-0.022289878,0.005222683,-0.035750626,0.03637818
siRNAs Derived from Cymbidium Mosaic Virus and Odontoglossum Ringspot Virus Down-modulated the Expression Levels of Endogenous Genes in Phalaenopsis equestris,"Interplay between Cymbidium mosaic virus (CymMV)/Odontoglossum ringspot virus (ORSV) and its host plant Phalaenopsis equestris remain largely unknown, which led to deficiency of effective measures to control disease of P. equestris caused by infecting viruses. In this study, for the first time, we characterized viral small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) profiles in P. equestris co-infected with CymMV and ORSV through small RNA sequencing technology. CymMV and ORSV small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) demonstrated several general and specific/new characteristics. vsiRNAs, with A/U bias at the first nucleotide, were predominantly 21-nt long and they were derived predominantly (90%) from viral positive-strand RNA. 21-nt siRNA duplexes with 0-nt overhangs were the most abundant 21-nt duplexes, followed by 2-nt overhangs and then 1-nt overhangs 21-nt duplexes in infected P. equestris. Continuous but heterogeneous distribution and secondary structures prediction implied that vsiRNAs originate predominantly by direct Dicer-like enzymes cleavage of imperfect duplexes in the most folded regions of the positive strand of both viruses RNA molecular. Furthermore, we totally predicted 54 target genes by vsiRNAs with psRNATarget server, including disease/stress response–related genes, RNA interference core components, cytoskeleton-related genes, photosynthesis or energy supply related genes. Gene Ontology classification showed that a majority of the predicted targets were related to cellular components and cellular processes and performed a certain function. All target genes were down-regulated with different degree by vsiRNAs as shown by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Taken together, CymMV and ORSV siRNAs played important roles in interplay with P. equestris by down modulating the expression levels of endogenous genes in host plant.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.137016929,-0.042387884,-0.01276142,0.009993405,0.010702823,-0.022328851,-0.012350911,0.017610164,0.00599983,-0.001146178,-0.04164578,-0.052344777,0.018182028,0.049817604,0.02779621,-0.001268677,-0.042414658,-0.005541354,-0.013689115,-0.015332507,0.010401428,0.025391499,-0.062500396,0.0095033,-0.104698025,-0.108450298,0.031039861,0.025042811,0.083148292,-0.022629751
"Viral deep sequencing needs an adaptive approach: IRMA, the iterative refinement meta-assembler","BACKGROUND: Deep sequencing makes it possible to observe low-frequency viral variants and sub-populations with greater accuracy and sensitivity than ever before. Existing platforms can be used to multiplex a large number of samples; however, analysis of the resulting data is complex and involves separating barcoded samples and various read manipulation processes ending in final assembly. Many assembly tools were designed with larger genomes and higher fidelity polymerases in mind and do not perform well with reads derived from highly variable viral genomes. Reference-based assemblers may leave gaps in viral assemblies while de novo assemblers may struggle to assemble unique genomes. RESULTS: The IRMA (iterative refinement meta-assembler) pipeline solves the problem of viral variation by the iterative optimization of read gathering and assembly. As with all reference-based assembly, reads are included in assembly when they match consensus template sets; however, IRMA provides for on-the-fly reference editing, correction, and optional elongation without the need for additional reference selection. This increases both read depth and breadth. IRMA also focuses on quality control, error correction, indel reporting, variant calling and variant phasing. In fact, IRMA’s ability to detect and phase minor variants is one of its most distinguishing features. We have built modules for influenza and ebolavirus. We demonstrate usage and provide calibration data from mixture experiments. Methods for variant calling, phasing, and error estimation/correction have been redesigned to meet the needs of viral genomic sequencing. CONCLUSION: IRMA provides a robust next-generation sequencing assembly solution that is adapted to the needs and characteristics of viral genomes. The software solves issues related to the genetic diversity of viruses while providing customized variant calling, phasing, and quality control. IRMA is freely available for non-commercial use on Linux and Mac OS X and has been parallelized for high-throughput computing.

Cleaved fragments are subsequently degraded by the cellular 5′-3′ mRNA exonuclease Xrn1, thereby suppressing cellular gene expression and facilitating viral evasion of host defenses. We reveal that mammalian cells respond to this widespread cytoplasmic mRNA decay by altering RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription in the nucleus. Measuring RNAPII recruitment to promoters and nascent mRNA synthesis revealed that the majority of affected genes are transcriptionally repressed in SOX-expressing cells. The transcriptional feedback does not occur in response to the initial viral endonuclease-induced cleavage, but instead to degradation of the cleaved fragments by cellular exonucleases. In particular, Xrn1 catalytic activity is required for transcriptional repression. Notably, viral mRNA transcription escapes decay-induced repression, and this escape requires Xrn1. Collectively, these results indicate that mRNA decay rates impact transcription and that gamma-herpesviruses use this feedback mechanism to facilitate viral gene expression.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.141598788,-0.058758327,-0.029565904,-0.064796067,-0.092619964,0.007906365,-0.005503301,-0.028466677,0.050424559,-0.049665477,-0.076174336,-0.085830587,0.011272749,0.113247562,-0.028398458,0.02435699,0.010037839,-0.103993394,-0.081864124,-0.014795199,0.002546542,0.049532968,-0.034736231,0.003649184,-0.008262707,-0.13875956,-0.022435826,0.041789064,0.130511427,0.00504015
Anti-cytomegalovirus activity of the anthraquinone atanyl blue PRL,"Abstract Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) causes significant disease in immunocompromised patients and serious birth defects if acquired in utero. Available CMV antivirals target the viral DNA polymerase, have significant toxicities, and suffer from resistance. New drugs targeting different pathways would be beneficial. The anthraquinone emodin is proposed to inhibit herpes simplex virus by blocking the viral nuclease. Emodin and related anthraquinones are also reported to inhibit CMV. In the present study, emodin reduced CMV infectious yield with an EC50 of 4.9μM but was cytotoxic at concentrations only twofold higher. Related anthraquinones acid blue 40 and alizarin violet R inhibited CMV at only high concentrations (238–265μM) that were also cytotoxic. However, atanyl blue PRL inhibited infectious yield of CMV with an EC50 of 6.3μM, significantly below its 50% cytotoxic concentration of 216μM. Atanyl blue PRL reduced CMV infectivity and inhibited spread. When added up to 1h after infection, it dramatically reduced CMV immediate early protein expression and blocked viral DNA synthesis. However, it had no antiviral activity when added 24h after infection. Interestingly, atanyl blue PRL inhibited nuclease activities of purified CMV UL98 protein with IC50 of 4.5 and 9.3μM. These results indicate that atanyl blue PRL targets very early post-entry events in CMV replication and suggest it may act through inhibition of UL98, making it a novel CMV inhibitor. This compound may provide valuable insights into molecular events that occur at the earliest times post-infection and serve as a lead structure for antiviral development.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.059335736,-0.029711941,-0.00657164,-0.064057969,-0.098148496,0.054571685,0.06014648,-0.004728397,0.02282306,0.023698882,-0.018706706,0.00670563,0.005293739,0.013289294,-0.007559094,0.006506338,-0.015146363,0.046232607,0.017196842,0.010868273,-0.003670472,0.009269291,-0.018592942,0.014973647,0.020748057,0.016617796,-0.002421043,-0.006744762,0.008718649,0.02579036
Evaluation of Four Different Systems for Extraction of RNA from Stool Suspensions Using MS-2 Coliphage as an Exogenous Control for RT-PCR Inhibition,"Knowing when, and to what extent co-extracted inhibitors interfere with molecular RNA diagnostic assays is of utmost importance. The QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (A); MagNA Pure LC2.0 Automatic extractor (B); KingFisher (C); and NucliSENS EasyMag (D) RNA extraction systems were evaluated for extraction efficiency and co-purification of inhibitors from stool suspensions. Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) of MS-2 coliphage spiked into each system’s lysis buffer served as an external control for both. Cycle thresholds (Cts) of the MS2 were determined for RNA extracted from stool suspensions containing unknown (n = 93) or varying amounts of inhibitors (n = 92). Stool suspensions from the latter group were also used to determine whether MS-2 and enterovirus rRT-PCR inhibitions were correlated. Specifically 23 RNA extracts from stool suspensions were spiked with enterovirus RNA after extraction and 13 of these stool suspension were spiked with intact enterovirus before extraction. MS2 rRT-PCR inhibition varied for RNAs extracted by the different systems. Inhibition was noted in 12 (13.0%), 26 (28.3%), 7 (7.6%), and 7 (7.6%) of the first 93 RNA extracts, and 58 (63.0%), 55 (59.8%), 37 (40.2%) and 30 (32.6%) of the second 92 extracts for A, B, C, and D, respectively. Furthermore, enterovirus rRT-PCR inhibition correlated with MS2 rRT-PCR inhibition for added enterovirus RNA or virus particles. In conclusion, rRT-PCR for MS-2 RNA is a good predictor of inhibition of enterovirus RNA extracted from stool suspensions. EasyMag performed the best, however all four extraction methods were suitable provided that external controls identified problematic samples.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.060432204,0.011966714,0.044762013,0.048756704,-0.018876981,-0.05467708,-0.010888837,0.040464673,-0.034182715,0.017604447,0.070348998,0.00116734,-0.021519824,0.04939871,0.034845063,0.011229655,0.005422511,0.016748897,0.04438033,-0.108321774,-0.028849009,0.03643478,0.018594498,-0.049071481,-0.033346601,-0.032807991,0.013830948,-0.031958482,0.021382904,0.025184132
Biochemical and genetic analysis of the role of the viral polymerase in enterovirus recombination,"Genetic recombination in single-strand, positive-sense RNA viruses is a poorly understand mechanism responsible for generating extensive genetic change and novel phenotypes. By moving a critical cis-acting replication element (CRE) from the polyprotein coding region to the 3′ non-coding region we have further developed a cell-based assay (the 3′CRE-REP assay) to yield recombinants throughout the non-structural coding region of poliovirus from dually transfected cells. We have additionally developed a defined biochemical assay in which the only protein present is the poliovirus RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which recapitulates the strand transfer events of the recombination process. We have used both assays to investigate the role of the polymerase fidelity and nucleotide turnover rates in recombination. Our results, of both poliovirus intertypic and intratypic recombination in the CRE-REP assay and using a range of polymerase variants in the biochemical assay, demonstrate that RdRp fidelity is a fundamental determinant of recombination frequency. High fidelity polymerases exhibit reduced recombination and low fidelity polymerases exhibit increased recombination in both assays. These studies provide the basis for the analysis of poliovirus recombination throughout the non-structural region of the virus genome and provide a defined biochemical assay to further dissect this important evolutionary process.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.17443169,-0.017109734,0.00751032,0.093259066,0.015038732,-0.059375533,0.0384029,0.023239541,-0.067446851,0.036795334,0.106410567,0.112182476,-0.082654637,-0.047157661,-0.014022285,0.027666848,-0.050462036,-0.051822043,-0.075367103,-0.041880061,0.153574881,-0.100769283,0.081733209,0.08135353,-0.084696311,0.059714785,0.089825108,-0.013463771,-0.084071165,-0.076844898
Applying a Linear Amplification Strategy to Recombinase Polymerase Amplification for Uniform DNA Library Amplification,"[Image: see text] Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is an isothermal DNA amplification method with broad applications as a point-of-care test and in molecular biology techniques. Currently, most of the applications are focused on target-specific amplification. Because RPA has the advantage of amplifying DNA under isothermal conditions, we utilized RPA as a DNA library amplification tool. In this study, we used a sheared genomic DNA library and an oligonucleotide (oligo) library for the comparison of polymerase chain reaction and RPA. For the sheared DNA library, we observed biased amplification after RPA was conducted. Thus, to amplify the size-variable DNA library uniformly, we introduced a linear amplification strategy with RPA and successfully improved the uniformity. On the other hand, using the same-sized oligo library, we confirmed that RPA amplified this library uniformly without modification of the protocol. These results demonstrate that RPA can be applied not only to amplify a specific target as previously demonstrated but also to amplify a complex DNA library composed of a large number of different DNA molecules.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.045360459,0.042346295,0.207539414,0.004736165,-0.10477986,-0.021573566,0.066767213,0.03267061,-0.00582613,-0.067606321,-0.113265275,0.053215447,-0.001370384,-0.152111245,-0.098144156,0.168033559,-0.115498302,-0.077707278,0.147074676,0.273598361,0.041348071,-0.02610512,-0.007239596,-0.083370041,-0.093606712,0.031930988,-0.032302125,0.077648027,0.03448626,0.010497807
The Hepatitis E virus intraviral interactome,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging virus causing epidemic acute hepatitis in developing countries as well as sporadic cases in industrialized countries. The life cycle of HEV is still poorly understood and the lack of efficient cell culture systems and animal models are the principal limitations for a detailed study of the viral replication cycle. Here we exhaustively examine all possible intraviral protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of HEV by systematic Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and LuMPIS screens, providing a basis for studying the function of these proteins in the viral replication cycle. Key PPIs correlate with the already published HEV 3D structure. Furthermore, we report 20 novel PPIs including the homodimerization of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the self-interaction of the papain like protease, and ORF3 interactions with the papain-like protease and putative replicase components: RdRp, methylase and helicase. Furthermore, we determined the dissociation constant (K(d)) of ORF3 interactions with the viral helicase, papain-like protease and methylase, which suggest a regulatory function for ORF3 in orchestrating the formation of the replicase complex. These interactions may represent new targets for antiviral drugs.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.153742987,-0.05073695,-0.074230157,0.04402192,-0.074459377,0.01000296,0.060229539,-0.01248851,0.014005232,0.033871101,0.005477916,0.056863446,-0.019581857,-0.036630398,-0.025095909,-0.068353187,0.049538889,0.019977637,0.032393717,0.027238579,-0.035009191,0.018712515,-0.050023384,-0.062208789,0.033080427,0.07614823,0.015836939,-0.010542986,0.026867207,-0.034306931
Delayed kinetics of poliovirus RNA synthesis in a human cell line with reduced levels of hnRNP C proteins,"Abstract The hnRNP C heterotetramer [(C13)C2] binds RNA polymerase II transcripts in the nucleus, along with other proteins of the core hnRNP complex, and plays an important role in mRNA biogenesis and transport. Infection of HeLa cells with poliovirus causes hnRNP C to re-localize from the nucleus, where it is normally retained during interphase, to the cytoplasm. We have proposed that in the cytoplasm, the protein isoforms of hnRNP C participate in the recognition of viral specific RNAs by the poliovirus replication proteins and/or in the assembly of membrane-bound RNA replication complexes. In SK-OV-3 cells, which express reduced levels of hnRNP C compared to HeLa cells or 293 cells, the kinetics of poliovirus replication are delayed. hnRNP C is also re-localized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in SK-OV-3 cells infected with poliovirus. Increased expression of hnRNP C in SK-OV-3 cells by transient transfection increases the rate of virus production and overall yield over that seen in mock-transfected cells. We propose that hnRNP C interacts with poliovirus RNA and replication proteins to increase the efficiency of viral genomic RNA synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.154033224,-0.063087026,-0.046385533,-0.014681575,-0.092962705,-0.016790561,0.003224953,-0.010631826,0.025278083,-0.023454805,0.007601119,-0.036011,-0.024326566,0.105088774,0.021799386,0.052960239,-0.007177788,-0.055760088,-0.015695495,0.015495528,-0.003228683,0.030118333,0.00462745,-0.052079546,0.032475937,0.013232871,-0.023854635,0.012160048,-0.052285387,0.010460999
Hepatitis E Virus Cysteine Protease Has Papain Like Properties Validated by in silico Modeling and Cell-Free Inhibition Assays,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) has emerged as a global health concern during the last decade. In spite of a high mortality rate in pregnant women with fulminant hepatitis, no antiviral drugs or licensed vaccine is available in India. HEV-protease is a pivotal enzyme responsible for ORF1 polyprotein processing leading to cleavage of the non-structural enzymes involved in virus replication. HEV-protease region encoding 432–592 amino acids of Genotype-1 was amplified, expressed in Sf21 cells and purified in its native form. The recombinant enzyme was biochemically characterized using SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and Immunofluorescence. The enzyme activity and the inhibition studies were conducted using Zymography, FTC-casein based protease assay and ORF1 polyprotein digestion. To conduct ORF1 digestion assay, the polyprotein, natural substrate of HEV-protease, was expressed in E. coli and purified. Cleavage of 186 kDa ORF1 polyprotein by the recombinant HEV-protease lead to appearance of non-structural proteins viz. Methyltransferase, Protease, Helicase and RNA dependent RNA polymerase which were confirmed through immunoblotting using antibodies generated against specific epitopes of the enzymes. FTC-casein substrate was used for kinetic studies to determine Km and Vmax of the enzyme and also the effect of different metal ions and other protease inhibitors. A 95% inhibition was observed with E-64 which was validated through in silico analysis. The correlation coefficient between inhibition and docking score of Inhibitors was found to have a significant value of r(2) = 0.75. The predicted 3D model showed two domain architecture structures similar to Papain like cysteine protease though they differed in arrangements of alpha helices and beta sheets. Hence, we propose that HEV-protease has characteristics of “Papain-like cysteine protease,” as determined through structural homology, active site residues and class-specific inhibition. However, conclusive nature of the enzyme remains to be established.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.132840604,-0.034365904,-0.022081168,-0.013820828,-0.050500081,0.031336245,0.009324235,-0.027427887,0.040793536,-0.024094674,-0.036237824,0.06949036,-0.012027064,-0.065526143,-0.056590683,-0.074617679,0.056245914,0.050159599,0.080865883,-0.000751858,-0.013775634,0.00062419,-0.006726031,-0.012203303,0.061485508,0.100677464,0.010047825,-0.039845561,0.01133655,-0.040151471
Detecting respiratory viral RNA using expanded genetic alphabets and self-avoiding DNA,"Abstract Nucleic acid (NA)-targeted tests detect and quantify viral DNA and RNA (collectively xNA) to support epidemiological surveillance and, in individual patients, to guide therapy. They commonly use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription PCR. Although these all have rapid turnaround, they are expensive to run. Multiplexing would allow their cost to be spread over multiple targets, but often only with lower sensitivity and accuracy, noise, false positives, and false negatives; these arise by interactions between the multiple nucleic acid primers and probes in a multiplexed kit. Here we offer a multiplexed assay for a panel of respiratory viruses that mitigates these problems by combining several nucleic acid analogs from the emerging field of synthetic biology: (i) self-avoiding molecular recognition systems (SAMRSs), which facilitate multiplexing, and (ii) artificially expanded genetic information systems (AEGISs), which enable low-noise PCR. These are supplemented by “transliteration” technology, which converts standard nucleotides in a target to AEGIS nucleotides in a product, improving hybridization. The combination supports a multiplexed Luminex-based respiratory panel that potentially differentiates influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, detecting as few as 10 MERS virions in a 20-μl sample.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0.079860171,0.122704075,0.035838206,0.121451004,-0.031285708,-0.013071575,-0.018126695,0.080570024,0.073434206,0.068088747,-0.021863376,-0.031299109,0.102626863,-0.071605656,0.0277973,-0.039251214,-0.008880832,-0.029709989,-0.005791264,-0.029951716,-0.007933893,-0.078114323,0.034387395,-0.044920826,-0.004264717,-0.044368549,-0.043755418,-0.009906981,-0.048246553,-0.016558406
Increased Detection of Viruses in Children with Respiratory Tract Infection Using PCR,"Respiratory viruses are a common cause of respiratory tract infection (RTI), particularly in neonates and children. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral infections could improve clinical outcomes and reduce the use of antibiotics and treatment sessions. Advances in diagnostic technology contribute to the accurate detection of viruses. We performed a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to investigate the viral etiology in pediatric patients and compared the detection rates with those determined using traditional antigen tests and virus cultures. Fifteen respiratory viruses were included in our investigation: respiratory syncytial virus A/B (RSV), influenza virus A (FluA) and influenza virus B (FluB), human metapneumovirus (MPV), enterovirus (EV), human parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1–4, human rhinovirus (RV), human coronavirus OC43, NL63, and 229E, human adenovirus (ADV), and human bocavirus (Boca). In total, 474 specimens were collected and tested. Respiratory viruses were detected more frequently by PCR (357, 75.3%) than they were by traditional tests (229, 49.3%). The leading pathogens were RSV (113, 23.8%), RV (72, 15.2%), PIV3 (53, 11.2%), FluA (51, 10.8%), and ADV (48, 10.1%). For children younger than 5 years, RSV and RV were most prevalent; for children older than 5 years, FluA and ADV were the most frequently detected. Of the specimens, 25.8% (92/357) were coinfected with two or more viruses. RV, Boca, PIV2, FluB, and PIV4 had higher rates of coinfection; MPV and PIV1 had the lowest rates of coinfection (9.1% and 5.3%). To conclude, the detection power of PCR was better than that of traditional antigen tests and virus cultures when considering the detection of respiratory viruses. RSV and RV were the leading viral pathogens identified in the respiratory specimens. One-quarter of the positive specimens were coinfected with two or more viruses. In the future, further application of PCR may contribute to the rapid and accurate diagnosis of respiratory viruses and could improve patient outcomes.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.301456688,-0.110335538,-0.016526099,0.19349994,0.057459672,-0.090212666,0.065263671,-0.066931863,0.070954245,0.052813146,-0.018823298,-0.074509947,0.060454018,0.006065497,0.022859018,-0.077868464,0.01723646,-0.027675861,0.019988364,-0.011140189,0.043015066,-0.051671815,0.068385778,0.019091552,0.009693015,-0.051568399,0.103157265,0.061355813,-0.076593948,-0.026268115
"Clinical Features, Virus Identification, and Sinusitis as a Complication of Upper Respiratory Tract Illness in Children Ages 4-7 Years","Objective To determine the rate of sinusitis complicating upper respiratory tract illnesses (URIs) in children. We prospectively identified the clinical, virologic, and epidemiologic characteristics of URIs in a population of 4- to 7-year-old children followed for 1 year. Study design This was an observational cohort study in 2 primary care pediatric practices in Madison, Wisconsin. Nasal samples were obtained during 4 asymptomatic surveillance visits and during symptomatic URIs. A polymerase chain reaction-based assay for 9 respiratory viruses was performed on nasal samples. A diagnosis of sinusitis was based on published criteria. Results Two hundred thirty-six children ages 48-96 months were enrolled. A total of 327 URIs were characterized. The mean number of URIs per child was 1.3 (range 0-9) per year. Viruses were detected in 81% of URIs; rhinovirus (RV) was most common. Seventy-two percent of URIs were resolved clinically by the 10th day. RV-A and RV-C were detected more frequently at URI visits; RV-B was detected at the same rate for both asymptomatic surveillance visits and URI visits. Sinusitis was diagnosed in 8.8% of symptomatic URIs. Viruses were detected frequently (33%) in samples from asymptomatic children. Conclusions Sinusitis occurred in 8.8% of symptomatic URIs in our study. The virus most frequently detected with URIs in children was RV; RV-A and RV-C detection but not RV-B detection were associated with illness. Viruses, especially RV, are detected frequently in asymptomatic children. Most URIs have improved or resolved by the 10th day after onset. Children experienced a mean of 1.3 URIs per year, which was lower than expected.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.099147937,-0.061309044,-0.015808647,-0.033533369,0.02947674,-0.056531818,0.056300765,-0.038179536,0.038953196,-0.017990244,0.008945341,-0.010317299,-0.040095069,-0.057802357,0.027184779,0.01825815,-0.007928142,-0.048053181,0.015906156,-0.042023844,-0.021296677,0.008840604,-0.013019074,0.035496991,0.008016647,0.033842209,-0.007237284,0.024834314,0.006700458,-0.006126372
A Next-Generation Sequencing Data Analysis Pipeline for Detecting Unknown Pathogens from Mixed Clinical Samples and Revealing Their Genetic Diversity,"Forty-two cytopathic effect (CPE)-positive isolates were collected from 2008 to 2012. All isolates could not be identified for known viral pathogens by routine diagnostic assays. They were pooled into 8 groups of 5–6 isolates to reduce the sequencing cost. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was conducted for each group of mixed samples, and the proposed data analysis pipeline was used to identify viral pathogens in these mixed samples. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was individually conducted for each of these 42 isolates depending on the predicted viral types in each group. Two isolates remained unknown after these tests. Moreover, iteration mapping was implemented for each of these 2 isolates, and predicted human parechovirus (HPeV) in both. In summary, our NGS pipeline detected the following viruses among the 42 isolates: 29 human rhinoviruses (HRVs), 10 HPeVs, 1 human adenovirus (HAdV), 1 echovirus and 1 rotavirus. We then focused on the 10 identified Taiwanese HPeVs because of their reported clinical significance over HRVs. Their genomes were assembled and their genetic diversity was explored. One novel 6-bp deletion was found in one HPeV-1 virus. In terms of nucleotide heterogeneity, 64 genetic variants were detected from these HPeVs using the mapped NGS reads. Most importantly, a recombination event was found between our HPeV-3 and a known HPeV-4 strain in the database. Similar event was detected in the other HPeV-3 strains in the same clade of the phylogenetic tree. These findings demonstrated that the proposed NGS data analysis pipeline identified unknown viruses from the mixed clinical samples, revealed their genetic identity and variants, and characterized their genetic features in terms of viral evolution.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.008507187,-0.025511374,0.048274637,-0.048663601,0.124091914,0.026722957,0.03561407,-0.012229481,-0.028643615,0.090652096,0.012971864,0.016809768,-0.009514679,-0.017416097,0.033525634,-0.064537737,-0.059211136,0.004177865,-0.023666081,-0.003772395,0.065953497,0.063729693,-0.001023046,0.078787708,-0.081407073,-0.011485361,0.034089492,0.046548015,-0.074185974,0.012023555
A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster,"Summary Background An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date. Methods In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done. Findings From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged >60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats. Interpretation Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.

A Reverse Genetics System for Cypovirus Based on a Bacmid Expressing T7 RNA Polymerase,"Dendrolimus punctatus cypovirus (DpCPV), belonging to the genus Cypovirus within the family Reoviridae, is considered the most destructive pest of pine forests worldwide. DpCPV has a genome consisting of 10 linear double-stranded RNA segments. To establish a reverse genetics system, we cloned cDNAs encoding the 10 genomic segments of DpCPV into three reverse genetics vectors in which each segment was transcribed under the control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter and terminator tagged with a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme sequence. We also constructed a vp80-knockout Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus bacmid to express a T7 RNA polymerase codon-optimized for Sf9 cells. Following transfection of Sf9 cells with the three vectors and the bacmid, occlusion bodies (OBs) with the typical morphology of cypovirus polyhedra were observed by optical microscopy. The rescue system was verified by incorporation of a HindIII restriction enzyme site null mutant of the 9th genomic segment. Furthermore, when we co-transfected Sf9 cells with the reverse genetics vectors, the bacmid, and an additional vector bearing an egfp gene flanked with the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of the 10th genomic segment, aggregated green fluorescence co-localizing with the OBs was observed. The rescued OBs were able to infect Spodopetra exigua larvae, although their infectivity was significantly lower than that of wild-type DpCPV. This reverse genetics system for DpCPV could be used to explore viral replication and pathogenesis and to facilitate the development of novel bio-insecticides and expression systems for exogenous proteins.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.153210134,-0.040727609,0.000576445,-0.000777206,-0.016549377,-0.023444402,-0.046695391,-0.009007944,0.006320396,-0.019358287,-0.019414238,-0.040563797,-0.006483845,0.044368078,0.03501094,0.018009129,-0.036944561,-0.012458398,-0.006140431,0.003024129,0.013112454,0.006636554,0.006657315,-0.000685453,-0.036936828,0.00268471,0.02492873,-0.002435624,-0.06635202,0.035561634
Viral etiologies of lower respiratory tract infections among Egyptian children under five years of age,"BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are responsible for a considerable number of deaths among children, particularly in developing countries. In Egypt and the Middle East region, there is a lack of data regarding the viral causes of LRTI. In this study, we aimed to identify the relative prevalence of various respiratory viruses that contribute to LRTIs in young children. Although, nucleic acid-based methods have gained importance as a sensitive tool to determine the viral infections, their use is limited because of their prohibitive cost in low-income countries. Therefore, we applied three different laboratory methods, and presented the different virus prevalence patterns detected by each method. METHODS: We collected nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, demographic data and, clinical data from 450 children under five years of age who presented with LRTI at Abou El Reesh hospital in Cairo during a one-year period. To identify the viral causes of the LRTI we used direct fluorescence assay, real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-RT-PCR), and shell vial culture. We tested for eight major respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-nine patients (59.9%) had a viral infection, among which 10.8% had a co-infection with two or more viruses. By all three methods, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most predominant, and parainfluenza virus type 2 (HPIV-2), influenza B virus (FLUBV) were the least predominant. Other viral prevalence patterns differed according to the detection method used. The distribution of various viruses among different age groups and seasonal distribution of the viruses were also determined. CONCLUSIONS: RSV and human adenovirus were the most common respiratory viruses detected by rt-RT-PCR. Co-infections were found to be frequent among children and the vast majority of co-infections were detected by nucleic acid-based detection assays.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.27277708,-0.078563817,0.040545623,0.186188963,0.050673539,-0.10867888,0.079971936,-0.072444019,0.086073152,0.048679982,0.007133972,-0.074469964,0.013908331,-0.003581109,0.012884374,-0.047377551,0.018400226,-0.010571276,-0.014302844,0.016074794,-0.014626036,0.035550277,-0.008838018,0.068433111,-0.009024358,-0.005554406,0.079104265,0.011883945,-0.016217551,0.014358596
What is the Role of Respiratory Viruses in Community-Acquired Pneumonia? What is the Best Therapy for Influenza and Other Viral Causes of Community-Acquired Pneumonia?,"Respiratory viruses including influenza have long been appreciated as a cause of community acquired pneumonia (CAP), particularly among children, people with serious medical co-morbidities and military recruits. They are increasingly recognized as a cause of CAP among adults, particularly older adults. Polymerase chain reaction-based testing has allowed detection of newer agents (e.g. human metapneumovirus, coronavirus HKU1 and NL63) as well as improved the ability to detect “old” viral infections such as influenza virus and rhinovirus. When PCR is used, viruses have been detected in 45–75% of children and 15–54% of adults with CAP. Co-infection with viruses and bacteria is common and it remains challenging to determine which patients have only viral infection as the cause of CAP. Treatment for influenza with neuraminidase inhibitors should be started promptly for patients with CAP when influenza is suspected or documented, regardless of evidence of bacterial co-infection. Better ways to diagnose viral CAP and to integrate detection into management are urgently needed, as well as better treatment options for non-influenza respiratory viral infections.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.219246683,-0.131695313,-0.091341846,0.130034051,-0.049403248,0.094534696,-0.037842929,0.048457264,-0.114109837,0.073774216,-0.063814763,-0.023608122,0.102749476,0.001715159,-0.064472413,-0.064327806,-0.007023907,0.012805077,-0.072622701,0.126818419,-0.01234783,0.130619627,0.181333628,0.091835674,0.109573231,-0.089948025,-0.021471417,0.043100909,0.19085014,0.078583504
Host-Driven Phosphorylation Appears to Regulate the Budding Activity of the Lassa Virus Matrix Protein,"Lassa mammarenavirus (LASV) is an enveloped RNA virus that can cause Lassa fever, an acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome associated with significant morbidity and high rates of fatality in endemic regions of western Africa. The arenavirus matrix protein Z has several functions during the virus life cycle, including coordinating viral assembly, driving the release of new virus particles, regulating viral polymerase activity, and antagonizing the host antiviral response. There is limited knowledge regarding how the various functions of Z are regulated. To investigate possible means of regulation, mass spectrometry was used to identify potential sites of phosphorylation in the LASV Z protein. This analysis revealed that two serines (S18, S98) and one tyrosine (Y97) are phosphorylated in the flexible N- and C-terminal regions of the protein. Notably, two of these sites, Y97 and S98, are located in (Y97) or directly adjacent to (S98) the PPXY late domain, an important motif for virus release. Studies with non-phosphorylatable and phosphomimetic Z proteins revealed that these sites are important regulators of the release of LASV particles and that host-driven, reversible phosphorylation may play an important role in the regulation of LASV Z protein function.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.129271896,-0.055763987,-0.060985115,-0.001992605,-0.055700197,0.045522876,0.036321629,-0.027868568,0.039931628,0.017916235,-0.050595075,-0.036091171,0.018977549,0.012998594,-0.009580085,-0.045839306,0.034863567,-0.030893217,-0.024631799,0.053055409,-0.025405781,0.042131073,-0.034980909,-0.018092872,0.0516561,0.07118482,0.04826392,-0.033822056,-0.006555058,0.013906865
A cypovirus VP5 displays the RNA chaperone-like activity that destabilizes RNA helices and accelerates strand annealing,"For double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses in the family Reoviridae, their inner capsids function as the machinery for viral RNA (vRNA) replication. Unlike other multishelled reoviruses, cypovirus has a single-layered capsid, thereby representing a simplified model for studying vRNA replication of reoviruses. VP5 is one of the three major cypovirus capsid proteins and functions as a clamp protein to stabilize cypovirus capsid. Here, we expressed VP5 from type 5 Helicoverpa armigera cypovirus (HaCPV-5) in a eukaryotic system and determined that this VP5 possesses RNA chaperone-like activity, which destabilizes RNA helices and accelerates strand annealing independent of ATP. Our further characterization of VP5 revealed that its helix-destabilizing activity is RNA specific, lacks directionality and could be inhibited by divalent ions, such as Mg(2+), Mn(2+), Ca(2+) or Zn(2+), to varying degrees. Furthermore, we found that HaCPV-5 VP5 facilitates the replication initiation of an alternative polymerase (i.e. reverse transcriptase) through a panhandle-structured RNA template, which mimics the 5′-3′ cyclization of cypoviral positive-stranded RNA. Given that the replication of negative-stranded vRNA on the positive-stranded vRNA template necessitates the dissociation of the 5′-3′ panhandle, the RNA chaperone activity of VP5 may play a direct role in the initiation of reoviral dsRNA synthesis.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.203243617,-0.055220247,-0.070412519,0.098145805,-0.054204361,-0.074559622,0.006416617,0.033829639,-0.036826564,-0.000275935,0.078342477,0.026405118,-0.045420808,0.060900298,0.0052622,0.017610973,0.022520823,-0.029751698,0.019992691,0.000354799,-0.039671793,0.046138965,-0.050173292,-0.080815613,-0.023271695,-0.03438813,-0.05309264,0.012775568,-0.029511152,0.026404571
Viral Respiratory Infections in Preterm Infants during and after Hospitalization,"Objective To determine the burden of viral respiratory infections in preterm infants both during and subsequent to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) hospitalization and to compare this with term infants living in the community. Study design From March 2013 through March 2015, we enrolled 189 newborns (96 term and 93 preterm) into a prospective, longitudinal study obtaining nose/throat swabs within 7 days of birth, weekly while hospitalized and then monthly to 4 months after hospital discharge. Taqman array cards were used to identify 16 viral respiratory pathogens by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were gathered from electronic medical records, and parent interview while hospitalized with interval histories collected at monthly visits. The hospital course of all preterm infants who underwent late-onset sepsis evaluations was reviewed. Results Over 119 weeks, we collected 618 nose/throat swabs from at risk preterm infants in our level IV regional NICU. Only 4 infants had viral respiratory infections, all less than 28 weeks gestation at birth. Two infants were symptomatic with the infections recognized by the clinical team. The daily risk of acquiring a respiratory viral infection in preterm infants in the NICU was significantly lower than in the full term cohort living in the community. Once discharged from the hospital, viral respiratory infections were common in all infants. Conclusions Viral respiratory infections are infrequent in a NICU with strict infection prevention strategies and do not appear to cause unrecognized illness. Both preterm and term infants living in the community quickly acquire respiratory viral infections.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.148292471,-0.072537702,-0.076540933,-0.025818967,-0.023206859,-0.059850663,0.051423122,-0.012063264,0.048135245,0.017775406,0.021364913,-0.031365527,-0.014227719,-0.059304614,0.07667218,0.057948406,0.032346075,-0.041888023,0.067378071,-0.004024338,-0.052759325,-0.095451371,-0.119712455,-0.022982116,0.091748261,-0.044733925,0.028712224,-0.002954876,0.031171654,-0.050269402
Evaluation of recombinase polymerase amplification for detection of begomoviruses by plant diagnostic clinics,"BACKGROUND: Plant viruses in the genus Begomovirus, family Geminiviridae often cause substantial crop losses. These viruses have been emerging in many locations throughout the tropics and subtropics. Like many plant viruses, they are often not recognized by plant diagnostic clinics due in large part to the lack of rapid and cost effective assays. An isothermal amplification assay, Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), was evaluated for its ability to detect three begomoviruses and for its suitability for use in plant diagnostic clinics. Methods for DNA extraction and separation of amplicons from proteins used in the assay were modified and compared to RPA manufacturer’s protocols. The modified RPA assays were compared to PCR assays for sensitivity, use in downstream applications, cost, and speed. RESULTS: Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assays for the detection of Bean golden yellow mosaic virus, Tomato mottle virus and Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) were specific, only amplifying the target viruses in three different host species. RPA was able to detect the target virus when the template was in a crude extract generated using a simple inexpensive extraction method, while PCR was not. Separation of RPA-generated amplicons from DNA-binding proteins could be accomplished by several methods, all of which were faster and less expensive than that recommended by the manufacturer. Use of these modifications resulted in an RPA assay that was faster than PCR but with a similar reagent cost. This modified RPA was the more cost effective assay when labor is added to the cost since RPA can be performed much faster than PCR. RPA had a sensitivity approximate to that of ELISA when crude extract was used as template. RPA-generated amplicons could be used in downstream applications (TA cloning, digestion with a restriction endonuclease, direct sequencing) similar to PCR but unlike some other isothermal reactions. CONCLUSIONS: RPA could prove useful for the cost effective detection of plant viruses by plant diagnostic clinics. It can be performed in one hour or less with a reagent cost similar to that of PCR but with a lower labor cost, and with an acceptable level of sensitivity and specificity.

The role of lateral pterygoid muscle in the traumatic temporomandibular joint ankylosis: A gene chip based analysis,"Traumatic temporomandibular joint ankylosis (TMJA) is a common disease and disorder of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ); however, its pathogenesis has yet to be completely elucidated. In the authors' previous studies, the lateral pterygoid muscle (LPM) was confirmed to exert a function in distraction osteogenesis (DO) during the healing of a condylar fracture, which resulted in the formation of excess bone. The aim of the present study was to investigate alterations in the expression of any associated genes via an Affymetrix GeneChip method. The traumatic TMJA model was fabricated by a condylar fracture in the TMJ area of sheep with either a dissected LPM (LPD) or normal (LPN). The untreated sheep served as a control. At 4- and 12 weeks post-surgery, the condylar zone was isolated to perform the gene chip analysis, which was performed according to a standard Affymetrix protocol. The validated genes were further evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The gene chip analysis indicated that the LPN gene expression pattern was similar compared with the DO process, while LPD was similar to that of normal bone fracture healing. The validated genes were collagen type II α1 chain, C-type lectin domain family 3 member A, interleukin 1A, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, chondromodulin (LECT1), calcitonin receptor (CALCR), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, Fos proto-oncogene (FOS), bone γ-carboxyglutamate protein and bone morphogenic protein (BMP)7, among which, BMP7, LECT1, CALCR and FOS were confirmed by RT-qPCR. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that LPM exerts a DO effect during the pathogenesis of traumatic TMJA, which may provide a novel target for preventing TMJA.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.066183971,0.004539217,0.070640475,-0.09977924,-0.029163976,0.024547287,-0.021271161,-0.0370905,0.040986698,-0.058753673,-0.097524288,-0.010207814,-0.030275379,0.045322177,-0.046214528,-0.043572422,0.028141243,-0.053382018,-0.048929443,-0.028215539,0.026728698,0.006276308,-0.00223224,0.045632049,-0.027277788,0.010171185,0.046087075,0.014334081,0.028315947,-0.034190086
Analysis of therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2 and discovery of potential drugs by computational methods,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused tens of thousands of infections and more than one thousand deaths. There are currently no registered therapies for treating coronavirus infections. Because of time consuming process of new drug development, drug repositioning may be the only solution to the epidemic of sudden infectious diseases. We systematically analyzed all the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes, compared them with proteins from other coronaviruses, predicted their structures, and built 19 structures that could be done by homology modeling. By performing target-based virtual ligand screening, a total of 21 targets (including two human targets) were screened against compound libraries including ZINC drug database and our own database of natural products. Structure and screening results of important targets such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), Spike, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and papain like protease (PLpro) were discussed in detail. In addition, a database of 78 commonly used anti-viral drugs including those currently on the market and undergoing clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 was constructed. Possible targets of these compounds and potential drugs acting on a certain target were predicted. This study will provide new lead compounds and targets for further in vitro and in vivo studies of SARS-CoV-2, new insights for those drugs currently ongoing clinical studies, and also possible new strategies for drug repositioning to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.",0,0,0,1,0,0,-0.082678192,0.291990387,-0.176372611,0.059870191,-0.07403822,0.07772005,0.057527335,-0.128867738,0.037383269,0.055511578,-0.025316987,0.026266184,0.058615693,-0.105173511,-0.001728028,-0.044180724,-0.010937755,0.105045628,0.048740476,0.025018134,-0.032207551,0.028248309,-0.047999089,0.048866806,0.032313821,0.006063165,0.061504312,-0.028227989,0.126002252,0.022727018
Unrecognized Viral Respiratory Tract Infections in Premature Infants during their Birth Hospitalization: A Prospective Surveillance Study in Two Neonatal Intensive Care Units,"Objective To determine the frequency and effects of nosocomial respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in premature neonates, including those who may be asymptomatic. Study design We performed a year-long surveillance for RVIs in infants <33 weeks gestational age admitted to 2 Syracuse neonatal intensive care units. Infants were enrolled within 3 days of neonatal intensive care unit admission and were sampled for RVIs until discharge using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay capable of detecting 17 different respiratory viruses or subtypes. Results Twenty-six of 50 prematurely born infants (52%) tested positive for a respiratory virus at least once during their birth hospitalization. Testing positive for a respiratory virus was significantly associated with longer length of stay (70 days vs 35 days, P = .002) and prolonged ventilatory support (51 vs 13 days, P = .002). Infants who tested positive for a respiratory virus during their birth hospitalization had more than twice the rate of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (P < .05). Conclusion Nosocomial RVIs were frequent in our study population, despite the absence of clinical indicators of illness. Length of hospital stay was significantly longer and a diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was more common in infants who had respiratory viruses detected.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.180284713,-0.067742599,-0.065064489,-0.010123052,0.010149968,-0.064375515,0.01403094,0.006364489,0.016937939,0.004169201,0.027330705,-0.018036187,-0.037712775,-0.020699767,0.069984461,0.041766632,0.035850053,-0.045575739,0.083846895,0.001799825,-0.038537132,-0.134035707,-0.100870426,-0.025017754,0.048816886,-0.022592865,0.019212359,0.000289848,-0.009958945,-0.096737198
Internal control for real-time polymerase chain reaction based on MS2 bacteriophage for RNA viruses diagnostics,"BACKGROUND: Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is routinely used to detect viral infections. In Brazil, it is mandatory the use of nucleic acid tests to detect hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus in blood banks because of the immunological window. The use of an internal control (IC) is necessary to differentiate the true negative results from those consequent from a failure in some step of the nucleic acid test. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was the construction of virus-modified particles, based on MS2 bacteriophage, to be used as IC for the diagnosis of RNA viruses. METHODS: The MS2 genome was cloned into the pET47b(+) plasmid, generating pET47b(+)-MS2. MS2-like particles were produced through the synthesis of MS2 RNA genome by T7 RNA polymerase. These particles were used as non-competitive IC in assays for RNA virus diagnostics. In addition, a competitive control for HCV diagnosis was developed by cloning a mutated HCV sequence into the MS2 replicase gene of pET47b(+)-MS2, which produces a non-propagating MS2 particle. The utility of MS2-like particles as IC was evaluated in a one-step format multiplex real-time RT-PCR for HCV detection. FINDINGS: We demonstrated that both competitive and non-competitive IC could be successfully used to monitor the HCV amplification performance, including the extraction, reverse transcription, amplification and detection steps, without compromising the detection of samples with low target concentrations. In conclusion, MS2-like particles generated by this strategy proved to be useful IC for RNA virus diagnosis, with advantage that they are produced by a low cost protocol. An attractive feature of this system is that it allows the construction of a multicontrol by the insertion of sequences from more than one pathogen, increasing its applicability for diagnosing different RNA viruses.",0,0,0,0,1,0,-0.062443973,0.005744743,0.095072036,0.070639865,-0.040869671,-0.037061909,0.00299598,0.025249793,-0.003212849,0.021787849,-0.000536861,0.004081131,0.044587152,-0.003467734,0.017121479,0.00089626,-0.010554267,0.108657566,0.121788695,-0.082416266,-0.05405293,-0.002506454,0.054283289,-0.004024086,-0.05107842,-0.034513219,-0.023190991,0.018098627,-0.065334504,-0.010702851
Potent Host-Directed Small-Molecule Inhibitors of Myxovirus RNA-Dependent RNA-Polymerases,"Therapeutic targeting of host cell factors required for virus replication rather than of pathogen components opens new perspectives to counteract virus infections. Anticipated advantages of this approach include a heightened barrier against the development of viral resistance and a broadened pathogen target spectrum. Myxoviruses are predominantly associated with acute disease and thus are particularly attractive for this approach since treatment time can be kept limited. To identify inhibitor candidates, we have analyzed hit compounds that emerged from a large-scale high-throughput screen for their ability to block replication of members of both the orthomyxovirus and paramyxovirus families. This has returned a compound class with broad anti-viral activity including potent inhibition of different influenza virus and paramyxovirus strains. After hit-to-lead chemistry, inhibitory concentrations are in the nanomolar range in the context of immortalized cell lines and human PBMCs. The compound shows high metabolic stability when exposed to human S-9 hepatocyte subcellular fractions. Antiviral activity is host-cell species specific and most pronounced in cells of higher mammalian origin, supporting a host-cell target. While the compound induces a temporary cell cycle arrest, host mRNA and protein biosynthesis are largely unaffected and treated cells maintain full metabolic activity. Viral replication is blocked at a post-entry step and resembles the inhibition profile of a known inhibitor of viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) activity. Direct assessment of RdRp activity in the presence of the reagent reveals strong inhibition both in the context of viral infection and in reporter-based minireplicon assays. In toto, we have identified a compound class with broad viral target range that blocks host factors required for viral RdRp activity. Viral adaptation attempts did not induce resistance after prolonged exposure, in contrast to rapid adaptation to a pathogen-directed inhibitor of RdRp activity.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.145829582,-0.054538171,-0.076156976,0.100572269,-0.154192805,0.10007487,0.160105772,-0.024855975,0.023211615,0.083835198,0.021802091,0.005867643,-0.004170522,0.091697681,-0.025009905,-0.029266263,-0.003222819,0.027680722,0.032326799,0.01915076,0.013594184,0.040171192,0.007872331,0.021647165,0.021020704,0.015575583,0.058711637,-0.013394199,0.015424864,0.075376239
Utility of DNA Microarrays for Detection of Viruses in Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in Children,"Objective To assess the utility of a panviral DNA microarray platform (Virochip) in the detection of viruses associated with pediatric respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Study design The Virochip was compared with conventional direct fluorescent antibody (DFA)- and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing for the detection of respiratory viruses in 278 consecutive nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from 222 children. Results The Virochip was superior in performance to DFA, showing a 19% increase in the detection of 7 respiratory viruses included in standard DFA panels, and was similar to virus-specific PCR (sensitivity, 85% to 90%; specificity, ≥99%; positive predictive value, 94% to 96%; negative predictive value, 97% to 98%) in the detection of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A, and rhinoviruses/enteroviruses. The Virochip also detected viruses not routinely tested for or missed by DFA and PCR, as well as double infections and infections in critically ill patients that DFA failed to detect. Conclusions Given its favorable sensitivity and specificity profile and expanded spectrum for detection, microarray-based viral testing holds promise for clinical diagnosis of pediatric RTIs.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.157517589,-0.020087523,0.087665548,0.089081471,-0.011103726,-0.038980658,0.025314189,-0.00830722,-0.008879039,0.045411203,-0.007395205,-0.029134752,0.045611156,-0.020462973,0.040283886,-0.030813236,0.015563619,-0.058355574,0.033534773,-0.071867351,-0.003163281,-0.025428953,0.024983464,-0.013089667,0.015134757,-0.00284096,-0.039127439,-0.040196304,-0.016938806,-0.039497643
Viral Respiratory Tract Infection During the First Postoperative Year Is a Risk Factor for Chronic Rejection After Lung Transplantation,"BACKGROUND: Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is the major limiting factor for long-term survival in lung transplant recipients. Viral respiratory tract infection (VRTI) has been previously associated with CLAD development. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of VRTI during the first year after lung transplantation in relation to CLAD development. METHOD: Ninety-eight patients undergoing lung transplantation were prospectively enrolled between 2009 and 2012. They were monitored for infections with predefined intervals and on extra visits during the first year, the total follow-up period ranged between 5 and 8 years. Nasopharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were analyzed using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction panel for respiratory pathogens. Data regarding clinical characteristics and infectious events were recorded. RESULTS: Viral respiratory tract infection during the first year was identified as a risk factor for long-term CLAD development (P = 0.041, hazard ratio 1.94 [1.03-3.66]) in a time-dependent multivariate Cox regression analysis. We also found that coronavirus in particular was associated with increased risk for CLAD development. Other identified risk factors were acute rejection and cyclosporine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that VRTI during the first year after lung transplantation is associated with long-term CLAD development and that coronavirus infections in particular might be a risk factor.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.090517068,-0.032119009,-0.056117495,-0.066885126,-0.032292711,-0.011172411,0.037602224,0.00668048,0.011913312,0.022691459,-0.0099051,-0.007296346,0.023137769,0.005237983,0.00946696,0.005940733,-0.008141579,-0.012850981,0.004028593,0.006605781,-0.00014154,-0.058191958,-0.063599488,0.008423752,0.030804191,-0.037736727,-0.028167986,-0.044506917,0.013600536,-0.029924268
Discovery of an essential nucleotidylating activity associated with a newly delineated conserved domain in the RNA polymerase-containing protein of all nidoviruses,"RNA viruses encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that catalyzes the synthesis of their RNA(s). In the case of positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the order Nidovirales, the RdRp resides in a replicase subunit that is unusually large. Bioinformatics analysis of this non-structural protein has now revealed a nidoviral signature domain (genetic marker) that is N-terminally adjacent to the RdRp and has no apparent homologs elsewhere. Based on its conservation profile, this domain is proposed to have nucleotidylation activity. We used recombinant non-structural protein 9 of the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV) and different biochemical assays, including irreversible labeling with a GTP analog followed by a proteomics analysis, to demonstrate the manganese-dependent covalent binding of guanosine and uridine phosphates to a lysine/histidine residue. Most likely this was the invariant lysine of the newly identified domain, named nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN), whose substitution with alanine severely diminished the described binding. Furthermore, this mutation crippled EAV and prevented the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in cell culture, indicating that NiRAN is essential for nidoviruses. Potential functions supported by NiRAN may include nucleic acid ligation, mRNA capping and protein-primed RNA synthesis, possibilities that remain to be explored in future studies.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.230022667,0.049998429,-0.161263053,0.163661081,-0.025436816,-0.080903444,0.037780363,-0.016774391,-0.059406346,0.045208314,0.079694103,0.102150406,-0.044774428,-0.055489356,-0.064359294,-0.084731892,0.0926502,-0.093723586,-0.03441287,-0.032172042,0.013675666,-0.016578337,0.061892698,-0.086411663,0.025697926,0.071098512,-0.012606017,0.015450258,0.004362352,0.025212388
