0,Selective induction of interleukin-6 in mouse microglia by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor,"Abstract Astrocytes produce granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and support the survival and proliferation of microglia. To study the functions of GM-CSF in the central nervous system (CNS), we examined the effects of GM-CSF on cytokine production by glial cells. GM-CSF induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by microglia, but not by astrocytes, in a dose-dependent manner as assessed by bioassay and the detection of IL-6 mRNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. GM-CSF did not induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)a or IL-1 in microglia and astrocytes, whereas lipopolysaccharide induced all these cytokines. The induction of IL-6 by GM-CSF in microglia was completely inhibited by antibodies to GM-CSF. Neither IL-3 nor macrophage-CSF (M-CSF) induced IL-6 production in microglia. Given that IL-1 and TNFα, monokines derived from microglia, induce IL-6 production in astrocytes, but not in microglia, results indicate that astrocytes and microglia may mutually regulate IL-6 production by different cytokines.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.044345517,-0.021360977000000003,0.027004715,-0.125376088,-0.064565103,0.031320094,0.029740096,-0.027272967000000002,0.03458619,-0.0586429,-0.002656506,-0.025331812999999998,-0.024426652000000004,0.05395039,-0.019408303999999998,0.041396284,-0.0017259489999999998,-0.041263682999999995,-0.025302601,-0.057897517999999995,0.020508046000000002,-0.045923729,0.030080925,-0.016598913,-0.00512236,-0.031965379,0.018319747,0.02858699,0.049780028,-0.015333081
2,Effect of sulfhydryl reagents on the infectivity of vesicular stomatitis virus,"Abstract The infectivity of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was moderately affected by iodoacetic acid and drastically affected by N-ethylmaleimide; the antiviral effect of these sulfhydryl reagents was enhanced somewhat by the reducing agent, 2-mercaptoethanol. Reducing and/or alkylating reagents did not affect VSV hemagglutination and the impermeable sulfhydryl reagent, dextran-maleimide, did not significantly influence VSV infectivity. These data indicate that glycoprotein spikes are not the major sites for the antiviral activity of sulfhydryl reagents. [14C]Iodoacetic acid was able to penetrate the virion membrane to bind covalently to the free sulfhydryl groups of all five virion proteins, particularly the reduced disulfides of the L protein. The RNA polymerase activity of intact VSV was inhibited by iodoacetic acid and to a greater extent by N-ethylmaleimide, which probably accounts for the loss of viral infectivity caused by the permeable sulfhydryl reagents.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.094380804,-0.038752156,-0.011736723000000001,-0.032672231,-0.07207058400000001,0.033810124,0.027868141000000003,-0.0065271140000000005,0.01955449,-0.0029399720000000003,-0.015458366999999999,0.007957261,-0.009747661999999999,-0.007828309,0.001412066,-0.001094659,0.010762767,0.021109327999999997,0.020056621,0.029231012,-0.023922614,-0.0065813,-0.00569754,-0.027449685,0.038206306,0.04441679900000001,-0.005336041999999999,-0.009797959,-0.022687842000000003,0.042103443
17,Comparison of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the S genes specified by virulent and avirulent strains of bovine coronaviruses,"Abstract The entire nucleotide sequences of the spike glycoprotein (S) genes of the highly virulent bovine coronavirus (BCV) strain BCV-LY138, the avirulent BCV-L9 and related Norden Vaccine (BCV-Vaccine) strains were determined using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify cDNAs obtained by reverse transcription of viral RNA, and to produce single strand cDNAs for DNA sequencing. The S gene sequences of these viral strains were compared with those of recently published strains BCV-Mebus, BCV-Quebec, and BCV-F15. An open reading frame of 4092 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 1363 amino acid residues, was found in all six strains. Frameshifts and insertions or deletions were not observed except for the BCV-Fl 5. The S gene sequences were more than 98% conserved overall inspite of different origins of the six viruses. There were 45 to 56 nt differences between the virulent and avirulent groups while there were 6 to 14 nt differences among four avirulent strains. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences indicated that the S proteins had typical properties of membrane glycoproteins. Nineteen Winked glycosylation sites were predicted in five strains, and 18 of them were conserved in the avirulent strain BCV-L9. The sequence KRRSRR at the predicted proteolytic cleavage site was identified in five strains while the sequence KRRSVR was found in BCV-Fl 5. Substitutions of few amino acids in the putative fusogenic domains and two prolines at 507 and 567 in the antigenic domains may cause altered immunogenic and other functional properties of the S proteins specified by the virulent and avirulent BCV strains. Nine amino acid substitutions between the virulent and avirulent groups may correlate with BCV virulence.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.10631355699999999,-0.032680646,0.030901672999999998,-0.075888234,0.104969035,0.01781532,-0.073783505,-0.012526331000000002,0.016253757,-0.002453059,-0.04020251,0.052796249,0.0027003409999999998,-0.097393539,-0.021939531,-0.071937878,0.016251186,0.009550608,-0.001875271,0.006556040999999999,0.03172982,-0.003265455,-0.014860678,0.045449942,0.041221682999999995,-0.00581965,0.008688405,-0.03353443,-0.027315969,0.044668012
26,Human coronavirus gene expression in the brains of multiple sclerosis patients,"Abstract Total RNA extracted from both white and gray matter of brain tissue from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and controls was analyzed using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for the presence of the nucleic acid of human coronavirus (HCV) 229E and OC43, the two strains characterized to date and associated with respiratory infections. HCV-229E viral RNA was detectable in the central nervous system tissue of 4 of 11 MS patients and in none of 6 neurological and 5 normal controls. No HCV-OC43 nucleic acid was detected in any of the specimens. These results suggest a neurotropism on the part of the 229E strain of human coronavirus and underline the importance of further studies on its tissue distribution. The fact that it was detected only in tissue from MS patients illustrates the need for continued studies on the possible role of coronaviruses in the etiology of MS.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.013921043999999999,-0.016927618999999998,-0.032769435,-0.035096973,0.023928064,-0.053203019000000004,0.008225488000000001,0.011054156,-0.017560094,0.046894005999999995,-0.019616916,0.127353172,0.13036192800000002,0.077440619,-0.026846887000000003,-0.030349102000000003,0.012710388999999999,0.14432289,0.162890574,-0.060792399000000004,-0.031756124,-0.051274615999999995,0.065301488,0.036708334,-0.026803172000000004,-0.063875784,-0.068938346,0.065558178,-0.095704724,-0.028456807999999997
31,Prevalence of group A and group B rotaviruses in the feces of neonatal dairy calves from California,"Abstract 136 fecal samples, collected from 47 dairy calves on a calf ranch and in a dairy herd in California, were tested for the presence of group A and group B rotaviruses by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Samples were collected from each calf at days 1, 7 and 14. Within the 14 day period, 44 calves (94%) were positive for group A rotavirus and an unexpectedly high number of calves (38 calves, 81%) were positive for group B rotavirus. When these samples were examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), rotavirus was found in 21 calves and all of them had group A electropherotype. Among 25 PAGE positive samples from 21 calves, 17 (68%) were of short electropherotype, 4 (28%) were of long electropherotype and 4 (28%) contained both short and long electropherotype rotaviruses.

32,"Cloning, expression and characterization of biologically active feline tumour necrosis factor-α","Abstract We report the cloning, expression and characterization of biologically active feline tumour necrosis factor-α (fTNF-α). Messenger RNA was extracted from feline peritoneal macrophage cultures and used to synthesize cDNA for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The PCR products were cloned into the plasmid vector pCRII and sequenced, showing 99.3% homology with a published fTNF-α gene sequence. Subcloning into the vector pGEX-2T and subsequent expression resulted in a 43 kDa fusion protein of fTNF-α and glutathione S-transferase (GST). Thrombin cleavage of the fusion protein yielded a 17 kDa protein. This protein cross-reacted with a monoclonal anti-human TNF-α antibody in Western blotting, but not with a polyclonal anti-murine TNF-α serum. Recombinant fTNF-α (rfTNF-α) and rfTNF-α-GST had a CD50 of 15 ng ml−1 and 230 ng ml−1, respectively, in the L929 cytotoxicity assay. Cats given rfTNF-α-GST intravenously manifested the typical biological effects of TNF-α, including fever, depression, and piloerection. The rfTNF-α-GST upregulated IL-2 receptor and MHC-II antigen expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated in vitro, but had no effect on TNF-α receptor and MHC-I antigen expression.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.10951843300000001,-0.019823926000000002,0.051445112,-0.13051759,-0.053007795,0.009038312,-0.041858919,-0.054972587999999996,0.052864947999999995,-0.11081800300000001,0.001713343,-0.081751264,0.06754748299999999,0.040480542,-0.081019533,-0.081767054,0.066281388,-0.029856799,0.01384242,-0.023609934,0.012517123,-0.009412935,0.09340166800000001,-0.022820627000000003,-0.024040502000000002,0.083370057,0.051405929,0.003915842,-0.009941090999999999,0.022089364
37,Genic amplification of the entire coding region of the HEF RNA segment of influenza C virus,"Abstract In order to provide an easy and powerful analysis of influenza C viral HEF RNA segment of a recent strain, a combination of reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction was used. We amplified the entire coding region of the HEF gene of a laboratory strain of virus called C/Johannesburg/1/66, widely used for binding and esterase activity studies as well as that of a strain isolated in 1991 (C/Paris/145/91) from a patient suffering from severe flu syndrome. The sequences we amplified were about 2 kilobases long. In this work, we show that the forward ‘universal primer’ Unil, which has been used for influenza A and B viruses cDNA syntheses can also be used for influenza C virus. The PCR primers were designed to contain restriction sites to make the PCR products ready to be used for further purposes. A restriction analysis of the PCR products combined with analyses of all the human influenza C virus HEF gene sequences published so far permitted the design of sets of oligonucleotides which can prime PCR on cDNA of unknown influenza C virus for cloning.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.010420806999999999,-0.03885692,0.06681090099999999,0.154216993,0.07280442,0.195312083,-0.194910198,-0.024743152999999997,-0.017295238,-0.016473491,-0.01474011,-0.023969681,0.057033092,-0.004345164,0.0006770169999999999,-0.040252529,0.021969575,0.003814244,-0.023108449,-0.060102288,0.031032979,0.032235297,0.059559645999999994,0.029333945,-0.019286392,-0.01994717,0.006424981999999999,-0.023760884,-0.028819047,0.112611412
43,The membrane glycoprotein G1 of Uukuniemi virus contains a signal for localization to the Golgi complex,"Abstract Members of the Bunyaviridae family acquire their envelopes by budding into the Golgi complex (GC). The accumulation of the membrane glycoproteins G1 and G2 in the GC probably determines the site of maturation. Here we have studied the intracellular transport and targeting to the GC of G1 and G2 of Uukuniemi virus, a member of the Phlebovirus genus, and report on their expression from cloned cDNAs either together or separately by using a T7 RNA polymerase-driven vaccinia virus expression system. When G1 and G2 were expressed together from a full-length cDNA as the p110 precursor, both proteins were localized to the Golgi complex, as evidenced by colocalization with the Golgi marker enzyme mannosidase II. Immunofluorescent staining indicated that G1 expressed alone also localized to the GC. However, pulse-chase experiments showed that G1 remained endoglycosidase H sensitive. G2 expressed alone remained associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). G2 could be rescued from the ER and transported to the GC by coexpression with G1 from separate mRNAs. Coexpression also increased the efficiency of G1 transport to the GC. With none of the constructs could the glycoproteins be observed on the cell surface. These results show that efficient export of G1 and G2 from the ER requires coexpression of both proteins, in conformity with our previous results showing that G1 and G2 from heterodimeric complexes in the ER. Since G1 expressed alone is retained in the GC, we conclude that G1 contains a retention signal for localization to the GC. G2 might thus become associated with the GC indirectly via its interaction with G1.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.079763263,-0.035533978,0.003542097,-0.07151101,-0.040164457,0.016780008,0.006706599000000001,-0.011822157,0.021681488999999998,-0.039116608,-0.032665521,0.003463874,-0.020327315,0.008465106,0.003262357,0.011705578999999999,0.019285963,-0.036567691,-0.013556658999999999,-0.007302108000000001,0.000593445,0.00038587800000000003,-0.006857839,-0.037830199,0.01693801,0.014316785,-0.021958002,0.015509385,-0.018498662,-0.01166525
44,Cloning and sequencing of a 8.4-kb region from the 3′-end of a Taiwanese virulent isolate of the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus,"Abstract The nucleotide sequence (8396 nucleotides) was determined, from the 3′-end of the putative polymerase gene to the poly(A) tail, for a Taiwanese virulent isolate, TFI, of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). The TFI nucleotide sequence had very high identity to the British virulent field isolate FS772/70 (98.3%), the attenuated Purdue 115 (96.7%) and from the S gene to ORF-4 gene region, to the low passaged virulent Miller (98.3%) strains of TGEV. Comparison of the TFI S protein sequence with those determined from other TGEV strains and those of the TGEV variant, porcine respiratory coronavirus, isolated from Europe and North America showed that they had changed very little over a period of 4 decades. The two extra amino acids found to be present in the spike proteins of the virulent FS772/70 and Miller strains when compared to the avirulent Purdue strain were found to be present in the TFI strain.

48,Mapping of a region of dengue virus type-2 glycoprotein required for binding by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody,"Abstract Envelope glycoprotein E of flaviviruses is exposed at the surface of the virion, and is responsible for eliciting a neutralizing antibody (Ab) response, as well as protective immunity in the host. In this report, we describe a method for the fine mapping of a linear sequence of the E protein of dengue virus type-2 (DEN-2), recognized by a type-specific and neutralizing monoclonal Ab (mAb), 3H5. First, an Escherichia coli expression vector containing a heat-inducible λ p l promoter was used to synthesize several truncated, and near-full length E polypeptides. Reactivities of these polypeptides with polyclonal mouse hyperimmune sera, as well as the 3H5 mAb revealed the location of the 3H5-binding site to be within a region of 166 amino acids (aa) between aa 255 and 422. For fine mapping, a series of targeted deletions were made inframe within this region using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The hydrophilicity pattern of this region was used as a guide to systematically delete the regions encoding the various groups of surface aa residues within the context of a near-full-length E polypeptide by using PCR. The 3H5-binding site was thus precisely mapped to a region encoding 12 aa (between aa 386 and 397). A synthetic peptide containing this sequence was able to bind to the 3H5 mAb specifically, as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, we show that rabbit Abs raised against the synthetic peptide of 12 aa were able to bind to the authentic E protein, and to neutralize DEN-2 virus in a plaque reduction assay.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.099592209,-0.019761337,0.042785163,-0.053080864000000005,0.004939291,0.002338355,-0.052005931,-0.024662051,0.028962052000000002,-0.05045278,-0.059306934000000006,0.00780268,0.00685404,-0.050393169,-0.019230095,-0.060691565999999995,0.038374354,-0.020374097,-0.011716675,-0.014561667,0.029711741,-0.019672026000000002,0.037813111,0.005865104,0.028651166000000002,0.05705303900000001,0.029642816000000002,-0.034900165,-0.01802985,0.030759678
51,Serological and genotypic characterization of group a rotavirus reassortants from diarrheic calves born to dams vaccinated against rotavirus,"Abstract Two strains of bovine rotavirus (BRV), designated strain Nebraska Scottsbluff-1 (NS-1) and NS-2, were isolated from 2 neighboring cow-calf beef cattle ranches where dams had been vaccinated with a commercial vaccine containing group A BRV strain Neonatal Calf Diarrhea Virus (NCDV)-Lincoln (P1:G6). Nothern blot by hybridizations using whole genomic RNA probes indicated that strains NS-1 and NS-2 had identical group A RNA electrophoretic patterns and were homologous at all gene segments. Strain NS-1 was compared with reference group A BRV strains using serological and genotypic methods. In vitro virus neutralization assays indicated that strain NS-1 was neutralized by a G6-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) and guinea pig hyperimmune serum (GPHS) raised against BRV strain B641 (P5:G6), but not by G10-specific neutralizing mAb or GPHS raised against BRV strain BRV strain B223 (P11:G10). Nucleic acid hybridization experiments using whole-genomic RNA probes revealed that gene segment 4 of strain NS-1 differed from BRV strains NCDV-Lincoln and B223, but hybridized with strain B641. Conversely, gene segment 5 of strain NS-1 hybridized with BRV strain B223, but not with BRV strains NCDV-Lincoln and B641. A G-specific cDNA probe produced by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of strain NS-1 hybridized specifically only with G6 strains NCDV-Lincoln and B641, but not with G10 strain B223. Co-electrophoresis experiments using strains NS-1, B641, and B223 further confirmed these results, suggesting that strain NS-1 was a naturally-occurring reassortant BRV between strains B641 and B223. Taken together these results indicated that a naturally-occurring group A BRV reassortant with a P gene different from the vaccine virus was responsible for the diarrheal syndrome observed on both ranches. Results from this study also indicate the existence of at least 2 different gene segments 5 among group A BRV infecting cattle.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.068505688,-0.013161708000000001,0.061942534,-0.085840128,0.073825773,0.037362398,-0.055682239,-0.023861926000000002,0.013069592,0.00091406,0.006024098,0.049485466,-0.033032897,-0.02309262,0.026669272,-0.023263347,-0.026513875,0.008583816999999999,0.008082585,0.0013248589999999998,0.045341890999999995,-0.008728468,0.003413822,0.034420076,0.048503002,-0.02696089,-0.003631485,-0.032060825,-0.047106313,0.071180715
52,Detection of feline coronaviruses in cell cultures and in fresh and fixed feline tissues using polymerase chain reaction,"Abstract Feline coronavirus infections in cell cultures and in fresh and fixed feline tissues were detected using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Cell cultures were inoculated with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), feline enteric coronavirus (FECV)_or sham inoculum. The tissue samples of liver, kidney and spleen were taken from specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cats that were inoculated intranasally with 103 TCID50 of FIPV 79-1146 (n = 10), FIPV UCD1 (n = 3) or sham inoculum (n = 3), from clinical cats (n = 43), and from formalin-fixed archived feline tissues (n = 49), respectively. Additional tissue samples were taken from the FIPV-inoculated cats (n = 6) and were kept at 4°C, room temperatures (20–24°C) and 37°C respectively for 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours before frozen (−70°C) for PCR to evaluate the effects of the ambient temperatures and post-mortem intervals on the test. The samples were also fixed in 10% neutrally buffered formalin, 95% ethanol, and Bouin's solution respectively to evaluate the effects of the fixatives on the test. Positive PCR results were obtained from the cell cultures that were inoculated with FIPV and FECV and from the FIPV-inoculated cats (13/13). Negative PCR results were obtained from the sham-inoculated cell cultures and cats (3/3). Of the 92 clinical cats, 7 of the 8 FIP-suspected cats (87.5%) and 51 of the 84 non-FIP-suspected cats (60.7%) were shown to be virus-positive in at least one of the tissue samples. There was no significant difference in the PCR results between the fresh and the formalin-fixed tissues of the clinical cats (P > 0.05). Of the FIPV inoculated cats, the virus was detectable equally well in fresh and formalin-, Bouin's solution- or ethanol-fixedtissues. However, the amounts of total RNA extracted from the fixed tissues were significantly less than those from fresh tissues (P < 0.01). In tissues that were kept at 4°C, the virus was detectable up to 96 h; at room temperatures, up to 48 h; and at 37°C, up to 24 h, respectively.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.00477513,-0.0034487479999999997,0.092071919,-0.172309195,0.010302248,0.024655585,0.007143079,-0.017585599,-0.044931955999999995,-0.128616445,0.363366271,-0.127687875,0.164872316,0.002396244,-0.064326717,-0.036024071,0.047420222000000005,-0.014024271000000001,0.031239278,0.037803187,-0.034816595,-0.015663121999999998,0.074545301,-0.006463666,-0.038583816,0.039385282,-0.008177911,0.019095621,-0.005607310999999999,-0.029553097
54,Expression of nitric oxide synthase type II in the spinal cord under conditions producing thermal hyperalgesia,"Abstract There is evidence supporting spinal cord nitric oxide (NO) production in the mechanisms underlying hyperalgesia, presumed to arise from the activity of neuronal nitric oxide synthase type I (NOS I). Intrathecal administration of interleukin-1β and interferon-γ to rats results in a thermal hyperalgesia which peaks at 2 h post-injection but which is undetectable 8 h post-injection. Expression of mRNA for nitric oxide synthase type II (NOS II) was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction followed by Southern hybridization utilizing specific oligonucleotides in spinal cord tissue from animals 4 h and 8 h after cytokine injection, but not at longer time points. NOS II protein was detected in soluble fractions of spinal cords from animals 4 h and 8 h after cytokine injection. In situ hybridization for NOS II mRNA revealed positive cells bilaterally in the spinal cord 4 h after cytokine injection in a perivascular distribution and scattered throughout the gray and white matter. Immunohistochemistry for NOS II showed a similar distribution which could only be partially accounted for by macrophages/microglia. These results provide evidence for induction of NOS II expression under conditions producing thermal hyperalgesia and suggest a possible role in this behavior for the production of NO by a variety of cell types in the CNS.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.067139663,-0.029139977999999997,0.019124174,-0.117773765,-0.054783755,0.035306741,0.012851316000000002,-0.03635955,0.038267145,-0.049511609000000005,-0.024574956000000002,-0.023818466,-0.013418978,0.07080890599999999,0.0031813220000000003,0.01037243,-0.01227806,-0.05872345599999999,-0.049248694,-0.034917066000000004,0.032299907999999995,-0.005223193,0.010702395,-0.001514363,0.001339551,-0.045209980999999996,-0.029753118999999998,0.045365555999999994,0.033081652,-0.031756666
56,Viruses that multiply in the gut and cause endemic and epidemic gastroenteritis,"Abstract Background: Acute infectious diarrhea in young children is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Even in developed countries, infectious enteritis is second only to respiratory infections as a cause of morbidity in early childhood. Objective: To nominate the various viral agents that cause enteritis, discuss the pathogenesis, clinical features, epidemiology and diagnostic procedures employed. Study design: Pertinent literature was reviewed and the findings of investigations carried out on viral enteritis by various colleagues recalled. Results: The viruses causing gastroenteritis include: Rotaviruses; Adenoviruses-especially Ad 31, Ad 40 and Ad 41; members of the Caliciviridae, e.g. Norwalk virus, Hawaii virus, Snow Mountain virus, Taunton virus, Southampton virus, Toronto virus (formerly mini-reovirus) and others; Astrovirus; Coronavirus; Torovirus; Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and possibly Picobirnavirus. Enteritis-producing viruses replicate in columar epithelial cells in the distal parts of villi of the small intestine. Two mechanisms are addressed to explain why diarrhea occurs. Clinically, the main expression of illness is a watery diarrhea that lasts 24 h to about 7 days. Vomiting is of shorter duration and may not always accompany the diarrhea. Fever is generally ⩽ 38.5°C. Virus is shed in the stool for about 3–7 days. Diagnostic procedures employ electron microscopy (EM), immune electron microscopy (IEM), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA), latex agglutination, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Conclusion: In developed countries viral enteritis among young children may be up to three times more common than bacterial gut disease. With the exception of CMV enteric involvement, the stool is characteristically not bloody and white blood cells are not found. Patient management may involve the employment of IV replacement therapy to counter dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Milder cases may be managed with oral rehydration.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.051705586,-0.034695017,0.0223545,-0.030066474,-0.025770994,0.003364414,0.041533567,-0.033491833,0.023547243,0.04123493,0.01765969,-0.043226604,0.008931561,-0.002109574,0.092168734,-0.034092254,-0.012672973999999998,-0.00349013,-0.009795501,0.016057899,-0.01092142,0.050572794000000004,-0.044848023,0.009479663000000001,0.001428135,0.008411629,0.022204689,-0.040131856,-0.028527725,-0.027700368
60,13 General Mechanisms of Antiviral Resistance,"This review explores the broad mechanisms of virus resistance. This will go beyond the generally accepted concept of antiviral resistance by summarizing those evolutionary outcomes that have enabled human viruses to resist mankind’s best efforts at control. The review then focuses on how viruses acquire resistance to compounds that specifically target a virus protein (e.g., polymerase, protease, integrase, sialidase). All viruses have a principle mechanism of acquiring resistance, random point mutations. Those viruses, which have segmented genomes, have an additional mechanism, genetic reassortment. For antiviral compounds that target a key virus enzyme, there is usually a stepwise evolution of resistance. For the therapy of chronic viral infections, such as HIV, the concept of increasing the genetic barrier has been important for optimizing drug combinations for effectively delaying the appearance of resistance. In some cases, the price to the virus for gaining resistance may be reduced “fitness” but there may also be other unexpected effects. Conceptually, one way to avoid virus resistance is to use a compound to target a host protein rather than a viral protein. Such an approach seems to risk causing unacceptable toxicity, however, some instances have been identified where there can be specificity for the virus-infected cell. We end by asking the question, how will viruses respond to such an indirect challenge?",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.067221407,-0.063574813,-0.025022641,0.057581292,-0.083293588,0.113754984,0.10016227800000001,-0.011335983,0.027304926,0.08469487,-0.020962522,-0.015721892,0.05888513099999999,-0.03111838,0.026606779,-0.042738735,-0.024655171,0.048257484,0.014347317,0.059566416,0.004936038,0.02459092,-0.025211705,0.118730683,-0.014858248000000001,0.043262472999999996,0.09479838199999999,-0.09405747699999999,0.000163174,-0.013881649
61,Chapter fifteen Enzymatic Assembly of Overlapping DNA Fragments,"Abstract Three methods for assembling multiple, overlapping DNA molecules are described. Each method shares the same basic approach: (i) an exonuclease removes nucleotides from the ends of double-stranded (ds) DNA molecules, exposing complementary single-stranded (ss) DNA overhangs that are specifically annealed; (ii) the ssDNA gaps of the joined molecules are filled in by DNA polymerase, and the nicks are covalently sealed by DNA ligase. The first method employs the 3′-exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase (T4 pol), Taq DNA polymerase (Taq pol), and Taq DNA ligase (Taq lig) in a two-step thermocycled reaction. The second method uses 3′-exonuclease III (ExoIII), antibody-bound Taq pol, and Taq lig in a one-step thermocycled reaction. The third method employs 5′-T5 exonuclease, Phusion® DNA polymerase, and Taq lig in a one-step isothermal reaction and can be used to assemble both ssDNA and dsDNA. These assembly methods can be used to seamlessly construct synthetic and natural genes, genetic pathways, and entire genomes and could be very useful for molecular engineering tools.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.075320342,-0.006247841,0.08195991400000001,-0.029556727999999997,-0.06344557099999999,0.002045883,0.04305443900000001,-0.005507051999999999,0.009109359000000001,-0.011864781999999999,-0.036723376,-0.000408206,0.024859917999999998,-0.045114212,-0.021877478,0.055729192999999996,-0.036440158,-0.034431875,-0.048528176,-0.031469051,-0.025360177,-0.0046934559999999995,-0.006914411,0.008415750999999999,-0.0259598,-0.07179308,-0.09142035400000001,0.058686529,-0.025447412000000003,0.0026818640000000004
62,Principles of Diagnosis of Infectious Diseases,"Abstract Infectious diseases are diagnosed by detection of a bacterium, virus, fungus, protozoan, or helminth in a patient with a compatible clinical illness. The methods of detection include cultivation of bacteria and fungi on growth medium, isolation of viruses in cell culture, and identification of the agent biochemically, antigenically, or genetically. Infectious diseases can also be identified by detection of a specific immune response, usually antibodies, that develop during the course of illness. Visualization of an agent in infected tissue can provide a diagnosis based on specific morphological characteristics or identify the category of organism, for example, gram-positive or gram-negative bacterium or virus (e.g., eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in neurons in rabies virus infection). Methods that detect and allow visualization of antigens (immunohistochemistry) or nucleic acid sequences (in situ hybridization) provide more specific diagnoses. Detection of specific nucleic acid sequences amplified by polymerase chain reaction is a powerful molecular diagnostic tool. Since the elucidation of the etiology of the first infectious disease, anthrax, more than 135 years ago, Koch's postulates have been applied and modified as novel technologies and agents have emerged. During the last 45 years, more than 70 previously unknown agents of infections have been identified in emerging infectious diseases, a phenomenon that is likely to continue.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.037088893,0.003366553,0.10801225199999999,-0.013917398999999999,-0.030380618999999998,0.028856147999999998,0.03886802,-0.007218967,0.006841435,0.127079376,-0.023739932999999998,-0.056873148,0.103955021,-0.087053296,0.042528473,-0.015798354,-0.044736385,0.021908099,-0.061837561,-0.005381080999999999,-0.022683122000000003,-0.030425009,0.026410249,-0.07159179,0.020013148999999997,-0.008727449,-0.028613007000000003,0.008465849000000001,-0.083664977,0.036881501000000004
64,Chapter 12 Synthesis,"Abstract The preceding chapters have described in detail specific examples of viruses that have emerged or re-emerged from animal sources. Most, although not all, are zoonotic and have caused significant human morbidity and mortality. This final chapter will attempt to bring together a number of the common themes raised by these examples. These include the role of historical events in shaping the emergence of viruses in the present, the ability to retrospectively test samples to trace the emergence of disease and the technologies used to detect viruses. Technologies such as the polymerase chain reaction and mass sequencing have revolutionized virus detection and enabled the rapid identification and characterization of viruses. The application of these methods has led to the identification of new groups of viruses in samples obtained from a range of animal species without the need for invasive sampling or the recovery of live virus. However, with the detection of such a large range of viruses that exist asymptomatically with other species, the challenge now becomes the identification of those with the potential to become pathogenic for humans.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.021973619,-0.009749675,0.069976442,0.060769853,0.055360848,0.06326855099999999,0.12522846599999998,0.029446522000000003,-0.03627862,0.105827299,-0.037509926,-0.038431692,0.074294995,-0.043276655,0.05502043400000001,-0.0190675,-0.034150749,-0.021572864,-0.033081819,0.0056961040000000004,0.021069828999999998,-0.005333197,-0.017919466999999998,0.046053054,-0.04094309,-0.013212521000000001,-0.009765386,-0.038827018,-0.04569176,-0.056375447
66,Chapter 34 Antiviral Drugs,"Abstract Viruses are major pathogenic agents causing a variety of serious diseases in humans, other animals, and plants. Drugs that combat viral infections are called antiviral drugs. There are no effective antiviral drugs for many viral infections. However, there are several drugs for influenza, a couple of drugs for herpesviruses, and some new antiviral drugs for treatment of HIV and hepatitis C infections. The arsenal of antivirals is complex. As of March 2014, it consists of approximately 50 drugs approved by the FDA, approximately half of which are directed against HIV. Antiviral drug creation strategies are focused on two different approaches: targeting the viruses themselves or targeting host cell factors. Direct virus-targeting antiviral drugs include attachment inhibitors, entry inhibitors, uncoating inhibitors, protease inhibitors, polymerase inhibitors, nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, and integrase inhibitors. Protease inhibitors (darunavir, atazanavir, and ritonavir), viral DNA polymerase inhibitors (acyclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, and tenofovir), and an integrase inhibitor (raltegravir) are included in the list of Top 200 Drugs by sales for the 2010s.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.05141869,-0.040697582999999996,-0.039529708,0.046442607000000004,-0.136618148,0.17646373399999998,0.116578445,-0.018350547,0.064678873,0.06468660700000001,0.014133155,0.044958927,0.064678238,-0.031441788,0.018224224,-0.034362233,-0.034509577,0.217905097,0.113513644,0.044977820999999994,-0.020940842,0.048394877,-0.089018999,0.134950342,0.069025726,0.001394969,0.062218997000000005,-0.093106179,0.168540125,0.029835515
68,Chapter 7 Long-Term Virus Evolution in Nature,"Abstract Viruses spread to give rise to epidemics and pandemics, and some key parameters that include virus and host population numbers determine virus persistence or extinction in nature. Viruses evolve at different rates of evolution depending on the polymerase copying fidelity during genome replication. Calculated rates of evolution in nature vary depending on the time interval between virus isolations. In particular, intra-host evolution is generally more rapid that inter-host evolution and several possible mechanisms for this difference are considered. The mechanisms by which the error-prone viruses evolve render very unlikely the operation of a molecular clock (constant rate of incorporation of mutations in the evolving genomes). Several computational methods are reviewed that permit the alignment of viral sequences and the establishment of phylogenetic relationships among viruses. The evolution of virus in the form of dynamic mutant clouds in each infected individual, together with multiple environmental influences, render the emergence and reemergence of viral pathogens an unpredictable event, another example of biological complexity.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.063308688,-0.064438629,-0.016544358999999998,0.058290373,0.018515135,0.061482214,0.109269483,0.017294063999999998,-0.03252211,0.096791345,0.02438527,-0.018377716000000002,0.025315896,-0.008019345,0.040128422000000004,0.008314304,-0.03509734,-0.065485801,-0.067232603,0.039924558,0.048403204000000005,-0.016148651,-0.049301283,0.10542575,-0.108164913,-0.012178665,0.092243823,-0.05265543,-0.09578058800000001,-0.083927136

Polymerase chain reaction for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral infections has led to a better understanding of the epidemiology and impact of many common respiratory viruses and resulted in better patient care.

75,Chapter 12 CSF in acute and chronic infectious diseases,"Abstract Infections of the nervous system are an important and challenging aspect of clinical neurology. Immediate correct diagnosis enables to introduce effective therapy, in conditions that without diagnosis may leave the patient with severe neurological incapacitation and sometimes even death. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a mirror that reflects nervous system pathology and can promote early diagnosis and therapy. The present chapter focuses on the CSF findings in neuro-infections, mainly viral and bacterial. Opening pressure, protein and glucose levels, presence of cells and type of the cellular reaction should be monitored. Other tests can also shed light on the causative agent: serology, culture, staining, molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction. Specific examination such as panbacterial and panfungal examinations should be examined when relevant. Our chapter is a guide-text that combines clinical presentation and course with CSF findings as a usuaful tool in diagnosis of neuroinfections.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.011008727,-0.003802054,0.031712667,-0.080081254,-0.095335282,0.018462817,0.04779769,-0.007019610999999999,0.005144395,0.05171309599999999,-0.004387052,-0.042236435,0.072587158,-0.039171469,0.026983458,-0.003444395,-0.009127553,0.039093212999999995,-0.044683245999999996,0.000380166,0.006287439000000001,-0.006567278,-0.0029923809999999997,-0.060471014000000003,0.045998502000000004,-0.009200940999999999,-0.021628288,-0.020658028999999998,-0.019315841,0.025477684
77,Chapter 3 Infectious Bronchitis Virus in Poultry: Molecular Epidemiology and Factors Leading to the Emergence and Reemergence of Novel Strains of Infectious Bronchitis Virus,"Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a coronavirus that causes an acute and highly contagious disease in chickens. The virus can cause substantial economic losses throughout the poultry industry worldwide. It can affect the upper respiratory tract and the reproductive tract, and some strains can cause nephritis. The causative agent IBV is an RNA virus with great ability for mutation and recombination, thus capable of generating new virus strains that are difficult to control. There are many IBV strains found worldwide, including the Massachusetts, 4/91, D274, and QX-like strains that can be grouped under the classic or variant serotypes. In addition, new types of the virus continue to arise due to mutations and recombination events in the viral genome and even more factors, making this virus difficult to identify and extremely difficult to control. Surveillance and identification of IBV types are extremely important for control of the disease and the advancement of molecular methods has aided in this pursuit. Genetic typing of IBV, which involves reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequence analysis of the S1 glycoprotein gene, has revolutionized diagnosis and identification of this virus by making it possible to type and compare the relatedness of a large number of virus isolates in a short period of time. Several conventional and molecular diagnostic methods have been described for the diagnosis of IB in chickens. “All-in/all-out” operations of rearing along with good biosafety measures form the basis of prevention, whereas vaccination forms the backbone of IB control program. Both live and inactivated (oil emulsified) conventional vaccines are available. The new generation vaccines (recombinant and vector-based) developed against locally prevailing IBV strains may be more helpful and avoid the reversion of virulence in live vaccine viruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.03713731,-0.022973714,0.105798467,-0.036653786,0.17247520000000002,0.106255886,-0.131707462,-0.09750888099999999,0.11704911,0.384708451,0.073704117,0.01861486,-0.021206626,-0.021107981,-0.079408957,0.11782260900000001,-0.044468984,0.01445412,-0.017474019,0.08992621,-0.003100918,-0.053225182999999995,0.014457142,-0.008370527,-0.001938769,-0.00049712,0.02468298,-0.00124571,-0.016398027,0.003486735
79,Chapter 7 Long-term virus evolution in nature,"Abstract Viruses spread to give rise to epidemics and pandemics, and some key parameters that include virus and host population numbers determine virus persistence or extinction in nature. Viruses evolve at different rates depending on the polymerase copying fidelity during genome replication and a number of environmental influences. Calculated rates of evolution in nature vary depending on the time interval between virus isolations. In particular, intrahost evolution is generally more rapid that interhost evolution, and several possible mechanisms for this difference are considered. The mechanisms by which the error-prone viruses evolve are very unlikely to render the operation of a molecular clock (constant rate of incorporation of mutations in the evolving genomes), although a clock is assumed in many calculations. Several computational tools permit the alignment of viral sequences and the establishment of phylogenetic relationships among viruses. The evolution of the virus in the form of dynamic mutant clouds in each infected individual, together with multiple environmental parameters renders the emergence and reemergence of viral pathogens an unpredictable event, another facet of biological complexity.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.057335751,-0.062252625,-0.010978092,0.054845832000000004,0.020248476,0.052433819000000007,0.09870522699999999,0.015893604,-0.031965965,0.093486101,0.025801499,-0.012774303,0.024479126,-0.019959422,0.046959067,0.006867614,-0.035562295,-0.061467985999999995,-0.064735883,0.033541206000000004,0.04989844,-0.022500465,-0.041807935,0.106271907,-0.10225180099999999,-0.003663204,0.08433533300000001,-0.047455033,-0.09509519400000001,-0.084849334
81,Chapter 19 Advances in structure-assisted antiviral discovery for animal viral diseases,"Abstract The latest advancements in drug development are structure-assisted and computer-aided identification, design, and synthesis of target-specific antiviral. Structural virology of animal viruses has made valuable contribution to our understanding of viruses in general, replication, evolution, and interaction with the host. Structure–function relation studies are definitely the need of the hour for rational design of drugs and vaccines to effectively treat animal viral diseases. These studies are important for economical, veterinary, and human medical perspectives. X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and cryo-electron microscopy techniques elaborate the structure–function relation studies by utilizing various computational approaches for structure-assisted designing of drug molecules and antiviral against viruses. Availability of protein three-dimensional structures, high-performance computing, data management software, and internet are enhancing the modern day drug discovery process. Computational tools offer the advantage of delivering new drug candidates more quickly and at a lower cost. Various viral proteins that are necessary for the survival of the virus inside the host are discussed in this chapter such as viral polymerase, helicase, protease, etc. Various antiviral drug molecules identified and designed on the basis of the structure of viral proteins which are highlighted, and disclosed details of the available inhibitors and potential antiviral are discussed. Further improvement in identified inhibitors, the need of novel structure-based drugs and their clinical testing is emphasized. This chapter describes briefly the structural techniques and advances made in animal virology toward structure-based identification and development of antiviral for treatment of animal viruses. In the future, the studies discussed may serve as the basis for development of potential antiviral against animal viral diseases.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.097527599,-0.03444845,-0.029289443,0.07278437900000001,-0.13053032,0.100806016,0.144754508,-0.002957488,0.035281400000000004,0.108994454,-0.026661981,0.01653059,0.08221458200000001,-0.085772881,0.004267077,-0.060796620999999995,-0.014947868999999999,0.10799799,-0.012806211000000001,0.028806553999999998,-0.032589172,0.032712426,-0.086318713,0.050440026,0.031379111,-0.020613034,0.062603275,-0.08851130199999999,0.101925352,0.005844644
82,Chapter 19 Disease resistance for different livestock species,"Abstract This chapter deals with progress in disease resistance for the livestock population species-wise and describes the progress that occurred globally. Certain genes were identified for mastitis resistance and the strategies for genomic control of mastitis are discussed. Gene-edited tuberculosis-resistant cattle were developed for the first time with CRISPR/Cas 9 technology with NRAMP gene insert. Similarly studies are in progress for the development of trypanosomiasis-resistant cattle at ILRI. Genomic insights were discussed for disease resistance for goat against gastrointestinal nematode infestation, coccidiosis, peste des petits ruminants, and scrapie. Similarly genomic resistance was also discussed for sheep, discussing the mechanism of disease resistance with MHC, antibody and T cell response, cytokines, and receptors. Genes identified for bacterial diarrhoeal resistance as K88, F18 (an intestinal receptor) for resistance to bacterial infection in pig. Gene-edited pigs were developed against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and transmissible gastroenteritis caused by corona virus using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Insights on the omics technologies developed and studied were discussed for livestock species. Genomic control on various diseases of poultry is discussed as salmonellosis, avian influenza, Marek’s disease, Newcastle disease with advanced genomic and allied techniques for its control as RNA interference, flow cytometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, transcriptomics, etc. A new concept on natural antibodies was discussed.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.041739454,-0.010557212,0.04251863,-0.034705183,-0.021256512,0.094624105,0.030997008,-0.008825217,0.018247505,0.032767488,-0.049762034000000004,-0.017341906,0.037242257,-0.05513507,0.05059280000000001,-0.009381681999999999,-0.047282892,0.036092224,-0.023431692,0.019614123,0.004052101,-0.02116624,0.013882828,0.020808671,-0.031661304,-0.023532879,0.011980741000000001,-0.057191427999999996,0.046187940999999996,0.006563131
92,La sécurité virale des médicaments d’origine biologique,"Résumé Les crises sanitaires survenues dans les années 1980 ont dramatiquement contribué à la prise de conscience des risques iatrogènes liés aux médicaments d’origine biologique et, ainsi, au développement du concept de sécurité virale de ces médicaments, qu’ils soient d’origine humaine, avec notamment les médicaments dérivés du sang (MDS), animale ou issus des biotechnologies (produits par des cellules eucaryotes). La sécurité virale des médicaments repose sur trois éléments : la qualité de la matière première, le procédé de fabrication qui inclue des étapes aptes à éliminer ou à inactiver les virus et, éventuellement, les contrôles des produits intermédiaires ou finis. La qualité de la matière première est désormais aisément garantie, pour les MDS, par le screening des dons de sang ou de plasma (screening individuel ou en pool) pour les marqueurs directs (antigènes, génomes) et indirects (anticorps) de virus majeurs. La succession d’étapes de purification des principes actifs (étapes de partition), d’étapes d’inactivation des virus (traitement solvant–détergent, chauffage) et d’étapes dédiées spécifiquement à l’élimination des virus (nanofiltration) au cours du procédé de fabrication permet de réduire considérablement le risque viral. Cette réduction peut être estimée quantitativement lors des études de validation par épreuves de surcharge à échelle réduite. Les contrôles virologiques sur produits intermédiaires ou sur produits finis permettent de conforter la sécurité virale d’un médicament lorsque les contributions des deux premiers éléments, qualité de la matière première et procédé de fabrication, paraissent insuffisants. Le développement des principes et des techniques de sécurisation des médicaments d’origine biologique permet désormais de garantir au mieux l’absence d’infectiosité liée à des virus connus mais également, par anticipation, de garantir l’absence d’infectiosité liée à des virus inconnus. Summary The viral safety of biologicals, either human blood derivatives or animal products or recombinant proteins issued from biotechnology, relies on the quality of the starting material, the manufacturing process and, if necessary, the control of the final product. The quality of the starting material is highly guaranteed for blood derivatives due to the individual screening for specific markers (antigens, genome, antibodies) for major blood borne viruses such as hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It can be reinforced by the detection through amplification procedures (polymerase chain reaction) in the plasma pool of genomes from viruses that have been implicated in contaminations of blood derivatives in the past (parvovirus B19, hepatitis A virus). The association in the manufacturing process of different steps dedicated to purification of plasma proteins (partitioning), virus inactivation (solvent/detergent treatment, heat inactivation) or specific procedures allowing virus removal (nanofiltration) allows to reduce the viral risk very efficiently. The validation studies using scaled down systems and model viruses allow to evaluate the virus safety of any product quantitatively. The aim of these procedures is to guarantee the lack of infectivity due to any virus, either known or unknown.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.027276118999999998,-0.0471624,0.022643772000000003,-0.044276628,-0.03354469,0.02945294,0.051577526,-0.008866701,0.032103976,-0.0008725089999999999,-0.011393525,0.0096707,0.040360667999999995,-0.09564168,0.193567143,0.207875516,0.307469476,0.052564874000000004,-0.026989784,0.036922346,0.014282706000000001,0.054114703,0.06932967799999999,0.033314672000000004,-0.03324674,0.024796769,-0.01046418,-0.039071058,-0.039179942999999995,0.006602338
101,IL-27 Is Elevated in Patients With COPD and Patients With Pulmonary TB and Induces Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells to Produce CXCL10,"Background The role of IL-27 in the pathogenesis of airway inflammatory diseases remains elusive. We, therefore, have studied its concentrations in the sputum and plasma of patients with COPD and patients with pulmonary TB (PTB), and further investigated the mechanism-of-action effects of IL-27 on bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. Methods Human bronchial epithelial cells grown on air-liquid interface culture were activated by IL-27, alone, or in combination with other inflammatory cytokines in the presence or absence of various signaling molecule inhibitors. The expression of CXCL10 was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The underlying signaling pathways were studied by intracellular staining using flow cytometry, Western blot, ELISA, or siRNA. Results Significantly higher sputum and plasma concentrations of IL-27 were found in patients with COPD (n = 34; P < .01 and P < .001, respectively) or patients with PTB (n = 31; P < .01 and P < .001, respectively) than in healthy control subjects (n = 48). Sputum, but not plasma, IL-27 levels in patients with COPD correlated negatively with FEV1 (r = −0.51, P < .01). Sputum, but not plasma, IL-27 in patients with PTB correlated positively with mycobacterial load in sputum (r = 0.48, P < .05). Further in vitro studies demonstrated that IL-27 could induce gene and protein expression of CXCL10 in bronchial epithelial cells, which was regulated by the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway. Conclusions The production of IL-27 is related to the pathogenesis of COPD and PTB, and IL-27 induces the expression of CXCL10 in bronchial epithelial cells through the activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.000609729,-0.035415069,-0.024834261,-0.181772715,-0.11439169199999999,0.002634466,0.002152715,-0.00597518,-0.019623265,-0.037767358,-0.071812359,-0.035889432,-0.033915326,0.144686759,-0.067396033,0.019343904,0.01013645,-0.051166402,4.35e-05,-0.056152682,0.053508564,-0.085914,0.068826572,0.010514042,-0.047190007,-0.020861962,0.045812254000000004,0.045610494,0.017932658,-0.000561304
109,In vitro activity of cepharanthine hydrochloride against clinical wild-type and lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus isolates,"Abstract Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection causes major public health problems worldwide. The clinical limitation of current antiviral drugs for HBV, such as lamivudine, is the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains during prolonged antiviral therapy. Cepharanthine hydrochloride (CH), a natural alkaloid-derived compound, has been reported to possess potent activity against various viruses. The present study was performed to evaluate the in vitro activity of CH against clinical wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV isolates in transiently transfected cells. HBV DNA was extracted from serum samples collected both before lamivudine therapy and at the time of viral breakthrough and was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplicons were cloned into a novel expression vector, pHY106, which can initiate the intracellular HBV replication cycle after cell transfection. Following transfection of the cloned amplicon into HepG2 cells, a drug susceptibility assay was performed. The level of viral antigen, HBeAg, was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) was used for determining the amount of intracellular HBV DNA. Heat stress cognate 70 (Hsc70), a host protein required for HBV replication, was also analyzed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to explore the possible antiviral mechanism of CH. The results showed that CH inhibited replication and HBeAg production by either wild-type or lamivudine-resistant HBV clinical isolates in a dose-dependent manner. The Hsc70 mRNA was also downregulated significantly. In conclusion, CH is active against both wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV clinical isolates, and its activity may be associated with its inhibition of host Hsc70.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.063811572,-0.010053421,0.056546843,-0.032438639,-0.108429502,0.063714315,0.045388615,-0.031462778999999996,0.044501775,0.024696987000000004,8.83e-05,0.003037653,-0.017625636,0.092843546,0.004102352,-0.012503825,-0.014018842,0.070050851,0.056593684000000005,-0.030473144,0.043278639,0.052812277000000005,0.030031073999999998,0.044615902,0.011486545,0.014930571,0.049191382,-0.031310031,0.028879269,0.00991044
112,Orchitis in a Cat Associated with Coronavirus Infection,"Abstract A case of severe, pyogranulomatous and necrotizing orchitis in a cat, which later succumbed to systemic feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), is described. The 3·5-year-old cat, positive for feline immunodeficiency virus infection, presented with a left testicular enlargement. A few months after castration the animal was humanely destroyed due to declining health. Post-mortem examination revealed inflammatory lesions in abdominal organs and in the brain compatible with FIP. Infection was confirmed with a reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction test and by immunohistochemical demonstration of coronavirus antigen in the affected tissues, including the left testicle. FIP is usually a systemic disease. However, lesions and presenting clinical signs in a single organ system such as the brain are not uncommon.

114,Systemic Toxoplasmosis and Concurrent Porcine Circovirus-2 Infection in a Pig,"Summary Systemic toxoplasmosis and concurrent infection with porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2) was diagnosed in a fattening pig. Clinical examination of the herd showed that up to 30% of the pigs of this weight group suffered from severe respiratory signs including sneezing and coughing, with a mortality rate of up to 5%. Gross necropsy examination revealed severe interstitial pneumonia and generalized lymphadenopathy. On microscopical examination there was necrotizing inflammation of the lung, adrenal glands and lymph nodes, associated with lymphoid depletion, cytoplasmic basophilic botryoid inclusion bodies and protozoal microorganisms. Infection with Toxoplasma gondii was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Polymerase chain reaction analysis, in-situ hybridization and IHC confirmed systemic PCV-2 infection. These findings, associated with the respiratory signs and lesions in lymphoid tissues, are characteristic for post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). In this case, immunosuppression by PCV-2 may have triggered systemic toxoplasmosis, or immune stimulation caused by coinfection with T. gondii may have caused extensive replication of PCV-2.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.030071005,-0.00178517,-0.028906996,-0.136813016,-0.022373502000000003,0.030245442999999997,0.011510643000000001,-0.00069613,0.004072789,-0.015805483000000002,0.046525026,-0.011599068999999998,-0.011642978,0.010714333000000001,0.053801854,-0.029295408,-0.016029907,0.010987626,-0.038420548,0.052679881,-0.000237772,-0.011835842,-0.032136477000000004,-0.043727182,0.050301334,-0.016588039,-0.064422148,0.006743221999999999,-0.012658528999999998,-0.05384387
115,Rhinitis and Meningitis in Two Shelter Cats Caused by Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus,"Summary In the past 6 years there have been increasing reports describing outbreaks of a severe fatal respiratory disease associated with Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus (SEZ) in dogs maintained in shelters, research facilities and kennels. Although SEZ appears to be an emerging pathogen of dogs kept in intensively housed environments, this bacterium has not been reported as a cause of death in intensively housed cats. This report describes fatal SEZ infection in two adult cats housed in separate animal shelter facilities. Both cats had acute onset of illness, which progressed to death in less than 24h. Post-mortem examination revealed rhinitis and meningitis and SEZ was demonstrated in the nasal cavity and brain.

116,Pathology and Tissue Distribution of Turkey Coronavirus in Experimentally Infected Chicks and Turkey Poults,"Summary Twenty 1-day-old specific pathogen free chicks and 20 1-day-old commercially derived turkey poults were inoculated with a Brazilian strain of turkey coronavirus (TCoV) to study the pathogenicity and virus distribution up to 14 days post-inoculation by histopathology, immunohistochemistry, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. At 2–14 dpi, TCoV antigens were detected in the paranasal sinus and lachrymal accessory gland (Harderian gland) of infected chicks and in the ileum, ileocaecal junction and caecum of infected poults. Lymphocytic inflammation was present in these tissues. TCoV was re-isolated from pooled tissue suspensions of nasal concha, Harderian gland and paranasal sinus from chicks, as well as from the ileum, ileocaecal junction and caecum of poults, after three consecutive passages in 28-day-old embryonated turkey eggs. Viral RNA corresponding to the spike gene region (1178–2073 genome position) was amplified from the upper respiratory tract of chickens and from the intestinal tract of poults and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the identity as TCoV. This is the first description of TCoV antigens and mRNA in upper respiratory tissues in experimentally infected chickens.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.020022579,-0.023774392000000002,0.013510409,-0.09174347699999999,0.06054059,0.006363245,-0.05199096,-0.032060407,0.044028462000000004,0.035348332,0.028786334,-0.017872258000000002,-0.004907463,0.019990594,0.033710624,0.006297161,-0.003147707,-0.010460438,0.006991531,-0.005039897,-0.00678747,-0.020542802,-0.004147215,-0.022994401,0.01492503,0.005227967,-0.040279525,-0.010114434,0.0058631690000000005,0.006367363000000001
117,An Investigation of the Pathology and Pathogens Associated with Porcine Respiratory Disease Complex in Denmark,"Summary Respiratory infections are among the most important diseases of growing pigs. In order to elucidate the multifactorial aetiology of porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) in Denmark, lungs from 148 finishing pigs with cranioventral bronchopneumonia (case group) and 60 pigs without lung lesions (control group) were collected from abattoirs. The pathogens involved in PRDC and their interactions were identified and linked to the histopathological diagnosis. The lung samples were cultured for bacteria and tested by multiplex polymerase chain reaction for presence of swine influenza virus (type A), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (both European and US type), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), porcine respiratory coronavirus, porcine cytomegalovirus, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Mycoplasma hyorhinis. All cases had cranioventral lobular bronchopneumonia consistent with PRDC. There was a broad range of microscopical lesions and the cases were characterized as acute (n =10), subacute (n =24) or chronic (n =114) bronchopneumonia. Five bacterial species, five viruses and two Mycoplasma spp. were detected in different combinations. PCV2, M. hyopneumoniae, M. hyorhinis and Pasteurella multocida were detected most frequently among the PRDC affected swine and the diversity and number of pathogens were higher in these animals compared with controls. No clear-cut associations were detected between pathogens and histological lesions or histopathological diagnoses. PRDC occurs more frequently than enzootic pneumonia among Danish finishing pigs and has complex and varied histopathology.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.094706703,-0.039023084,0.000232229,-0.060537657,0.040994821,0.038895185,0.025749400000000002,0.0021223360000000003,-0.047082193,0.026204136,0.027646689,-0.007985923,-0.041276024,-0.003217318,0.159146512,-0.12056665,-0.011948103,-0.040967474,-0.00548812,0.077393157,-0.05277272,-0.008949558,0.046870272000000004,-0.027150335,0.064304248,0.004697192,-0.08196393099999999,0.021453147000000002,0.019205168,-0.098415029
118,A Histopathological Study of Bovine Ganglia,"Summary One hundred and sixty-eight ganglia from 54 cattle aged 10 days to 10 years were examined microscopically. Samples from six autonomic ganglia and one sensory ganglion were represented. Thirteen animals were clinically normal and 41 were submitted for post-mortem examination. Neuronal vacuolation, spheroid formation, lipofuscin accumulation and central chromatolysis were observed sporadically and were of varying magnitude. Neuronal vacuolation and spheroid formation were not age-related changes, while lipofuscin accumulation was more common in older animals and central chromatolysis was more common in younger cattle. Non-suppurative inflammation and neuronophagia were also common findings (23 out of 54 animals, 42.6%) in autonomic ganglia that did not contain herpesvirus DNA as determined by polymerase chain reaction. Renaut bodies, features of peripheral nerves, were most commonly noted in the vagus. None of the histopathological findings were related to any particular disease in which loss of autonomic nervous system function might be expected. Furthermore, all changes were as common in clinically normal animals as in animals with disease.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.0007703769999999999,-0.027616044,0.011001425,-0.110336539,-0.001186933,0.022958584,0.040049531,-0.013355853,-0.016019663,-0.028944896,0.028610956,0.002425534,-0.024479062000000003,-0.032948832000000004,0.014057193999999999,0.005696719,-0.027237228,-0.008755806,-0.006409277,0.003321702,0.026724022000000004,0.00341785,-0.053112817,-0.019607396000000003,0.000511969,-0.044544984,-0.050502545999999995,0.018197448,0.013192404,-0.024749925
119,Enteric Colonization by Staphylococcus delphini in Four Ferret Kits with Diarrhoea,"Summary Four, 1-to 4-week-old ferret kits were submitted to the Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health at Michigan State University for post-mortem examination. Grossly, multiple bowel loops in all ferret kits were distended by mucoid faecal material. Microscopically, there was no evidence of inflammation or notable alteration to the normal mucosal morphology. Gram-positive coccoid bacteria colonized variable segments of the small intestine. These bacteria were identified as Staphylococcus delphini by phenotypic and molecular analyses. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of Staphylococcus enterotoxins was positive and polymerase chain reaction detected the gene for Staphylococcus enterotoxin E in the isolates. The hypersecretory diarrhoea in these ferret kits may have been associated with colonization of the small intestine by S. delphini, cultures of which were shown in vitro to be potentially capable of producing enterotoxin E. The condition described in these ferrets is similar to ‘sticky’ kit syndrome in mink.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.007689921999999999,0.003161836,0.043991218,-0.082872662,0.0009209810000000001,0.01132159,0.023254958,0.005576173,-0.016970104,-0.006317863000000001,0.003978317,0.004812818,-0.002334559,-0.035801116,0.019099546999999998,-0.022550457000000003,-0.008539744,-0.015897816000000002,-0.015720602,-0.018290903,0.002827954,-0.003522941,0.026339541,-0.01238523,0.00586443,-0.008275991,-0.021875736,-0.005495076,0.016085171000000002,-0.028591482
120,Neospora caninum: the First Demonstration of the Enteroepithelial Stages in the Intestines of a Naturally Infected Dog,"Summary A 1.5-month-old Kangal breed puppy from a dairy cattle farm died after showing severe diarrhoea and incoordination. Necropsy examination revealed multifocal pulmonary consolidation and necrosis and fibrinohaemorrhagic enteritis. Microscopically, there was necrotic and purulent bronchopneumonia, myocarditis and non-purulent encephalitis. In the jejunum and ileum there was villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia with oocyst-like and schizont-like structures in the epithelia. Immunohistochemically, Neospora caninum antigen was detected in association with the intestinal protozoal structures, degenerative neurons and areas of necrosis in the lungs and heart. Polymerase chain reaction confirmed that the organism was N. caninum and not Toxoplasma gondii. The seroprevalence for N. caninum was 74.2% (49/66 animals) for the cattle and 57.1% (4/7 animals) for dogs on this farm. This report documents fatal systemic neosporosis and enteroepithelial stages of N. caninum in a naturally infected puppy.

121,An Outbreak of Fatal Bordetella bronchiseptica Bronchopneumonia in Puppies,"Summary Twenty-two newborn puppies that did not receive colostrum exhibited acute respiratory signs and died at a breeding facility. Pathological examinations were performed on four of the puppies. At necropsy examination, the lungs were firm and mottled dark red, consistent with acute bronchopneumonia. Histopathologically, there was marked infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the bronchi and alveoli, and gram-negative coccobacilli were attached diffusely to the cilia of bronchial mucosa. Immunohistochemistry for Bordetella bronchiseptica antigen revealed positive labelling of the bacterial agents. On electron microscopy, a large number of coccobacilli were observed attaching to the cilia of bronchial epithelial cells. Real-time polymerase chain reaction amplified a B. bronchiseptica gene from the affected lung tissue. Based on these findings, the four puppies were diagnosed with fatal B. bronchiseptica bronchopneumonia.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.00295517,-0.0018348560000000002,0.018868119,-0.10296382400000001,-0.025515327,0.020584977,-0.0012332369999999999,-0.014778548,0.00793685,-0.015274308,0.001739633,-0.015508208999999998,-0.002946015,0.012972038,0.037931192999999995,-0.005218307,-0.005468538,-0.028392159,-0.001065522,-0.0249693,0.045311387,0.000970394,-0.013760132,-0.048993884,0.02425752,0.001136447,-0.058008402,0.021424891,0.005246398,-0.043760195
122,Detection of nucleic acids of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in the lungs of naturally infected piglets as determined by in-situ hybridization,"Summary Replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was studied in formalin-fixed paraffin wax-embedded lung tissues from seven naturally infected piglets by in-situ hybridization with a non-radioactive digoxigenin-labelled probe. A 433 base pair cDNA probe for the viral RNA encoding the nucleocapsid proteins of a Korean PRRSV isolate was generated by the polymerase chain reaction. All seven piglets infected with PRRSV showed a distinct, positive signal, scattered throughout the alveolar septa and spaces. Positive cells typically exhibited dark brown staining deposits in the cytoplasm without background staining. In-situ hybridization demonstrated that PRRSV replicated primarily in interstitial and alveolar macrophages, and occasionally in type 2 pneumocytes. The bronchial or bronchiolar epithelium did not exhibit a hybridization signal for PRRSV nucleic acids. The anterior and middle lobes of the lung were more reliable than the caudal or accessory lobes for the detection of PRRSV nucleic acids. The in-situ hybridization technique used was rapid, specific and sensitive, and may prove useful for the diagnosis of PRRSV infection in routinely fixed and processed tissues.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.063865733,-0.008946671,0.04722657,-0.060912218,-0.036368608999999996,0.0029650429999999997,-0.017504985,-0.023229457999999998,0.036904709,-0.003257123,-0.017570708,-0.041649158,-0.003867235,0.041459455,0.110682777,-0.079610259,0.016684206,-0.044181909000000005,-0.03628153,0.073669628,-0.065880671,-0.022547011000000002,0.04578392,-0.102318616,0.032827676,0.053174381,-0.036532112,-0.01173051,-0.121967276,0.067022997
124,Association of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 gene A/G polymorphism and elevated blood pressure in Chinese patients with metabolic syndrome,"To establish whether angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene A/G single nucleotide polymorphism is associated with hypertension in Chinese patients with metabolic syndrome. The study was conducted in 353 patients with metabolic syndrome. The alleles of the ACE2 A/G polymorphism, which is located on the X chromosome, were detected using polymerase chain reaction and subsequent cleavage by Alu I restriction endonuclease. G allele frequencies in patients with metabolic syndrome were 36.6% in female subjects and 43.4% in male subjects, respectively. Female patients with metabolic syndrome who carry the GG genotype had a significantly higher diastolic blood pressure compared with other genotypes. Multivariate logistic regression showed that female gender (P = 0.019) and carrying only the G allele (odds ratio 2.83 [95% CI 1.36 to 5.91]; P = 0.005) were significantly associated with increased diastolic blood pressure.

127,Outbreak of Necrotizing Enterocolitis Caused by Norovirus in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit,"Objectives To investigate an outbreak of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and to identify the etiology, describe illness risk factors, and develop control measures. Study design A retrospective case-control study was performed including newborns with NEC and newborns without NEC, examining demographic factors and exposures to medications, staff members, and procedures before illness. Stool samples from affected newborns were collected and tested for bacteria, parasites, and viruses. Results We confirmed a NEC outbreak in the NICU in January 1998 with 8 cases, including 2 deaths, clustered in time and space. Norovirus-like particles were identified in all available stools from cases; norovirus (NoV) was confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 4 of 6 samples. NEC cases were younger, had lower Apgar scores, and received antibiotics longer than 25 control subjects. Three NICU health care personnel had more contact with cases than control subjects; 1 staff member recalled having gastroenteritis symptoms around the time of the outbreak. Conclusions This report associates NoV with NEC. NoV appeared to precipitate NEC in predisposed infants. Spatial clustering and epidemiologic links between cases and a health care worker with gastroenteritis suggests that NoV should be investigated among the etiologies of NEC outbreaks and that interventions targeted to interruption of NoV transmission should be considered.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.076581997,0.007300745,-0.014598783999999998,-0.083968888,-0.003238643,0.02616973,-0.001173157,0.053155182,-0.010552613999999998,-0.02850779,0.029709381,0.047576148,-0.05590975,-0.086427404,0.05786589,0.01364145,-0.031976002,-0.002770408,0.015747777,-0.013515093,-0.000195728,0.041103855,-0.140603951,-0.011469426999999999,0.021851261,0.008761886,0.018114164,0.058260057000000004,-0.010924203,-0.020740854

133,Ultrafiltration attenuates cardiopulmonary bypass–induced acute lung injury in a canine model of single-lung transplantation,"Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass and ultrafiltration on graft function in a canine single-lung transplantation model. Methods Fifteen left single-lung transplantations were done in weight-mismatched canine pairs. The animals were divided into 3 groups: group 1, in which transplantation was done without cardiopulmonary bypass; group 2, in which transplantation was done with cardiopulmonary bypass and in which the cardiopulmonary bypass flow was decreased slowly with controlled pulmonary artery pressure; and group 3, in which transplantation was done with cardiopulmonary bypass and ultrafiltration. Hemodynamic parameters and lung function were monitored for 6 hours after reperfusion. The grafts were harvested for histologic studies, myeloperoxidase assay, and real-time quantitive reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction of mRNA encoding interleukin 6. Results The hemodynamic parameters were similar among the 3 groups. In group 1 Pao 2 and alveolar to arterial gradient for O2 levels were excellent throughout the 6-hour observation period, but in group 2 they progressively deteriorated. However, ultrafiltration significantly (P = .02) improved the Pao 2 level in group 3. On histology, interstitial edema and polynuclear cell infiltration were most marked in group 2 and significantly worse than in groups 1 and 3. Myeloperoxidase assay and real-time quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction showed increased myeloperoxidase activity and interleukin 6 gene expression in group 2 grafts compared with group 1 grafts.

134,Luteolin suppresses inflammation-associated gene expression by blocking NF-κB and AP-1 activation pathway in mouse alveolar macrophages,"Abstract Luteolin, a plant flavonoid, has potent anti-inflammatory properties both in vitro and in vivo. However, the molecular mechanism of luteolin-mediated immune modulation has not been fully understood. In this study, we examined the effects of luteolin on the production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), as well as the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in mouse alveolar macrophage MH-S and peripheral macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. Luteolin dose-dependently inhibited the expression and production of these inflammatory genes and mediators in macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Semi-quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay further confirmed the suppression of LPS-induced TNF- α, IL-6, iNOS and COX-2 gene expression by luteolin at a transcriptional level. Luteolin also reduced the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in LPS-activated macrophages. Moreover, luteolin blocked the degradation of IκB-α and nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 subunit. In addition, luteolin significantly inhibited the LPS-induced DNA binding activity of activating protein-1 (AP-1). We also found that luteolin attenuated the LPS-mediated protein kinase B (Akt) and IKK phosphorylation, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In sum, these data suggest that, by blocking NF-κB and AP-1 activation, luteolin acts to suppress the LPS-elicited inflammatory events in mouse alveolar macrophages, and this effect was mediated, at least in part, by inhibiting the generation of reactive oxygen species. Our observations suggest a possible therapeutic application of this agent for treating inflammatory disorders in lung.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.07862413,-0.018849677,0.020713352,-0.12037662699999999,-0.083560953,0.048772586,0.035629127000000003,-0.043074777,0.04945583,-0.06734833400000001,-0.058233552,-0.012464863999999999,-0.031249082,0.081377125,-0.03533558,0.026353566000000002,0.008325756,-0.048220519,-0.033395305,-0.054679236,0.02883725,-0.039349229,0.031549157,-1.9e-05,-0.007005946999999999,-0.0036689509999999997,-0.00120523,0.041042781,0.062089754000000004,-0.04639087
136,Epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infection in a large teaching hospital in Singapore,"Summary Aims We undertook this study to define the incidence of toxigenic Clostridium difficile in our hospital and to characterise the isolates. Methods All unformed stool was tested for the presence of Toxin A (TcdA) and Toxin B (TcdB), and cultured for C. difficile. Culture filtrates were also tested for TcdA and TcdB. Detection of tcdA and tcdB genes was carried out for A2B+ strains by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of metronidazole, vancomycin and clindamycin for all isolates were tested using the Etest. PCR ribotyping was carried out on all isolates. Results The incidence of Clostridium difficile associated disease (CDAD) was 3.2 cases per 1000 admissions or discharges and 53.8 cases per 100000 patient days. Most cases occurred in renal and haematology patients. CDAD was more common in patients aged over 50 years and of male gender. The Indian population was under-represented. Fourteen (11.8%) isolates were A-B+. All strains were susceptible to metronidazole but one strain showed intermediate resistance to vancomycin. Only 12.8% of the isolates were susceptible to clindamycin. Thirty-five isolates had PCR ribotype A, of which 29 (83%) had a clindamycin MIC >256mg/L. Thirty-three had PCR ribotype B, of which only one (3%) had a clindamycin MIC >256mg/L. The 14 A-B+ strains were all PCR ribotype C, and had a range of MICs for clindamycin from 2 to >256mg/L. Conclusions: The incidence of CDAD in our hospital is relatively low. Isolates remain susceptible to metronidazole and vancomycin.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.074586245,0.010717795,0.046686730999999995,-0.103206911,0.040758016,0.034708287000000004,-0.058994284,0.014048835,-0.036277704,0.032421969,0.032717073,0.062730927,-0.052467752,-0.004374982,0.006105652,-0.000821065,-0.016331701,0.05210046,-0.013426531,-0.06103564400000001,0.043036309,0.039471777,0.019302417,0.004745528,-0.011163158000000001,-0.016243188000000002,0.035690301,0.025941588999999998,-0.018343057,0.054899629000000005
139,Effect of experimental Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale infection along with live infectious bronchitis vaccination in broiler chickens,"ABSTRACT Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT), a bacterium causing respiratory tract infection, has led to a significant problem in the intensive poultry production in Egypt. Polymerase chain reaction-amplified 784-bp specific ORT DNA fragments were found in 7 ORT isolates from lungs, air sacs, and tracheas of commercial broilers or layers in Egypt in 2015. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of the live variant IBV 4/91 with ORT infection. A total of 120 14-d-old broiler chickens (Cobb 500) were equally divided into 4 groups for experimental infection in a complete randomized design. Group 1 was infected with ORT strain and live infectious bronchitis vaccine (IBV 4/91) simultaneously; group 2 was infected with the bacterial strain alone; group 3 was vaccinated only with IBV 4/91, and group 4 was the non-vaccinated and non-infected control group. The respiratory signs, post-mortem lesions (tracheitis and pneumonia) and histopathological findings of lungs, trachea, and air sacs in the experimentally infected broiler chickens appeared to be more prominent in the chickens of group 1 than group 2. With respect to body weight, weight gain, feed conversion rate, and Ornithobacterium re-isolation, there was a difference (P ≤ 0.05) among the chickens of group 1 and the other groups. This reveals that the use of live infectious bronchitic vaccines, which is a common practice in the local Egyptian field of production, may concomitantly increase the pathogenicity of ORT in broiler chickens.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.010451806999999999,-0.035592953,0.032641379,-0.15382447900000001,0.10436503300000001,0.068513918,-0.086993899,-0.059794877,0.046711162,0.197354241,0.07461633,-0.007167726,-0.08631701900000001,0.02606137,-0.073107195,0.09301029699999999,-0.02089316,0.00936309,0.015313531000000002,0.061363897,-0.055182792,-0.053304762,-0.003494673,-0.046246653,0.006888610999999999,-0.016108941,-0.060507665999999995,-0.017615844,-0.032119836,-0.018045723
141,Molecular characterization of a unique variant of avian infectious bronchitis virus in Tunisia,"ABSTRACT Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is responsible of significant economic losses for poultry industry around the world, through evolution of its pathogenicity, inadequacy of vaccines, and virus evasion. Such evasion is related to the unstable nature of its RNA, in particular the S glycoprotein encoding gene, which raises great challenges with regard to the control of the disease, along with the lack of proof reading mechanisms of the RNA polymerase. The emergence of new variants might be a reason for the endemic outbreaks that are being reported in Tunisia, in addition to poor vaccination techniques and ineffective prophylactic programs. In the present study, partial nucleotide sequences of the S1 glycoprotein gene and the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of 2 Tunisian isolates, TN1011/16 and TN1012/16, identified in 2016, were determined. Specific mutations were found in S1 gene as well as in 3′UTR region. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 nucleotide sequences showed that both isolates are closely related to the Algerian strains, and formed a common cluster within the genotype I. In addition, these isolates were non-recombinant ones, confirming that they are unique variants. Based on their S1 gene sequences, TN1011/16 and TN1012/16 strains were distant from the H120 vaccine strain, commercially used in Tunisia along with the variant vaccine 793B type (4/91). A comparison between nucleotide sequences of their 3′UTR region and S1 gene showed a difference in IBV classification. The obtained results have confirmed that the IBVsequence continues to drift and brings valuable information in relation with its evolution, vaccine development and better control of the disease.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.10942949699999999,-0.022800873,0.057691824,-0.093934053,0.202009512,0.09378184699999999,-0.123906414,-0.037280135,0.070315269,0.189792563,0.01950586,0.043005075,-0.050248764,-0.067604493,-0.07541305400000001,0.016177438,-0.049614799,0.021497265,-0.019205944,0.028156324,0.043296432,-0.019123282,0.019236116,0.06728429400000001,-0.049706254000000005,-0.028218167000000002,0.035041871,0.00691598,0.019654975,0.039803253
142,Comparative analysis on the 5′-untranslated region of bovine viral diarrhea virus isolated in Korea,"Abstract Samples of 249 bovine abortuses, one intestine, and four diarrheal stools from 254 cows were collected, and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Subsequently, virus isolation was preformed with PCR-positive samples, and then PCR product of 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of BVDV isolate was sequenced and analyzed. Among the samples collected, 20 (from 17 bovine abortuses, one intestine, and two diarrheal stools) were positive for BVDV RT-PCR; four BVDVs (from two bovine abortuses, one intestine, and one diarrheal stool) were isolated. When the four isolates were biotyped in cell culture, one BVDV isolate from a bovine abortus was cytopathic and the others were non-cytopathic. In addition, three isolates were genotyped as BVDV-1 and one isolate from a diarrheal stool as BVDV-2. In phylogenetic analysis, it suggested that the BVDV-2 isolate in Korea is closer to the North American strains than Asian strains.

Pathological findings and immunohistochemical identification using a monoclonal anti-canine Coronavirus antibody are included. Visceral lesions consisted of extensive fibrinopurulent bronchopneumonia, multiple renal cortical infarcts, severe coalescing centrilobular hepatic fatty change with minimal random hepatic necrosis, and multifocal splenic haemorrhage with lymphoid depletion. Moderate chronic diffuse enteritis was associated with intraluminal adult ascarids. Identification of type I and type II coronavirus in this subject had been previously confirmed by genotype-specific real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays of the intestinal contents, while only Coronavirus type II was detected in visceral organs.

145,Oxidative stress indices in gastroenteritis in dogs with canine parvoviral infection,"Abstract Gastroenteritis of viral origin has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in dogs during the last two decades. Amongst the viral etiologies responsible for gastroenteritis in dogs, canine parvovirus (CPV) is considered as the most pathogenic. The disease is characterized by hemorrhagic enteritis, bloody diarrhoea and myocarditis in young pups. The present study was carried out to examine alterations in oxidative stress indices in the erythrocytes from dogs suffering from gastroenteritis with or without canine parvoviral infection as confirmed by CPV-DNA amplification from faeces using specific primers for CPV-2 as well as CPV-2a and CPV-2b variants by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The present investigation utilized clinical cases of dogs with signs of acute diarrhea (n =56), and 14 more apparently healthy dogs of similar age group. Erythrocytic oxidative stress indices such as lipid peroxides level and antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase and catalase activity, and blood micro-mineral (iron, copper, cobalt and zinc) status were analyzed in each dog (n =70). The acute cases of gastroenteritis in dogs were associated with altered erythrocytic lipid peroxidation as evident by estimation of malonaldehyde (MDA) concentration. The activities of antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase, the first line of antioxidant defense against damaging effects of free radicals, were also altered. The alterations in oxidative stress indices were more pronounced in cases with involvement of canine parvovirus as compared to parvo-negative cases. Our results also revealed decreased blood zinc level in diarrhoea in dogs irrespective of involvement of canine parvovirus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.000382169,-0.006670832,0.061584618,-0.11397726300000001,-0.0025134660000000002,0.022276356,0.034017782999999996,-0.002230311,-0.023293479,-0.04316994,0.06255142799999999,0.040823101,-0.040403422,-0.062766862,0.050505166,-0.026085854,-0.042486576,-0.072926993,0.110585749,0.00372389,0.20173881800000001,0.15137277400000002,-0.139387079,-0.049404984000000006,0.185228339,-0.159361427,-0.126711412,-0.0032576740000000003,-0.069884219,0.100294254
146,Transient inhibition of foot-and-mouth disease virus replication by siRNAs silencing VP1 protein coding region,"Abstract Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is the causative agent of foot-and-mouth disease, a severe, clinically acute, vesicular disease of cloven-hoofed animals. RNA interference (RNAi) is a mechanism for silencing gene expression post-transcriptionally that is being exploited as a rapid antiviral strategy. To identify efficacious small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to inhibit the replication of FMDV, candidate siRNAs corresponding to FMDV VP1 gene were designed and synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase. In reporter assays, five siRNAs showed significant sequence-specific silencing effects on the expression of VP1-EGFP fusion protein from plasmid pVP1-EGFP-N1, which was cotransfected with siRNA into 293T cells. Furthermore, using RT-qPCR, viral titration and viability assay, we identified VP1-siRNA517, VP1-siRNA113 and VP1-siRNA519 that transiently acted as potent inhibitors of FMDV replication when BHK-21 cells were infected with FMDV. In addition, variations within multiple regions of the quasispecies of FMDV were retrospectively revealed by sequencing of FMDV genes, and a single nucleotide substitution was identified as the main factor in resistance to RNAi. Our data demonstrated that the three siRNA molecules synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase could have transient inhibitory effects on the replication of FMDV.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.125364437,-0.027091217999999997,0.015168783,-0.021953456,-0.060038717000000005,0.012394943,0.001411288,-0.026409666000000002,0.037245043,-0.008882493,-0.01473428,-0.020938744,-0.015195993,0.058336100999999994,0.017271466,-0.005446696,-0.033756048999999996,0.023853531,0.005465839,-0.001188723,0.047631455999999996,0.006228007,0.005955859,0.058148201,-0.022375037,0.01685875,0.044726369,0.005796255,-0.006589305,0.009772397
147,Experimental infection of IS/885/00-like infectious bronchitis virus in specific pathogen free and commercial broiler chicks,"Abstract Pathogenesis of an IS/885/00-like (IS/885) strain of variant infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was examined in one day old specific pathogen free (SPF) and commercial broiler chicks. Chicks were humanely euthanized at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 21 and 28days post infection (dpi) for necropsy examination, and tissues were collected for histopathology and virus detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Respiratory clinical signs and gross lesions consisting of tracheal caseous exudate and plugs, and swollen kidneys (with or without) urate deposits were observed in SPF and broiler chicks. The onset of disease developed more slowly and were of lesser severity in broiler compared to SPF chicks, reflecting the inhibitory effects of the IBV maternal-antibodies in the broiler chicks or genetic/strain susceptibility, or both. Head swelling was observed in one infected broiler chick at 15dpi and the virus was recovered by RT-PCR and isolation. In the IS/885-infected SPF chicks, cystic oviducts were found in two female chicks. IS/885 was isolated from the cystic fluid.

149,Oral Mutian®X stopped faecal feline coronavirus shedding by naturally infected cats,"Abstract Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is common among cats living indoors in groups. In about 10% of infected cats, a potentially lethal disease, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) occurs. Virus transmission is faecal-oral. Mutian® X is a product marketed to treat cats with FIP but is also being used to stop virus shedding, although no clear guidelines exist for its use for this purpose. The aim of this study was to establish the minimum dose and treatment duration required to ensure viral clearance from the faeces of asymptomatic virus-shedding cats. In five multicat households, 29 cats naturally infected with FCoV and actively shedding virus in the faeces were given Mutian X pills. Virus shedding was monitored using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) controlled for faecal inhibitors to ensure sensitivity. Mutian X given orally cleared the virus in 29 cats; although four cats required a repeated course to finally stop virus shedding. A dose of 4 mg/kg q24 h for four days was found to be the optimal treatment protocol: 2 mg/kg cleared only 80% of cats. Post-treatment using a sensitive RT-qPCR test was essential to ensure that virus clearance had been achieved, since failure to clear even one cat can result in re-infection of the others. Records of virus shedding by cats before treatment provided a retrospective control: significantly more cats stopped shedding virus after Mutian X than recovered from infection during the control period (p < .00001). This is the first report of the successful elimination of faecal FCoV shedding in chronically infected cats.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.01080832,-0.010491993,0.080308394,-0.16208091300000002,-0.018039054,0.050010953,0.03696492,0.004012681,-0.032312826,-0.166299062,0.46448792,-0.17621216,0.241494958,-0.00951369,-0.106610613,-0.037390716000000004,0.049693296,0.028352485,0.00751258,0.123387532,-0.057146369,-0.042181327000000005,0.029483757000000003,0.042491112000000004,-0.029918907,0.051422232000000005,0.03752736,0.018698093,0.019634408,-0.00112175
150,Preliminary studies on feline coronavirus distribution in naturally and experimentally infected cats,"Abstract The shedding, tissue distribution and quasispecies composition of feline coronaviruses were studied in naturally and experimentally infected cats. The infection remained subclinical, but the majority of the animals shed the virus via faeces throughout the experiment. Sequences corresponding to the viral nucleocapsid region were amplified by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction from the cortex, dura mater, pancreas, lungs, third eyelid, and the heart muscle in four cases. Interestingly, the ORF7b viral region – a supposed virulence factor – was detected in fewer organs, raising the possibility that this region can be affected by deletions during virus replication in vivo. It is demonstrated that the composition of the viral quasispecies differs between organs, and that genomic regions with different functions undergo distinct processes of selection, which should be considered during the evolution of feline coronaviruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.075540379,-0.030926376000000002,0.005165272,-0.074107918,0.055786696,0.018855099,0.021894396,-0.007754011999999999,-0.010459914,-0.03940261,0.166627478,-0.086294491,0.106985993,-0.001274942,-0.022362093,-0.02154769,0.009346216,-0.0021289670000000003,-0.02318003,0.072926927,-0.013133042,-0.005022747,-0.026834406,0.04725744900000001,-0.010739191,-0.007742189,0.017609336,0.0064053140000000005,-0.021186204,0.013054455
153,Detection of a group 2 coronavirus in dogs with canine infectious respiratory disease,"Abstract An investigation into the causes of canine infectious respiratory disease was carried out in a large rehoming kennel. Tissue samples taken from the respiratory tract of diseased dogs were tested for the presence of coronaviruses using RT–PCR with conserved primers for the polymerase gene. Sequence analysis of four positive samples showed the presence of a coronavirus with high similarity to both bovine and human coronavirus (strain OC43) in their polymerase and spike genes, whereas there was a low similarity to comparable genes in the enteric canine coronavirus. This canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCV) was detected by RT–PCR in 32/119 tracheal and 20/119 lung samples, with the highest prevalence being detected in dogs with mild clinical symptoms. Serological analysis showed that the presence of antibodies against CRCV on the day of entry into the kennel decreased the risk of developing respiratory disease.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.07429322599999999,0.051906475,0.096825206,-0.038571077,0.171970557,-0.043168393,-0.027369900000000003,-0.032524568,0.039117816,-0.004060332,0.04455717,0.038373023,0.055771336,0.030698682999999997,0.05449969,-0.089114048,0.031650483,-0.04274697,0.08740655300000001,-0.031953859,0.171528228,0.06231905099999999,-0.108387934,0.031178677999999998,0.167684221,-0.08787376599999999,-0.068085589,-0.035668518999999996,-0.004006376,-0.023760278
154,Down-regulation of transcription of the proapoptotic gene BNip3 in cultured astrocytes by murine coronavirus infection,"Abstract Murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) causes encephalitis and demyelination in the central nervous system of susceptible rodents. Astrocytes are the major target for MHV persistence. However, the mechanisms by which astrocytes survive MHV infection and permit viral persistence are not known. Here we performed DNA microarray analysis on differential gene expression in astrocyte DBT cells by MHV infection and found that the mRNA of the proapoptotic gene BNip3 was significantly decreased following MHV infection. This finding was further confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and BNip3-promoter-luciferase reporter system. Interestingly, infection with live and ultraviolet light-inactivated viruses equally repressed BNip3 expression, indicating that the down-regulation of BNip3 expression does not require virus replication and is mediated during cell entry. Furthermore, treatment of cells with chloroquine, which blocks the acidification of endosomes, significantly inhibited the repression of the BNip3 promoter activity induced by the acidic pH-dependent MHV mutant OBLV60, which enters cells via endocytosis, indicating that the down-regulation of BNip3 expression is mediated by fusion between viral envelope and cell membranes during entry. Deletion analysis showed that the sequence between nucleotides 262 and 550 of the 588-base-pair BNip3 promoter is necessary and sufficient for driving the BNip3 expression and that it contains signals that are responsible for MHV-induced down-regulation of BNip3 expression in DBT cells. These results may provide insights into the mechanisms by which MHV evades host antiviral defense and promotes cell survival, thereby allowing its persistence in the host astrocytes.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.117773893,-0.048857012000000005,-0.010419708,-0.07449767,-0.055139340999999994,0.013714758999999998,-0.035633095,-0.023383259,0.056749623,-0.05455937,-0.07051444700000001,-0.08645896900000001,0.025252797999999996,0.08804458300000001,0.039119249,0.056176443,-0.053591632,-0.001629571,-0.023146349,-0.014272922,0.054414045,-0.017629724,0.042681172,0.05080950099999999,0.067813695,0.060583817000000005,0.006549462,-0.0007329560000000001,-0.015163093,-0.021747845
157,A highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus generated from an infectious cDNA clone retains the in vivo virulence and transmissibility properties of the parental virus,"Abstract The nucleotide sequence of a highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was determined. Transfection of MARC-145 cells with capped in vitro transcripts derived from a full-length cDNA clone of the viral genome resulted in infectious PRRSV with growth characteristics similar to that of the parental virus. Primer extension analysis revealed that during replication, the viral polymerase corrected the two nonviral guanosine residues present at the 5′ terminus of the transfected transcripts. Animal studies showed that the cloned virus induced hyperthermia, persistent viremia, and antibody response, similar to that observed with the parental virus. Contact transmission occurred rapidly within 3 days of introduction of naı̈ve pigs into the group of clone virus-inoculated pigs. These results suggest that the cloned virus retains the in vivo virulence and contagion properties of the parental virus, thus, providing the background for reverse genetics manipulation in systematic examination of attenuation and virulence phenotypes.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.085478925,-0.050074842,-0.012904578,-0.023897239,0.0040229129999999995,0.027525377,-0.046982774000000005,-0.025755231,0.037639978,0.025468652,-0.000579879,-0.066992552,-0.009430131999999999,0.038868525,0.115566197,-0.059676634000000006,-0.013069832,-0.023334857999999997,-0.022344895,0.09136456800000001,-0.016591156,-0.048337899000000004,0.037847811,0.008168443000000001,-0.010681383999999999,0.058866265,0.027714045,-0.02895043,-0.106672955,0.021435035
159,Molecular characterization of a novel coronavirus associated with epizootic catarrhal enteritis (ECE) in ferrets,"Abstract A novel coronavirus, designated as ferret enteric coronavirus (FECV), was identified in feces of domestic ferrets clinically diagnosed with epizootic catarrhal enteritis (ECE). Initially, partial sequences of the polymerase, spike, membrane protein, and nucleocapsid genes were generated using coronavirus consensus PCR assays. Subsequently, the complete sequences of the nucleocapsid gene and the last two open reading frames at the 3′ terminus of the FECV genome were obtained. Phylogenetic analyses based on predicted partial amino acid sequences of the polymerase, spike, and membrane proteins, and full sequence of the nucleocapsid protein showed that FECV is genetically most closely related to group 1 coronaviruses. FECV is more similar to feline coronavirus, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and canine coronavirus than to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and human coronavirus 229E.

160,Genomic characterization of the unclassified bovine enteric virus Newbury agent-1 (Newbury1) endorses a new genus in the family Caliciviridae,"Abstract The pathogenic bovine enteric virus, Newbury agent-1 (Bo//Newbury1/1976/UK), first identified in 1976, was characterized as a possible calicivirus by morphology, buoyant density in CsCl and the presence of a single capsid protein but genomic sequence could not be obtained. In the present study, the complete genome sequence of Newbury1 was determined and classified Newbury1 in a new genus of the Caliciviridae. The Newbury1 genome, of 7454 nucleotides, had two predicted open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encoded the non-structural and contiguous capsid proteins. ORF2 encoded a basic protein characteristic of the family Caliciviridae. Compared to the 4 recognized Caliciviridae genera, Norovirus, Sapovirus, Lagovirus and Vesivirus, Newbury1 had less than 39% amino acid (47% nucleotide) identity in the complete 2C-helicase, 3C-protease, 3D-polymerase and capsid regions but had 89% to 98% amino acid (78% to 92% nucleotide) identity to the recently characterized NB virus in these regions. By phylogenetic analyses, Newbury1 and NB viruses formed a distinct clade independent of the 4 recognized genera. However, amino acid identities showed that Newbury1 and the NB virus were distinct polymerase types (90% amino acid identity), but their complete capsid proteins were almost identical (98% amino acid identity). Analyses of contemporary viruses showed that the two polymerase genotypes, Newbury1 and NB, were circulating in UK cattle and antibody to Newbury1-like viruses was common in cattle sera. The present study defined the existence of a new genus in the Caliciviridae that we propose be named Becovirus or Nabovirus to distinguish the new clade from bovine noroviruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.09515039,-0.037316999,0.010614648999999999,-0.052786988,0.080558231,0.01225445,-0.012864354,-0.002003562,-0.005312235,-0.014948093,-0.057278538,0.032405574,0.016751166,-0.11566764800000001,-0.011865581000000002,-0.088888035,0.038572765,0.0071044359999999996,0.018230238,0.009200843,0.021855162999999997,-0.002791244,-0.038598725,0.024653787000000003,0.00337997,0.0252467,0.023252832999999997,-0.04347706900000001,-0.03565486,-0.008898264

169,Pathogenicity and pathogenesis of a United States porcine deltacoronavirus cell culture isolate in 5-day-old neonatal piglets,"Abstract Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was first identified in Hong Kong in 2009–2010 and reported in United States swine for the first time in February 2014. However, diagnostic tools other than polymerase chain reaction for PDCoV detection were lacking and Koch׳s postulates had not been fulfilled to confirm the pathogenic potential of PDCoV. In the present study, PDCoV peptide-specific rabbit antisera were developed and used in immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry assays to assist PDCoV diagnostics. The pathogenicity and pathogenesis of PDCoV was investigated following orogastric inoculation of 5-day-old piglets with a plaque-purified PDCoV cell culture isolate (3×104 TCID50 per pig). The PDCoV-inoculated piglets developed mild to moderate diarrhea, shed increasing amount of virus in rectal swabs from 2 to 7 days post inoculation, and developed macroscopic and microscopic lesions in small intestines with viral antigen confirmed by immunohistochemistry staining.

171,Involvement of a joker mutation in a polymerase-independent lethal mutagenesis escape mechanism,"Abstract We previously characterized a foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) with three amino acid replacements in its polymerase (3D) that conferred resistance to the mutagenic nucleoside analogue ribavirin. Here we show that passage of this mutant in the presence of high ribavirin concentrations resulted in selection of viruses with the additional replacement I248T in 2C. This 2C substitution alone (even in the absence of replacements in 3D) increased FMDV fitness mainly in the presence of ribavirin, prevented an incorporation bias in favor of A and U associated with ribavirin mutagenesis, and conferred the ATPase activity of 2C decreased sensitivity to ribavirin-triphosphate. Since in previous studies we described that 2C with I248T was selected under different selective pressures, this replacement qualifies as a joker substitution in FMDV evolution. The results have identified a role of 2C in nucleotide incorporation, and have unveiled a new polymerase-independent mechanism of virus escape to lethal mutagenesis.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.070701888,-0.034495578,0.000450606,-0.037144063,-0.026980288999999998,0.04665482,0.057619473,0.002686197,0.003493868,0.007360878,0.018175382,0.049480067999999995,-0.024747486000000003,-0.051944810999999994,0.002957154,-0.001282067,-0.016106474,0.018194472,-0.015632795,-0.019751336,0.0655612,-0.05954212,0.021174256000000002,0.088189747,-0.0030522390000000004,0.034324817,0.007098726,-0.023833369,-0.035300145,-0.050605109
179,Experimental Evidence of Recombination in Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus,"Abstract Embryonated eggs were coinfected with two strains of the coronavirus avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), IBV-Beaudette and IBV-M41, to investigate whether recombination between the two strains would occur. Virions were isolated from the allantoic fluid of the coinfected eggs and putative hybrid RNAs were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using strain-specific oligonucleotides. PCR products, of the expected sizes, were obtained as predicted from potential recombination events between the nucleoprotein (N) gene and the 3′-untranslated region of the two IBV genomes. Sequencing confirmed that they corresponded to hybrid RNAs. Virus produced as a result of the mixed infection was treated with an M41-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody and passaged in Vero cells, in which IBV-Beaudette, but not IBV-M41, replicated. Hybrid RNA was still detectable after three serial passages. Since no IBV-M41 was detectable this confirmed that infectious recombinant genomes had been produced in the embryonated eggs. These findings not only support the circumstantial evidence, from sequencing studies of IBV field strains, that recombination occurs during replication of IBV and contributes to the diversity of IBV, but also show that coronavirus RNA recombination is not limited to mouse hepatitis virus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.113194628,-0.022943705,0.090732275,-0.086259579,0.22188801,0.06774515,-0.227944841,-0.09169609599999999,0.12138382199999999,0.401044564,0.122284385,0.0042573509999999995,-0.062932625,0.071422838,-0.129986253,0.209443966,-0.030807054,0.031087352999999998,0.020623126000000002,0.040532951,-0.031673648,-0.016762723,0.024661907,-0.043121745,0.005119495,0.037726203,0.013966633999999999,0.025236689,-0.0037246540000000004,0.009978395
181,The Molecular Genetics of Feline Coronaviruses: Comparative Sequence Analysis of the ORF7a/7b Transcription Unit of Different Biotypes,"Abstract Feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) have been subdivided into feline enteric coronaviruses (FECVs) and feline infectious peritonitis viruses (FIPVs) on the basis of pathogenic properties. Serologically, a distinction has been made between type I and II FCoVs, the latter of which more closely resemble canine coronavirus (CCV). To gain more insight into the genetic relationships between different FCoV biotypes, we determined the nucleotide sequences of the ORF7a/7b transcription unit of nine strains. The following observations were made: (i) The sequences are 87-100% identical. In this part of the genome, type I and II FCoVs are more closely related to each other than to CCV. To explain the genetic and antigenic differences between the spike genes of type I and II FCoVs, we postulate that type II FCoVs have arisen by an RNA recombination event between a type I FCoV and CCV. (ii) The avirulent ""FECV"" strains UCD and 79-1683 are more similar to virulent ""FIPV"" strains than to each other. Our findings thus support the notion that FECV and FIPV are not different species but merely virulence variants. (iii) In contrast to FECV 79-1683, FECV UCD contains an intact ORF7b, indicating that ORF7b deletions are not a universal distinguishing property of FECVs. (iv) ORF7b deletions readily occur in vitro, correlating with loss of virulence. By reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis, we show that in naturally occurring FCoVs ORF7b is maintained Thus, ORF7b seems to provide a distinct selective advantage during natural infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.08688039,-0.013281652,0.033998982000000004,-0.107869264,0.09752699,0.04217876,0.009354884,-0.005081251,-0.020373153,-0.053923529000000005,0.144525235,-0.018790953,0.071862027,-0.043465607,-0.015336506000000001,-0.020251863999999998,-0.021839759,0.000437535,-0.030303042999999998,0.036819738,0.082075262,-0.004093478,-0.004384434,0.078336848,0.026714411,-0.04815803,0.005573133,0.018088312,-0.028169237000000003,-0.006027136
186,Persistence and Evolution of Feline Coronavirus in a Closed Cat-Breeding Colony,"Abstract Feline coronavirus (FCoV) persistence and evolution were studied in a closed cat-breeding facility with an endemic serotype I FCoV infection. Viral RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the feces and/or plasma of 36 of 42 cats (86%) tested. Of 5 cats, identified as FCoV shedders during the initial survey, 4 had detectable viral RNA in the feces when tested 111 days later. To determine whether this was due to continuous reinfection or to viral persistence, 2 cats were placed in strict isolation and virus shedding in the feces was monitored every 2–4 days. In 1 of the cats, virus shedding continued for up to 7 months. The other animal was sacrificed after 124 days of continuous virus shedding in order to identify the sites of viral replication. Viral mRNA was detected only in the ileum, colon, and rectum. Also in these tissues, FCoV-infected cells were identified by immunohistochemistry. These findings provide the first formal evidence that FCoV causes chronic enteric infections. To assess FCoV heterogeneity in the breeding facility and to study viral evolution during chronic infection, FCoV quasispecies sampled from individual cats were characterized by RT-PCR amplification of selected regions of the viral genome followed by sequence analysis. Phylogenetic comparison of nucleotides 7–146 of ORF7b to corresponding sequences obtained for independent European and American isolates indicated that the viruses in the breeding facility form a clade and are likely to have originated from a single founder infection. Comparative consensus sequence analysis of the more variable region formed by residues 79–478 of the S gene revealed that each cat harbored a distinct FCoV quasispecies. Moreover, FCoV appeared to be subject to immune selection during chronic infection. The combined data support a model in which the endemic infection is maintained by chronically infected carriers. Virtually every cat born to the breeding facility becomes infected, indicating that FCoV is spread very efficiently. FCoV-infected cats, however, appear to resist superinfection by closely related FCoVs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.047643239000000004,-0.016196631,0.04891024,-0.117885301,0.047914918,7.890000000000001e-05,0.017667929,0.003407108,-0.040877633,-0.122538824,0.36096015200000003,-0.155163045,0.198146518,0.007742178000000001,-0.078131954,-0.046112342,0.039236746,0.008260401,-0.01564198,0.09340227599999999,-0.037245674,0.0035688079999999997,-0.005398718,0.059977145999999995,-0.041966740999999995,0.011451532,0.037624596,0.009359951,0.009413872,0.02991067
188,Inhibition of white spot syndrome virus in Litopenaeus vannamei shrimp by sequence-specific siRNA,"Abstract RNA interference (RNAi) is a sequence-specific, post-transcriptional process of mRNA degradation. Here, we described specific silencing of five white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) genes in Litopenaeus vannamei in vivo with sequence-specific siRNAs. These genes included DNA polymerase (dnapol), ribonucleotide reductase small subunit (rr2), thymidine kinase and thymidylate kinase (tk-tmk), vp24 and vp28. At 6 days post-challenged, the relative survival rates of shrimp injected with siDNApol, siRR2, siTK-TMK, siVP24 and siVP28 (siRNAs for dnapol, rr2, tk-tmk, vp24 and vp28 genes) reached 50%, 50%, 66%, 33% and 33%, respectively. Specific siRNAs of the five WSSV genes could result in suppression of the target genes and a significant reduction in the viral proliferation. In negative controls, sequence-independent siRNA (mutant siRNA) could not inhibit expression of these five genes or viral replication. Consequently, injection of sequence-dependent siRNA could induce anti-WSSV activity in shrimp. These results suggest that siRNA can suppress WSSV efficiently in shrimp, and it may provide a potential approach to the therapy of aquaculture viral disease.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.10278634199999999,-0.03038049,-0.005001648,-0.06975440599999999,-0.047184015,0.028719615,0.005709501999999999,-0.012845127,0.029550984,-0.013520388999999999,-0.053043865,-0.025529837000000003,0.000664269,0.032316323,-0.000850553,-0.01193377,-0.028511863999999998,-0.013861779,-0.024319483,-0.032548858,0.016719852,0.000797575,-0.012487212,0.04294272,-0.086070088,-0.060840171,0.024593154,0.018533828000000002,0.052408786,-0.013405781

Some attributes of the virus and epidemiology of disease that have clinical relevance, the efficiency of methods for detecting the presence of the virus in the human respiratory tract, and the means by which symptomatic illness is produced by rhinovirus infection of the respiratory tract are described Rhinoviruses cause more infections in humans than any other microorganism. The chapter also discusses the attributes of virus and the epidemiology of disease. These acid-sensitive picornaviruses infect epithelial cells following inoculation onto the nasal mucosa and are detected reliably in nasopharyngeal secretions. Rhinovirus colds occur year round, with a peak of illness in the fall. Type-specific serum antibody correlates with protection against infection. The fact that there are at least 100 different immunotypes makes development of an effective vaccine unlikely.

199,Postexposure protection of non-human primates against a lethal Ebola virus challenge with RNA interference: a proof-of-concept study,"Summary Background We previously showed that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV) RNA polymerase L protein formulated in stable nucleic acid-lipid particles (SNALPs) completely protected guineapigs when administered shortly after a lethal ZEBOV challenge. Although rodent models of ZEBOV infection are useful for screening prospective countermeasures, they are frequently not useful for prediction of efficacy in the more stringent non-human primate models. We therefore assessed the efficacy of modified non-immunostimulatory siRNAs in a uniformly lethal non-human primate model of ZEBOV haemorrhagic fever. Methods A combination of modified siRNAs targeting the ZEBOV L polymerase (EK-1 mod), viral protein (VP) 24 (VP24-1160 mod), and VP35 (VP35-855 mod) were formulated in SNALPs. A group of macaques (n=3) was given these pooled anti-ZEBOV siRNAs (2 mg/kg per dose, bolus intravenous infusion) after 30 min, and on days 1, 3, and 5 after challenge with ZEBOV. A second group of macaques (n=4) was given the pooled anti-ZEBOV siRNAs after 30 min, and on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 after challenge with ZEBOV. Findings Two (66%) of three rhesus monkeys given four postexposure treatments of the pooled anti-ZEBOV siRNAs were protected from lethal ZEBOV infection, whereas all macaques given seven postexposure treatments were protected. The treatment regimen in the second study was well tolerated with minor changes in liver enzymes that might have been related to viral infection. Interpretation This complete postexposure protection against ZEBOV in non-human primates provides a model for the treatment of ZEBOV-induced haemorrhagic fever. These data show the potential of RNA interference as an effective postexposure treatment strategy for people infected with Ebola virus, and suggest that this strategy might also be useful for treatment of other emerging viral infections.

Clinical evidence of meningoencephalitis was dullness, stupor, and occasional head or nose pressing postures. The polymerase chain reactions associated the BIV provirus with the lesions in the central nervous system and lymphoid tissues. Multiple concurrent infections developed in retrovirally infected cows undergoing normal stresses associated with parturition and lactation. A major functional correlate of the lymphoreticular alterations was the development of multiple secondary infections which failed to resolve after appropriate antibacterial therapy.

207,Viral interference between H9N2-low pathogenic avian influenza virus and avian infectious bronchitis virus vaccine strain H120 in vivo,"Abstract The interaction between a low pathogenic avian influenza virus (A/CK/TUN/145/2012), a H9N2 Tunisian isolate, and a vaccine strain (H120) of avian infectious bronchitis, administered simultaneously or sequentially three days apart to chicks during 20 days, was evaluated using ELISA antibody levels, quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses and histopathology examination. First, the in vivo replication interference of avian influenza virus (AIV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was evaluated using qRT-PCR to detect accurately either AIV or IBV genomes or viral copy numbers during dual infections. Second, we have determined the amount of specific antibodies in sera of chick’s infected with AIV alone, IBV alone, mixed AIV + IBV, IBV then AIV or AIV IBV 3 days later using an ELISA test. Finally, histopathological analyses of internal organs from inoculated chicks were realized. Quantitative results of AIV and IBV co-infection showed that interferences between the two viruses yielded decreased viral growth. However, in the case of super-infection, the second virus, either AIV or IBV, induced a decrease in the growth of the first inoculated virus. According to our results, vaccine application was safe and do not interfere with AIV H9N2 infection, and does not enhance such infection. In conclusion, co-infection of chicks with AIV and IBV, simultaneously or sequentially, affected the clinical signs, the virus replication dynamics as well as the internal organ integrity. The results proposed that infection with heterologous virus may result in temporary competition for cell receptors or competent cells for replication, most likely interferon-mediated.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.028377046,-0.038125511,0.067592406,-0.062961164,0.078802024,0.132520741,-0.14691617199999998,-0.083710199,0.11608133400000001,0.29671358,0.09760825,-0.036046499999999995,-0.064236156,0.10755474400000001,-0.10092726,0.15213768,0.014445766,-0.011093126000000002,0.020061382,0.036584175,-0.049155794,-0.017339283,0.0060114980000000005,-0.058646610999999994,-0.005014956,0.022891827000000003,-0.022915758999999997,0.012452877,0.020168593000000002,-0.019024219

We reported the first Hong Kong patient without risk factors for severe A(H7N9) disease. Methods Direct sequencing was performed on the endotracheal aspirate collected from a 36-year-old female with history of poultry contact. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to compare the current strain and previous A(H7N9) isolates. Results The influenza A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 virus strain was detected in a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome, deranged liver function and coagulation profile, cytopenia, and rhabdomyolysis. The HA, NA and MP genes of A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 cluster with those of other human A(H7N9) strains. The PB1, PB2 and NS genes are most closely related to those of A/Guangdong/1/2013 strain identified in August 2013, but are distinct from those of other human and avian A(H7N9) strains. The other internal genes NP and PA genes are more closely related to those of non-A(H7N9) avian influenza A viruses. A unique PA L336M mutation, associated with increased polymerase activity, was found. The patient required salvage by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Conclusions The A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 virus is a novel reassortant derived from A/Guangdong/1/2013 virus. The unique mutation PA L336M may enhance viral replication and therefore disease severity.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.015714007,-0.0417328,-0.030844951000000002,0.006714203,0.041111077999999995,0.165017716,-0.03116596,-0.009730131,0.020046451,0.010558379,-0.011425363000000001,0.025315264,-0.000621204,0.012967796,0.02274621,0.002145245,-0.022090956000000002,-0.014330764,-0.016862121,0.020646906,0.061695010999999994,-0.0051038229999999995,-0.048053005,0.054957788,-0.051766092,-0.008647577,-0.022080082999999997,0.017476238999999998,-0.020930213,-0.008011541
211,Identifcation of differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs in CD4+ T cells response to latent tuberculosis infection,"Summary Objective To identify differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in CD4+ T cells triggered upon latent tuberculosis (TB) infection. Methods Expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in CD4+ T cells from individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI), active TB and healthy controls were analyzed by microarray assay and four lncRNAs were selected for validation using real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway based approaches were used to investigate biological functions and signaling pathways affected by the differentially expressed mRNAs. Results LncRNAs and mRNAs in CD4+ T cells were involved in LTBI and active TB disease. Compared with healthy controls, 449 lncRNAs and 461 mRNAs were deregulated in LTBI group, 1,113 lncRNAs and 1,490 mRNAs were deregulated in active TB group, as well as 163 lncRNAs and 187 mRNAs were differentially expressed in both LTBI and active TB group. It was worth noting that 41 lncRNAs and 60 mRNAs were deregulated between three groups. Most deregulated lncRNAs were from intergenic regions (∼50%), natural antisense to protein-coding loci (∼20%), or intronic antisense to protein-coding loci (∼10%). Significantly enriched signaling pathways based on deregulated mRNAs were mainly involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, etc. Conclusions The study was the first report of differentially expressed lncRNAs in CD4+ T cells response to TB infection and indicated that some lncRNAs may be involved in regulating host immune response to TB infection. Future studies are needed to further elucidate potential roles of these deregulated lncRNAs in LTBI and its reactivation.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.062731213,-0.028876752999999998,0.009410394,-0.09824694099999999,-0.04557825,0.024118549,0.00546643,-0.018280452,0.032168286000000004,-0.057212827,-0.054657115,-0.026516356,-0.01435524,0.03419774,-0.015664806,0.015883805,-0.0028421109999999996,-0.037670527,-0.010184474,-0.018919626999999998,0.004951687,-0.002235549,-0.003488979,-0.009368666,-0.01075787,-0.022832666,0.004380437,0.0016828529999999998,0.032013056,-0.015749197
212,Genotype shift in human coronavirus OC43 and emergence of a novel genotype by natural recombination,"Summary Background Human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 is the most prevalent HCoV in respiratory tract infections. Its molecular epidemiological characterization, particularly the genotyping, was poorly addressed. Methods The full-length spike (S), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and nucleocapsid (N) genes were amplified from each respiratory sample collected from 65 HCoV-OC43-positive patients between 2005 and 2012. Genotypes were determined by phylogenetic analysis. Recombination was analyzed based on full-length viral genome sequences. Clinical manifestations of each HCoV genotype infection were compared by reviewing clinical records. Results Sixty of these 65 samples belong to genotypes B, C and D. The remaining five strains had incongruent positions in the phylogenetic trees of the S, RdRp and N genes, suggesting a novel genotype emerging, designated as genotype E. Whole genome sequencing and bootscan analysis indicated that genotype E is generated by recombination between genotypes B, C and D. Temporal analysis revealed a sequential genotype replacement of C, B, D and E over the study period with genotype D being the dominant genotype since 2007. The novel genotype E was only detected in children younger than three years suffering from lower respiratory tract infections. Conclusions Our results suggest that HCoV-OC43 genotypes are evolving. Such genotype shift may be an adapting mechanism for HCoV-OC43 maintaining its epidemic.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.023619517000000003,-0.040844548,-0.061595294,-0.031543659,0.183542287,-0.0733908,0.058951777000000004,-0.041848315,0.083605531,-0.027357377000000002,-0.005351369,0.371821876,0.211622196,0.113453995,0.004976638,0.030949358,-0.074585,-0.00907459,-0.052970787000000005,-0.015671731,0.036379662,-0.027713097000000003,0.043192988,-0.0074594,-0.033130812,-0.051469216,0.080336061,-0.002797055,0.010532981,0.08105609
214,Early inhibitors of human cytomegalovirus: State-of-art and therapeutic perspectives,"Abstract Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is associated with severe morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals, mainly transplant recipients and AIDS patients, and is the most frequent cause of congenital malformations in newborn children. To date, few drugs are licensed for the treatment of HCMV infections, most of which target the viral DNA polymerase and suffer from many drawbacks, including long-term toxicity, low potency, and poor bioavailability. In addition, the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains is becoming an increasing problem for disease management. Finally, none of the current anti-HCMV drugs have been approved for the treatment of congenital infections. For all these reasons, there is still a strong need for new anti-HCMV drugs with novel mechanisms of action. The first events of the virus replication cycle, including attachment, entry, immediate-early gene expression, and immediate-early functions—in particular that of Immediate-Early 2 protein—represent attractive targets for the development of novel antiviral compounds. Such inhibitors would block not only the expression of viral immediate-early proteins, which play a key role in the pathogenesis of HCMV infection, but also the host immunomodulation and the changes to cell physiology induced by the first events of virus infection. This review describes the current knowledge on the initial phases of HCMV replication, their validation as potential novel antiviral targets, and the development of compounds that block such processes.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.052495493,-0.035282713,-0.047401100999999994,-0.026385576,-0.136049105,0.103250996,0.11498616,-0.026965621000000002,0.069483828,0.06687138,-0.036651392000000005,-0.008770407,0.056215888,0.028489922,-0.002557325,-0.016983027,-0.032919437,0.098233082,0.018065302,0.054459254000000006,-0.001695342,0.048496344000000004,-0.084554695,0.061382055,0.037009827,0.00265067,0.057924444000000005,-0.058314015,0.064061849,0.037244839
215,Antibody and cytokine responses in kittens during the development of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP),"Abstract Two recombinant FIPV spike proteins were assessed for their immunogenic properties in 8-week-old kittens, which were then challenged intranasally with FIPV 79-1146. Humoral responses were assessed by ELISA and serum neutralisation test. Changes in PBMC cytokine mRNA levels were detected by a reverse transcription, semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-sqPCR), assessing IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IFNγ. All of the kittens developed clinical signs typical of FIP, which were confirmed on gross post mortem examination. The recombinant proteins induced little or no specific antibody response prior to challenge, and failed to alter the course of disease compared to controls. One week after virus challenge, the stimulated PBMCs showed small increases in the expression of IL-6 and IFNγ mRNA, which correlated with a transient pyrexia. After this time expression of IL-6 mRNA remained unaltered but, as FIP developed, mRNA levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and IFNγ became markedly depressed.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.035396998,-0.011487383,0.040720384,-0.15842811099999998,-0.080869281,0.01905334,0.008647398,-0.048495800000000006,0.044980024,-0.116851082,0.013049635,-0.071520817,-0.011817981000000002,0.097066007,-0.067693493,0.023369372000000003,0.011186946000000001,-0.070348063,-0.033344507999999995,-0.062358860999999995,0.020692659,-0.072337212,0.066452113,0.005978955,-0.045211685,-0.050501305999999996,0.064635573,0.045112649000000005,0.076753641,-0.016204967
216,Quantitative real-time PCR for the measurement of feline cytokine mRNA,"Abstract We have developed real-time PCR systems to quantitate feline cytokine gene expression. The method is based on the cleavage of fluorescent dye-labelled probes by the 5′–3′ exonuclease activity of the Taq DNA polymerase during PCR and measurement of fluorescence intensity by a Sequence Detection System. The feline-specific TaqMan probes were designed to encompass an intron, thus allowing differentiation of complementary DNA versus genomic DNA amplification products. Quantitative analysis of cytokine cDNA concentrations was performed in comparison to feline GAPDH. Messenger RNA (mRNA) from the universally expressed housekeeping gene GAPDH proved to be useful as an amplification control and allowed for correction of variations in the efficiencies of RNA extraction and reverse transcription. GAPDH mRNAs were readily detectable in cDNAs prepared from unstimulated feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and from frozen cell pellets, while cytokines (Interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-12 p35, IL-12 p40, IFNγ, IL-16) were expressed at variable amounts. IFNγ transcription was found to be upregulated in stimulated PBMCs and feline cell lines. The synthesis of cDNA and the performance of the PCR in separate tubes proved to be of superior sensitivity compared to a single-tube based system. The assays described are highly reproducible, require no post-PCR manipulation of the amplicons and permit the analysis of several hundred PCR reactions per day. With this method it is possible to detect and quantify cytokine mRNA expression reliably in small amounts of cells even after storage of samples for at least 5 years.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.073123151,0.028648154,0.156343065,-0.072688798,-0.064035779,-0.033904499,-0.015351584,-0.042711663,0.013994181999999999,-0.099112917,0.040155876,-0.11808614,0.090848574,0.070243085,-0.073399964,0.018934266,-0.002764022,-0.070567703,-0.013024498999999998,-0.0950852,-0.0040289670000000005,-0.027546042000000003,0.108550751,-0.021878305,-0.08554998800000001,-0.08429223,0.014046965,0.058285265,0.029534078999999998,0.040705386
217,Avian influenza A (H5N1) infection: targets and strategies for chemotherapeutic intervention,"In an avian flu pandemic, which drugs could be used to treat or prevent infection with influenza A (H5N1) virus? Foremost are the viral neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, which have already been used to treat human influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B virus infections. The use of the M2 ion channel blockers amantadine and rimantadine is compounded by the rapid development of drug resistance. Although formally approved for other indications (i.e. treatment of hepatitis C), ribavirin and pegylated interferon might also be useful for controlling avian flu. Combined use of the currently available drugs should be taken into account and attempts should be made to develop new strategies directed at unexplored targets such as the viral proteins hemagglutinin, the viral polymerase (and endonuclease) and the non-structural protein NS1.

223,Expression and purification of turkey coronavirus nucleocapsid protein in Escherichia coli,"Abstract Purification of turkey coronavirus (TCoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein, expressed in a prokaryotic expression system as histidine-tagged fusion protein is demonstrated in the present study. Turkey coronavirus was partially purified from infected intestine of turkey embryo by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and RNA was extracted. The N protein gene was amplified from the extracted RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and cloned. The recombinant expression construct (pTri-N) was identified by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis. Expression of histidine-tagged fusion N protein with a molecular mass of 57kd was determined by Western blotting analysis. By chromatography on nickel-agarose column, the expressed N protein was purified to near homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The protein recovery could be 2.5mg from 100ml of bacterial culture. The purified N protein was recognized by antibody to TCoV in Western blotting assay. The capability of the recombinant N protein to differentiate positive serum of turkey infected with TCoV from normal turkey serum was evident in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). These results indicated that the expressed N protein is a superior source of TCoV antigen for development of antibody-capture ELISA for detection of antibodies to TCoV.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.11793066699999999,-0.010767233999999999,0.033710364,-0.086114716,-0.020804206000000002,-0.013816028000000001,-0.062948622,-0.054710062000000004,0.051803518,-0.031984957,-0.078050737,-0.036698176,0.015099211999999999,0.03174467,-0.051145315999999996,-0.09027843599999999,0.08297517,-0.056593667,-0.002415277,-0.030478001,-0.005938066,0.009175999,0.06188716,-0.039656661,0.040568902000000004,0.098550775,0.037630912,-0.05209363,-0.048644296,0.080052535

The assay is evaluated as a diagnostic test for feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). It is based on a well-documented key event in the development of FIP: the replication of virulent FCoV mutants in monocytes/macrophages. To detect most feline coronavirus field strains, the test was designed to amplify subgenomic mRNA of the highly conserved M gene. The test was applied to 1075 feline blood samples (424 from healthy, 651 from sick cats suspected of FIP) and returned 46% of the diseased cats as positive for feline coronavirus mRNA in their peripheral blood cells; of the healthy cats, 5% tested positive. Of a group of 81 animals in which FIP had been confirmed by post-mortem examination, 75 (93%) tested positive, whereas 17 cats with different pathologies (non-FIP cases) all tested negative. In view of the low rate of false-positive results (high specificity) the mRNA RT-PCR may be a valuable addition to the diagnostic arsenal for FIP.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.019083458,0.046587229,0.145246383,-0.15208981,0.012889781000000001,0.001652754,-0.009446419000000001,0.0025284229999999997,-0.063652764,-0.19451116899999998,0.45883820299999994,-0.157274555,0.240417932,0.006748888000000001,-0.137615754,-0.041724624,0.060791240999999996,0.002231533,-0.018943893,0.058010227000000004,-0.03932095,0.005094548,0.04839633,0.021731791,-0.014826522,0.030429984,-0.005017446,0.039602471,0.038846562,-0.02986382
228,Effects of cold storage on detection of avian infectious bronchitis virus in chicken carcasses and local antibodies in tracheal washes,"Abstract In order to test the survivability of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in dead chicken carcasses during 24h of cold storage, 7 week-old specific-pathogen-free chickens were infected with virulent IBV Massachusetts strain M41, and were killed humanely 10 days later. Carcasses were stored in a cold room at 4°C. After 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 or 24h of storage, necropsies were carried out. Trachea, lung, kidney and rectum were collected for virus isolation by tracheal organ culture (TOC) or embryonated chicken eggs (ECE), and detection by nested reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). IBV was detected by RT-PCR at all sampling times, except for 1 and 6h of storage in kidney and 9h of storage in kidney and rectum. For ECE, isolation was obtained at all sampling points, except at 1 and 24h of storage in lungs. Isolation by tracheal organ cultures was less successful, except from rectum. In addition to sampling for virus, tracheal washes were collected from each carcass to measure the ability to detect local antibodies after storage. Levels of IgA in tracheal washes remained high for up to 9h of storage, suggesting that accurate sampling for research purposes when required must be carried out within this time.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.00509484,0.015572583000000001,0.10430810300000001,-0.074095016,0.05381161,0.037469691,-0.072580885,-0.047726234000000006,0.044517451,0.142458651,0.0572056,-0.009492633,-0.044233817,0.042057062,-0.038028854,0.085788226,0.016876073999999998,-0.002396121,0.008675130999999999,-0.020273422,-0.028921638,-0.006890352,0.0031761479999999997,-0.046021112,0.018576874,0.039469395,-0.013211523000000001,-0.001220412,0.015850839,-0.019796611000000002

234,Evaluation of the efficacy of disinfectants against Puumala hantavirus by real-time RT-PCR,"Abstract Puumala virus, a hantavirus belonging to the Bunyaviridae family, causes a human disease known as nephropathia epidemica, a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The implementation of effective decontamination procedures is critical in hantavirus research to minimize the risk of personnel exposure. This study investigated the efficacy of Clidox®, Dettol®, ethanol, Halamid-d®, peracetic acid, sodium hypochloride and Virkon®S for inactivating Puumala virus. A real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to quantify Puumala virus before and after treatment with these products. Inactivation of Puumala virus was effective after 10min with all products except ethanol. Inactivation with absolute ethanol was effective only after 30min. Using the qRT-PCR method, this study has shown that the commercially available products Clidox®, Halamid-d® and Virkon®S in particular represent a rapid and safe way to decontaminate surfaces with possible Puumala virus contamination. These products can be used in solutions of 1–2%, with contact times greater than 10min, for inactivating effectively Puumala virus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.000314085,0.016914091000000003,0.08298947799999999,0.005536419,-0.033006104,0.040339631,0.0030424859999999996,-0.0038058529999999997,0.030599622000000003,0.034250658999999996,0.000250981,-0.037273605,0.034820912999999995,-0.006161537,0.040928827,-0.006964616,0.004966192,0.025725672,-0.012660076000000001,-0.019660301,-0.016894458,-0.008142353,0.002802905,-0.03144753,-0.024689812999999998,0.035221393999999996,0.029147741,-0.020652741000000002,-0.017049823000000002,0.006382846
239,Rapid molecular detection of the H275Y oseltamivir resistance gene mutation in circulating influenza A (H1N1) viruses,"Abstract In early 2008, drug susceptibility surveillance of influenza viruses in Europe revealed that some influenza A viruses (subtype H1N1) circulating during the winter season of 2007 and 2008 were resistant to the neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir. This resistance arises due to a histidine to tyrosine substitution in the neuraminidase active site (H275Y in N1 nomenclature). Current methods to detect this mutation involve an end-point reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction followed by nucleotide sequencing. While accurate, this approach has the limitation of being time-consuming, labour-intensive and expensive. Herein we describe a one-step allelic discrimination assay which rapidly (2h) detects this resistance mutation. The sensitivity of the assay was as low as 10 copies per reaction and is capable of detecting the antiviral resistance mutation in a mixture of wild type H275 and mutant H275Y targets.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.006901349,-0.020609956999999998,0.069468003,0.112341296,-0.050730372999999995,0.168328337,-0.012658348,-0.0060566840000000005,-0.017857903,-0.037609533,0.003161754,0.061851039000000003,-0.011122756999999999,-0.041894281,0.001536584,0.0034941259999999997,-0.044461633,0.025607669,0.002498532,-0.00238541,0.05472022,-0.008647689,0.020082955,0.079865855,-0.045159131,0.01456359,0.025734292000000002,-0.01370566,0.007323372,-0.017208418
251,SYBR Green based real-time RT-PCR assay for detection and genotype prediction of bovine noroviruses and assessment of clinical significance in Norway,Abstract A novel SYBR Green based real-time RT-PCR assay for detection of genogroup III bovine noroviruses (BoNoV) was developed and the assay applied to 419 faecal samples from calves with and without diarrhoea. The samples were obtained from 190 Norwegian dairy and beef herds. BoNoV was detected in 49.6% of the samples from 61.1% of the herds indicating that BoNoV is ubiquitous in Norway. The overall prevalence was not significantly different in diarrhoea and non-diarrhoea samples. Analyses of polymerase gene sequences revealed both genotype III/1 and III/2 with genotype III/2 (Newbury2-like) being the most prevalent. Detected capsid sequences were restricted to Newbury2-like and the chimeric Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK strain. The RNA polymerase genotypes of the circulating BoNoVs in Norway were predicted by melting temperature analysis. Additional data from a challenge experiment suggest that a high proportion of young calves are shedding low levels of BoNoV for a prolonged time after recovering from the associated diarrhoea. The findings may explain some of the discrepancies in detection rates from previous studies and explain why some studies have failed to detect significant prevalence differences between calves with and without diarrhoea. It may also shed new light on some epidemiological aspects of norovirus infections.,0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.007502796999999999,0.01822891,0.11790095099999999,-0.045160198,0.076909191,-0.01309618,0.018143309,-0.023633341000000002,-0.017861727,-0.033407687,0.02822419,0.054160035999999995,-0.03041142,-0.00363494,0.036069942,-0.038791794,-0.014300626,-0.017174544,0.034255859,-0.053299099999999995,0.046509432999999996,0.025220724,-0.044225815,0.041792112,0.00895913,-0.043410297,0.016170463,-0.072530676,0.047455428,-0.014368546000000001
256,Development of a combined canine distemper virus specific RT-PCR protocol for the differentiation of infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA) and genetic characterization of the hemagglutinin gene of seven Chinese strains demonstrated in dogs,"Abstract A combined reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method was developed for the detection and differentiation of wild-type and vaccine strains of the canine distemper virus (CDV). A pair of primers (P1/P2) was used to detect both CDV wild-type strains and vaccines. Another pair (P3/P4) was used to detect only CDV wild-type strains. A 335bp fragment was amplified from the genomic RNA of the vaccine and wild-type strains. A 555bp fragment was amplified specifically from the genomic RNA of the wild-type strains. No amplification was achieved for the uninfected cells, cells infected with canine parvovirus, canine coronavirus, or canine adenovirus. The combined RT-PCR method detected effectively and differentiated the CDV wild-type and vaccine strains by two separate RT-PCRs. The method can be used for clinical detection and epidemiological surveillance. The phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin gene of the local wild-type CDV strains revealed that the seven local isolates all belonged to the Asia-1 lineage, and were clustered closely with one another at the same location. These results suggested that the CDV genotype Asia-1 is circulating currently in domestic dogs in China.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.049664436,0.029984224,0.17575973399999997,-0.033258845,0.097260568,0.034973096,-0.037793741,-0.035291662,-0.010032151999999999,0.000686619,0.053766339,0.08573484699999999,-0.060985093,0.005449221,0.049245594000000004,-0.032237579,-0.0588585,-0.022271813999999997,0.052144964,0.021823295,0.256606688,0.147800475,-0.053764998,0.075676126,0.217261233,-0.116466919,-0.04650023599999999,-0.003797955,-0.082215546,0.118315663
257,Generation of a mouse scFv library specific for porcine aminopeptidase N using the T7 phage display system,"Abstract Porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) is a common cellular receptor for swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). To investigate single-chain fragment variable (scFv) repertoire against pAPN, the genes encoding the immunoglobulin light chain variable region (VL) and heavy chain variable region (VH) were amplified by reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a series of degenerate primers from the spleen of BABL/c mice immunized with native pAPN. The VL and VH amplicons were combined randomly by a 12 amino acid flexible linker by splicing by overlap extension PCR (SOE-PCR), which produced the scFv gene repertoire. After ligation of the scFv gene repertoire into the T7Select10-3b vector, a mouse scFv phage library specific for pAPN was produced through in vitro packaging. The primary scFv library against pAPN contained 2.0×107 recombinant phage clones, and the titer of the amplified library was 3.6×109 pfu/mL. BstNI restriction analysis and DNA sequencing revealed that 28 phage clones from the primary pAPN scFv library showed excellent diversity. The effectiveness of the scFv library against pAPN was verified further by phage ELISA using the recombinant protein of the pAPN C subunit as coating antigen. The construction and evaluation of a murine scFv library against the common receptor pAPN of porcine coronaviruses TGEV and PEDV using the T7 phage display system are described.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.06355002900000001,0.003246778,0.102779556,-0.075197357,0.05043562099999999,0.02028467,-0.054049373,-0.03024983,0.02046632,-0.043329528,-0.037128862,0.020911143,-0.051560438,0.005406495999999999,0.096755176,-0.113412699,0.013052282,0.012153292,-0.033328157000000004,0.05006065,-0.055335414000000006,-0.024161968,0.07272782700000001,0.00027547,-0.0030282259999999997,0.030837876,0.013134941,-0.014607769,0.008857749,0.038931501
262,Detection and differentiation of field and vaccine strains of canine distemper virus using reverse transcription followed by nested real time PCR (RT-nqPCR) and RFLP analysis,"Abstract Canine distemper virus (CDV) is the cause of a severe and highly contagious disease in dogs. Practical diagnosis of canine distemper based on clinical signs and laboratory tests are required to confirm CDV infection. The present study aimed to develop a molecular assay to detect and differentiate field and vaccine CDV strains. Reverse transcription followed by nested real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-nqPCR) was developed, which exhibited analytical specificity (all the samples from healthy dogs and other canine infectious agents were not incorrectly detected) and sensitivity (all replicates of a vaccine strain were positive up to the 3125-fold dilution – 100.7 TCID50). RT-nqPCR was validated for CDV detection on different clinical samples (blood, urine, rectal and conjunctival swabs) of 103 animals suspected to have distemper. A total of 53 animals were found to be positive based on RT-nqPCR in at least one clinical sample. Blood resulted in more positive samples (50 out of 53, 94.3%), followed by urine (44/53, 83.0%), rectal (38/53, 71%) and conjunctival (27/53, 50.9%) swabs. A commercial immunochromatography (IC) assay had detected CDV in only 30 conjunctival samples of these positive dogs. Nucleoprotein (NC) gene sequencing of 25 samples demonstrated that 23 of them were closer to other Brazilian field strains and the remaining two to vaccine strains. A single nucleotide sequences difference, which creates an Msp I restriction enzyme digestion, was used to differentiate between field and vaccine CDV strains by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The complete assay was more sensitive than was IC for the detection of CDV. Blood was the more frequently positive specimen and the addition of a restriction enzyme step allowed the differentiation of vaccine and Brazilian field strains.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.036959919,0.057199680999999995,0.196368509,-0.053542455999999995,0.076950144,0.011491748000000001,-0.028371692999999996,-0.01899319,-0.025704998,-0.001095588,0.083497605,0.079332448,-0.070790355,-0.015297078,0.043399287,-0.054390792,-0.028308365,-0.03371546,0.106427743,0.019270827,0.197716636,0.11503521300000001,-0.072347041,0.027989319,0.205065112,-0.119728461,-0.055244124000000006,-0.025428832000000002,-0.045371459,0.093237797
279,Comparison of immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies and RT-PCR for the detection of human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 in cell culture,"Abstract Human coronaviruses, with two known serogroups named 229E and OC43, cause up to one third of common colds and may be associated with serious diseases such as nosocomial respiratory infections, enterocolitis, pericarditis and neurological disorders. Reliable methods of detection in clinical samples are needed for a better understanding of their role in pathology. As a first step in the design of such diagnostic procedures, the sensitivities and specificities of two viral diagnostic assays were compared in an experimental cell culture model: an indirect immuno-fluorescence assay using monoclonal antibodies and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification of viral RNA from infected cells. Immunofluorescence detected human coronaviruses in cells infected at a MOI as low as 10−2 (log TCID50/ml=4.25 for HCV-229E and 2.0 for HCV-OC43; log PFU/ml=4.83 for HCV-229E and 1.84 for HCV-OC43) versus 10−3 (HCV-OC43) or 10−4 (HCV-229E) for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification (log TCID50/ml=1.75 for HCV-229E and 1.5 for HCV-OC43; log PFU/ml=2.3 for HCV-229E and 1.34 for HCV-OC43). There were no false positive signals with other human respiratory pathogens: influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus. Moreover, each assay was coronavirus serogroup-specific. These results demonstrate the potential usefulness of immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction RNA amplification for the rapid detection of human coronaviruses in infected cell cultures. Both methods could be applied to clinical specimens for the diagnosis of human infections.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.018591956,-0.009612492,0.037332513,0.051093274,-0.021284857999999997,-0.036964672999999997,0.074093304,-0.03023967,0.08189136799999999,-0.006828375,-0.049458500999999995,0.126646294,0.170533779,0.099694475,-0.00462988,-0.053967979000000006,0.022708681,0.239966325,0.31966495100000003,-0.100784082,-0.090349233,-0.052397975,0.157137482,0.045632667,-0.068131405,-0.079936071,-0.10317804900000001,0.105891969,-0.149973826,-0.057014119

286,Effective inhibition of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus replication in ST cells by shRNAs targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene,"Abstract Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is identified as one of the most important pathogenic agents during swine enteric infection, leading to high mortality in neonatal pigs and severe annual economic loss in swine-producing areas. Up to date, various vaccines developed against TGEV still need to be improved. To exploit the possibility of using RNA interference (RNAi) as a strategy against TGEV infection, two shRNA-expressing plasmids (pEGFP-U6/P1 and pEGFP-U6/P2) targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of TGEV were constructed and transfected into swine testicular (ST) cells. The cytopathic effect (CPE) and MTS assays demonstrated that both shRNAs were capable of protecting cells against TGEV invasion with very high specificity and efficiency. A real-time quantitative RT-PCR further confirmed that the amounts of viral RNAs in cell cultures pre-transfected with the two plasmids were reduced by 95.2% and up to 100%, respectively. Our results suggest that RNAi might be a promising new strategy against TGEV infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.090193995,-8.01e-05,0.051107888,-0.000114476,-0.029001327,-0.000912449,-0.02263916,-0.007093566999999999,0.011856471,-0.029172872000000002,0.016024582,0.015856004,-0.056994107,0.049896959000000005,0.074690936,-0.028038933,-0.023296599999999997,0.004184377,0.0271349,0.03004036,0.003607149,0.017018707,0.046074332999999995,-0.0032112620000000003,0.030665367000000002,0.013247581999999999,0.027282725,-0.046815429000000006,5.6999999999999996e-05,0.04163453
287,T-705 (favipiravir) and related compounds: Novel broad-spectrum inhibitors of RNA viral infections,"Abstract A series of pyrazinecarboxamide derivatives T-705 (favipiravir), T-1105 and T-1106 were discovered to be candidate antiviral drugs. These compounds have demonstrated good activity in treating viral infections in laboratory animals caused by various RNA viruses, including influenza virus, arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Treatment has in some cases been effective when initiated up to 5–7 days after virus infection, when the animals already showed signs of illness. Studies on the mechanism of action of T-705 have shown that this compound is converted to the ribofuranosyltriphosphate derivative by host enzymes, and this metabolite selectively inhibits the influenza viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase without cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. Interestingly, these compounds do not inhibit host DNA and RNA synthesis and inosine 5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) activity. From in vivo studies using several animal models, the pyrazinecarboxamide derivatives were found to be effective in protecting animals from death, reducing viral burden, and limiting disease manifestations, even when treatment was initiated after virus inoculation. Importantly, T-705 imparts its beneficial antiviral effects without significant toxicity to the host. Prompt development of these compounds is expected to provide effective countermeasures against pandemic influenza virus and several bioweapon threats, all of which are of great global public health concern given the current paucity of highly effective broad-spectrum drugs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.074061284,-0.070171132,-0.06265130299999999,0.133236965,-0.123241306,0.17589844899999998,0.06050973900000001,0.004763248,0.015902305,0.047797297999999995,0.059037843,-0.017743898,0.026595413999999998,0.029439253999999998,0.033999212,-0.005361396,-0.044148539,0.099721152,0.053276565,0.047966292,-0.013066733,0.03752868,-0.071625147,0.045697535,0.00965523,-0.0060772230000000005,0.044676822000000005,-0.031180804,0.040124637000000005,0.045047643
289,Expression of an antiviral protein from Lonomia obliqua hemolymph in baculovirus/insect cell system,"Abstract The control of viral infections, mainly those caused by influenza viruses, is of great interest in Public Health. Several studies have shown the presence of active properties in the hemolymph of arthropods, some of which are of interest for the development of new pharmacological drugs. Recently, we have demonstrated the existence of a potent antiviral property in the hemolymph of Lonomia obliqua caterpillars. The aim of this study was to produce an antiviral protein in a baculovirus/Sf9 cell system. The resulting bacmid contains the sequence coding for the antiviral protein previously described by our group. Total RNA from L. obliqua caterpillars was extracted with Trizol and used in the reverse transcription assay with oligo(d)T primer followed by polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) with specific primers for the cDNA coding for the antiviral protein, based on the sequence deposited in the GenBank database. Restriction sites were inserted in the cDNA for ligation in the donor plasmid pFastBac1™. The recombinant plasmid was selected in Escherichia coli DH5α and subsequently used in the transformation of E. coli DH10Bac for the construction of the recombinant bacmid. This bacmid was used for the expression of the antiviral protein in the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system. After identifying the protein by western blot, activity tests were performed, showing that the purified recombinant protein was able to significantly reduce viral replication (about 4 logs). Studies on the optimization of the expression system for the production of this antiviral protein in insect cells are in progress.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.13598713,-0.040202596,0.013782497,0.03039005,-0.085092053,0.064040382,-0.028750092999999997,-0.052656241,0.068981689,-0.00321313,-0.071008492,-0.026122077999999996,0.037118122999999996,0.041420344,-0.036049229,-0.10317501300000001,0.058142072999999996,0.040071752,0.049036954,-0.006847001,-0.008609164,0.030278731,0.029939679,0.043120214000000004,0.039266737,0.103210144,0.095626634,-0.071748985,0.001591191,0.100584859
290,dsRNA binding characterization of full length recombinant wild type and mutants Zaire ebolavirus VP35,"Abstract The Ebola viruses (EBOVs) VP35 protein is a multifunctional major virulence factor involved in EBOVs replication and evasion of the host immune system. EBOV VP35 is an essential component of the viral RNA polymerase, it is a key participant of the nucleocapsid assembly and it inhibits the innate immune response by antagonizing RIG-I like receptors through its dsRNA binding function and, hence, by suppressing the host type I interferon (IFN) production. Insights into the VP35 dsRNA recognition have been recently revealed by structural and functional analysis performed on its C-terminus protein. We report the biochemical characterization of the Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) full-length recombinant VP35 (rVP35)–dsRNA binding function. We established a novel in vitro magnetic dsRNA binding pull down assay, determined the rVP35 optimal dsRNA binding parameters, measured the rVP35 equilibrium dissociation constant for heterologous in vitro transcribed dsRNA of different length and short synthetic dsRNA of 8bp, and validated the assay for compound screening by assessing the inhibitory ability of auryntricarboxylic acid (IC50 value of 50μg/mL). Furthermore, we compared the dsRNA binding properties of full length wt rVP35 with those of R305A, K309A and R312A rVP35 mutants, which were previously reported to be defective in dsRNA binding-mediated IFN inhibition, showing that the latter have measurably increased K d values for dsRNA binding and modified migration patterns in mobility shift assays with respect to wt rVP35. Overall, these results provide the first characterization of the full-length wt and mutants VP35–dsRNA binding functions.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.11714954,-0.030945563,-0.011728668000000001,-0.022819912999999997,-0.06234833,0.022322962999999998,0.047977412000000004,-0.007960124,0.018994887,-0.011804838,-0.012412321,0.020061566,-0.03095272,0.007891214,-0.03263109,-0.008351391,0.01650297,-0.04219682599999999,-0.029769816,-0.002497544,0.013680023999999999,-3.3e-05,0.000494751,-0.008237561,-0.005632113,0.009594749,0.023871296,-0.007326401999999999,-0.00802909,-0.0015089379999999998
291,Artificial microRNAs can effectively inhibit replication of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus,"Abstract Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus is a member of the alphavirus family and genus togaviridae. VEEV is highly infectious in aerosol form and has been weaponized in the past making it a potential biothreat agent. At present, there are no FDA approved antiviral treatments or vaccines for VEEV. Artificial microRNAs are small molecules which are expressed through endogenous microRNA machinery by RNA polymerase II. These artificial microRNAs effectively inhibit gene expression and are non-toxic to the host cell. VEEV RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is central to VEEV replication. Therefore, we hypothesize that targeted inhibition of VEEV RdRp using artificial microRNAs may efficiently inhibit VEEV replication. Five artificial microRNAs were tested in vitro in BHK cells. Three of these artificial miRNAs showed significant inhibition of VEEV replication. Further, these microRNAs were cloned into the expression vector in combination to see the synergistic effect on VEEV replication. Combination of more than one miRNA did not result in significant inhibition of virus replication. In conclusion, we have shown that RNAi through artificial microRNAs effectively inhibits VEEV replication and is significantly less toxic in comparison to siRNAs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.125297656,-0.038411844,-0.027600185,-0.011950932,-0.068443082,0.028727875,0.03998272,-0.008492059,0.017680428999999998,0.00726122,0.02397808,0.014527523999999998,-0.037652343,0.045465767000000004,0.006902620999999999,0.022017805,-0.005098958,0.0013474420000000001,0.013788603,-0.011643529,0.018519887,0.007536694,0.010090984,-0.014158036,0.0017439,0.013341243999999999,0.00484796,-0.000932933,0.00196915,0.0049689109999999995
293,Inhibition of enterovirus 71 infection by antisense octaguanidinium dendrimer-conjugated morpholino oligomers,"Abstract Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) infections are generally manifested as mild hand, foot and mouth disease, but have been reported to cause severe neurological complications with high mortality rates. Treatment options remain limited due to the lack of antivirals. Octaguanidinium-conjugated morpholino oligomers (vivo-MOs) are single-stranded DNA-like antisense agents that can readily penetrate cells and reduce gene expression by steric blocking of complementary RNA sequences. In this study, inhibitory effects of three vivo-MOs that are complementary to the EV-71 internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) were tested in RD cells. Vivo-MO-1 and vivo-MO-2 targeting the EV-71 IRES showed significant viral plaque reductions of 2.5 and 3.5 log10PFU/ml, respectively. Both vivo-MOs reduced viral RNA copies and viral capsid expression in RD cells in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, vivo-MO-3 targeting the EV-71 RdRP exhibited less antiviral activity. Both vivo-MO-1 and 2 remained active when administered either 4h before or within 6h after EV-71 infection. Vivo-MO-2 exhibited antiviral activities against poliovirus (PV) and coxsackievirus A16 but vivo-MO-1 showed no antiviral activities against PV. Both the IRES-targeting vivo-MO-1 and vivo-MO-2 inhibit EV-71 RNA translation. Resistant mutants arose after serial passages in the presence of vivo-MO-1, but none were isolated against vivo-MO-2. A single T to C substitution at nucleotide position 533 was sufficient to confer resistance to vivo-MO-1. Our findings suggest that IRES-targeting vivo-MOs are good antiviral candidates for treating early EV-71 infection, and vivo-MO-2 is a more favorable candidate with broader antiviral spectrum against enteroviruses and are refractory to antiviral resistance.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.096572684,-0.040725425,-0.027829747999999998,-0.01561753,-0.065804225,0.025492676000000002,0.047590673,-0.00172436,0.017670017,0.009714882,0.030278921,0.036983357,-0.029084187,0.002347936,-0.000139441,0.00575308,-0.022565117000000003,0.037651695,0.028770715,-0.027999715,0.031685589,-0.005242254,-0.0056590469999999995,0.028524978,-0.011052652,0.005617692,0.0030900759999999998,0.011388167,0.04053037,0.014804135
294,"Meeting report: 27th International conference on antiviral research, in Raleigh, NC, USA","Abstract The 27th International Conference on Antiviral Research (ICAR) was held in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA from May 12 to 16, 2014. This article summarizes the principal invited lectures. John Drach (Elion Award) described the early days of antiviral drugs and their novel modes of action. Piet Herdewijn (Holý Award) used evolutionary pressure to select DNA polymerases that accept nucleoside analogs. Replacing thymine by 5-chlorouracil led to the generation of a new form of Escherichia coli. Adrian Ray (Prusoff Award) demonstrated how prodrugs can markedly improve both the efficacy and safety of potential drugs. The keynote addresses, by David Margolis and Myron Cohen, tackled two emerging areas of HIV research, to find an HIV “cure” and to prevent HIV transmission, respectively. These topics were discussed further in other presentations – a cure seems to be a distant prospect but there are exciting developments for reducing HIV transmission. TDF-containing vaginal rings and GSK-744, as a long-lasting injection, offer great hope. There were three mini-symposia. Although therapy with TDF/FTC gives excellent control of HBV replication, there are only a few patients who achieve a functional cure. Myrcludex, an entry inhibitor, is active against both HBV and HDV. The recent progress with HBV replication in cell cultures has transformed the search for new antiviral compounds. The HBV capsid protein has been recognized as key player in HBV DNA synthesis. Unexpectedly, compounds which enhance capsid formation, markedly reduce HBV DNA synthesis. The development of BCX4430, which is active against Marburg and Ebola viruses, is of great current interest.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.082959651,-0.025120458,-0.01564079,-0.037620648,-0.128250524,0.090095891,0.09357112599999999,0.011800631,0.024442972,0.033517411000000004,-0.017921776,0.043111532,0.009052105999999999,-0.018252887,-0.002483008,0.01239782,-0.034640258,0.10038898,0.053038307,0.003588074,-0.018769186,0.020135857,-0.036615729,0.057027742,0.024421388,-0.003255033,0.015734238,-0.051856582000000005,0.044993708,0.009212969
295,The Herpes Simplex Virus-1 genome contains multiple clusters of repeated G-quadruplex: Implications for the antiviral activity of a G-quadruplex ligand,"Abstract Guanine-rich nucleic acids can fold into G-quadruplexes, secondary structures implicated in important regulatory functions at the genomic level in humans, prokaryotes and viruses. The remarkably high guanine content of the Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) genome prompted us to investigate both the presence of G-quadruplex forming sequences in the viral genome and the possibility to target them with G-quadruplex ligands to obtain anti-HSV-1 effects with a novel mechanism of action. Using biophysical, molecular biology and antiviral assays, we showed that the HSV-1 genome displays multiple clusters of repeated sequences that form very stable G-quadruplexes. These sequences are mainly located in the inverted repeats of the HSV-1 genome. Treatment of HSV-1 infected cells with the G-quadruplex ligand BRACO-19 induced inhibition of virus production. BRACO-19 was able to inhibit Taq polymerase processing at G-quadruplex forming sequences in the HSV-1 genome, and decreased intracellular viral DNA in infected cells. The last step targeted by BRACO-19 was viral DNA replication, while no effect on virus entry in the cells was observed. This work, presents the first evidence of extended G-quadruplex sites in key regions of the HSV-1 genome, indicates the possibility to block viral DNA replication by G-quadruplex-ligand and therefore provides a proof of concept for the use of G-quadruplex ligands as new anti-herpetic therapeutic options.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.10659270400000001,-0.035759177999999996,0.001884407,-0.023312436000000002,-0.056136272,0.035423933,0.044842993,-0.009269771,0.026574635,0.023716523,-0.035429637,-0.024536798,0.040890281,-0.004210296,0.013262936000000001,0.010982003999999998,-0.033028192000000005,0.017344128,-0.006412175,0.013865185,-0.011440292,0.034118044,-0.051074755,0.021569796000000002,-0.015775065,-0.010110502,0.026063648,0.006616021999999999,-0.0033715140000000004,0.02674351

With emerging resistance to the drugs currently licensed for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza viruses, primarily the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu) and the M2 inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine, and the lack of effective interventions against other respiratory viruses, the 3-day programme focused on the discovery and development of inhibitors of several virus targets and key host cell factors involved in virus replication or mediating the inflammatory response. Virus targets included the influenza haemagglutinin, neuraminidase and M2 proteins, and both the respiratory syncytial virus and influenza polymerases and nucleoproteins. Therapies for rhinoviruses and MERS and SARS coronaviruses were also discussed. With the emerging development of monoclonal antibodies as therapeutics, the potential implications of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease were also addressed. Topics covered all aspects from structural and molecular biology to preclinical and clinical studies. The importance of suitable clinical trial endpoints and regulatory issues were also discussed from the perspectives of both industry and government.

297,Identification of a novel small-molecule compound targeting the influenza A virus polymerase PB1-PB2 interface,"Abstract The PB1 C-terminal domain and PB2 N-terminal domain interaction of the influenza A polymerase, which modulates the assembly of PB1 and PB2 subunits, may serve as a valuable target for the development of novel anti-influenza therapeutics. In this study, we performed a systematic screening of a chemical library, followed by the antiviral evaluation of primary hits and their analogues. Eventually, a novel small-molecule compound PP7 that abrogated the PB1-PB2 association and impaired viral polymerase activity was identified. PP7 exhibited antiviral activities against influenza virus subtypes A (H1N1)pdm09, A(H7N9) and A(H9N2) in cell cultures and partially protected mice against lethal challenge of mouse-adapted influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus. Surprisingly, a panel of other subtypes of influenza virus, including A(H5N1) and A(H7N7), showed various degrees of resistance to the compound. Biochemical studies revealed a similar pattern of resistance on the impairment of polymerase activity. Molecular docking analyses suggested a PP7-binding site that appeared to be completely conserved among the subtypes of the virus mentioned above. Thus, we propose that alternative/additional binding site (s) may exist for the regulation of PB1-PB2 subunits assembly of influenza A virus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.034799339,-0.090493523,-0.033827675,0.128865869,-0.071547347,0.28348420399999996,-0.072583485,-0.010170293,-0.001830759,-0.070294976,-0.008847139,0.043611594000000004,0.00560705,-0.027414139,-0.019348313,-0.01486295,0.022659983999999998,0.013508438999999999,-0.001806194,-0.012240326000000001,0.02874626,-0.006461346,0.026793105,0.011293791999999999,0.017370194,0.064632545,-0.013723726,0.00058022,0.050014697000000004,0.024423603999999998
298,Ribavirin inhibits Zika virus (ZIKV) replication in vitro and suppresses viremia in ZIKV-infected STAT1-deficient mice,"Abstract Zika fever, a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by Zika virus (ZIKV), is an epidemic disease for which no effective therapy has been established. The recent outbreaks of ZIKV in Brazil and French Polynesia have been linked to a considerable increase in the incidence of fetal microcephaly and other diseases such as Guillain-Barre syndrome. Because there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine, the early exploitation of a method to prevent expansion of ZIKV is a high priority. To validate commonly used antiviral drugs, we evaluated the effect of ribavirin, a drug used to treat hepatitis C with interferon-β (IFN-β), on ZIKV replication. In mammalian cells, we observed an inhibitory effect of ribavirin on ZIKV replication and ZIKV-induced cell death without cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, we found that STAT1-deficient mice, which lack type I IFN signaling, were highly sensitive to ZIKV infection and exhibited lethal outcome. Ribavirin abrogated viremia in ZIKV-infected STAT-1-deficient mice. These data suggest that the inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases may be effective for treatment of ZIKV infection. Our data provide a new insight into the mechanisms for inhibition of ZIKV replication and prevention of Zika fever.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.079488712,-0.02163104,-0.006569368000000001,-0.039943996,-0.10909777699999999,0.069409348,0.067279278,-0.002465157,0.045410226,0.034658065,0.010153558,-0.000932358,-0.00155394,0.023075186,0.01573782,0.024838328,-0.045652492,0.068398905,-0.002912573,0.031703777,0.004518287,-0.010575336999999999,-0.019432915,0.029201004,0.036309929,0.010013079,0.014377375,-0.005170816,-0.029071027000000003,0.015037493999999998
303,Calf-level risk factors for neonatal diarrhea and shedding of Cryptosporidium parvum in Ontario dairy calves,"Abstract This work was conducted to investigate calf-level factors that influence the risk of neonatal diarrhea and shedding of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts in calves, on dairy farms in Ontario with histories of calf diarrhea or cryptosporidiosis. Fecal samples were collected weekly for 4 weeks from each of 1045 calves under 30 days of age on 11 dairy farms in south-western Ontario during the summer of 2003 and the winter of 2004. A questionnaire designed to gather information on calf-level management factors was administered on farm for each calf in the study. Samples were examined for C. parvum oocysts by microscopy, and a subset of specimens was also tested for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella, bovine rotavirus and bovine coronavirus. The consistency of each sample was scored and recorded at the time of collection in order to assess the presence or absence of diarrhea. In addition, a blood sample was taken from each calf upon enrolment in the study, for assessment of maternal antibody transfer and for polymerase chain reaction testing for persistent bovine viral diarrhea virus infection. Using the GLLAMM function in Stata 9.0, multilevel regression techniques were employed to investigate associations between management practices and the risk of C. parvum shedding or diarrhea. C. parvum oocysts were detected in the feces of 78% of the 919 calves from which all four fecal samples had been collected. Furthermore, 73% of the 846 calves for which all four fecal consistency scores had been recorded were diarrheic at the time of collection of at least one sample. Significant predictors of the calf-level risk of C. parvum shedding included the use of calf diarrhea prophylaxis in pregnant cows, and the type of maternity facilities in which the calves were born. Factors associated with an increased risk of diarrhea were leaving the calf with the dam for more than an hour after birth, and the birth of a calf in the summer as opposed to winter. Calves shedding C. parvum oocysts had 5.3 (95% CI 4.4, 6.4) times the odds of diarrhea than non-shedding calves, controlling for other factors included in the final multivariable model. Furthermore, infected calves shedding more than 2.2×105 oocysts per gram of feces were more likely to scour than infected calves shedding lower numbers of oocysts (OR=6.1, 95% CI 4.8, 7.8). The odds of diarrhea in calves shedding oocysts that had been allowed to remain with their dams for more than an hour were higher than the odds of diarrhea in shedding calves that had been separated from their dams within an hour after birth.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.007742858,-0.015676577,0.043829677000000004,-0.132412034,0.012232904,0.021440467,0.026508275,-0.013424229,-0.022110189,-0.071124066,0.058494366,0.061999334,-0.06107978,-0.030651319,0.076034042,-0.009729202,-0.032501229,-0.028602611,0.012727303999999998,-0.032754632,-0.062086404000000005,0.003021543,-0.056378095999999996,0.000783354,0.051729369000000004,-0.057691333,-0.012600527,-0.166465523,0.006286997,-0.024090248999999998
304,Molecular detection of canine parvovirus in flies (Diptera) at open and closed canine facilities in the eastern United States,"Abstract More than thirty years have passed since canine parvovirus (CPV) emerged as a significant pathogen and it continues to pose a severe threat to world canine populations. Published information suggests that flies (Diptera) may play a role in spreading this virus; however, they have not been studied extensively and the degree of their involvement is not known. This investigation was directed toward evaluating the vector capacity of such flies and determining their potential role in the transmission and ecology of CPV. Molecular diagnostic methods were used in this cross-sectional study to detect the presence of CPV in flies trapped at thirty-eight canine facilities. The flies involved were identified as belonging to the house fly (Mucidae), flesh fly (Sarcophagidae) and blow/bottle fly (Calliphoridae) families. A primary surveillance location (PSL) was established at a canine facility in south-central South Carolina, USA, to identify fly–virus interaction within the canine facility environment. Flies trapped at this location were pooled monthly and assayed for CPV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. These insects were found to be positive for CPV every month from February through the end of November 2011. Fly vector behavior and seasonality were documented and potential environmental risk factors were evaluated. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare the mean numbers of each of the three fly families captured, and after determining fly CPV status (positive or negative), it was determined whether there were significant relationships between numbers of flies captured, seasonal numbers of CPV cases, temperature and rainfall. Flies were also sampled at thirty-seven additional canine facility surveillance locations (ASL) and at four non-canine animal industry locations serving as negative field controls. Canine facility risk factors were identified and evaluated. Statistical analyses were conducted on the number of CPV cases reported within the past year to determine the correlation of fly CPV status (positive or negative) for each facility, facility design (open or closed), mean number of dogs present monthly and number of flies captured. Significant differences occurred between fly CPV positive vs. negative sites with regard to their CPV case numbers, fly numbers captured, and number of dogs present. At the ASL, a statistically significant relationship was found between PCR-determined fly CPV status (positive or negative) and facility design (open vs. closed). Open-facility designs were likely to have more CPV outbreaks and more likely to have flies testing positive for CPV DNA.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.0031716340000000004,-0.007864515,0.049737454,-0.077878125,0.012711723999999999,0.023404926,0.025200259,0.023749075,-0.019849197,-0.046507455,0.026305863,0.025769852000000003,-0.024755948,-0.061423770999999995,0.035844735,-0.004271414,-0.03069467,-0.065706367,0.077140058,-0.007845454,0.122185326,0.087622675,-0.088956795,-0.060116903,0.09230407300000001,-0.096060063,-0.065974282,-0.001954216,-0.042932644000000006,0.055790853
305,Heterologous expression of fused genes encoding the glycoprotein 5 from PRRSV: A way for producing functional protein in prokaryotic microorganism,"Abstract Based on the bioinformatics analysis of the gene encoding glycoprotein 5 (GP5) of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) isolate HH08, two gene fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), deleting the signal peptide and transmembrane sequences in GP5 gene. Both gene fragments were designated GP5a and GP5b, respectively. They were ligated with a linker and cloned into prokaryotic expression vector, pET-30a. Expression of the protein of interest was induced by isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. The purified protein was used as an immunogen to elicit antibody in rabbit. The immunoreactivity of the protein was determined using ELISA and Western blot. Biologically active GP5 and anti-GP5 antibody inhibited cell infection by PRRSV.

306,A recombinant Fab neutralizes dengue virus in vitro,"Abstract A recombinant Fab that recognizes a neutralizing epitope located in the (296–400) region of protein E of dengue virus was obtained from cloned hybridoma cells secreting the mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4E11. The Fd and light chain antibody genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, cloned into the phagemid vector pMad, expressed in bacteria to produce Fab fragments and sequenced. The mAb 4E11, in particular its light chain complementary-determining regions, shared homologies with two other anti-viral mAbs. The affinity of the parental mAb and the cloned Fab to the MalE-E(296–400) fusion protein were shown to be of the same magnitude, i.e. nanomolar. Fab 4E11 neutralization capacity was found between 8 and 4-times or less lower than that of mAb 4E11, depending on serotypes, thus the Fab could have a smaller antiviral activity than the mAb in vitro.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.08434928300000001,-0.032471054,0.006204637,-0.073148037,-0.026037507999999997,0.02154767,-0.029108323999999998,-0.031080518999999997,0.039338901,-0.02369039,-0.042291048,-0.000525086,0.0032202140000000003,-0.017078566,0.002742532,-0.032900938,0.021984375,0.0026781279999999997,0.002115201,-0.009470316999999999,0.009605339000000001,-0.005154791,0.040590964,0.01093127,0.044811998,0.07654502099999999,0.020768681,-0.027840867000000002,-0.033211086,0.049598025
307,Molecular confirmation of an adenovirus in brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula),"Abstract Partial genome characterisation of a non-cultivable marsupial adenovirus is described. Adenovirus-like particles were found by electron microscopy (EM) in the intestinal contents of brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) in New Zealand. Using degenerate PCR primers complementary to the most conserved genome regions of adenoviruses, the complete nucleotide sequence of the penton base gene, and partial nucleotide sequences of the DNA polymerase, hexon, and pVII genes were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis of the penton base gene strongly suggested that the brushtail possum adenovirus (candidate PoAdV-1) belongs to the recently proposed genus Atadenovirus. Sequence analysis of the PCR products amplified from the intestinal contents of brushtail possums originating from different geographical regions of New Zealand identified a single genotype.

308,Molecular characterization of noroviruses detected in diarrheic stools of Michigan and Wisconsin dairy calves: circulation of two distinct subgroups,"Abstract Noroviruses have emerged as the leading worldwide cause of acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis in humans. The presence of noroviruses in diarrheic stool samples from calves on Michigan and Wisconsin dairy farms was investigated by RT-PCR. Norovirus-positive samples were found on all eight farms studied in Michigan and on 2 out of 14 farms in Wisconsin. Phylogenetic analyses of partial polymerase and capsid sequences, derived for a subset of these bovine noroviruses, showed that these strains formed a group which is genetically distinct from the human noroviruses, but more closely related to genogroup I than to genogroup II human noroviruses. Examination of 2 full and 10 additional partial capsid (ORF2) sequences of these bovine strains revealed the presence of two genetic subgroups or clusters of bovine noroviruses circulating on Michigan and Wisconsin farms. One subgroup is “Jena-like”, the other “Newbury agent-2-like”.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.034185107,-0.002786846,0.062214952999999996,-0.089433007,0.113893581,0.037697181,0.018111827,-0.007656149,-0.017147469,-0.012084505,0.015706005,0.07114728,-0.035857804,-0.018319224,0.038387031,-0.0461276,-0.010985998,0.020386914,0.019767502,-0.013063305,0.062275447000000005,0.043523563,-0.065570183,0.046307823,0.028938796,-0.046341335,-0.005732207,-0.047843763,0.049574732,-0.014532053999999999
316,Comparative sequence analysis of the distal one-third of the genomes of a systemic and an enteric ferret coronavirus,"Abstract Ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV) infection is associated with an emerging, highly fatal disease of ferrets. Enhanced macrophage tropism and the resulting induction of pyogranulomatous lesions are shared with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) infection in cats, but are not features of ferret enteric coronavirus (FRECV) infection. Comparative sequence analysis of the distal one-third of the genomes of one FRSCV and one FRECV strain showed that these two ferret coronaviruses share >96% nucleotide sequence identities in the membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and non-structural protein genes (partial polymerase, open reading frames [ORFs] 3 and 7b). The envelope (E) protein gene showed a moderate nucleotide sequence similarity of 91.6%. In contrast, nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities observed with the spike (S) protein were only 79.5 and 79.6%, respectively. Twenty-one amino acid differences within a 195–199-amino acid C-terminal portion of the S protein were conserved between 3 strains each of FRSCV and FRECV. Both systemic and enteric strains were found to carry a single ORF 3 gene with truncated proteins observed in two out of three FRSCV strains examined. The two enteric strains analyzed each contained an intact ORF 3 gene. Phylogenetically, FRSCV is more closely related to FRECV than to other group 1 coronaviruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.133446411,-0.022336967000000003,0.011771786000000001,-0.125005629,0.155768932,0.018419858,-0.094376153,-0.016791764,0.028012301,-0.045470832,0.0032379740000000002,-0.007759401,0.089590744,-0.131543368,-0.077318548,-0.138425558,0.06666516900000001,0.017571132,0.006369645,0.070428479,0.02454222,-0.017471977,-0.028114275,0.037934052,0.031470304,0.028757513999999998,0.034414935,-0.041549611,-0.063974142,0.033932951
317,Inhibition of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) replication in mini-pigs by shRNA,"Abstract Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is the causative agent of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), characterized by high mortality and severely retarded growth in piglets that dramatically affects the porcine industry. Previously, we have identified two shRNA-expressing plasmids pEGFP-U6/P1 and pEGFP-U6/P2 that target RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene of TGEV with more than 95% of virus inhibition in vitro. In this study, inhibition of the TGEV replication by pEGFP-U6/P1 and pEGFP-U6/P2 was tested in mini-pigs. SPF mini-pigs at 25 days old were injected with the shRNA-expressing plasmids and then infected with TGEV. The results from the analyses of clinical signs, histopathology, indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and RT-PCR show that the two shRNA-expressing plasmids could significantly decrease the quantity of TGEV in different organs and protect mini-pigs from TGEV infection.

319,Intracerebral delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) using adenoviral vector protects mice against lethal peripheral rabies challenge,"Abstract To investigate the potential of RNA interference (RNAi) as antiviral agent against rabies, two small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting rabies virus (RABV) nucleoprotein (N) and polymerase (L) genes were designed and evaluated. Both siRNAs knockdown or silenced the target RABV genes as evaluated in a plasmid based transient expression model. For efficient delivery, adenoviruses expressing the siRNAs were constructed and antiviral potential of the delivered siRNAs was investigated in BHK-21 cells. When cells treated with adenoviruses expressing siRNAs were challenged with RABV, there was 88.35±2.4% and 41.52±9.3% reduction in RABV multiplication in infected cells with siRNAs targeting RABV-N and L genes, respectively. Relative quantification of RABV transcripts using real-time PCR revealed knockdown of both RABV-N and L gene transcripts, however, significant reduction was observed only with adenovirus expressing siRNA against RABV-N. When mice treated intracerebrally with adenoviruses expressing siRNAs were challenged peripherally with lethal RABV by the intramuscular route in masseter muscle, there was 66.6% and 33.3% protection with adenoviruses expressing siRNAs against RABV-N and L genes, respectively. These results demonstrated that adenovirus expressing siRNA against RABV-N efficiently inhibited the RABV multiplication both, in vitro and in vivo and conferred significant protection against lethal RABV challenge. This supported the hypothesis that RNAi, based on siRNA targeting RABV-N gene can prevent RABV infection and holds the potential of RNAi as an approach to prevent rabies infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.059876219,-0.021722734,0.013507833,-0.070815398,-0.038266409,0.03775441,0.014925066,-0.01357367,0.032851057,-0.026355757999999996,-0.025040304,-0.009888533,-0.018079568,0.021221335,0.023415836000000002,0.020920831,-0.029500754,0.006173936999999999,0.008606103,-0.033239189,0.026514468,0.010813369,0.011953567,0.01107762,-0.02312062,-0.002473086,0.015038458999999999,0.01248586,0.018819962,-0.006178594

In the present study, stool samples from 144 dogs were analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for CPV-2, and 29.2% (42/144) of them were positive. From the 42 positive strains, 71.4% (30) of the dogs had signs of haemorrhagic gastroenteritis. The sequencing of the 583bp fragment of the VP2 gene from the positive strains identified 78.6% (33/42) of them as type 2c, 19% (8/42) as type 2b and 2.4% (1/42) as type 2a.

322,A study of the virulence in mice of high copying fidelity variants of human enterovirus 71,"Abstract Polioviruses with a G64S mutation in the 3D polymerase have enhanced replication fidelity and are attenuated in animal models. Here we describe the mouse virulence properties of high replication fidelity 3D polymerase variants of human enterovirus 71 (HEV71), with mutations at positions 3D-S264L, 3D-G64R or at 3D-S264L plus 3D-G64R. Mouse-adapted strains (MP-G64R, MP-S264L and MP-S264L-G64R) were constructed in order to compare the virulence of the 3D polymerase variants with that of mouse-adapted parental virus (MP-26M). MP-S264L and MP-S264L-G64R were attenuated in mice (mean survival time 7.0 and 7.5 days p.i., respectively) compared to MP-G64R and MP-26M (mean survival time 6.5 and 6.0 days p.i., respectively). MP-26M and MP-G64R infection induced early onset, severe generalised necrotising myositis, whereas MP-S264L and MP-S264L-G64R infection induced a later onset, mild and focal skeletal muscle myositis. Our findings demonstrate that only the 3D-S264L mutation attenuates HEV71 in mice, suggesting that the high replication fidelity phenotype is not essential for virulence attenuation in this model.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.053239107,-0.026901047999999997,-0.0037577870000000003,-0.062182009,-0.035763257,0.034083336,0.03250176,-0.001326545,0.002868245,-0.00582201,0.021583612000000002,0.038681152,-0.0462609,-0.019490565,0.016276022,0.030337611,-0.025752183999999997,-0.014550176000000001,-0.046403995999999996,-0.020185151000000002,0.06814622299999999,-0.046139402999999996,0.016254036,0.035997983,-0.0038842290000000003,0.039881833,-0.006995138000000001,-0.022519167000000003,-0.03444525,-0.054099147
324,Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infects and replicates in porcine alveolar macrophages,"Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea; consequently, the small intestine was believed to be its only target organ. In this study, we found that PEDV infected not only the small intestines, but also the respiratory tract. Infection and replication of PEDV in the respiratory tract from naturally PEDV-infected piglets were examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and virus re-isolation. Our observations were confirmed by experimental inoculation, and we found that PEDV infection in the respiratory tract was specifically associated with alveolar macrophages in the lung. Vero cell-adapted PEDV was able to replicate in both primary alveolar macrophages and continuous porcine alveolar macrophage cells. Sequencing analysis of the spike (S) glycoprotein revealed that mutations in S might be a potential determinant of auxiliary targets for PEDV. The discovery that PEDV infects and replicates in alveolar macrophages provides new insights into its pathogenesis.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.017774913,-0.003587183,0.045592987,-0.119853579,0.022070178,0.047090997,-0.00042657800000000005,-0.05521152,0.048291493,-0.027358052,0.042415612000000005,0.07945148,-0.17236955699999998,0.090553671,0.36218580899999997,-0.24846097600000003,-0.057185608,0.052357075,-0.07820498099999999,0.257045691,-0.21471710100000002,-0.133268812,0.118428424,-0.063630619,-0.052395193,-0.037811874,-0.057214054,0.034538498,0.06466312,-0.04991894400000001
325,Generation of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus by in vitro assembly of viral genomic cDNA fragments,"Abstract Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the causative agent for a swine disease affecting the pig industry worldwide. Infection with PRRSV leads to reproductive complications, respiratory illness, and weak immunity to secondary infections. To better control PRRSV infection, novel approaches for generating control measures are critically needed. Here, in vitro Gibson assembly (GA) of viral genomic cDNA fragments was tested for its use as a quick and simple method to recover infectious PRRSV in cell culture. GA involves the activities of T5-exonuclease, Phusion polymerase, and Taq ligase to join overlapping cDNA fragments in an isothermal condition. Four overlapping cDNA fragments covering the entire PRRSV genome and one vector fragment were used to create a plasmid capable of expressing the PRRSV genome. The assembled product was used to transfect a co-culture of 293T and MARC-145 cells. Supernatants from the transfected cells were then passaged onto MARC-145 cells to rescue infectious virus particles. Verification and characterization of the recovered virus confirmed that the GA protocol generated infectious PRRSV that had similar characteristics to the parental virus. This approach was then tested for the generation of a chimeric virus. By replacing one of the four genomic fragments with that of another virus strain, a chimeric virus was successfully recovered via GA. In conclusion, this study describes for the first time the use of GA as a simple, yet powerful tool for generating infectious PRRSV needed for studying PRRSV biology and developing novel vaccines.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.05553227,-0.033132998999999996,0.033275638999999996,-0.028523777,-0.025221751,0.028942776,-0.037205301,-0.034436148,0.061196259,0.034567905,-0.044061579000000003,-0.06794850599999999,0.031299232,0.020404504,0.08965348199999999,-0.037553763999999996,0.0009307139999999999,-0.034723138,-0.017737014,0.08716990599999999,-0.046885486,-0.016142691,0.045999791,-0.076453305,0.013298115,0.075322525,0.012977668999999999,-0.023921803,-0.134303007,0.078822266
327,"Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus proteins VP2, VP3, VP4 and VP5 antagonize IFNa1 promoter activation while VP1 induces IFNa1","Abstract Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is one of the major viral pathogens causing disease in farmed Atlantic salmon worldwide. In the present work we show that several of the IPN proteins have powerful antagonistic properties against type I IFN induction in Atlantic salmon. Each of the five IPNV genes cloned into an expression vector were tested for the ability to influence activation of the Atlantic salmon IFNa1 promoter by the interferon promoter inducing protein one (IPS-1) or interferon regulatory factors (IRF). This showed that preVP2, VP3 and VP5 inhibited activation of both promoters, while VP4 only antagonized activation of the IFNa1 promoter. The viral protease VP4 was the most potent inhibitor of IFN induction, apparently targeting the IRF1 and IRF3 branch of the signaling cascade. VP4 antagonism is independent of its protease activity since the catalytically dead mutant VP4K674A inhibited activation of the IFNa1 promoter to a similar extent as wild type VP4. In contrast to the other IPNV proteins, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase VP1 activated the IFNa1 promoter. The ability to activate the IFN response was disrupted in the mutant VP1S163A, which has lost the ability to produce dsRNA. VP1 also exhibited synergistic effects with IRF1 and IRF3 in inducing an IFNa1-dependent antiviral state in cells. Taken together these results suggest that IPNV has developed multiple IFN antagonistic properties to prevent IFN-induction by VP1 and its dsRNA genome.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.125510677,-0.051450742,-0.025516692,-0.056943068,-0.087624533,0.040478003,0.035315725,-0.022737893999999998,0.049585221,-0.008187231,-0.018067209,-0.018921458999999998,-0.016709037,0.055183232,-0.014510742,-0.001646759,-0.003040047,-0.027828055,0.014343268000000001,-0.000988565,0.040151203999999996,0.006153691,0.002527061,0.018304504,0.012606507,0.011048616,0.026083662,0.004910758,-0.018622845,0.001243795
331,Enzootic bovine leukosis in a two-month-old calf,"Abstract A two-month-old calf was diagnosed with leukosis on the basis of the clinical sign of enlarged, superficial lymph nodes. Serological and genetic tests for bovine leukemia virus (BLV) were performed because the calf was born from a cow infected with BLV. The serum had a weakly positive BLV antibody, and the BLV provirus was detected within neoplastic cells on performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Analysis of the BLV provirus integration site using inverse PCR revealed that the BLV integration site location was identical on all chromosomes in all tumor tissues examined. Thus, the tumor cells monoclonally proliferated following BLV infection. The present study shows that enzootic bovine leukosis can occur in a young animal, as in the two-month-old calf in our study.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.015401836,-0.009967046,0.057453692,-0.095606295,-0.003373858,0.015017496000000002,-0.00039498699999999996,-0.015409497,0.015184978,-0.034968985,0.027239105,-0.018101683,0.0060593719999999995,0.015917712,0.047806919,-0.00482907,0.0031555759999999998,-0.007988888000000001,-0.006674493,-0.049952279,0.035079967999999996,-0.008032006999999999,0.016194328,-0.03560376,0.030816899,0.0080009,-0.016347996,-0.035702991,-0.002612175,-0.020080305
334,Viruses associated with Antarctic wildlife: From serology based detection to identification of genomes using high throughput sequencing,"Abstract The Antarctic, sub-Antarctic islands and surrounding sea-ice provide a unique environment for the existence of organisms. Nonetheless, birds and seals of a variety of species inhabit them, particularly during their breeding seasons. Early research on Antarctic wildlife health, using serology-based assays, showed exposure to viruses in the families Birnaviridae, Flaviviridae, Herpesviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae circulating in seals (Phocidae), penguins (Spheniscidae), petrels (Procellariidae) and skuas (Stercorariidae). It is only during the last decade or so that polymerase chain reaction-based assays have been used to characterize viruses associated with Antarctic animals. Furthermore, it is only during the last five years that full/whole genomes of viruses (adenoviruses, anelloviruses, orthomyxoviruses, a papillomavirus, paramyoviruses, polyomaviruses and a togavirus) have been sequenced using Sanger sequencing or high throughput sequencing (HTS) approaches.

335,Identification of gammaherpesvirus infection in free-ranging black bears (Ursus americanus),"Abstract Herpesvirus infection was investigated in black bears (Ursus americanus) with neurological signs and brain lesions of nonsuppurative encephalitis of unknown cause. Visible cytopathic effects (CPE) could only be observed on days 3–5 post-infection in HrT-18G cell line inoculated with bear tissue extracts. The observed CPE in HrT-18G cells included syncytia, intranuclear inclusions, and cell detachments seen in herpesvirus infection in vitro. Herpesvirus-like particles were observed in viral culture supernatant under the electron microscope, however, capsids ranging from 60 nm to 100 nm in size were often observed in viral cultures within the first two passages of propagation. Herpesvirus infection in the bear tissues and tissue cultures were detected by PCR using degenerate primers specific to the DNA polymerase gene (DPOL) and glycoprotein B gene (gB). DNA sequencing of the amplicon revealed that the detected herpesvirus has 94–95% identity to Ursid gammaherpesvirus 1 (UrHV-1) DNA sequences of DPOL. Phylogenetic analysis of DPOL sequences indicates that black bear herpesviruses and UrHV-1 are closely related and have small distances to members of Rhadinovirus. Interestingly, black bear herpesvirus infections were also found in bears without neurological signs. The DPOL DNA sequence of black bear herpesviruses detected in neurological bears were similar to the those detected in the non-neurological bears. However, the gB DNA sequence detected from the neurological bear is different from non-neurological bear and has only 64.5%–70% identity to each other. It is possible that at least two different types of gammaherpesviruses are present in the U. americanus population or several gammaherpesviruses exist in ursine species.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.043338071,-0.030112716,0.037551657999999995,-0.09365236099999999,0.025077488,0.024018112,0.023578382000000002,-0.015805644,0.00551248,-0.006384597,-0.014711888999999999,-0.028359682,0.015733063999999998,-0.0026797459999999998,0.013605436,0.006723983,-0.026475247,-0.009856495,0.017297048,-0.016298056000000002,0.019161196000000002,0.014918006999999999,-0.002627199,0.017573283000000002,-0.007842363,-0.022988571,-0.048914287,0.017546603,-0.037733895,0.019396049
337,"An epidemiological investigation of porcine circovirus 3 infection in dogs in the Guangxi Province from 2015 to 2017, China","Abstract Porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) is an emerging circovirus species associated with several diseases. The study aimed to investigate the frequency of porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) and its coinfection with canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) in dogs in the Guangxi province from 2015 to 2017, China, and to examine the genome diversity of PCV3. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing, 96 of 406 (23.6%)samples were positive for PCV3, 38 out of 406 (9.4%) samples were coinfected with both PCV3 and CPV-2. The CPV-positive rate was significantly higher in the PCV3-positive samples than in the non-PCV3 samples, and the difference was extremely significant (P < 0.01). The complete genome (n=4) and ten capsid genes (n=10) of PCV3 were sequenced. Multiple sequence alignment results showed that these sequences shared 98.5–100% nucleotide similarity with the reference genome sequence and 97.5–100% nucleotide similarity with the reference capsid gene sequence. PCV3 was classified into two different genotypes, according to phylogenetic analysis based on the whole genome. These strains were clustered in PCV3a, showing a close relationship with PCV3-US/SD2016. Surprisingly, we separately analyzed these PCV3 strains from the Guangxi province and found that the dog and pig PCV3 are from different branches. In summary, this was the first seroprevalence and genetic investigation of PCV3 in dogs in the Guangxi province, China, and the first complete genome PCV3 from dogs obtained in the world.

340,Experimental confirmation of recombination upstream of the S1 hypervariable region of infectious bronchitis virus,"Abstract Chimeric infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) genomes with cross-over sites in the S1 gene were generated by co-infection with two distinct IBV strains. Recombinant viruses were collected from chicken embryos, embryonic cultured cells and chickens co-infected with Ark99 and Mass41 strains and purified by differential centrifugation. The recombinant S1 genes were identified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) using heterologous primers and confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The recombinants with Ark99 5′ and Mass41 3′ sequences were identified following the in vitro, in ovo and in vivo co-infections. Mixed RNA extracted from Ark99 and Mass41 did not produce RTPCR products with these primers at the PCR conditions used. Cross-over sites within the amplified 580 (Mass41) or 604 (Ark99) bases of the 5′ S1 gene could only be detected between nucleotides 50 and 155.

341,Phylogenetic analysis of a highly conserved region of the polymerase gene from 11 coronaviruses and development of a consensus polymerase chain reaction assay,"Abstract Viruses in the genus Coronavirus are currently placed in three groups based on antigenic cross-reactivity and sequence analysis of structural protein genes. Consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were used to obtain cDNA, then cloned and sequenced a highly conserved 922 nucleotide region in open reading frame (ORF) 1b of the polymerase (pol) gene from eight coronaviruses. These sequences were compared with published sequences for three additional coronaviruses. In this comparison, it was found that nucleotide substitution frequencies (per 100 nucleotides) varied from 46.40 to 50.13 when viruses were compared among the traditional coronavirus groups and, with one exception (the human coronavirus (HCV) 229E), varied from 2.54 to 15.89 when compared within these groups. (The substitution frequency for 229E, as compared to other members of the same group, varied from 35.37 to 35.72.) Phylogenetic analysis of these pol gene sequences resulted in groupings which correspond closely with the previously described groupings, including recent data which places the two avian coronaviruses—infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) of chickens and turkey coronavirus (TCV)—in the same group [Guy, J.S., Barnes, H.J., Smith L.G., Breslin, J., 1997. Avian Dis. 41:583–590]. A single pair of degenerate primers was identified which amplify a 251 bp region from coronaviruses of all three groups using the same reaction conditions.

342,"Macromolecular prodrugs of ribavirin: Polymer backbone defines blood safety, drug release, and efficacy of anti-inflammatory effects","Abstract Macromolecular (pro)drugs hold much promise as broad-spectrum antiviral agents as either microbicides or carriers for intracellular delivery of antiviral drugs. Intriguing opportunity exists in combining the two modes of antiviral activity in the same polymer structure such that the same polymer acts as a microbicide and also serves to deliver the conjugated drug (ribavirin) into the cells. We explore this opportunity in detail and focus on the polymer backbone as a decisive constituent of such formulations. Fourteen polyanions (polycarboxylates, polyphosphates and polyphosphonates, and polysulfonates) were analyzed for blood pro/anti coagulation effects, albumin binding and albumin aggregation, inhibitory activity on polymerases, cytotoxicity, and anti-inflammatory activity in stimulated macrophages. Ribavirin containing monomers were designed to accommodate the synthesis of macromolecular prodrugs with disulfide-exchange triggered drug release. Kinetics of drug release was fast in all cases however enhanced hydrophobicity of the polymer significantly slowed release of ribavirin. Results of this study present a comprehensive view on polyanions as backbone for macromolecular prodrugs of ribavirin as broad-spectrum antiviral agents.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.089335468,-0.026945931,-0.037878722999999996,-0.032114121,-0.14941770000000001,0.09724006199999999,0.084394556,-0.009804258,0.046616964000000004,0.007103601,0.016774947,0.05850970900000001,-0.001624249,-0.01072135,-0.004060271,-0.0007103910000000001,-0.020193451,0.126110789,0.079957649,-0.021674987000000003,0.014529762,0.015358493999999999,-0.0005123069999999999,0.048123337,0.07146359299999999,0.054070151,0.027584022000000003,-0.018537425,0.092637557,-0.0028160190000000003
343,Intranasal delivery of adjuvant-free peptide nanofibers elicits resident CD8+ T cell responses,"Abstract Influenza vaccines that can be administered intranasally or by other needle-free delivery routes have potential advantages over injected formulations in terms of patient compliance, cost, and ease of global distribution. Supramolecular peptide nanofibers have been investigated previously as platforms for vaccines and immunotherapies and have been shown to raise immune responses in the absence of exogenous adjuvants and without measurable inflammation. However, at present it has not been tested whether the immunogenicity of these materials extends to the intranasal route. Here we investigated the extent to which self-assembled peptide nanofibers bearing an influenza peptide epitope elicit antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses when delivered intranasally, and we compared these responses with those elicited by subcutaneous immunization. Peptides containing an epitope from influenza acid polymerase (PA) and the Q11 self-assembly domain formed nanofibers that were avidly taken up by dendritic cells in lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes after intranasal immunization. Intranasally delivered nanofibers generated greater antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses in the lung-draining lymph nodes than subcutaneous immunizations while retaining the non-inflammatory character of the materials observed in other delivery sites. The CD8+ T cells elicited systemically were functional as assessed by their ability to produce IFN-γ ex vivo, lyse epitope-pulsed target cells in vivo, and diminish viral loads in infected mice. Compared to subcutaneously delivered nanofibers, intranasally delivered peptide nanofibers significantly increased the number of persisting antigen-specific tissue resident memory CD8+ T cells in the lung, allowing for a more rapid response to infection at 6 weeks post-vaccination. These results indicate that intranasally delivered self-assembled peptide nanofibers are immunogenic when delivering CD8+ epitopes without adjuvant or CD4+ epitopes, are non-inflammatory, and promote more lung-resident memory CD8+ T cells compared to subcutaneous immunization.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.043098139,-0.032597018,0.002064038,-0.068129052,-0.073698282,0.107195951,-0.013553167,-0.032944542,0.032292593,-0.046186076,-0.023515705,-0.021827749,-0.001675196,0.031396377,0.007809263,0.020640276000000003,-0.016579619,-0.026369983,-0.02238763,-0.022037973,0.025763375,-0.032221303,0.022711067,-0.023441915,0.015735227,0.019978639,-0.022889912000000002,0.011777936999999999,-0.022507827999999997,-0.011114104
344,Astroviruses,"Publisher Summary Human astroviruses are members of the Astroviridae family. They are non-enveloped viruses possessing a single-stranded RNA of positive polarity as their genome. The development of sensitive tests for the presence of astrovirus—for example, using group reactive monoclonal antibodies—has led to the conclusion that astroviruses are the cause of more cases of childhood diarrhea. Astroviruses have also been identified as the cause of major outbreaks of diarrhea and vomiting. Different serotypes of human astrovirus have been defined based on immune electron microscopy, neutralization tests, and type-specific enzyme immune assays (EIAs). Eight different serotypes have been identified and it has been shown that differences in the sequences of reverse transcription–polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) products from a region within open reading frame 2 (ORF2) correlated precisely with antigenic types determined by type-specific EIA.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.045318918,0.007395195,0.063365604,-0.022507461,0.062981523,-0.0057886859999999995,0.011756375,-0.000642266,-0.007886438,0.005303469,-0.019715081000000002,0.000970645,0.017209486,-0.028563137000000002,0.041679087000000004,-0.064666613,0.021122553999999998,0.013214417,-0.051407339,-0.026751427,0.014639403999999998,0.025436329,-0.063253977,0.035273273,-0.034960014,-0.036566357,0.023906202,-0.040910814,-0.011056836,-0.034725966000000004
345,Chapter 9 The Detection of Waterborne Viruses,"Publisher Summary Viruses in water are usually present in concentrations too low for detection by direct analysis. Virological investigation of water samples is always a multi-stage process involving concentration of viruses present followed by an appropriate detection procedure. There are several approaches to detection of viruses. Part or all of the concentrate may be inoculated into cell cultures to detect infectious cytopathogenic virus, and if this is done in a quantitative fashion the virus can be enumerated, the count being reported as plaque-forming units, the tissue culture infectious dose, or most probable number units. The virus may be isolated and identified from the cell cultures. Viruses that multiply without producing an identifiable cytopathic effect in culture may sometimes be detected by immunoperoxidase or immunofluorescence staining. The concentrate may also be analyzed by molecular biological procedures (usually polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time-PCR). The problem then is that such techniques do not usually detect the infectious virus, and novel approaches have been made recently to meet this challenge.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.022771276,-0.002851493,0.11984681300000001,0.021488135,-0.012541136999999999,0.037328282000000004,0.04793399,-0.01993022,-0.008559254,0.107122674,-0.006885298000000001,-0.067724349,0.067504385,0.005044943,0.067302284,-0.028842377000000002,-0.004630520999999999,-0.030493497,0.0016520839999999998,-0.06175102,0.018805947,0.026282942000000004,0.046218664000000007,0.00010637799999999999,-0.051039521,0.021489636,0.011298451000000001,-0.003440875,-0.08117527,-0.041744111
346,Substituted imidazopyridines as potent inhibitors of HCV replication,"Background/Aims Following lead optimization, a set of substituted imidazopyridines was identified as potent and selective inhibitors of in vitro HCV replication. The particular characteristics of one of the most potent compounds in this series (5-[[3-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-isoxazolyl]methyl]-2-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-5H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine or GS-327073), were studied. Methods Antiviral activity of GS-327073 was evaluated in HCV subgenomic replicons (genotypes 1b, 1a and 2a), in the JFH1 (genotype 2a) infectious system and against replicons resistant to various selective HCV inhibitors. Combination studies of GS-327073 with other selective HCV inhibitors were performed. Results Fifty percent effective concentrations for inhibition of HCV subgenomic 1b replicon replication ranged between 2 and 50nM and were 100-fold higher for HCV genotype 2a virus. The 50% cytostatic concentrations were ⩾17μM, thus resulting in selectivity indices of ⩾340. GS-327073 retained wild-type activity against HCV replicons that were resistant to either HCV protease inhibitors or several polymerase inhibitors. GS-327073, when combined with either interferon α, ribavirin, a nucleoside polymerase or a protease inhibitor resulted in overall additive antiviral activity. Combinations containing GS-327073 proved highly effective in clearing hepatoma cells from HCV. Conclusions GS-327073 is a potent in vitro inhibitor of HCV replication either alone or in combination with other selective HCV inhibitors.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.109620829,-0.04637208,-0.025860175,-0.023836535,-0.12964239,0.060634932999999995,0.072624685,-0.003542082,0.062573701,0.00323704,0.015239146,0.120369213,0.020874931,0.04025965,-0.038694842,-0.033623342,0.019694592,0.33376551600000004,0.382253076,-0.135522274,-0.066710199,-0.0027713459999999996,0.111920045,0.107786286,-0.020752106,-0.066149794,-0.068185275,0.047647312000000004,-0.04256284900000001,-0.072837255
347,Modulation of host metabolism as a target of new antivirals,"Abstract The therapy for chronic hepatitis C (CH–C) started with interferon (IFN) monotherapy in the early 1990s and this therapy was considered effective in about 10% of cases. The present standard therapy of pegylated IFN with ribavirin achieves a sustained virologic response in about 50% of patients. However, about half of the CH–C patients are still at risk of fatal liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The other significant event in hepatitis C virus (HCV) research has been the development of a cell culture system. The subgenomic replicon system enables robust HCV RNA replication in hepatoma cells. And recently, the complete life cycle of HCV has been achieved using a genotype 2a strain, JFH1. These hallmarks have provided much information about the mechanisms of HCV replication, including information on the host molecules required for the replication. Anti-HCV reagents targeting HCV proteins have been developed, and some of them are now in clinical trials. However, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase frequently causes mutations in the HCV genome, which lead to the emergence of drug-resistant HCV mutants. Some of the cellular proteins essential for HCV RNA replication have already been discovered using the HCV cell culture system. These host molecules are also candidate targets for antivirals. Here, we describe the recent progress regarding the anti-HCV reagents targeting host metabolism.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.136657029,-0.053436637,-0.055514747,0.0015847620000000002,-0.148950047,0.021578264,0.067620456,0.026834012,0.027830494,0.039133532,-0.00923954,0.085554865,0.043415074000000005,0.10852000099999999,-0.038596822,-0.034679432999999996,0.013592855,0.34054388399999996,0.38879920100000004,-0.10742047,-0.078020847,0.011953364,0.09406137,0.08100204700000001,-0.08131538099999999,-0.106788486,-0.056413458,0.060783867000000005,-0.12241025800000001,-0.074334407
354,Detection of viruses in used ventilation filters from two large public buildings,"Background Viral and bacterial pathogens may be present in the air after being released from infected individuals and animals. Filters are installed in the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems of buildings to protect ventilation equipment and maintain healthy indoor air quality. These filters process enormous volumes of air. This study was undertaken to determine the utility of sampling used ventilation filters to assess the types and concentrations of virus aerosols present in buildings. Methods The HVAC filters from 2 large public buildings in Minneapolis and Seattle were sampled to determine the presence of human respiratory viruses and viruses with bioterrorism potential. Four air-handling units were selected from each building, and a total of 64 prefilters and final filters were tested for the presence of influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial, corona, parainfluenza 1-3, adeno, orthopox, entero, Ebola, Marburg, Lassa fever, Machupo, eastern equine encephalitis, western equine encephalitis, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses. Representative pieces of each filter were cut and eluted with a buffer solution. Results Attempts were made to detect viruses by inoculation of these eluates in cell cultures (Vero, MDCK, and RK-13) and specific pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs. Two passages of eluates in cell cultures or these eggs did not reveal the presence of any live virus. The eluates were also examined by polymerase chain reaction or reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction to detect the presence of viral DNA or RNA, respectively. Nine of the 64 filters tested were positive for influenza A virus, 2 filters were positive for influenza B virus, and 1 filter was positive for parainfluenza virus 1. Conclusion These findings indicate that existing building HVAC filters may be used as a method of detection for airborne viruses. As integrated long-term bioaerosol sampling devices, they may yield valuable information on the epidemiology and aerobiology of viruses in air that can inform the development of methods to prevent airborne transmission of viruses and possible deterrents against the spread of bioterrorism agents.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.064939962,-0.068753165,0.016605642,0.09722934800000001,0.012787031,0.121614119,-0.012710997,0.0024049510000000002,-0.02988285,0.045416632,0.012566703,-0.054261178,0.031215039,0.009011,0.0484288,-0.004602075,-0.013308992,-0.073304937,0.013922257,-0.002777656,-0.022122968,0.008393475,0.004604156,0.023964923,-0.009673449,0.011043009,-0.029534305,0.029297577,-0.050774140999999995,-0.053434543
359,Bacteria emitted in ambient air during bronchoscopy—a risk to health care workers?,"Background Health care workers are at risk of occupational infections, and some procedures are known to increase this risk. The aim of this study was to qualify and quantify bioaerosol concentrations during bronchoscopy to estimate the occupational risk. Methods Full-day sampling was conducted in 2 rooms while bronchoscopies were performed on patients. Two microbial air samplers were used, a wet wall cyclonic sampler and an impactor, on culture media. Identification of the culturable bacterial flora was performed with chromatographic analysis of cellular fatty acid of the isolated strain and additional biochemical tests if needed. Specific polymerase chain reaction analysis was completed on wet wall cyclonic samples for the detection of influenza A and B and Mycobacterium spp. Results A wide variety of bacteria were collected from the ambient air. All samples yielded at least 1 Staphylococcus species. Although most of the culturable bacteria identified were normal nonpathogenic flora, such as Streptococcus spp, Neisseria spp, and Corynebacterium spp, some opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, were found. Neither Mycobacterium spp nor influenza virus was detected with the polymerase chain reaction method during this study. Conclusions Culturable bacteria from oral, nasal, and pulmonary flora are aerosolized during bronchoscopy and could be inhaled by medical staff. The potential presence of pathogens in those aerosols could represent an occupational infection risk.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.09726731599999999,-0.040175783,0.029290826000000002,-0.04327013,-0.008457036,0.062917192,0.0026556220000000003,0.04560564,-0.083834517,0.038584479,-0.033328237999999996,-0.00759794,-0.0018172820000000001,-0.062240555999999995,0.031403176,-0.006380404,-0.022219787999999997,-0.061147922,0.019269038,-0.034882422,-0.012428778,0.030968344,0.079661797,-0.021570446,0.070180979,-0.015662846,-0.035661307,0.004232641,0.024373452,-0.015397567
365,Alveolar macrophages in allergic asthma: An expression signature characterized by heat shock protein pathways,"Abstract The implication of alveolar macrophages (AM) in asthma, a Th2 disease, has not been well characterized. Thus, the goal of this study is to better characterize AM phenotype of allergic asthmatic compared with normal subjects using genomic expression analyses. Microarray analyses were performed with AM isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage. Robust multiarray analysis (RMA) normalization and Smyth's moderated t test were used to select differentially expressed genes. Fifty differentially expressed genes were identified. Nineteen have been classified in categories linked to stress or immune responses and among them; nine are part of the heat shock protein (HSP) family. Difference of expression for three (HSPD1, PRNP, SERPINH1) of the five selected genes were validated using real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the protein level of heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), the protein encoded by HSPD1, and showed difference in AM protein level between allergic asthmatic and control subjects. In summary, this study suggests that HSP gene family, particularly HSP60, is involved in AM functions in a context of allergic asthma. These results also support the involvement of AM immune functions in the development of an allergic asthmatic response.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.06607228700000001,-0.025170507,0.024528422,-0.114237311,-0.039744369,0.014469952,0.000914471,-0.037032167000000005,0.044074664000000006,-0.038179057,-0.114656231,-0.035127427,-0.009682975,0.027447252999999998,-0.037070303,-0.059630613,0.048836572,-0.10034067699999999,-0.025563942000000003,-0.038792972,0.020115692,-0.051405748,0.001211965,0.02309524,-0.05565572,0.043554015,0.023495271,-0.016000471000000002,0.051894628,0.032176857
366,"Discovery, synthesis, and optimization of an N-alkoxy indolylacetamide against HIV-1 carrying NNRTI-resistant mutations from the Isatis indigotica root","Abstract From an aqueous decoction of the traditional Chinese medicine “ban lan gen” (the Isatis indigotica root), an antiviral natural product CI - 39 was isolated as an NNRTI (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) (EC50 = 3.40 μM). Its novel structure was determined as methyl (1-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)acetamidobenzoate by spectroscopic data and confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Through synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) investigation of CI - 39 and 57 new derivatives (24 with EC50 values of 0.06–8.55 μM), two optimized derivatives 10f and 10i (EC50: 0.06 μM and 0.06 μM) having activity comparable to that of NVP (EC50 = 0.03 μM) were obtained. Further evaluation verified that 10f and 10i were RT DNA polymerase inhibitors and exhibited better activities and drug resistance folds compared to NVP against seven NNRTI-resistant strains carrying different mutations. Especially, 10i (EC50 = 0.43 μM) was more active to the L100I/K103N double-mutant strain as compared to both NVP (EC50 = 0.76 μM) and EFV (EC50 = 1.08 μM). The molecular docking demonstrated a possible binding pattern between 10i and RT and revealed activity mechanism of 10i against the NNRTI-resistant strains.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.058184713,-0.014712767,0.017955506,-0.047918634,-0.048305197,0.057199775,0.032544511,-0.016978012,0.012018381000000002,-0.029366097,0.017097408,0.08790616,-0.04354526,-0.015435243000000001,-0.030827637,0.020182669,-0.013081200000000001,0.072778953,0.058650139000000004,-0.035107365,-0.025003705,0.015909408,0.009316893,0.070755718,0.037797383999999996,0.010792076999999999,0.0010860289999999999,-0.033209641,0.03285136,0.00590719
367,Antiviral activity of Jinchai capsule against influenza virus,"Abstract Objective To evaluate the effect on influenza virus of Jinchai, a capsule made of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Methods Madin-darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were infected with the FM1 strain of influenza virus A (subtype H1N1) in vitro. They were used to explore how Jinchai affected cell adsorption, cell membrane fusion, transcription and replication of the influenza virus. Hemagglutinin (HA) protein, intracellular pH, and influenza virus protein acid (PA) polymerase subunit were detected with confocal microscopy and real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results Jinchai significantly reduced the expression of HA and PA polymerase subunit mRNA in infected MDCK cells. Jinchai also significantly decreased intracellular pH in infected cells. Conclusions Jinchai had strong anti-influenza activity against the influenza virus. It weakened the ability of the influenza virus to adsorb to cell wall and fuse with cell membranes in the early infection stage, and inhibited the transcription and replication of the virus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.025510368999999998,-0.127203227,-0.020006164,0.141623622,-0.111351843,0.32567368399999996,-0.15701367800000002,-0.062334325999999995,0.039888098999999996,-0.11762760400000001,-0.031972007999999996,-0.07842940799999999,0.012002195,0.146559427,0.018232314,0.009704153,0.031844881,-0.087173692,0.031262192,0.022139497999999997,0.058361878,0.025397916,0.064961483,-0.021830062,0.027860871000000002,0.040402218,-0.047415578,0.025526674,-0.08911522599999999,0.068471191
373,Gripe A (H1N1)v pandémica en UCI: ¿qué hemos aprendido?,"Resumen Las características de la gripe pandémica 2009 son diferentes de las de la gripe estacional. En Australia- Nueva Zelanda (ANZIC) se multiplicaron por 15 los ingresos en la unidad de cuidados intensivos (UCI) en el invierno austral. Se comparan las características de la serie española de los primeros ingresos en UCI en julio con las series publicadas en Canadá y ANZIC hasta octubre de 2009. A diferencia de lo observado en España, sólo la mitad de los ingresos en Canadá y ANZIC se debió a neumonía viral primaria, mientras que la neumonía bacteriana fue más frecuente en los primeros. En todas las series, los jóvenes, muchos de los cuales no tenían comorbilidad, fueron la población más afectada. La obesidad, la patología pulmonar crónica, el embarazo y la cardiopatía fueron las comorbilidades más frecuentes. El diagnóstico mediante rt-PCR puede presentar un 10% de falsos negativos. El shock y la insuficiencia renal aguda fueron más frecuentes en la serie española. El 10-30% de los afectados requieren ingreso a UCI y 6 de cada 10 ventilación mecánica (VM), con una alta frecuencia de fracaso de la ventilación no invasiva (75%). La mortalidad fue similar entre las series (14-25%), aunque mayor en los pacientes que requieren VM (30%). La administración precoz (< 48 h de inicio de los síntomas) de oseltamvir se ha asociado a una mejor evolución. Por ello, su administración precoz en pacientes con factores de riesgo, o en quienes aun sin ellos presentan signos de progresión clínica, podría reducir el ingreso en la UCI y la mortalidad. Abstract The characteristics of pandemic influenza 2009 differ from those of seasonal influenza. In Australia-New Zealand the number of admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) increased by 15-fold in the southern winter. We compared the characteristics of the Spanish series of the first ICU admissions in July with those of series published in Canada and Australia-New Zealand up to October 2009. Unlike the situation in Spain, only half the admissions in Canada and Australia-New Zealand were due to primary viral pneumonia but bacterial pneumonia was much more frequent. In all series, young people, many of whom had no comborbidities, were the most frequently affected population. The most common comorbidities were obesity, chronic pulmonary disease, pregnancy and heart disease. Diagnosis through reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction can have a false-negative rate of 10%. Shock and acute renal insufficiency were more frequent in the Spanish series. A total of 10-30% of patients required ICU admission and 6 of 10 patients required mechanical ventilation with a high frequency of failure of non-invasive ventilation (75%). Mortality was similar among the series (14-25%) but was higher in patients requiring mechanical ventilation (30%). Early oseltamivir administration (< 48h after symptom onset) has been associated with better outcome. Therefore, early administration of this drug in patients with risk factors or those who, although free from risk factors, show clinical progression, could reduce ICU admissions and mortality.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.046645685,-0.047864555999999996,-0.020956884,-0.09872377800000001,-0.052045425,0.034569041,-0.001365106,0.020752204,-0.015109898,-0.048586973,-0.014031488,0.056189895,-0.026412072999999998,-0.131782793,0.240474036,0.35909819600000004,0.492982711,0.12777661099999998,-0.050266363,0.11072031199999999,0.07069437099999999,0.07827479400000001,0.059577375999999994,0.045580586,-0.126020559,-0.125939915,0.065509388,-0.0007961639999999999,-0.033745742,0.049512259
376,A follow-up of Beagle dogs intradermally infected with Leishmania chagasi in the presence or absence of sand fly saliva,"Abstract In this study, we compare the development of infection and/or disease in Beagle dogs intradermally infected with Leishmania chagasi, in the presence or absence of Lutzomyia longipalpis saliva, with those of intravenously infected animals. Spleen samples of all the animals inoculated with parasites had positive polymerase chain reaction tests for Leishmania DNA. Positive spleen cultures for Leishmania were detected earlier (P≤0.018) and were more frequent (five out of the five animals) in intravenously infected animals than in the intradermally infected animals, in presence (two out of the six animals) or absence (three out of the five animals) of salivary gland lysate of L. longipalpis. Significant increase in serum antibodies against Leishmania was observed only in the intravenously infected group (P=0.004). In addition, dogs with infection confirmed by isolation of amastigotes or detection of parasite DNA were, nevertheless, negative for anti-Leishmania antibodies up to 5 months or more after infection. Only animals of the intravenously infected group developed progressive decreases in hematocrit (Pearson r=−0.8076, P=0.0026) and hemoglobin (Pearson r=−0.8403, P=0.0012) during the infection period. No significant difference in the course of infection was observed between groups of intradermally infected animals. The data presented herein confirms that the intradermal inoculation of dogs with Leishmania produces an asymptomatic form of infection. It also fails to show an advantage in using L. longipalpis saliva as an infection-enhancing agent in experimental canine leishmaniasis.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.003723875,-0.005276746999999999,0.036181142,-0.118334063,0.002466213,0.023842792999999998,0.04722899,-0.009710996,0.00326555,-0.027160889,0.05616372099999999,-0.021926582000000003,-0.018239023,0.01350192,0.062892604,-0.007062878000000001,-0.034505406,-0.015972933,0.037188523,0.017305808,0.053671210999999996,0.019163686,-0.079210564,-0.03008631,0.08524022,-0.072000825,-0.09334327199999999,-0.0017630679999999998,-0.081837915,0.063076797
377,Multiattribute evaluation of two simple tests for the detection of Cryptosporidium parvum in calf faeces,"Abstract There is a need for simple and inexpensive diagnostic and screening tests for the detection of Cryptosporidium parvum infection in calves. A sucrose wet mount test and a lateral immunochromatography test were evaluated for epidemiological sensitivity and specificity, cost per test, simplicity, test time and ease of batching. Polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) of the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) gene locus, with gel electrophoresis, was used as a gold standard. Cohen's kappa statistic of agreement (к) between the Ontario Veterinary College (OVC) sucrose wet mount test and COWP PCR–RFLP was 0.82, and the sensitivity and specificity of the OVC sucrose wet mount test were 88.6% and 93.8%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the lateral immunochromatography test were 78.3% and 93.3%, respectively, and agreement between this test and PCR–RFLP was good (к =0.73). There was substantial agreement between the OVC sucrose wet mount test and the lateral immunochromatography test (к =0.84). Both tests were inexpensive and easy to use; however, the lateral immunochromatography test was faster and simpler to perform than the sucrose wet mount test, and was generally more user-friendly. These tests provide practitioners and researchers with cheap, quick and accurate methods of detecting C. parvum infection in young calves.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.012740962,0.031513137999999996,0.119955076,-0.050130031,-0.04214781099999999,0.0073096969999999995,-0.0082692,0.0059645240000000006,-0.016401478,-0.026923222000000004,-0.010362521,0.014359478,0.002917475,-0.056446095,-0.0031485429999999997,0.022014942000000003,-0.001031811,0.001259128,-0.017866339,-0.058003904,-0.010389028,-0.017857272,0.031513691,-0.067362803,0.020304034,0.009797987,-0.009120775,-0.077555725,-0.020091859,0.007124971
378,"Molecular and immunohistochemical detection of assemblage E, Giardia duodenalis in scouring North Dakota calves","Abstract Despite many reports on the shedding of Giardia parasites by scouring calves, the role of Giardia as a cause of calf diarrhea is still controversial. To elucidate the role of Giardia duodenalis in calf scours, diagnostic samples from 189 scouring calves were tested by different assays during a 1-year-study period. Giardia antigens were detected in 22/189 scouring calves by a fecal-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and 10 of these were positive for assemblage E, G. duodenalis by polymerase chain reaction. Giardia trophozoites were demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in intestinal sections from five calves in which the parasites were spatially distributed in areas of microscopically detectable enteritis. Our data suggest that under certain circumstances, Giardia may cause intestinal lesions leading to calf scours.

379,Species identification of trichomonads and associated coinfections in dogs with diarrhea and suspected trichomonosis,"Abstract Trichomonads have been infrequently reported in the feces of dogs where their pathogenicity remains uncertain. It is currently unknown whether Tritrichomonas foetus or Pentatrichomonas hominis is identified more commonly in dogs with trichomonosis or how often these infections are accompanied by concurrent enteric infectious agents. The objective of this study was to determine the identity of trichomonads present in a series of 38 unsolicited canine diarrheic fecal samples submitted for T. foetus diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing between 2007 and 2010. We also examined each fecal sample for an association of trichomonosis with concurrent infection using a convenient real-time PCR panel for nine gastrointestinal pathogens. P. hominis, T. foetus, or both were identified by PCR in feces of 17, 1, and 1 dogs respectively. Feces from the remaining 19 dogs were PCR negative for T. foetus, P. hominis and using broader-spectrum Trichomonadida primers. The total number and specific identities of concurrent enteropathogens identified did not differ between fecal samples from dogs that were or were not identified by PCR as infected with trichomonads. These results suggest that P. hominis infection is more frequently identified than T. foetus infection in diarrheic dogs with trichomonosis and that concurrent enteropathogen infection is common in this population.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.049111817,0.017739361000000002,0.107389866,-0.086398503,0.049878862,0.00026194,0.022750726000000002,0.004267791,-0.024369444,0.000929722,0.055426014,0.012445148999999999,-0.013789346000000001,-0.006158364,0.09314292800000001,-0.069344818,0.0059191109999999995,-0.029039638,0.067035048,-0.085369358,0.140184415,0.11202276,-0.074588566,-0.058948085,0.14980328,-0.104813011,-0.061588163,-0.051189070999999996,-0.010421624,0.08641348900000001
381,Diagnostic moléculaire en pathologie infectieuse: intérêt d'un diagnostic multiplex dans les pneumopathies atypiques,"Résumé Parmi les pathogènes responsables de pneumopathies atypiques, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, et Legionella pneumophila sont trois bactéries fréquentes pour lesquelles un diagnostic étiologique rapide est difficile à obtenir. L'amplification génique in vitro offre une possibilité de rendu de résultats dans la journée, mais souvent au détriment d'un temps de réalisation important du fait du manque d'automatisation. Cet inconvénient est réduit en cas d'utilisation de techniques d'amplification génique multiplex, dont un exemple de réalisation est présenté dans cet article. Abstract Among frequent potential respiratory pathogens, Mycoplasma pneumoniæ, Chlamydia pneumoniæ, and Legionella pneumophila are difficult to isolate with usual laboratory techniques (culture, serologic tests). Adapted molecular biology tools are able to amplify a specific genomic target and allow the diagnosis the same day, but with a very time consuming process.

Étude prospective pilote,"Résumé Les coronavirus humains (HCoV) ont été impliqués dans la survenue d'infections respiratoires nosocomiales chez les nouveau-nés. Plusieurs cas d'infections néonatales ont été mis en évidence. Cette étude pilote recherche l'existence d'une éventuelle transmission maternofœtale des HCoV pouvant expliquer les cas infections néonatales observées dans les premières 24 heures de vie. Matériel et méthode Étude monocentrique prospective pilote. Étude des couples mère–enfant par la réalisation de trois prélèvements: vaginal et respiratoire chez la mère (VM et RM) lors du travail, gastrique chez le nouveau-né (GNN). Suivi clinique des nouveau-nés et des mères jusqu'à j3. Analyse virologique des échantillons par reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) en temps réel pour la recherche des HCoV 229-E et OC43. Résultats Cent cinquante-neuf couples mère–enfant ont été inclus de juillet 2003 à août 2005. Seul HCoV 229-E a été détecté dans 11 échantillons chez six couples mère–enfant. Pour deux couples, les trois prélèvements (VM, RM et GNN) étaient positifs (cas 1 et 2). Pour le cas 3, seuls le VM et GNN étaient positifs. Pour deux couples, seuls les RM étaient positifs (cas 4 et 5). Pour le cas 6, seul le VM était positif. Pour les trois GNN positifs, aucun enfant n'était symptomatique. Conclusion Une possible transmission verticale des HCoV est mise en évidence dans cette étude pilote qui nécessite désormais d'être poursuivie à plus large échelle. Il convient également d'inclure la recherche des coronavirus humains identifiés récemment, HCoV NL63 et HKU1, et d'analyser le profil génomique des HCoV détectés chez les trois couples mère–enfant positifs. Abstract Human coronaviruses (HCoV) have been implicated in neonatal nosocomial respiratory infection. Prior to our study, several cases of neonatal infection were observed in infants born at our hospital. This prospective pilot monocentric pilot study investigates the possibility of maternofetal transmission of HCoV responsible for cases of neonatal infection observed within the first 24 hours of life. Materials and methods Three samples from mother–child couples, maternal vaginal (VM) and respiratory (RM) samples during labor; newborn gastric sample (GNN), were assessed for viral analysis using real time RT-PCR for the detection of HCoV 229-E and OC43. Clinical follow-up of infants and mothers was up to Day 3 after birth. Results One hundred (and) fifty-nine mother–child couples were included between July 2003 and August 2005. HCoV 229-E only was detected in 11 samples from 6 mother–child couples. For 2 couples, all 3 samples (VM, RM and GNN) were tested positive (cases 1 and 2). For case 3, both VM and GNN were positive. For 2 couples, only RM was positive (cases 4 and 5). In case 6, only VM was positive. Of the 3 positive GNN, no infant was symptomatic. Conclusion Possible vertical transmission of HCoV was evidenced in this pilot study and requires further investigation on a larger scale. Equally indicated is the inclusion of tests to detect recently identified human coronaviruses HCoV NL63 and HKU1, as well as genomic profile analysis of HCoV 229-E detected in the 3 positive mother-child couples.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.04281418099999999,-0.02670712,-0.005437572,-0.071765576,0.060006839000000006,-0.025140925,0.059416695,-0.021377411000000002,0.087837256,-0.07413479099999999,-0.010991898,0.22020129800000002,0.15812295099999998,0.017667448,0.16862334199999998,0.22147201800000002,0.231907948,0.017186421,-0.070044472,0.015788973,9.65e-05,0.045638770999999995,0.04516441400000001,-0.036505347,-0.000949504,0.016110452,0.023532248,-0.013111117,0.016843939,0.028074228
385,Reproduction of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in immunostimulated and non-immunostimulated 3-week-old piglets experimentally infected with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2),"Abstract Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in swine is causally associated with the newly recognised pathogen, porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). In this study, 3-week-old SPF PCV2-seronegative piglets were inoculated intranasally with PCV2. The effect of immunostimulation on the induction of PMWS was investigated by immunisation with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) emulsified in incomplete Freunds adjuvant. The study was terminated 5 weeks after inoculation. While disease was not observed in the age-matched controls, two out of five non-immunised PCV2-infected piglets died on postinoculation day (PID) 21, and one was euthanized on PID 25 in moribund condition. These animals had appeared lethargic with persistent fever from PID 12 onwards. The euthanized pig appeared smaller than littermates and suffered from jaundice. At postmortem examination, gastric ulceration, icterus, and liver and thymus atrophy were observed. Furthermore, histological lesions of degenerating hepatocytes and hepatitis in combination with lymphoid depletion and syncytial cells in lymph nodes were consistent with the diagnosis of PMWS. One out of five immunostimulated PCV2-infected piglets was euthanized on PID 22 with convulsions after a period with wasting. This pig was lethargic from PID 14 onwards with persistent fever from PID 8 and transient dyspnoea. No differences in clinical signs, gross pathologic or histological findings were observed for the remaining non-immunostimulated and immunostimulated PCV2-infected piglets. All 10 PCV2-inoculated piglets seroconverted to PCV2 within 14 days after inoculation. By virus isolation, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), and immunostaining of cryostat sections, it was demonstrated that lymphoid tissue contained abundant PCV2 antigen. Viral DNA load in serum samples was assessed by Q-PCR. All four PMWS-affected piglets had high levels of PCV2 DNA in serum, suggesting that there was a correlation between high levels of viral DNA in serum and the development of PMWS. In conclusion, infection with PCV2 caused PMWS in SPF piglets, however, the immunostimulation did not seem to play a critical role.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.0052050329999999995,-0.01476767,0.039688142999999995,-0.125050128,-0.033078348,0.025480298,0.012564743,-0.027101091,0.004801606,-0.02142693,0.037377874,-0.006151964,-0.05461285,0.02923955,0.102209867,-0.046646202000000005,-0.026348852000000002,-0.011450676000000002,8.48e-05,0.0062146580000000005,-0.025286905,-0.0027051479999999997,0.008091589,-0.032857644,-0.003280071,-0.020456055,-0.057497017000000004,-0.007581782,-0.00564118,-0.017972486
386,Partial sequence of the spike glycoprotein gene of transmissible gastroenteritis viruses isolated in Korea,"Abstract The spike (S) glycoprotein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is the predominant inducer of neutralizing antibodies and has been implicated in virulence and host cell tropism. In this study, the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the amino terminal half of the S glycoprotein gene of one Korean field TGEV strain (133) isolated in 1997 and three Korean field TGEV strains (KT2, KT3 and KT4) isolated in 2000 and HKT2 strain, KT2 passaged 104 times in ST cells, were determined. The amino terminal half of the S glycoprotein gene including antigenic sites A, B, C and D, were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Amplified PCR products were cloned, sequenced, and compared with published sequences for non-Korean TGEV strains. Korea TGEV field strains had 98.5–99.5% nucleotide sequence and 97.2–99.0% amino acid sequence similarity with each other. They had 96.5–99.0% nucleotide sequence similarity and 94.9–97.6% amino acid sequence similarity compared to non-Korean TGEV strains. Korean TGEV strains had several specific nucleotide and amino acid sequences which were not found in foreign TGEV or PRCV strains. HKT2 strain differed by 0.89% in nucleotide and 2.03% amino acid sequences compared to original KT2 strain although the regions forming four antigenic sites were not changed. By phylogenetic tree analysis, Korean field TGEV strains were branched into different groups from non-Korean TGEV or PRCV strains. Korean TGEV field strains KT2 and 133 were branched in separate groups that were differentiated from the other Korean TGEV strains. The Korean TGEV strains seemed to be evolved from a separate lineage of TGEV strain.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.095979952,-0.019224368000000002,0.077907368,-0.114068455,0.137773654,0.038235628,-0.10678626699999999,-0.029095846,0.025414354,0.000701659,-0.02180524,0.089573115,-0.041021542,-0.09358136800000001,0.022528991,-0.100056351,-0.002952058,0.034257455,0.006214979,0.062087795,0.05084062,-0.014725459,0.028444321,0.064228256,0.079095045,0.010882232,0.023252254,-0.038480039,-0.03069296,0.103372121
387,Genetic diversity of Hungarian canine distemper virus strains,"Abstract To achieve proper diagnosis of dogs based on acute clinical symptoms and poorly preserved field samples taken from animals that died due to canine distemper (CD), a new differential diagnostic test has been developed based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In this study, more than 150 samples collected from dogs showing respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurological signs suggesting canine distemper virus (CDV) infection were examined. The samples consisted of urine, blood and nasal swabs collected from clinically ill patients, sent to our laboratory by clinicians from various veterinary clinics throughout Hungary. Various organs collected during the necropsy of dogs with pathological changes that suggested CDV infection were also included. Three distinct PCRs were designed. For diagnostic purposes, a primer pair specific to a 409 bases-long segment within the conservative part of the large polymerase region (L) of the CDV genome was designed. Using this test, out of the 150 analyzed samples, 46 (30.66%) proved to be positive for CDV, indicating that CDV still represents a high risk to the canine population in Hungary. For the phylogenetical analysis, a primer pair that completely encompasses the hemagglutinin (H) gene of the CDV genome was designed. The amplicons of this region were sequenced in both directions using the appropriate primers. Our results indicate that several different CDV genotypes are currently present in Hungary. Nine of the analyzed Hungarian strains turned out to belong to the so-called Arctic group of CDVs, and were most closely related to non-European strains from North America, China and Greenland, as well as to the phocine distemper virus 2 (PDV-2) isolated from Baikal seals (Phoca sibirica). One of the Hungarian strains showed high similarity to other European isolates from Denmark, Germany, Italy and Turkey, as well as to other isolates from geographically more distant regions, such as the USA. Three Hungarian strains seem to join a new cluster that is formed by only a couple of strains, one isolated from a mink in Denmark, and another from a dog in North America. Using a third set of primers, a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay has also been designed for the fast and reliable differentiation of the wild-type CDVs from the vaccine strains.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.006848241,0.027855735,0.132630434,-0.087082831,0.11710678699999999,0.037102861,-0.033357777000000005,-0.014137165,-0.032877981,0.013259133999999999,0.056771362,0.07536615299999999,-0.033888945,-0.036893467,0.060566336,-0.06738567,-0.040508443,-0.025969675,0.090900354,0.004220717,0.228759535,0.10703528400000001,-0.08906751800000001,0.020936641000000002,0.193164439,-0.140068609,-0.065638874,-0.035123834,-0.07216997900000001,0.121006106
388,Characterization of an outbreak of astroviral diarrhea in a group of cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus),"Abstract A Mamastrovirus was identified in an outbreak of diarrhea in cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). Five young adult and two adult cheetahs presented with lethargy, anorexia, watery diarrhea and regurgitation over an 11-day period. Fecal samples were submitted for electron microscopy and culture. Electron microscopy results revealed particles morphologically consistent with an astrovirus, and no other viral pathogens or significant bacterial pathogens were identified. The astrovirus was confirmed and sequenced using consensus astroviral PCR, resulting in a 367 base pair partial RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) product and a 628 base pair partial capsid product. Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses were performed on both the RdRp and the capsid protein segments. All animals were monitored and treated with bismuth subsalicylate tablets (524mg PO BID for 5 days), and recovered without additional intervention. This is the first report we are aware of documenting an astrovirus outbreak in cheetah.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.06794064799999999,-0.01072793,-0.002578056,-0.038628231,0.047404822,-0.023397936,0.026095742999999998,0.035194051000000004,-0.077130278,0.017077609,0.031821016,0.055808182000000005,-0.057208963,-0.045842984,0.04075097,-0.082839334,0.032581883,-0.009952945999999999,-0.029303357000000002,-0.045080546,0.037091423,0.042541499,-0.021366831,-0.034387126000000004,0.011776538999999999,-0.000303487,0.009340218,-0.005714994,-0.0028227670000000003,0.040910203
389,Epidemiological study of bovine norovirus infection by RT-PCR and a VLP-based antibody ELISA,"Abstract Noroviruses, belonging to the family Caliciviridae, have been identified in human beings and in several animal species including cattle. The distribution of bovine norovirus infections was investigated by both RT-PCR to detect norovirus genomes and a virus-like particles-based ELISA to detect genotype 2 bovine norovirus antibodies. During a 1-year systematic study, a virus prevalence of 7.5% (CI 95%: [3.7; 13.4%]) (10 out of 133 samples) was found in stool samples from diarrhoeic calves screened by RT-PCR. Nucleotide sequencing performed on the polymerase region classified all the norovirus amplicons in the bovine norovirus genotype 2. Rather surprisingly, some rotavirus sequences were also detected. On the basis of the polymerase region, genotype 1 bovine norovirus was not identified. Other enteropathogens were found in all samples. By ELISA, a genotype 2 seroprevalence of 93.2% (CI 95%: [90.4; 95.3%]) was found from calves and adult cattle. Antibody levels against genotype 2 bovine noroviruses rose in the first 6 months of life and were maintained in adults. Together the results of virus prevalence and seroprevalence studies suggest that bovine norovirus infection occurs early in life and that re-infection with serologically related bovine noroviruses strains could occur in adult cattle as reported for rotaviruses. The antibody rise against genotype 2 bovine noroviruses in the adult cattle also suggests a short lived and/or strain specific immunity as already shown in human noroviruses. Genotype 2 bovine noroviruses are endemic in the region investigated.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.0084721,-0.012869225,0.077487183,-0.076962089,0.072691882,0.00477011,0.019591354,-0.022834171,-0.009375895,-0.056280283,0.016407489,0.10779255,-0.026918569,-0.020585236,0.020359008999999997,-0.01693592,-0.036128137000000005,0.0077191230000000005,0.052917497,-0.029265902000000003,0.036995321,0.061929829000000006,-0.04462799,0.09188564099999999,0.038320331,-0.047295357999999996,0.03320752,-0.167222183,0.049067925,-0.01866219
390,Genetic characterization of a new astrovirus detected in dogs suffering from diarrhoea,"Abstract Astroviruses have been described in several animals species frequently associated with diarrhoea, especially in young animals. In dogs, astrovirus-like particles have been observed sporadically and very little is known about their epidemiology and characteristics. In this paper, we describe the detection of astrovirus-like particles in symptomatic puppies. Furthermore, for the first time in this species, the presumptive identification made by electron microscopy was confirmed by genetic analysis of the viral RNA conducted directly on the clinical specimens. Genetic sequences of ORF2 (2443 nt), encoding for the capsid protein, and partial sequence of ORF1b (346 nt), encoding for the viral polymerase, identified the viruses as member of the family Astroviridae. The phylogenetic analysis clearly clustered canine astroviruses in the genus Mamastrovirus. Relative closest similarities were revealed with a cluster comprising human, porcine and feline astroviruses, based on the ORF2 sequences available. Based on the species definition for astroviruses and on the data obtained in this study, we suggest a new species of astrovirus – canine astrovirus, CaAstV – to be included in the genus Mamastrovirus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.070783403,-0.019237116000000002,0.029905802000000002,-0.056763454000000005,0.149528608,0.028508996,0.072081841,0.027200911,-0.051522948,-0.023844331,-0.012508996000000001,-0.017986461000000002,0.025204282999999997,-0.075139678,0.038943395,-0.05752241599999999,-0.006343535,-0.0008767489999999999,0.008112656,-0.008559218,0.088144498,0.061590316,-0.100155202,0.009285114,0.008490032,-0.073091092,-0.005933203000000001,-0.01931359,-0.032123239,0.048998075
391,"Bid cleavage, cytochrome c release and caspase activation in canine coronavirus-induced apoptosis","Abstract A previous study demonstrated that infection of a canine fibrosarcoma cell line (A-72 cells) by canine coronavirus (CCoV) resulted in apoptosis (Ruggieri et al., 2007). In this study, we investigated the cell death processes during infection and the underlying mechanisms. We found that CCoV-II triggers apoptosis in A-72 cells by activating initiator (caspase-8 and -9) and executioner (caspase-3 and -6) caspases. The proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) confirmed the activation of executioner caspases. Furthermore, CCoV-II infection resulted in truncated bid (tbid) translocation from the cytosolic to the mitochondrial fraction, the cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and alterations in the pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins of bcl-2 family. Our data indicated that, in this experimental model, both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways are involved. In addition, we demonstrated that the inhibition of apoptosis by caspase inhibitors did not affect CCoV replication, suggesting that apoptosis does not play a role in facilitating viral release.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.08813125699999999,-0.038381579,-0.01843382,-0.117150103,-0.089152938,0.06618487099999999,0.041468011,-0.044465257,0.074195025,-0.036086328,-0.028943773,-0.00359037,-0.024667033999999997,0.082486398,0.01843663,0.03329041,0.022049084,-0.038217844,0.034103392,0.004102639,0.090706516,0.057212649000000004,-0.028556212,-0.019616586999999998,0.11769137800000001,-0.007177657,-0.06638012900000001,0.045184338,-0.018220841,-0.048465417000000004
392,RNA interference inhibits hepatitis E virus mRNA accumulation and protein synthesis in vitro,"Abstract Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a zoonotic pathogen to which several species, including human beings, pigs and rodents, are reported to be susceptible. To date, vaccines developed against HEV still need to be improved and a structural gene (ORF2), which encodes a capsid protein with high sequence conservation found across HEV genotypes, is a potential candidate. To exploit the possibility of using RNA interference (RNAi) as a strategy against HEV infection, four small interference RNA (siRNA) duplex targeting ORF2 gene were constructed. A challenge against HEV infection by RNAi was performed in A549 cells. Real-Time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Real-Time qPCR) and Western blot assay demonstrated that four HEV specific siRNAs (si-ORF2-1, si-ORF2-2, si-ORF2-3 and si-ORF2-4) were capable of protecting cells against HEV infection with very high specificity and efficiency. The results suggest that RNAi is a potent anti-HEV infection prophylaxis strategy.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.077112447,-0.010056467,0.026235077000000002,-0.03459929,-0.025372439,0.015232144,0.017375302,-0.005347991,0.034114885,-0.025547315,-0.026377654,0.000968523,-0.009771148,-0.0013135,0.01533741,-0.037929335,-0.008204974,0.028951828,0.043950069,-0.002921107,0.044842448,0.009446429000000001,-0.006070348000000001,-0.01976459,-0.030068975,0.034141306,0.008050807,-0.006785946,0.029925864,-0.00163743

The C-terminal of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the FNoV M49-1 strain was highly homologous with GIV FNoV and GIV lion norovirus, whereas VP1 was highly homologous with GVI canine NoV (CNoV). Based on the results of the Simplot analysis, the FNoV M49-1 strain may have been produced by recombination between GIV.2 FNoV and GVI.1 CNoV.

394,Genetic characteristics of canine bocaviruses in Korean dogs,"Abstract To survey for canine bocavirus (CBoV) infection, 83 Korean dogs showing several clinical signs were collected in different provinces from January 2013 to July 2014. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization, CBoVs were detected in intestine and/or lung samples of 8 dogs (9.6%). To reveal the genetic characteristics of CBoVs, partial or complete regions of CBoVs were sequenced. In phylogenetic trees, 8 CBoVs fell into three clusters. The CBoV strains 13D226-1, 13D250, and 14Q216 were closely related to the CBoV HK831F strain, and the CBoV 14D142 strain was related to the CBoV HK882F strain. Lastly, CBoV 13D003, 13D095, 14D193, and 14Q209 strains were related to CBoV Dis-023, Dis-040, and Dis-046 strains. Interestingly, no canine pathogens were found in dogs in which four CBoVs (13D003, 13D0095, 14D142, and 14D193 strains) were detected and three of them (13D003, 13D095, and 14D193 strains) had a unique deletion (18 nucleotides) in the VP2 gene. Further, the open reading frame 4 (ORF4) region was absent in these 4CBoVs, but found in the other strains, which indicates that the absence of the ORF4 region rather than a unique deletion may have an influence on the pathogenesis of CBoV in dogs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.040604627000000004,-0.011323211000000001,0.070949249,-0.127702536,0.184429084,0.037947675,-0.045613842,-0.008964259,0.001596389,0.009657581,0.029509217,0.072304249,-0.018812797,-0.063872759,0.060230251,-0.079089201,-0.044030630999999994,-0.0026632229999999997,0.061124585,0.00341059,0.195759116,0.080579177,-0.063974353,0.04978791900000001,0.150924126,-0.11663034300000001,-0.066608042,-0.0124997,-0.048659013,0.11879425099999999
395,The nucleoside analog GS-441524 strongly inhibits feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus in tissue culture and experimental cat infection studies,"Abstract Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a common and highly lethal coronavirus disease of domestic cats. Recent studies of diseases caused by several RNA viruses in people and other species indicate that antiviral therapy may be effective against FIP in cats. The small molecule nucleoside analog GS-441524 is a molecular precursor to a pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate molecule. These analogs act as an alternative substrate and RNA-chain terminator of viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase. We determined that GS-441524 was non-toxic in feline cells at concentrations as high as 100 uM and effectively inhibited FIPV replication in cultured CRFK cells and in naturally infected feline peritoneal macrophages at concentrations as low as 1 uM. We determined the pharmacokinetics of GS-441524 in cats in vivo and established a dosage that would sustain effective blood levels for 24 h. In an experimental FIPV infection of cats, GS-441524 treatment caused a rapid reversal of disease signs and return to normality with as little as two weeks of treatment in 10/10 cats and with no apparent toxicity.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.10096032,-0.015747702,0.018064486,-0.10216734699999999,-0.054146762,0.036517133,0.089007238,0.005334574,-0.029233354,-0.103198062,0.40500670899999996,-0.129811214,0.204677072,-0.011609185,-0.08883532400000001,-0.027677498,-0.002716638,0.08390767699999999,0.07304762299999999,0.09181476400000001,-0.032215338999999996,-0.029024937,0.056613988,0.040960724,-0.033648624,0.008777998,-0.0009887610000000001,0.044156032000000005,0.021828066,-0.014970417
396,Longitudinal surveillance of rotavirus A genotypes circulating in a high milk yield dairy cattle herd after the introduction of a rotavirus vaccine,"Abstract Worldwide, neonatal diarrhea is one of the most important health issues affecting dairy calves, and rotavirus A (RVA) is one of its primary causes. Among the measures to mitigate the risk of diarrhea outbreaks, cow vaccination stands out as one of the most important. However, the immune pressure resulting from routine vaccination may be able to select specific G and P genotypes in RVA field strains. This study aimed to determine the frequency and intensity of neonatal diarrhea and the incidence of RVA and attempted to monitor the G and P genotypes present in the RVA strains circulating in a high milk yield cattle herd vaccinated with RVA G6P[5] strain. Fecal samples (n = 1220) from 122 Holstein heifer calves between 0–30 days old that were born from RVA-vaccinated cows were collected at 10 different time points, regardless of the presence or absence of diarrhea. The presence of RVA in fecal samples was determined by the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) technique and confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). G and P amplicons from 10 RVA-positive fecal samples from calves of different ages and collections were subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The proportion of the calves and fecal samples that were positive for RVA were 62.3% (76/122) and 8.1% (99/1220), respectively. Using sequence analysis, all 10 RVA field strains presented genotype G10P[11]. The protection of G6P[5] vaccination is clear, as this genotype was not detected in this study, and it is known that vaccination against RVA reduces the incidence of diarrhea independent of genotype involved. This result demonstrates the importance of epidemiological monitoring of RVA genotypes circulating in vaccinated dairy cattle herds to the early detection of new potential pathogenic RVA strains.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.008594605,9.18e-05,0.075758529,-0.100241922,0.056629303,0.036381654,0.0020979429999999997,-0.014233613999999999,-0.006651847,-0.015739659,0.030350016,0.077612485,-0.065777825,-0.014586799999999999,0.067547279,-0.021876428,-0.022334255,0.0060617069999999995,0.005656986,-0.025015561000000002,0.001425217,0.012143257,-0.039348892,0.018844722,0.040147237,-0.048531722,-0.012080935,-0.045340415999999995,0.018721981000000002,0.005436580999999999
397,Limited adaptation of chimeric H9N2 viruses containing internal genes from bat influenza viruses in chickens,"Abstract Influenza virus-like sequences of H17N10 and H18N11 were identified in bats, despite there has been no live virus isolated. The genetic analysis indicated that they have distinct but relatively close evolutionary relationships to known influenza A viruses. However, the infectivity and adaptation of bat influenza viruses in avian species remain unclear. In this study, two modified bat influenza viruses cH9cN2/H17 and cH9cN2/H18 containing HA and NA coding regions replaced with those of H9N2 influenza A virus were generated in the background of the H17N10 or H18N11 viruses. These two modified viruses replicated less efficiently than wild type H9N2 virus in cultured chicken cells. The mini-genome assay showed that viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) of H9N2 has significantly higher polymerase activity than that of bat influenza viruses in avian cells. In chicken study, compared with H9N2 virus, which replicated and transmitted efficiently in chickens, the cH9cN2/H17 and cH9cN2/H18 viruses only replicated in chicken tracheas with lower titers. Pathological examination showed that the H9N2 caused severer lesions in lung and trachea than the modified bat influenza viruses. Notably, the cH9cN2/H18 transmitted among chickens, but not cH9cN2/H17, and chicken IFN-β antagonism results showed that H18N11 NS1 protein inhibited chicken IFN-β response more efficiently than H17N10 NS1 protein in avian cells. Taken together, our data indicated that the internal genes of bat influenza viruses adapted poorly to chickens, while the internal genes of H18N11 seemed to adapt to chickens better than H17N10.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.014677468,-0.079191049,-0.027060914,0.11639924199999999,0.14281428300000001,0.30027774,0.004216108,-0.0026850840000000003,-0.054371607999999995,-0.022942601,-0.054735628,-0.097009421,-0.016904093999999998,0.092868836,-0.030402824,0.041626243,0.017623119,-0.044018355,0.022127082000000003,0.029053041,0.019014575,-0.006638166,0.031985968,0.026513372,-0.03716548,0.032281615,-0.016250116999999998,-0.000127219,-0.037026598,-0.032358393
398,Detection of feline coronaviruses by culture and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of blood samples from healthy cats and cats with clinical feline infectious peritonitis,"Abstract A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for the detection of the feline coronavirus (FCoV) genome and a co-cultivation method for the isolation of field strains of FCoV are described. Using the RT-PCR assay to assess blood samples from cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) (n=47) and healthy cats from households with endemic FCoV (n=69) it was shown that approximately 80% of the cats were viraemic, irrespective of their health status. It was also shown that, over a 12-month period, a similar percentage of healthy cats remained viraemic, and that the presence of viraemia did not appear to predispose the cats to the development of FIP. The co-cultivation system proved to be a suitable method for the culture of field strains of FCoV from blood samples, so long as the cultures were maintained for at least 4 weeks. Using this system, followed by the RT-PCR, viraemia was detected as frequently as by RT-PCR on RNA extracted directly from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.006752705,0.068473866,0.221835497,-0.115880193,0.039186909,-0.022672496,0.006770295,-0.021681231000000002,-0.064042444,-0.180954698,0.484562945,-0.151309995,0.225727311,0.030663636,-0.139582565,-0.058152545,0.088369117,0.013574063999999999,-0.00032826199999999995,0.061372702,-0.029738588,0.015966719,0.053074325,0.077951535,-0.016293771999999998,0.051580412,0.044749845999999996,0.025907778,0.048443575999999995,-0.002063428
399,Detection and genotyping of bovine diarrhea virus by reverse transcription-polymerase chain amplification of the 5′ untranslated region,"Abstract A reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was developed to differentiate the bovine diarrhea virus (BVDV) from other pestiviruses, and to determine the genotype of the BVDV isolates. For this purpose, primer pairs were selected in the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR). The primers BE and B2 were located in highly conserved regions and were pestivirus-specific. Two primer pairs named B3B4 and B5B6 were specific of BVDV genotypes I and II, respectively. With this technique, an amplification product of the expected size was obtained with either the B3B4 or the B5B6 primer pairs for the 107 BVDV isolates tested but not for BDV or CSFV. For some isolates that were grouped in the genotype II, sequence analysis of the PCR fragments confirmed their classification into this genotype.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.046477345999999996,0.020126583,0.124510452,-0.056499876,0.055950565,-0.0019358079999999998,-0.052945019,-0.025369056,-0.0007359310000000001,-0.018805133,0.005761979,0.07592419,-0.029216034,-0.004701029000000001,0.021591346,-0.015732688,0.010115505,0.029611787999999997,-0.030403297000000003,-0.072280804,0.008700055,0.010763076000000002,0.0035893279999999997,0.042177757,0.008860825,-0.030720967000000002,0.011349358,-0.022223073,0.039283662000000004,0.034227887
401,Water extract of licorice had anti-viral activity against human respiratory syncytial virus in human respiratory tract cell lines,"Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch., Leguminosae) has been used in herbal medicine and food supplement worldwide for centuries. Licorice is a common ingredient of several prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine which have been proved to inhibit infection of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). There are two preparations of licorice, Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata. However, it is unknown whether licorice or which preparation of licorice is effective against HRSV, nor is its active constituent. Aim of the study We tested the hypothesis that Radix Glycyrrhizae can effectively decrease HRSV-induced plaque formation in respiratory mucosal cell lines. We also tried to find out the active constituent. Materials and methods Anti-HRSV activities of hot water extracts of preparations of licorice, glycyrrhizin and 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (18β-GA), the active constituents of licorice, were examined by plaque reduction assay in both human upper (HEp-2) and low (A549) respiratory tract cell lines. Abilities of crude licorice to inhibit viral replication and to stimulate IFN-β were evaluated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Results Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata dose-dependently inhibited HRSV-induced plaque formation in both HEp-2 and A549 cell lines (p<0.0001). The effect of Radix Glycyrrhizae was better than that of Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata on HEp-2 cells. However, there was no difference of their anti-HRSV effects on A549 cells. Besides, glycyrrhizin was ineffective at all. Nevertheless, 18β-GA showed a potent anti-HRSV activity. Radix Glycyrrhizae was more effective when given before viral inoculation (p<0.0001) which may be due to its inhibition of viral attachment on (p<0.0001) and penetration (p<0.0001) into the host cells. The anti-HRSV activity of Radix Glycyrrhizae was further confirmed by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. 300μg/ml Radix Glycyrrhizae markedly decreased the viral amounts within the cells and in the suspension. Radix Glycyrrhizae might further stimulate mucosal cells to secrete IFN-β to counteract viral infection. Conclusions Both Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata are effective against HRSV infection on airway epithelial cells. Radix Glycyrrhizae inhibited HRSV mainly by preventing viral attachment, internalization, and by stimulating IFN secretion. 18β-GA may be one of its active constituents.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.032356149,-0.023151101,0.012930721000000001,-0.052898905999999996,-0.067835934,0.028993638,0.041179965,-0.028171157000000002,0.045835908,-0.019672718,-0.00846426,-0.010185489,-0.014287791999999999,0.057019137000000004,0.010128451,0.010081549,0.006906054,0.002992056,0.0033312359999999996,-0.011455169,0.017577755,0.002567207,0.00513318,0.0027844659999999998,0.014433946000000001,0.023797475,-0.013423635,0.002568918,0.00327273,-0.016666026
402,"Aqueous extract of Bai-Hu-Tang, a classical Chinese herb formula, prevents excessive immune response and liver injury induced by LPS in rabbits","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Bai-Hu-Tang (BHT) was traditionally used to reduce fever heat and promote generation of body fluids. Aim of the study To investigate the effect and mechanism of BHT in the prevention of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) fever in manners of immune modulation. Materials and methods The model of fever syndrome of Chinese medicine pattern was imitated by LPS injection i.v. in rabbits, and BHT was gavaged. The serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL-6, 10) and immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, and IgM) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were tested by biochemical methods. Liver tissue damage was detected by hematoxylin–eosin (H&E) stain. Subpopulation of T cells was detected by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS). Genes expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) in liver tissue were assayed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Result The results demonstrated that BHT prevented sudden increase of IL-10, TNF-α, ALT and AST, and liver damage induced by LPS. BHT also prevented significant decrease of the percentage of CD8+ T cells since LPS injection. At the same time, BHT did not affect the gene expression of TLR4 and serum concentration of three immunoglobulins, which were increased by LPS, but made gene expression of LBP higher. Conclusion The results of this study indicated that BHT played an important role in immunity protection and anti-injury through preventing immunoinflammatory damage by LPS. The achievement thereby scientifically provided mechanism of BHT in the prevention of febrile disease, and supported its traditional use.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.034640024,-0.004066145,0.04268593,-0.140022276,-0.091172062,0.038861669,0.0067239380000000005,-0.04262631099999999,0.051413006,-0.057878054000000005,-0.058256258,-0.033909543,-0.034036329,0.09996803800000001,-0.038539255,0.008084953,0.004510271,-0.047323288,-0.008305823,-0.075162467,0.053466565,-0.047771633,0.047108542999999996,-0.014530089,-0.058988900999999996,0.014739422,0.036763975,0.024196013,0.034632056,-0.058056357999999995
406,Seroepidemiological analysis of influenza pandemics in Shizuoka Prefecture and all Japan,"Abstract (1) Seroepidemiological analysis of influenza pandemics (1986–2003) in Shizuoka Prefecture and all Japan revealed differences in geographical, annual, seasonal, and age distributions. (2) For 17 years, the pandemics generally began at the 50th week every year showing over 1.0 patient/clinic, reached the peak at 5th week the following year, and ended over 10–15th week. Two big A/H3N2 pandemics were seen in 1989/1990 and 1997/1998 seasons, claiming over 1 million patients in Japan. (3) As herald strains, A/H3N2 strains (A/Sydney-like) were found in October 1999, and B strains (B/Victoria- and B/Yamagata-like) were detected in July and November 1998 and, in August and December 2000 in Shizuoka. B/Shizuoka/1/98 strain was registered internationally as a vaccine-recommended strain. (4) A/H3N2 and B viruses were detected in 55–78% of flu patients (almost under 10 years) with encephalopathy in 1999/2000 and 78–91% in 2000/2001 by MDCK and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. (5) High hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers over 40 in 250 persons were shown against A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2), A/Yokohama/8/98 (H3N2), A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) and A/Moscow/10/99 (H1N1) strains, while low titers showed against A/Beijing/262/95 (H1N1) and A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1), and B/Beijing/243/97, B/Shangdong/7/97 and B/Yamanashi/106/98 strains in 1998–2000. (6) In anti-HA titers against A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B subtypes, clear generation gaps were observed between children (0–19 years), adults (20–59 years) and old men (over 60 years). (7) The pandemics are dependent on host immunity (acquired and vaccinated) and climatic conditions (low temperature, low humidity and limited rainfall), considering highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses (A/H5N1, A/H7N7) like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus in 2002–2003.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.080850062,-0.015937652,-0.018291111999999998,0.019430576,0.048529217,0.137960902,-0.09314554,-0.046469689,-0.031108135,-0.038640162,0.018643455,0.070440436,-0.032762068,-0.010101524,-0.00575943,0.0030986459999999996,-0.02591588,0.023314572000000002,-0.0016461429999999999,0.013613958999999998,0.025217034,0.026557497000000003,-0.007828950999999999,0.035544464,-0.016932447,-0.000363096,-0.011829751999999999,0.019739008,-0.019164902,0.060832357999999996
426,Equine Coronavirus-Associated Colitis in Horses: A Retrospective Study,"Abstract Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is a known cause of fever, anorexia, and lethargy in adult horses. Although there are multiple reports of ECoV outbreaks, less is known about the clinical presentation of individual horses during a nonoutbreak situation. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical presentation of horses diagnosed with ECoV infection that were not associated with an outbreak. Medical records of all horses admitted to Washington State University, Veterinary Teaching Hospital, during an 8-year period were reviewed (2010–2018). The five horses included in this study were older than 1 year of age, were diagnosed with colitis, tested positive for ECoV using real-time polymerase chain reaction, and were negative to other enteric pathogens. Interestingly, 4 of 5 horses had moderate to severe diarrhea, 3 had abnormal large colon ultrasonography, 2 had transient ventricular tachycardia and 2 had clinicopathologic evidence of liver dysfunction. ECoV should be included as a differential diagnosis for individual horses presenting with anorexia, fever, lethargy, and colitis.

428,Immunohistochemical and molecular detection of natural cases of bovine rotavirus and coronavirus infection causing enteritis in dairy calves,"Abstract Bovine rotavirus (BRoV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are major enteric viral pathogens responsible for calve diarrhoea. They are widespread both in dairy and beef cattle throughout the world and causing huge economic losses. The diagnosis of these agents is very difficult due to non-specific nature of lesions and the involvement of some intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors. We performed postmortem of 45 calves, which was below three months of age. Out of 45 necropscid calves, three (6.66%) cases were positive for BRoV and four (8.88%) cases were found positive for BCoV, screened by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Further RT-PCR positive cases were confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in paraffin-embedded intestinal tissue sections. Three cases of enteritis caused by BRoV showed the hallmark lesions of the shortening and fusion of villi, denudation and infiltration of mononuclear cells in the lamina propria. The BRoV antigen distribution was prominent within the lining epithelium of the villi, peyer's patches in the ileum and strong immunoreactions in the lymphocytes and some macrophages of the mesenteric lymph nodes. Four cases in which BCoV was detected, grossly lesions characterized by colonic mucosa covered with thick, fibrinous and diphtheritic membrane.

430,Genomic analysis of HAdV-B14 isolate from the outbreak of febrile respiratory infection in China,"Abstract Human adenovirus type 14 (HAdV-B14) was first reported in 1955 from the Netherlands and since then had been associated with outbreaks of febrile respiratory illness (FRI). In China, sporadic HAdV-B14 infections were first identified in 2010, in Guangzhou and Beijing. In 2012, an outbreak of FRI occurred in Beijing and the etiological agent was determined to be HAdV-B14. We present a complete HAdV-B14 genome sequence isolated from this recent FRI outbreak. Virus in 30 throat swab samples was detected using polymerase chain reaction assays, and confirmed by sequencing of the fiber, hexon and penton genes. Comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis showed that the newly isolated HAdV-B14 (HAdV-B14 CHN) shared highest sequence homology with a 2006 isolate from the United States and clustered closely with other HAdV-B14 strains. It is expected that data from the present study will help in devising better protocols for virus surveillance, and in developing preventative measures.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.023104769,-0.024687099,-0.00113315,-0.08145168900000001,0.09341232199999999,0.010115784000000001,0.002956355,-0.016710746999999998,0.022301022,-0.0063901059999999996,-0.032752019,0.049657994000000004,-0.029530265,-0.085455985,0.052699688,-0.058928082,-0.09694991,0.029904211,-0.030714646,-0.065760977,0.065450387,0.23387981600000002,-0.051176606,0.074155517,-0.127905728,0.126366358,-0.024294392999999997,0.37074339700000003,-0.167914552,0.01329402
433,Development of a realtime RT-PCR assay for the rapid detection of influenza A(H2) viruses,"Abstract Influenza and other acute respiratory infections are of great concern for public health, causing excessive morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Influenza virus A(H2N2), which caused a pandemic of so called “Asian flu” in 1957 was expelled from the human population by the new pandemic virus subtype H3N2 in 1968, however, influenza A(H2) viruses continue to circulate in wild birds and poultry. The lack of immunity in human population and the continued circulation of influenza A(H2) among animals makes emergence of a new pandemic virus possible. One of the basic techniques of molecular diagnostics of infectious diseases is the realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The aim of this work was to design oligonucleotide primers and probes for the rapid detection of influenza A virus subtype H2 by realtime reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Analysis of 539 sequences of influenza A(H2N2) virus hemagglutinin gene from GISAID EpiFlu database revealed conservative regions suitable for use as binding sites for primers and probes. 191 probes were designed and 2 sets of primers and probes (H2-1 and H2-2) were selected for further experimental evaluation. Detection limit of RT-PCR system was 50 copies of DNA per 25 μl reaction when 10-fold dilutions of pCI-neo-H2 plasmid used as template. Analytical specificity of selected sets of primers and probes were tested on wide range of influenza strains and non-influenza respiratory viruses. H2-2 set found to have insufficient specificity detecting seasonal influenza A(H1N1) viruses and was excluded from further analysis. Analytical sensitivity was further tested on vaccine strain A/17/California/66/395 (H2N2) and A/Japan/305/1957 (H2N2), limit of detection for primers-probe set H2-1 was 3.2 (CI95%: 3.07–3.48) lg EID50/ml. Designed primers and probes for the realtime RT-PCR universal detection of influenza A(H2) viruses could be used in clinical trials of vaccines against influenza A(H2) and screening for H2 in cases of unsubtypeable influenza A in humans.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.071043518,-0.032337286,0.09899987699999999,0.159035034,0.014328158999999998,0.21759877,-0.102363601,-0.005776444,-0.021520695,-0.047653185,-0.000916785,0.011909938,0.024283865,-0.009068168,0.003854626,-0.003504917,0.009805572,-0.012689365,-0.019288711,-0.047403975999999994,0.018346136000000002,0.0026526920000000003,0.020998582000000002,0.024243875,-0.007971387,-0.017048537,-0.038334269,-0.004509493,0.009147272,0.040537217
441,Three-dimensional Culture of Human Airway Epithelium in Matrigel for Evaluation of Human Rhinovirus C and Bocavirus Infections,"Abstract Objective Newly identified human rhinovirus C (HRV-C) and human bocavirus (HBoV) cannot propagate in vitro in traditional cell culture models; thus obtaining knowledge about these viruses and developing related vaccines are difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a novel platform for the propagation of these types of viruses. Methods A platform for culturing human airway epithelia in a three-dimensional (3D) pattern using Matrigel as scaffold was developed. The features of 3D culture were identified by immunochemical staining and transmission electron microscopy. Nucleic acid levels of HRV-C and HBoV in 3D cells at designated time points were quantitated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Levels of cytokines, whose secretion was induced by the viruses, were measured by ELISA. Results Properties of bronchial-like tissues, such as the expression of biomarkers CK5, ZO-1, and PCK, and the development of cilium-like protuberances indicative of the human respiration tract, were observed in 3D-cultured human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, but not in monolayer-cultured cells. Nucleic acid levels of HRV-C and HBoV and levels of virus-induced cytokines were also measured using the 3D culture system. Conclusion Our data provide a preliminary indication that the 3D culture model of primary epithelia using a Matrigel scaffold in vitro can be used to propagate HRV-C and HBoV.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.006653656,-0.046204735,0.020057016,-0.044958434000000005,-0.032708074,0.00608607,0.080318923,-0.049441864,0.046045794,0.016830983,-0.058705932,-0.030589394,0.019447592,0.03379016,0.018589615,-0.030893222999999997,-0.017187283,-0.047141825,0.003557368,-0.084465529,0.063562279,-0.050614951,-0.000553123,0.07179783,-0.14209083,0.108819692,-0.08936740900000001,0.029650851000000002,0.037110363,0.103005999
442,Coxsackievirus B3 Infection Triggers Autophagy through 3 Pathways of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress,"Abstract Objective Autophagy is a highly conserved intracellular degradation pathway. Many picornaviruses induce autophagy to benefit viral replication, but an understanding of how autophagy occurs remains incomplete. In this study, we explored whether coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection induced autophagy through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Methods In CVB3-infected HeLa cells, the specific molecules of ER stress and autophagy were detected using Western blotting, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and confocal microscopy. Then PKR-like ER protein kinase (PERK) inhibitor, inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE1) inhibitor, or activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6) inhibitor worked on CVB3-infected cells, their effect on autophagy was assessed by Western blotting for detecting microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3). Results CVB3 infection induced ER stress, and ER stress sensors PERK/eIF2α, IRE1/XBP1, and ATF6 were activated. CVB3 infection increased the accumulation of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 punctuation and induced the conversion from LC3-I to phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated LC3-1 (LC3-II). CVB3 infection still decreased the expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p-mTOR. Inhibition of PERK, IRE1, or ATF6 significantly decreased the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I in CVB3-infected HeLa cells. Conclusion CVB3 infection induced autophagy through ER stress in HeLa cells, and PERK, IRE1, and ATF6a pathways participated in the regulation of autophagy. Our data suggested that ER stress may inhibit mTOR signaling pathway to induce autophagy during CVB3 infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.066179078,-0.030980866,0.00015974200000000002,-0.08656187800000001,-0.077077267,0.03058556,0.023822838,-0.029937482,0.051297234000000004,-0.036999252999999996,-0.024922621000000002,-0.016856995,-0.026863428999999998,0.076786881,-0.004546903,0.016956195,0.024955354,-0.034811275,-0.000782849,-0.002294018,0.002259738,0.013717558000000001,-0.005269891999999999,-0.027299628,0.042963222,0.012205561,-0.026149172000000002,0.014134299,-0.013547179,-0.004644264
444,Sequence similarity and structural homologies are involved in the autoimmune response elicited by mouse hepatitis virus A59,"Abstract The features of autoantibodies (autoAb) to liver fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) elicited in mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) were studied by ELISA and western-blot competition assays. All sera tested contained Ab to cryptic FAH epitopes according with results from western-blot tests, whereas ELISA data indicated that some of these same sera did recognize native epitopes of the autoantigen (autoAg). Such differences were detected in individual sera from various mouse strains, and were ascribed to the fact that proteins insolubilized on solid supports expose a variety of conformational and cryptic antigenic determinants. On the other hand, whereas results from both experimental protocols showed that anti-MHV Ab did not cross-react with the soluble autoAg, the opposite situation did not show analogous results. Thus, binding of autoAb to insolubilized FAH could be inhibited by MHV depending on the mouse serum or the experimental protocol used. Additionally, a set of synthetic homologous peptides from mouse FAH and various viral proteins was employed to analyze the Ab repertoire of MHV-infected mice. Results indicated that two homologous peptides were recognized by most Ab: the N-terminal sequences (1–10) from FAH and the nucleocapside, both sharing 50% of identity, and sequence 2317–2326 of the RNA polymerase, a peptide showing 30% of identity with FAH 11–20. Results indicated that MHV-infection triggers at least three distinct Ab populations: anti-MHV, anti-FAH and cross-reacting Ab. This cross-reaction implies either sequential or conformational epitopes from both the viral proteins and the autoAg and may differ between individuals.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.087371058,-0.033242453,0.00242688,-0.052919035999999996,-0.008116271999999999,-0.00713811,-0.048609317,-0.010272373000000001,0.02350837,-0.055098978,-0.041959574000000006,-0.023588603,0.013796733,0.00386401,0.040617307000000005,0.029372849,-0.040445802999999995,0.023140337999999996,0.018581223,-0.01020862,0.030227545,-0.014546446999999999,0.054707697,0.028490505,0.116421161,0.11870741300000001,0.019413831,-0.035877877999999995,-0.055051535,0.016099865

A total of 60 samples were screened for coronavirus using a nested PCR amplification of a fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. Sequences from 11 positive samples were highly similar to the Kakegawa, Quebec and Mebus BCoV strains (99.5–100.0%) and 99.2% identical to an alpaca Coronavirus (CoV) previously detected in the USA.

448,Interplay between mutational and horizontally acquired resistance mechanisms and its association with carbapenem resistance amongst extensively drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (XDR-PA),"Abstract Between 2003 and 2009, the prevalence of extensively drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (XDR-PA) increased significantly in northern Taiwan from 1.0% to 2.1%. Molecular methods were used to investigate the genetic relatedness and carbapenem resistance mechanisms of a collection of 203 non-repetitive XDR-PA isolates available for study. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), 52 genotypes were observed; one predominant genotype (pulsotype 1) was found in 57.6% of the isolates. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequencing and quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR analyses demonstrated that one horizontally acquired mechanism [metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) genes] and two mutational mechanisms (efflux and porins) accounted for the carbapenem resistance. The most predominant horizontally acquired mechanism was carriage of bla VIM-3, which was found in 61.1% of isolates. Decreased expression of oprD was the most prevalent mutational mechanism and was found in 70.0% of the XDR-PA isolates, whereas overexpression of mexA was found in 27.6% of the isolates. The highlight of this study was the discovery of statistically significant relationships between certain horizontally acquired and mutational resistance mechanisms and their contribution to carbapenem susceptibility. MBL-producers expressed significantly lower MexAB and higher OprD than non-MBL-producers. Amongst isolates without an acquired β-lactamase gene, oprD expression was significantly reduced, whilst expression of efflux pumps was increased. Reduced OprD expression alone or the production of VIM-type MBLs showed similar contributions to a low to intermediate MIC50 (minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of the organisms) for carbapenems. Isolates with reduced OprD expression that simultaneously harboured bla VIM exhibited high levels of resistance to carbapenems, which implied that these two mechanisms had a synergistic effect on the MICs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.042236786,-0.025870667000000003,0.032502403,-0.11199729900000001,-0.030817746,0.087201349,0.0032257220000000003,-0.047363002,0.024247911,0.020449021,-0.032698015,0.021612277000000003,-0.03449041,0.044198296,-0.015399026000000001,-0.009678220999999999,-0.036893748999999997,-0.00822365,-0.039344211000000004,-0.06073128,0.058329947,0.014592228,0.063485452,0.058519173,-0.076372193,-0.01072017,0.043954673,0.000188457,0.043647045,-0.010216403

452,IoT PCR for pandemic disease detection and its spread monitoring,"Abstract During infectious disease outbreaks, the centers for disease control need to monitor particular areas. Considerable effort has been invested in the development of portable, user-friendly, and cost-effective systems for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, which could also create an Internet of Things (IoT) for healthcare via a global network. However, at present IoT based on a functional POC instrument is not available. Here we show a fast, user-friendly, and affordable IoT system based on a miniaturized polymerase chain reaction device.

453,Infectious exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease associated with respiratory viruses and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae,"Abstract Infectious exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been reported to occur with both viral and bacterial pathogens. In this study, 35 exacerbations associated with the isolation of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae from sputum were identified as part of a prospective longitudinal study. Samples from these patients were subjected to immunoassays to identify a new immune response to the homologous isolate of non-typeable H. influenzae to more accurately assess a bacterial etiology. These patients also were studied carefully for evidence of viral infection using viral culture, serology and polymerase chain reaction-based assays. Sixteen of 35 exacerbations (45.7%) were associated with evidence of acute viral infection and 11 of the 35 exacerbations (31.4%) were associated with the development of new serum IgG to homologous non-typeable H. influenzae. Overall, evidence of infection with a respiratory virus or non-typeable H. influenzae was seen in 24 of 35 exacerbations (68.6%). No association between viral infection and immune response to non-typeable H. influenzae was observed, although a trend toward an immune response to non-typeable H. influenzae and absence of viral infection was seen. The results show that exacerbations in adults with COPD were associated with infection caused by virus alone, non-typeable H. influenzae alone, or virus and non-typeable H. influenzae simultaneously.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.061555925,-0.045276669000000005,-0.045884947999999995,-0.10851642,-0.064030187,-0.013811001000000002,0.039390301,0.002963558,-0.053696792,0.07918683900000001,-0.017437971,-0.05493137,0.019244326000000003,0.017032931,0.0036985840000000004,-0.017200893000000002,0.007264408000000001,-0.051384964000000005,-0.009504885,0.004431707,-0.011184445,-0.055923619,-0.005053308,0.059438622,0.006023874,0.025892698999999998,0.003102831,-0.028238501000000003,0.059050219,0.110488402

Les formes gravissimes ou létales sont en revanche exceptionnelles. Observation. – Nous rapportons une observation de décès brutal d’un enfant de 23 mois chez lequel le virus Influenza A a été isolé postmortem par polymerase chain reaction (PCR) dans le poumon et dont les lésions anatomopathologiques étaient celles décrites dans la grippe maligne. Conclusion. – Devant un tableau de décès non expliqué voire une mort subite du nourrisson ou du jeune enfant, les causes infectieuses en particulier virales doivent être cherchées soigneusement avec recherche virale par PCR recommandée, les autres techniques pouvant rester négatives. Abstract Influenza A virus infections are common in childhood and infancy and are often underdiagnosed while serious or letal forms are rare. Case-report. – We describe a case of sudden death in a two-year-old boy.

A. Gagneur est boursier de la Société française de pédiatrie.","Résumé Les coronavirus humains sont des virus enveloppés à ARN de la famille des Coronaviridae avec deux sérogroupes identifiés : 229-E et OC-43. Ces virus possèdent le plus grand ARN viral connu. Ce génome est un ARN simple brin positif associé à une protéine phosphorylée de la nucléocapside, la protéine N. L’enveloppe des coronavirus humains contient deux ou trois glycoprotéines membranaires : S ou spike protein, M ou protéine de membrane et HE ou hémagglutine-estérase. Le rôle pathogène de ces virus est mal connu en raison des difficultés diagnostiques. Cependant la mise au point de l’immunofluorescence avec anticorps monoclonaux et des techniques d’amplification génique permet de nouvelles recherches épidémiologiques. Les coronavirus peuvent survivre jusqu’à six jours en suspension et trois heures après séchage, ce qui suggère un rôle nosocomial potentiel. Deux études prospectives réalisées dans une unité de réanimation néonatale et pédiatrique ont révélé une relation significative entre l’existence de prélèvement nasopharyngés positifs et la survenue de symptômes respiratoires. Des prélèvements positifs chez le personnel suggèrent une contamination patient-personnel ou personnel–patient. En raison de leur survie possible sur les surfaces et de l’efficacité démontrée des agents désinfectants, des mesures universelles de prévention associant lavage des mains et désinfection des surfaces peuvent être proposées. Abstract Human coronaviruses, with two known serogroups named 229-E and OC-43, are enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses. The large RNA is surrounded by a nucleoprotein (protein N). The envelop contains 2 or 3 glycoproteins: spike protein (or protein S), matrix protein (or protein M) and a hemagglutinin (or protein HE). Their pathogen role remains unclear because their isolation is difficult. Reliable and rapid methods as immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction allow new researches on epidemiology. Human coronaviruses can survive for as long as 6 days in suspension and 3 hours after drying on surfaces, suggesting that they could be a source of hospital-acquired infections. Two prospective studies conducted in a neonatal and paediatric intensive care unit demonstrated a significant association of coronavirus-positive naso-pharyngal samples with respiratory illness in hospitalised preterm neonates. Positive samples from staff suggested either a patient-to-staff or a staff-to-patient transmission. No cross-infection were observed from community-acquired respiratory-syncitial virus or influenza-infected children to neonates.

464,Angiotensin-converting enzyme polymorphism affects outcome of local Chinese with acute lung injury,"Summary Introduction Acute Lung Injury (ALI) with genetic predisposition is fatal. Relationship between angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D) polymorphism and the prognosis of local Chinese patients with ALI was investigated; meanwhile, the mechanisms involved were explored. Methods 101 ALI patients, 408 non-ALI patients and 236 healthy blood donors were enrolled. ACE I/D polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction, then ACE genotype (II, ID, DD) and allele (I, D) frequencies were compared. Clinical data of ALI patients was calculated. Also, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from healthy volunteers with different ACE genotypes. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ACE gene mRNA expression and ACE activity was measured. Results There was no significant difference in the frequencies of the genotypes and alleles. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score was higher in DD subgroup than in II subgroup (19.7 ± 8.7 and 15.6 ± 6.2; P < 0.05). The 28-day mortality was significantly different (17.4%, 26.8%, and 64.3% for II, ID, and DD; P = 0.013). DD genotype was the independent prognostic factor for 28-day outcome. Furthermore, LPS-induced ACE mRNA expression and ACE activity from PBMC in DD genotype subgroup were both significantly higher than those in the other two subgroups. Conclusions ACE I/D polymorphism is a prognostic factor for ALI. Patients with the DD genotype have higher mortality of ALI. Polymorphism influences the expression of ACE gene in LPS-stimulated PBMC, DD genotype leads to higher level of mRNA and enzyme activity. It may be one of the mechanisms involved.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.011179798999999999,-0.024764607,-0.025445655,-0.146329183,-0.046133217000000004,0.015433055,-0.008648444,-0.007561775,-0.03993603,-0.038491962000000005,-0.038046078,0.031431532000000005,-0.020085227,0.054048777,-0.039706536,0.03055927,-0.011232343999999998,-0.024387767,-0.018021018,-0.037853967999999995,0.038375278,-0.041992535,0.009299969,0.028161606000000002,-0.031295475,-0.054330475999999996,-0.009430745,-0.016585986,0.019151688,-0.026642617
469,Polyproteins in structural biology,"Polyproteins are chains of covalently conjoined smaller proteins that occur in nature as versatile means to organize the proteome of viruses including HIV. During maturation, viral polyproteins are typically cleaved into the constituent proteins with different biological functions by highly specific proteases, and structural analyses at defined stages of this maturation process can provide clues for antiviral intervention strategies. Recombinant polyproteins that use similar mechanisms are emerging as powerful tools for producing hitherto inaccessible protein targets such as the influenza polymerase, for high-resolution structure determination by X-ray crystallography. Conversely, covalent linking of individual protein subunits into single polypeptide chains are exploited to overcome sample preparation bottlenecks. Moreover, synthetic polyproteins provide a promising tool to dissect dynamic folding of polypeptide chains into three-dimensional architectures in single-molecule structure analysis by atomic force microscopy (AFM).

471,Bat-derived influenza-like viruses H17N10 and H18N11,"Shorebirds and waterfowls are believed to be the reservoir hosts for influenza viruses, whereas swine putatively act as mixing vessels. The recent identification of two influenza-like virus genomes (designated H17N10 and H18N11) from bats has challenged this notion. A crucial question concerns the role bats might play in influenza virus ecology. Structural and functional studies of the two major surface envelope proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), demonstrate that neither has canonical HA or NA functions found in influenza viruses. However, putative functional modules and domains in other encoded proteins are conserved, and the N-terminal domain of the H17N10 polymerase subunit PA has a classical structure and function. Therefore, potential genomic reassortments of such influenza-like viruses with canonical influenza viruses cannot be excluded at this point and should be assessed.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.027446211,-0.10626072199999999,-0.047954727999999995,0.204646694,0.069154893,0.324605354,-0.033117028,0.016008981000000002,-0.078889932,-0.094321393,-0.068729622,-0.02547038,0.011133768999999998,-0.028139364,-0.038133506,-0.00972076,0.074124398,-0.052671275,-0.021538707,0.019589278999999998,-0.014257696,-0.0025473379999999997,0.012758465,-0.035100923,-0.000786013,0.030004158,-0.048002779,-0.004275794,0.011556631999999999,-0.026453313
472,Antiviral and cytotoxic activities of aminoarylazo compounds and aryltriazene derivatives,"Abstract Twelve aminoarylazocompounds (A–C) and 46 aryltriazene 7 derivatives (D–G) have been synthesized and evaluated in cell-based assays for cytotoxicity and antiviral activity against a panel of 10 RNA and DNA viruses. Eight aminoazocompounds and 27 aryltriazene derivatives exhibited antiviral activity, sometimes of high level, against one or more viruses. A marked activity against BVDV and YFV was prevailing among the former compounds, while the latter type of compounds affected mainly CVB-2 and RSV. None of the active compounds inhibited the multiplication of HIV-1, VSV and VV. Arranged in order of decreasing potency and selectivity versus the host cell lines, the best compounds are the following; BVDV: 1 > 7 > 8 > 4; YFV: 7 > 5; CVB-2: 25 > 56 > 18; RSV: 14 > 20 > 55 > 38 > 18 > 19; HSV-1: 2. For these compounds the EC50 ranged from 1.6μM (1) to 12μM (18), and the S. I. from 19.4 (1) to 4.2 (2). Thus the aminoarylazo and aryltriazene substructures appear as interesting molecular component for developing antiviral agents against ss RNA viruses, particularly against RSV and BVDV, which are important human and veterinary pathogens. Finally, molecular modeling investigations indicated that compounds of structure A–C, active against BVDV, could work targeting the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), having been observed a good agreement between the trends of the estimated IC50 and the experimental EC50 values.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.069404609,-0.058545793,-0.037758044,0.062631817,-0.084899747,0.017291535,0.104598151,-0.018381931,0.033922518,0.020557551,0.047469769,0.032790175,-0.06982414599999999,-0.007077986,-0.018942272,-0.020248227,-0.022801265,0.102068274,0.08002816900000001,-0.044922547,7.31e-07,-0.011606243,0.014380166000000002,0.011563211,0.061189583,-0.044522611,0.130484869,0.012219671999999999,0.012239591000000001,0.035328411000000004

479,Hesperetin protects crayfish Procambarus clarkii against white spot syndrome virus infection,"Abstract Hesperetin is a natural flavanone compound, which mainly exists in lemons and oranges, and has potential antiviral and anticancer activities. In this study, hesperetin was used in a crayfish pathogen challenge to discover its effects on the innate immune system of invertebrates. The crayfish Procambarus clarkii was used as an experimental model and challenged with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). Pathogen challenge experiments showed that hesperetin treatment significantly reduced the mortality caused by WSSV infection, while the VP28 copies of WSSV were also reduced. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction revealed that hesperetin increased the expression of several innate immune-related genes, including NF-kappaB and C-type lectin. Further analysis showed that hesperetin treatment plays a positive effects on three immune parameters like total hemocyte count, phenoloxidase and superoxide dismutase activity. Nevertheless, whether or not infected with WSSV, hesperetin treatment would significantly increase the hemocyte apoptosis rates in crayfish. These results indicated that hesperetin could regulate the innate immunity of crayfish, and delaying and reducing the mortality after WSSV challenge.

482,Molecular Screening by Polymerase Chain Reaction Detects Panleukopenia Virus DNA in Formalin-Fixed Hearts from Cats with Idiopathic Cardiomyopathy and Myocarditis,"Abstract Viral myocarditis has been suggested as an etiology for cardiomyopathy in several mammalian species. Myocarditis and idiopathic cardiomyopathy have been reported in the domestic cat, although a viral etiology has not been demonstrated. Because of the continuing interest in the potential relationship between viral myocarditis and cardiomyopathy, we evaluated hearts from cats with spontaneous, idiopathic cardiomyopathy for viral genomic material within myocytes by polymerase chain reaction, and for the presence of myocarditis by light microscopy. Thirty-one (31) formalin-fixed hearts from domestic cats who died of idiopathic cardiomyopathy were randomly selected from pathology archives. Seventeen (17) formalin-fixed hearts from healthy cats were similarly selected as normal controls. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to evaluate myocardial tissue for the presence of viral genome from feline panleukopenia virus, herpes virus, calici virus, and corona virus. Hearts were examined using light microscopy for histologic evidence of myocarditis according to the Dallas criteria. Panleukopenia virus was identified by PCR in 10 of 31 cats with cardiomyopathy but in none of the controls. Neither cardiomyopathic or control cats tested positive by PCR for herpes virus, calici virus, and corona virus. Myocarditis was detected by histologic examination in 18 of 31 cardiomyopathic cats and in none of 17 control cats. Myocarditis and or feline panleukopenia virus genome was detected in felines with idiopathic hypertrophic, dilated, and restrictive cardiomyopathy, suggesting a possible role of viral infection and inflammation in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy in this species.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.01236592,-0.030948842999999997,0.039807888,-0.111029751,0.005746223000000001,0.023643467999999997,0.038572136,-0.00157474,-0.04462871,-0.069054685,0.22136065600000002,-0.11454895699999999,0.126707921,-0.013595165,-0.037088765,-0.02885346,0.02848808,-0.015986548,0.003915092,0.051927672,-0.019826605,0.000830463,0.024648681000000002,0.025427743,-0.027225362000000003,0.02856319,0.005017344,0.0057157430000000006,-0.009465011,0.017743285
486,Identification of porcine circovirus type 2 in retrospective cases of pigs naturally infected with porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus,"Abstract The identification of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) was studied in fresh intestinal tissues by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in formalin-fixed, paraffin-wax-embedded intestinal tissues by in situ hybridisation. The tissues came from pigs naturally infected with porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV). A total of 35 (32.7%) of 107 small intestinal samples from pigs naturally infected with PEDV were found to be positive using PCR. Positive signals for PCV2 were detected in 32 (29.9%) of 107 small intestinal samples from pigs naturally infected with PEDV by in situ hybridisation. The distribution of positive cells in the jejunum and ileum was multifocal or patchy. Distinct positive labelling was found throughout the lamina propria in the small intestines. The results of this study indicate that PCV2 is highly prevalent in pigs naturally infected with PEDV.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.016319655,0.00015345299999999998,0.09775713800000001,-0.131248193,0.043156027,0.031662775,-0.016914711000000002,-0.031731277999999995,-0.005889933000000001,-0.054390525999999995,0.083894008,0.048778370999999994,-0.141660904,0.091284978,0.296956288,-0.181569549,-0.032711282,0.012087317,-0.041562366,0.11522999800000001,-0.142221452,-0.047792849000000005,0.086068834,-0.072222575,-0.025256721,-0.028099374,-0.071471727,0.025823915,0.036556127,-0.024741661
487,Genetic differentiation of the nucleocapsid protein of Korean isolates of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus by RT-PCR based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis,"Abstract A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis based on the nucleocapsid (N) gene was developed to differentiate between field isolates of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) and a vaccine strain, J-vac. Thirteen field isolates of PEDV from Korea were distinguishable from the vaccine strain and the prototype PEDV strain CV777 by RFLP using Tru9I. RFLP patterns in 11 of 13 field PEDV isolates were different from the vaccine strain using AspLEI, HgaI and MspR9I. Sequence analysis of the PEDV N gene revealed that Korean field PEDV isolates had 93.6% and 89.6% identity with the vaccine virus at nucleotide and amino acid sequence levels, respectively, suggesting progressive point mutations of the PEDV genome in the field. RFLP analysis of the PEDV N gene is a promising tool for distinguishing field strains from the vaccine-derived virus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.064951305,0.007637615,0.134226291,-0.128161148,0.129016892,0.074477523,-0.093960523,-0.050211173,0.027406881,0.008694321,0.03917603,0.13342695300000001,-0.18071827399999998,-0.026014501000000002,0.243691552,-0.232751785,-0.078104258,0.0648314,-0.07564356700000001,0.217602513,-0.14206960400000002,-0.095565938,0.142925991,0.014281344,-0.053308614000000004,-0.050016475,0.014158469,0.01391247,0.046125004000000004,0.03982578
488,Current perspectives on the diagnosis and epidemiology of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infection,"Abstract Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is the principal aetiological agent of enzootic pneumonia (EP), a chronic respiratory disease that affects mainly finishing pigs. Although major efforts to control M. hyopneumoniae infection and its detrimental effects have been made, significant economic losses in pig production worldwide due to EP continue. M. hyopneumoniae is typically introduced into pig herds by the purchase of subclinically infected animals or, less frequently, through airborne transmission over short distances. Once in the herd, M. hyopneumoniae may be transmitted by direct contact from infected sows to their offspring or between pen mates. The ‘gold standard’ technique used to diagnose M. hyopneumoniae infection, bacteriological culture, is laborious and is seldom used routinely. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction detection methods, in addition to post-mortem inspection in the form of abattoir surveillance or field necropsy, are the techniques most frequently used to investigate the potential involvement of M. hyopneumoniae in porcine respiratory disease. Such techniques have been used to monitor the incidence of M. hyopneumoniae infection in herds both clinically and subclinically affected by EP, in vaccinated and non-vaccinated herds and under different production and management conditions. Differences in the clinical course of EP at farm level and in the efficacy of M. hyopneumoniae vaccination suggest that the transmission and virulence characteristics of different field isolates of M. hyopneumoniae may vary. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of the epidemiology of M. hyopneumoniae infection including its transmission, infection and seroconversion dynamics and also compares the various epidemiological tools used to monitor EP.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.010539821999999999,-0.009290088,0.034602826,-0.076345974,-0.021643496,0.049256285999999996,0.03422892,0.0041647509999999995,0.017617774,0.02381316,0.004193602,0.008665883000000001,-0.007049491999999999,-0.039283264,0.060766485,-0.004734875,-0.032143676,0.011098847,-0.035986682,0.022743826,-0.009597631,-0.02824016,0.007218056,-0.03241009,0.018187404,-0.007488536,-0.031367016,0.007905106,-0.002669582,-0.012041131000000002
490,Tracing the transmission of bovine coronavirus infections in cattle herds based on S gene diversity,"Abstract Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is found worldwide and causes respiratory infections and diarrhoea in calves and adult cattle. In order to investigate the molecular epidemiology of BCoV, 27 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive samples from 25 cattle herds in different parts of Sweden were analysed. A 1038-nucleotide fragment was PCR amplified and directly sequenced. The analysed BCoV strains showed a high sequence identity, regardless of whether they were obtained from outbreaks of respiratory disease or diarrhoea or from calves or adult cattle. Circulation of an identical BCoV strain during a 4-month period was demonstrated in calves in one dairy herd. In a regional epizootic of winter dysentery in Northern Sweden, highly similar BCoV strains were detected. In the Southern and Central regions, several genotypes of BCoV circulated contemporaneously, indicating that in these regions, which had a higher density of cattle than the Northern regions, more extensive transmission of the virus was occurring. Identical BCoV sequences supported the epidemiological data that inter-herd contact through purchased calves was important. Swedish BCoV strains unexpectedly showed a high homology with recently detected Italian strains. This study shows that molecular analysis of the spike (S) glycoprotein gene of BCoV can be a useful tool to support or rule out suspected transmission routes.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.009687707,0.007520723000000001,0.079412602,-0.074227579,0.104503291,0.009851091999999999,-0.026775197,-0.009333224000000001,0.010760071999999999,-0.004381493,0.022881186,0.05900463400000001,-0.029273504,-0.024995423,0.053123564000000005,-0.032792809,-0.007332683,0.01835152,0.013170796,-0.033214204,0.058962334000000005,0.0076875780000000005,-0.053144120999999996,0.022034397,0.061166028,-0.01086471,0.001346164,-0.08496660699999999,0.061153237,0.0022021189999999998

Rectal swab samples were subjected to a nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, specific for the conservative nucleocapsid region of the virus genome. More than 30% of the sampled animals proved positive for the presence of feline coronaviruses.

493,In-silico screening for anti-Zika virus phytochemicals,"Abstract Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus that has infected hundreds of thousands of people and is a rapidly expanding epidemic across Central and South America. ZIKV infection has caused serious, albeit rare, complications including Guillain–Barré syndrome and congenital microcephaly. There are currently no vaccines or antiviral agents to treat or prevent ZIKV infection, but there are several ZIKV non-structural proteins that may serve as promising antiviral drug targets. In this work, we have carried out an in-silico search for potential anti-Zika viral agents from natural sources. We have generated ZIKV protease, methyltransferase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase using homology modeling techniques and we have carried out molecular docking analyses of our in-house virtual library of phytochemicals with these protein targets as well as with ZIKV helicase. Overall, 2263 plant-derived secondary metabolites have been docked. Of these, 43 compounds that have drug-like properties have exhibited remarkable docking profiles to one or more of the ZIKV protein targets, and several of these are found in relatively common herbal medicines, suggesting promise for natural and inexpensive antiviral therapy for this emerging tropical disease.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.090377659,-0.014482766999999999,-0.016179028999999998,-0.013741318,-0.08367367099999999,0.06623084,0.069395968,-0.0030038940000000004,0.035713582,0.035951916,-0.017914606,0.023121809,0.027670096,-0.050377895,0.005031857,-0.024490215,-0.008007577,0.097380823,0.017362731,0.036321457,-0.024939196,0.008966472,-0.044126570999999996,0.016101456,0.056726421,0.035277881000000004,0.039193018999999996,-0.025697787000000003,0.025263187000000003,0.041613523

The low inter-assay coefficient of variation recorded demonstrated that this method is highly repeatable. Compared with SPF cats, cytokine production was upregulated in most of the samples from FCoV-positive non-symptomatic cats. The appearance of a case of FIP in the cattery was associated with an increased expression of cytokines, in particular there was an increased production of IL-1β and IFN-γ, suggesting that these cytokines might protect infected cats from the disease. This hypothesis was also supported by the low levels of IFN-γ recorded in blood from cats with FIP.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.01353442,0.020156201999999998,0.134224925,-0.217994362,-0.024079037,0.026368818999999998,0.044901878,-0.026573542999999998,-0.027022821000000002,-0.20581671399999998,0.485762825,-0.18530400600000002,0.244982602,0.010405936,-0.16869041399999998,-0.03519026,0.05181665,-0.02588386,-0.007354806,0.066592445,-0.029210963,-0.047159590999999994,0.08930939800000001,0.035030473,-0.05868063,0.034976349,0.01825176,0.05358794,0.039814511000000004,-0.033071749
496,The detection of feline coronaviruses in blood samples from cats by mRNA RT-PCR,"In this study, 26 blood samples were collected from 25 healthy cats and one cat with clinical signs suggestive of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), namely, fever, weight loss, enlarged abdomen, and ascites. Blood samples were tested for feline coronavirus (FCoV) messenger RNA (mRNA) by an reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay which has previously been described to have a high specificity in the diagnosis of clinical FIP [Simons AF, Vennema H, Rofina JE, Pol JM, Horzinek MC, Rottier PJM, Egberink HF (2005) A mRNA PCR for the diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis. Journal of Virological Methods 124, 111–116]. Overall we found 14 (54%) of the cats were positive for FCoV including the cat with clinical disease, but the high rate of positivity among healthy cats suggested a poor specificity for the clinical diagnosis of FIP among these cats. It was observed that the positivity rate was highest in cats aged between 6 months–1 year old.

498,Pathogenesis of feline enteric coronavirus infection,"Fifty-one specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats 10 weeks to 13 years of age were infected with a cat-to-cat fecal–oral passed strain of feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). Clinical signs ranged from unapparent to a mild and self-limiting diarrhea. Twenty-nine of these cats were FECV naïve before infection and followed sequentially for fecal virus shedding and antibody responses over a period of 8–48 months. Fecal shedding, as determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from rectal swabs, appeared within a week and was significantly higher in kittens than older cats. FECV shedding remained at high levels for 2–10 months before eventually evolving into one of three excretion patterns. Eleven cats shed the virus persistently at varying levels over an observation period of 9–24 months. Eleven cats appeared to have periods of virus shedding interlaced with periods of non-shedding (intermittent or recurrent shedders), and seven cats ceased shedding after 5–19 months (average 12 months). There was no change in the patterns of virus shedding among cats that were excreting FECV at the time of a secondary challenge exposure. Four cats, which had ceased shedding, re-manifested a primary type infection when secondarily infected. Cats with higher feline coronavirus (FCoV) antibody titers were significantly more likely to shed virus, while cats with lower titers were significantly less likely to be shedding. Twenty-two kittens born to experimentally infected project queens began shedding virus spontaneously, but never before 9–10 weeks of age. Natural kittenhood infections appeared to be low grade and abortive. However, a characteristic primary type infection occurred following experimental infection with FECV at 12–15 weeks of age. Pregnancy, parturition and lactation had no influence on fecal shedding by queens.

499,Association between faecal shedding of feline coronavirus and serum α1-acid glycoprotein sialylation,"The sialylation pattern of serum α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) in non-symptomatic cats infected by feline coronavirus (FCoV) and its possible relationship with the amount of FCoVs shed in faeces were investigated. Blood from three specific pathogen-free cats (group A) and from 10 non-symptomatic FCoV-positive cats from catteries with low (group B, three cats) or high (group C, seven cats) levels of faecal shedding were collected monthly. AGP was purified from serum and Western blotting followed by lectin-staining of α(2,3)-linked and α(2,6)-linked sialic acid. Faecal shedding was quantified in group C by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Variations of AGP sialylation were recorded only in cats from group C, on which viral shedding peaked before the occurrence of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in the cattery, and decreased 1 month later, when serum AGP had an increase of α(2,3)-linked sialic acid. These results suggest that hypersialylation of AGP may be involved in host–virus interactions.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.026823261,-0.013810869,0.055594498,-0.226413845,0.014697163000000001,0.034288107000000005,0.061392677,-0.010970671000000001,-0.065283252,-0.175469248,0.44390778,-0.171060354,0.222118858,-0.039319804,-0.144343733,-0.055183234000000005,0.048318494000000003,-0.014433321,0.0051358720000000005,0.09160379,-0.064449966,-0.073991659,0.037582538,0.008980586,-0.046606517,0.034008706,0.012631291000000001,0.006621406,-0.029959994,-0.00227997
500,Polycystic kidney disease in a Chartreux cat,"Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is one of the most common genetic diseases in cats. It has been widely described in Persians and Persian-related cats and sporadically in other breeds. The purpose of the present paper is to describe the first reported case of PKD in a 12-year-old female Chartreux cat. The cat was referred with polyuria and polydipsia and enlarged and irregular kidneys at palpation. Multiple renal cysts and a single liver cyst were identified by ultrasound and the inherited pattern was confirmed by genetic test (polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR/RFLP) assay).

501,Prevalence of feline coronavirus in two cat populations in Malaysia,The prevalence of feline coronavirus (FCoV) was studied in two catteries in Malaysia. Rectal swabs or faecal samples were collected from a total of 44 clinically healthy Persian purebred and mix-breed cats. RNA extracted from the faecal material was subjected to a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers flanking for a conserved region of the virus genome. The overall prevalence of FCoV infection was 84% and the infection rate was higher in Persian purebred cats (96%) than mix-breed cats (70%). There was no significant association between the age or gender of tested cats and shedding the virus. This study is the first PCR-based survey for FCoV in Malaysia and showed the ubiquitous presence of FCoV in Malaysian cat colonies.,0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.000135107,0.006621913,0.097085059,-0.13060048400000002,0.068588708,-0.01100915,0.00757586,-0.001481342,-0.053089359,-0.177674867,0.44484897799999995,-0.136060152,0.205912617,-0.00021912,-0.114306506,-0.044226534000000005,0.07493418,-0.008295809,0.014384033999999999,0.051273995,-0.048859112999999996,-0.003089295,0.038714969,0.033426628,-0.019849497,0.03533676,0.021559807,0.026507227,0.037818741,-0.000545567
504,Infectious disease emergencies: role of the infectious disease specialist,"ABSTRACT The importance of infections for public health has become obvious during the last decades. Examples are emerging infections such as HIV/AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome, deliberate release of microorganisms, such as the anthrax episode in the USA, the increasing problems with organisms resistant to antimicrobial treatment, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and the threat of a new influenza pandemic with a case fatality rate similar to that in the 1918 outbreak. An effective response to infectious disease emergencies requires careful planning and establishment of resources in advance. The medical specialties involved are clinical microbiology, clinical infectious diseases and epidemiology. Clinical microbiology should include bacteriology, virology and parasitology; the technical developments during the last 15 years have clearly erased most of the methodological differences between these branches of microbiology. New techniques such as new generations of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), rapid methods for nucleic acid sequence analyses and microarrays have enabled more rapid identification of organisms and provide powerful tools in the epidemiological analysis of an outbreak. The infectious disease specialists are necessary for rapid and adequate clinical diagnoses, optimal use of antimicrobial agents and provision of facilities for containment of patients who may spread the infections. The need for isolation units became acute when many countries prepared themselves for a possible severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Europe. With few exceptions, Europe still lacks epidemiological field forces, and it has been embarrassing to be obliged to call upon the Centers for Disease Control for European outbreaks. Hopefully, this will be corrected with the creation of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.09027410400000001,0.026549853999999998,0.024489017000000002,-0.003896664,-0.047260575,0.080148372,0.028937277999999997,0.01838862,-0.000279242,0.105296587,-0.027195999999999998,-0.008925918,0.100069831,-0.12352649199999999,0.036411642,-0.015567336000000001,-0.055982581,0.077910016,-0.05693561900000001,0.009497753000000001,0.011235667,-0.053593708,-0.039352482,-0.072583812,-0.008162425,-0.011777453,-0.016283698,0.0037726820000000003,0.005004376,0.017213838000000002
506,Ordinary and opportunistic enteropathogens associated with diarrhea in senegalese adults in relation to human immunodeficiency virus serostatus,"Abstract Objectives: A survey was conducted in Dakar, Senegal, to identify major types and prevalences of bacteria, parasites, fungi, and Rotaviruses associated with diarrhea in relation to human immunodeficieny virus (HIV) serostatus with the goal to provide guidance to physicians for case management. Methods: Etiologic agents were identified in a case-control study: cases were HIV-infected patients with diarrhea (HIV+ D+) and HIV seronegative patients with diarrhea (HIV− D+); controls were HIV-infected patients without diarrhea (HIV+ D−) and seronegative controls without diarrhea (HID− D−). Ordinary enteric pathogens were identified by conventional methods. Different Escherichia coli pathotypes were characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), identification of HEp-2 cell adherence pattern, Sereny test, GIvl1-ELISA, and the suckling mouse assay. Opportunistic parasites, such as Cryptosporidium and Microsporidium, were identified by the Kinyoun method and trichromic stain of Weber, respectively. Rotaviruses were identified with a commercial latex agglutination kit. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by the disk diffusion method. Results: Among the 594 patients examined, 158 were HIV+ D+, 121 were HIV− D+, 160 were HIV+ D−, and 155 were HIV− D−. The main etiologies of diarrhea were different according to HIV serostatus of patients. In immunocompetent adults the main causes of diarrhea were Shigella sp (12.4%), Entamoeba histolytica (10.7%), Salmonella enterica (6.6%), and Giardia (4.9%). In the immunocompromised host the more frequent pathogens were enteroaggregative E. coli (19.6%), Microsporidium (9.4%), Cryptosporidium sp (8.2%), Rotavirus (8.2%), Shigella sp (7.6%), Candida albicans (7.6%), E. histolytica (5.1%), S. enterica (4.4%), and Isospora belli (4.4%). Also, Blastocystis hominis has to be considered as an opportunistic parasite, because it was identified only in HIV-infected patients, with higher prevalence in adults with diarrhea (2.5% in HIV+ D+ patients; 0.6% in HIV+ D− patients). High level of asymptomatic carriage of Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura and some cases of multiple infections were observed. Fungi, Cryptosporidium sp and Microsporidium sp, were often identified in patients with low CD4 counts (range, 79–250 cells/mL). Independently from HIV-serostatus, CD4 count was lower in diarrheic persons, suggesting that diarrhea is a debilitating illness and that effective management of diarrhea can prevent immunosuppression. Isolated enteropathogenic strains displayed high resistance to most antibiotics used in Senegal for treating diarrhea (ampicillin, tetracycline, cotrimoxazole); they were susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. Conclusion: These epidemiologic data suggest that guidelines for the management of diarrhea during HIV infection in Dakar should be updated.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.056624399000000006,-0.011305531,-0.004928328,-0.11475578300000001,-0.050471256,0.010989744,0.0028833290000000004,0.027531195,-0.072725231,0.025337647999999997,-0.016028581,0.056507572,-0.036750444,0.009487726,0.041879022,-0.036891438,-0.018200287,0.053978542000000004,-0.012864044,0.016581947,0.0015776770000000002,0.003714398,-0.020687062,0.034709276000000004,0.020906916,-0.008738848,0.0036975140000000003,-0.066558489,-0.0032190229999999997,0.024717051
514,"Incorporating polymerase chain reaction-based identification, population characterization, and quantification of microorganisms into aerosol science: A review","Abstract The quantity, identity, and distribution of biomass in indoor and outdoor aerosols are poorly described. This is not consistent with the current understanding of atmospheric chemistry or the microbiological characterization of aquatic and terrestrial environments. This knowledge gap is due to both difficulties in applying contemporary microbiological techniques to the low biomass concentrations present in aerosols, and the traditional reliance of aerosol researchers on culture-based techniques—the quantitative limitations and ecological biases of which have been well-documented and are now avoided in other environmental matrices. This article reviews the emergence of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a nonculture-based method to determine the identity, distribution, and abundance of airborne microorganisms. To encourage the use of PCR-based techniques by a broad spectrum of aerosol researchers, emphasis is given to the critical, aerosol specific method issues of sample processing, DNA extraction, and PCR inhibition removal. These methods are synthesized into a generalized procedure for the PCR-based study of microbial aerosols—equally applicable to both indoor and outdoor aerosol environments.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.01004613,0.020581104,0.10738301199999999,-0.030865211,-0.04349366599999999,0.02947914,0.050075651,0.003019485,-0.007611926999999999,0.04019336,-0.011456972,-0.007187176,0.048847830999999994,-0.068230811,0.03068604,0.016527717,-0.012765021000000001,0.010366564,-0.053197207,-0.108052093,-0.020089571,0.004753579,0.045061077000000005,-0.06236456,-0.004906811,-0.018391552,-0.010594353,-0.028659625,-0.004323227,0.036656558
518,"The macro domain protein family: Structure, functions, and their potential therapeutic implications","Abstract Macro domains are ancient, highly evolutionarily conserved domains that are widely distributed throughout all kingdoms of life. The ‘macro fold’ is roughly 25kDa in size and is composed of a mixed α–β fold with similarity to the P loop-containing nucleotide triphosphate hydrolases. They function as binding modules for metabolites of NAD+, including poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), which is synthesized by PAR polymerases (PARPs). Although there is a high degree of sequence similarity within this family, particularly for residues that might be involved in catalysis or substrates binding, it is likely that the sequence variation that does exist among macro domains is responsible for the specificity of function of individual proteins. Recent findings have indicated that macro domain proteins are functionally promiscuous and are implicated in the regulation of diverse biological functions, such as DNA repair, chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Significant advances in the field of macro domain have occurred in the past few years, including biological insights and the discovery of novel signaling pathways. To provide a framework for understanding these recent findings, this review will provide a comprehensive overview of the known and proposed biochemical, cellular and physiological roles of the macro domain family. Recent data that indicate a critical role of macro domain regulation for the proper progression of cellular differentiation programs will be discussed. In addition, the effect of dysregulated expression of macro domain proteins will be considered in the processes of tumorigenesis and bacterial pathogenesis. Finally, a series of observations will be highlighted that should be addressed in future efforts to develop macro domains as effective therapeutic targets.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.110985385,-0.028737417,-0.01820271,-0.046929448,-0.044636669000000004,0.032523766,0.047849179000000006,-0.018950226,0.024300789,-0.008745135,-0.058169175,0.041111347,0.004026929,-0.071772803,-0.041734747999999995,-0.02830098,0.061113972,-0.021841593,-0.060294522999999996,0.017632748,-0.021125234,0.016262031,-0.022900441,-0.043703375,0.06032034,0.031395262,-0.03076662,0.027886516,0.053725830999999995,-0.06669336099999999
519,"Interaction of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) with four nucleic acid binding proteins DNase I, RNase A, reverse transcriptase and Taq polymerase","Abstract In the investigation of interaction of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) with four biologically important proteins we observed inhibition of enzymatic activity of DNase I, RNase A, M-MLV reverse transcriptase and Taq polymerase by ATA in vitro assay. As the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is the main catalytic subunit of telomerase holoenzyme, we also monitored effect of ATA on telomerase activity in vivo and observed dose-dependent inhibition of telomerase activity in Chinese hamster V79 cells treated with ATA. Direct association of ATA with DNase I (K d =9.019μM)), RNase A (K d =2.33μM) reverse transcriptase (K d =0.255μM) and Taq polymerase (K d =81.97μM) was further shown by tryptophan fluorescence quenching studies. Such association altered the three-dimensional conformation of DNase I, RNase A and Taq polymerase as detected by circular dichroism. We propose ATA inhibits enzymatic activity of the four proteins through interfering with DNA or RNA binding to the respective proteins either competitively or allosterically, i.e. by perturbing three-dimensional structure of enzymes.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.095695509,-0.017800674,-0.006898207,-0.02000267,-0.070873011,0.016287661999999998,0.030208895,-0.021110125,0.020294929,-0.031620521,0.005834768000000001,0.04742476599999999,-0.029254022,2.84e-05,-0.024671329,0.006553139,0.029016979,-0.000579765,0.010954153999999999,-0.021145667000000003,-0.012649443,-0.001407437,0.012973211,-0.033470184,0.040170618,0.029129007999999998,-0.051887820999999994,0.028536842000000003,0.014095636000000002,0.008514304
523,A role for arrays in clinical virology: fact or fiction?,"Abstract Microarrays of DNA probes have at least three roles in clinical virology. These are: firstly, in diagnosis, to recognise the causative agent of an illness; secondly, for molecular typing for (i) patient management, (ii) epidemiological reasons (e.g. investigating routes of transmission), (iii) purposes related to vaccine use; and thirdly, in research, to investigate the interactions between the virus and the host cell. Microarrays intended for syndromic diagnostic purposes require genome specific probes to capture the unknown target viral sequences and thereby reveal the presence of that virus in a test sample. Microarrays intended for typing and patient management, e.g. monitoring antiviral drug resistant mutations require a set of probes representing the important sequence variants of one or more viral genes. Microarrays intended for research into virus–host interactions require probes representative of each individual gene or mRNA of either the virus or the host genome. Diagnostic microarrays are dependent for their utility and versatility on generic, multiplex or random polymerase chain reactions that will amplify any of several (unknown) viral target sequences from a patient sample. In this review, the existing and potential applications of microarrays in virology, and the problems that need to be overcome for future success, are discussed.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.052997424,-0.007196445,0.045706181,0.002697892,-0.045903164,0.057447248,0.04702507400000001,0.007398486,0.021354768,0.066871455,-0.050229692,-0.039204215,0.078133381,-0.061780707000000004,0.021958019,-0.001997187,-0.040752654,0.017743327,-0.061226872,-0.018758018,-0.0064066190000000005,-0.011229071,-0.021610261000000002,-0.004791381,-0.032013224,-0.060843195,0.027759251000000002,-0.020814539,-0.010724683,0.03913078
526,Development of a PCR-and hybridization-based assay (PCR Adenovirus Consensus®) for the detection and the species identification of adenoviruses in respiratory specimens,"Abstract Background: Antigen detection assays and viral isolation techniques are routinely used to detect adenoviruses (Ad) associated with respiratory infections, and the value of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has recently been assessed. Objectives: This paper describes a PCR-hybridization-immunoenzymatic assay (PCR Adenovirus consensus®) used to detect Ad and identify Ad species in respiratory specimens. Results: On seven representative serotypes Ad 12, Ad 3, Ad 7, Ad 11, Ad 1, Ad 8, Ad 4, the mean genome equivalents per ml and the mean 50% infectious doses per ml were 106.3and 104, respectively. Using 362 nasal aspirates from children, Ad were detected by immunofluorescence (IF) and culture in 97 cases (27%), by the PCR-Ad hexon method in 107 cases (29.5%) and by the PCR Adenovirus Consensus® method in 113 cases (31.2%); 13 samples were found positive by both PCR and negative by the IF and culture methods; five samples were only positive according to the PCR Adenovirus Consensus® method. The sensitivity, specificity, predictive positive value and predictive negative value of the PCR Adenovirus Consensus® method were 97.9%, 93.2%, 84%, 99.1%, respectively. The method identified the species (sp) from 91 positive amplicons: 1 Ad sp A, 44 Ad sp B, 42 Ad sp C, 3 Ad sp E, and 1 Ad sp F; 85 isolates were identified by IF or the neutralisation in culture, and 86 by a PCR-RE digestion method. The PCR Adenovirus Consensus® detected six positive samples that were negative according to the IF and culture methods, and it identified the precise species of nine IF-positive and culture-negative nasal aspirates. Conclusion: The PCR Adenovirus Consensus® technique is more efficient than the classical IF or culture techniques for the detection of Ad in respiratory samples.

555,Kinetics of viral load and cytokines in severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome,"Abstract Background Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease in China, Japan, and Korea, which is characterized by high fever, thrombocytopenia, and high mortality. It is hypothesized that a cytokine storm plays an important role in the pathophysiology of SFTS. However, limited data have been published on the detailed kinetics of the viral load and cytokine profiles throughout the course of this disease. Objectives We investigated the patterns of changes in cytokines and viral load in SFTS patients. Study design During the admission period of patients, RNA was extracted from plasma and quantified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In addition, cytokine bead arrays were performed for the 18 cytokines and chemokines selected for testing. Results The median time from admission to the negative conversion of SFTS viremia was 17.0 days. When censored patients were found to be negative for viral load at discharge, the median duration of viral shedding was 13.0 days (95% CI, 5.4–20.6). Interferon (IFN)-α, interleukin (IL)-10, and IFN-γ-induced protein (IP)-10 concentrations significantly increased in the early course of disease and then decreased during the hospital stay. However, the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, IL-12p40, IL-13, IL-17A, Regulated on Activation and Normally T-cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) increased during the late course of disease. Initial IP-10 levels during hospital days 1–4 were the most significantly correlated with initial viral load (r = 0.88, P < .01). Conclusion SFTS viremia persisted until weeks 2–3 and was highly correlated with initial plasma IP-10 levels. In addition, IFN-α, IL-10, and IP-10 were associated with the initial cytokine storm in SFTS.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.039632255,-0.023782727000000004,-0.043568628,-0.162291803,-0.12387498599999999,-0.010801634,0.012333301000000001,0.00976021,-0.018019241999999998,-0.038394406,0.000116184,-0.041562009,-0.055436953,0.10840957400000001,-0.078277641,0.03744928,-0.040412744,-0.041831821,-0.008677821,-0.020870658,-0.029649516,-0.051189637999999996,-0.008933808,0.002595079,-0.109259218,-0.065395762,0.09624485,-0.036684001,-0.042486196,0.029571339
557,Clinical decision making in the emergency department setting using rapid PCR: Results of the CLADE study group,"Abstract Background Emergency Departments (ED) are challenged during influenza season by patients who present acutely during sporadic ED visits. ED management is largely empiric, often occurring without reliable diagnostics needed for targeted therapies, safe outpatient discharge, or hospital admissions. Objective To evaluate the impact of the influenza diagnosis on physician decision making during ED visits using the Cobas Liat® influenza A + B assay. Study design Prospective study assessing the impact of rapid (<30 min), reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) influenza testing on physician decision making in the ED. Physician responses established pre-and post-diagnosis management courses which required confirmation via secondary documentation in the medical record. Changes in physician decision making were analyzed across four clinical touchpoints: (i) admission/discharge status, (ii) medical procedures, (iii) antiviral and antibiotic prescribing, and (iv) laboratory studies. Results An influenza diagnosis changed patient management courses, relative to empiric, pre-diagnosis plans, in in 61% of the cases resulting in cost savings of $49,420-to-$42,270 over 143 patients and 104 days during influenza season resulting in a cost savings of $200.40/ED visit. Evaluation over 2000 ED patient visits projects cost savings > $578,000 due to deferred admissions, and reduction in antiviral prescribing. Sensitivity of ED-based influenza testing using the Cobas Liat® assay was equivalent to centralized lab testing at 98.8% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity respectively. Conclusion Providing rapid, RT-PCR influenza testing to ED settings is actionable and used to guide patient care decisions. Understanding the cascade of events linked to the influenza diagnosis in the ED provides overall cost savings which offset the cost of providing ED-based testing.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.09149115099999999,-0.014253053,0.056529011,0.06925642900000001,-0.07811358,0.152991465,-0.08430206800000001,0.041788166,-0.04990537900000001,-0.059266719,-0.011578722,0.026728892999999997,0.0064207890000000005,-0.028129192999999997,-0.022848066,0.031297035,0.014760335,0.032755553,-0.02948888,-0.04693109,0.013797973,-0.048427549,0.0056831040000000005,-0.057299305,3.73e-05,-0.013986343,-0.00217584,-0.02134777,0.022955722999999997,0.030157337000000003
563,The emergence of influenza A H7N9 in human beings 16 years after influenza A H5N1: a tale of two cities,"Summary Infection with either influenza A H5N1 virus in 1997 or avian influenza A H7N9 virus in 2013 caused severe pneumonia that did not respond to typical or atypical antimicrobial treatment, and resulted in high mortality. Both viruses are reassortants with internal genes derived from avian influenza A H9N2 viruses that circulate in Asian poultry. Both viruses have genetic markers of mammalian adaptation in their haemagglutinin and polymerase PB2 subunits, which enhanced binding to human-type receptors and improved replication in mammals, respectively. Hong Kong (affected by H5N1 in 1997) and Shanghai (affected by H7N9 in 2013) are two rapidly flourishing cosmopolitan megacities that were increasing in human population and poultry consumption before the outbreaks. Both cities are located along the avian migratory route at the Pearl River delta and Yangtze River delta. Whether the widespread use of the H5N1 vaccine in east Asia—with suboptimum biosecurity measures in live poultry markets and farms—predisposed to the emergence of H7N9 or other virus subtypes needs further investigation.

571,Two Cases of Systemic Coronavirus-Associated Disease Resembling Feline Infectious Peritonitis in Domestic Ferrets in Japan,"Abstract A systemic disease of domestic ferrets characterized by pyogranulomatous inflammation was first recognized in Europe and the United States in 2002. The disease closely resembled feline infectious peritonitis and subsequently has been shown to be associated with ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV). A definitive laboratory diagnosis of this disease is typically based on a combination of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests to detect FRSCV in granulomatous lesions. In 2010, this feline infectious peritonitis–like disease was first identified in a laboratory ferret in Japan, and laboratory confirmation of the clinical diagnosis was limited to IHC. This report describes 2 cases of systemic coronavirus-associated disease in ferrets presented to Japanese veterinary hospitals. Both presented with pyogranulomatous inflammation in the abdominal cavity, and both cases tested positive for coronavirus antigen by IHC. In 1 case, for which unfixed tissues were available, FRSCV RNA was detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in the affected tissues.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.01355531,0.027437582000000002,0.032733248,-0.095058928,0.001984196,0.031839703,-0.006135475,0.007667261,-0.000242015,-0.021046132000000002,0.11372491,-0.01565996,0.086565071,-0.06739909200000001,0.000444706,-0.001818288,-0.012829398,0.041801677,-0.050670789,-0.002221612,-0.002480225,-0.0067247159999999995,-0.050261130999999994,-0.06150904,0.029064975,0.017969908,-0.021725074,0.021923939,-0.013052332,-0.020179973
572,A Retrospective Study of 17 Cases of Mycobacteriosis in Domestic Ferrets (Mustela Putorius furo) between 2005 and 2013,"Abstract From 2005 to 2013, 17 ferrets were diagnosed with mycobacteriosis at the authors’ practices. Clinical findings included ocular, respiratory, and digestive abnormalities. Diagnosis was based on histopathology, specific histochemical stains, and/or on polymerase chain reaction. All bacteria identified belonged to the nontuberculous Mycobacterium complex. Several treatment protocols were attempted, frequently based on the use of enrofloxacin. In all, 3 ferrets were considered cured. Mycobacteriosis in ferrets is a polymorphous disease with diverse clinical presentations. It is also likely an underdiagnosed disease in pet ferrets, which appear to be particularly susceptible to environmental sources. Mycobacteriosis should be included in the differential diagnosis for ocular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal diseases; in particular, it should be differentiated from systemic coronavirus infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.041784969,-0.004771582,0.011188146000000001,-0.065321049,-0.021819872,0.013609851999999999,0.033461727000000004,0.013112489,0.01101894,0.02481132,0.017811523,0.00307444,0.057743746,-0.054741804000000005,0.0191343,0.002441898,-0.00340685,0.032735047,-0.024254422999999997,0.002513554,0.021413012000000002,-0.034379049,-0.034917796,-0.044275472999999996,0.05202955,-0.008851033000000001,-0.032118731,-0.005225368,0.011501757,-0.019930623

However, limitations to implementation of molecular methods for human infectious diseases testing are being rapidly overcome allowing for the clinical evaluation and implementation of diverse technologies with expanding diagnostic capabilities. The advantages and limitation of molecular techniques including real-time polymerase chain reaction, partial or whole genome sequencing, molecular typing, microarrays, broad-range PCR and multiplexing will be discussed.

578,Molecular evolution and emergence of avian gammacoronaviruses,"Abstract Coronaviruses, which are single stranded, positive sense RNA viruses, are responsible for a wide variety of existing and emerging diseases in humans and other animals. The gammacoronaviruses primarily infect avian hosts. Within this genus of coronaviruses, the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes a highly infectious upper-respiratory tract disease in commercial poultry. IBV shows rapid evolution in chickens, frequently producing new antigenic types, which adds to the multiple serotypes of the virus that do not cross protect. Rapid evolution in IBV is facilitated by strong selection, large population sizes and high genetic diversity within hosts, and transmission bottlenecks between hosts. Genetic diversity within a host arises primarily by mutation, which includes substitutions, insertions and deletions. Mutations are caused both by the high error rate, and limited proof reading capability, of the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, and by recombination. Recombination also generates new haplotype diversity by recombining existing variants. Rapid evolution of avian coronavirus IBV makes this virus extremely difficult to diagnose and control, but also makes it an excellent model system to study viral genetic diversity and the mechanisms behind the emergence of coronaviruses in their natural host.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.099953852,-0.013863685,0.014687104,0.04656012599999999,0.185563838,0.087946124,0.002736352,-0.021046884,0.030453581,0.300142765,0.095839782,-0.021561793,0.004212663,0.017326795,-0.063695048,0.11913988699999999,-0.038459173,0.002076918,-0.027533374,0.085219984,-0.0075465440000000005,-0.047588205999999994,-0.055502232,0.016396818,-0.089272445,-0.02612223,0.037471514,-0.025772872000000002,-0.033021616000000004,-0.07138615400000001

Several molecular clock and demographic models available in the BEAST package were compared on three avipoxvirus genes (P4b, cnpv186 and DNA polymerase genes), which enabled to determine that avipoxviruses evolved at a rate of 2–8×10−5 substitution/site/year, in the range of poxviruses previously reported evolution rates. In addition, the date of mean time of divergence of avipoxviruses from a common ancestor was extrapolated to be about 10,000–30,000years ago, at the same period as modern poxvirus species.

581,Detection and molecular characterization of sapoviruses in dogs,"Abstract Caliciviruses are important human and animal pathogens. Novel caliciviruses have been identified recently in dogs, raising questions about their pathogenic role and concerns regarding their zoonotic potential. By screening stool samples of young or juvenile dogs using RT-PCR assays, sapoviruses (SaVs) were found in 7/320 (2.2%) samples of animals with acute gastroenteritis while they were not detected in healthy animals (0/119). The sequence of a nearly 3kb portion at the 3′ end of the genome, encompassing the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the capsid region (ORF1) and the ORF2 were determined for three strains. A distinctive genetic feature in canine SaVs was a 4-nucleotide (nt) interval between the ORF1 and ORF2. Two strains (Bari/4076/07/ITA and Bari/253/07/ITA) were very closely related in the RdRp and capsid regions to the strain AN210D/09/USA (90.4–93.9% nt), while strain Bari/5020/07/ITA displayed only 71.0–72.0% nt identity to this group of canine SaVs and 76.0% to strain AN196/09/USA. Overall, these findings indicate that the canine SaVs detected in Italy may represent distinct capsid types, although all currently known SaVs segregate into the novel proposed genogroup, tentatively named as GXIII.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.08614998800000001,-0.004827555999999999,0.05004349599999999,-0.034969899,0.136334592,-0.007981526999999999,0.00657057,0.0036196809999999996,-0.05411819,-0.0040794740000000005,0.062235056,0.09440870800000001,-0.050243580999999995,-0.07477012799999999,0.027456525,-0.085249194,-0.016642799,-0.007714633,0.057704465999999996,-0.043810932999999996,0.175165961,0.087048395,-0.086127571,0.035802093,0.105529093,-0.10775615699999999,-0.024802294,-0.026596243,0.001062333,0.07289427400000001
582,A novel feline norovirus in diarrheic cats,"Abstract By screening a collection of fecal samples from young cats housed in three different shelters in South Italy, noroviruses (NoVs) were found in 3/48 (6.2%) specimens of animals with enteritis signs while they were not detected in samples collected from healthy cats (0/57). Upon sequence analysis of the short RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region, the three strains displayed the highest nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) identities to the prototype GIV.2 strain lion/Pistoia/387/06/ITA (91.0–93.0% nt and 97.0–98.0% aa). The sequence of ~3.4-kb portion at the 3′ end of the genome of a NoV strain, TE/77-13/ITA, was determined. In the full-length ORF2, encoding the VP1 capsid protein, the virus was genetically closest to the canine GVI.2 NoV strains C33/Viseu/2007/PRT and FD53/2007/ITA (81.0–84.0% nt and 93.0–94.0% aa identities), suggesting a recombination nature, with the cross-over site being mapped to the ORF1-ORF2 junction. Based on the full-length VP1 amino acid sequence, we classified the novel feline NoV, together with the canine strains Viseu and FD53, as a genotype 2, within the genogroup GVI. These findings indicate that, as observed for GIV NoV, GVI strains may infect both the canine and feline host. Unrestricted circulation of NoV strains in small carnivores may provide the basis for quick genetic diversification of these viruses by recombination. Interspecies circulation of NoVs in pets must also be considered when facing outbreaks of enteric diseases in these animals.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.111162808,-0.033113314,0.051233544000000006,-0.09434369699999999,0.162650439,0.014769181000000001,-0.032639108,-0.002750018,-0.048144677999999996,-0.049836542000000005,0.152409717,0.070025826,0.03327575,-0.13004458300000002,0.002455058,-0.09736173599999999,-0.031541846,0.003747102,0.034421311,0.026808934,0.137372164,0.038108692,-0.055873701,0.071262691,0.073630723,-0.07125271700000001,0.006837585,-0.005782661999999999,-0.04629083,0.081247026

In this study, three bovine norovirus genogroup III sequences were determined by conventional RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing in feces from diarrheic dairy calves from Argentina (B4836, B4848, and B4881, all collected in 2012). Phylogenetic studies based on a partial coding region for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, 503 nucleotides) of these three samples suggested that two of them (B4836 and B4881) belong to genotype 2 (GIII.2) while the third one (B4848) was more closely related to genotype 1 (GIII.1) strains. By deep sequencing, the capsid region from two of these strains could be determined. This confirmed the circulation of genotype 1 (B4848) together with the presence of another sequence (B4881) sharing its highest genetic relatedness with genotype 1, but sufficiently distant to constitute a new genotype. This latter strain was shown in silico to be a recombinant: phylogenetic divergence was detected between its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase coding sequence (genotype GIII.2) and its capsid protein coding sequence (genotype GIII.1 or a potential norovirus genotype). According to this data, this strain could be the second genotype GIII.2_GIII.1 bovine norovirus recombinant described in literature worldwide. Further analysis suggested that this strain could even be a potential norovirus GIII genotype, tentatively named GIII.4. The data provides important epidemiological and evolutionary information on bovine noroviruses circulating in South America.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.090347539,-0.014824068000000001,0.043811484000000005,-0.057185252,0.11717241800000001,-5.42e-05,0.002721822,-0.004830147,-0.018750769,-0.011302406000000001,0.02146516,0.130966721,-0.018536906000000002,-0.043925560999999995,0.033301257,-0.053821302,-0.02625583,0.022346172999999997,0.027734811,-0.046855345,0.069603043,0.043724793,-0.041603537999999995,0.058509846,0.020384733000000002,-0.05084538,0.043030292000000005,-0.063149809,0.043578992000000004,0.032118132
586,Astrovirus evolution and emergence,"Abstract Astroviruses are small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the Astroviridae family. Astroviruses infect diverse hosts and are typically associated with gastrointestinal illness; although disease can range from asymptomatic to encephalitis depending on the host and viral genotype. Astroviruses have high genetic variability due to an error prone polymerase and frequent recombination events between strains. Once thought to be species specific, recent evidence suggests astroviruses can spread between different host species, although the frequency with which this occurs and the restrictions that regulate the process are unknown. Recombination events can lead to drastic evolutionary changes and contribute to cross-species transmission events. This work reviews the current state of research on astrovirus evolution and emergence, especially as it relates to cross-species transmission and recombination of astroviruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.078014275,-0.019059739,-0.011361022,-0.020849119,0.105540047,0.053510174,0.126790812,0.042007471,-0.04871902400000001,0.027438023,0.013895962,-0.000559826,-0.0026547579999999997,-0.030430383999999998,0.037626696,0.04876466,-0.060268144,0.001665262,-0.053197061,0.010327436,0.044148321,-0.008472097,-0.081007266,0.06061207,-0.05805308,-0.042079307,0.051531235999999994,-0.020152792,-0.036719402000000005,-0.0028082429999999998
587,Virome diversity analysis reveals novel enteroviruses and a human picobirnavirus in stool samples from African green monkeys with diarrhea,"Abstract It is important to identify viruses in animals because most infectious diseases in humans are caused by viruses of zoonotic origin. African green monkey is a widely used non-human primate model in biomedical investigations. In this study, total RNAs were extracted from stool samples of 10 African green monkeys with diarrhea. High-throughput sequencing was used to characterize viromes. PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to determine the full genome sequences. Great viral diversity was observed. The dominant viruses were enteroviruses and picobirnaviruses. Six enterovirus genomes and a picobirnavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence were characterized. Five enteroviruses belonged to two putative new genotypes of species Enterovirus J. One enterovirus belonged to EV-A92. The picobirnavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence had the highest nucleotide similarity (93.48%) with human picobirnavirus isolate GPBV6C2. The present study helped to identify the potential zoonotic viruses in African green monkeys.

594,Ribovirus emergentes implicados en las gastroenteritis,"Los virus se sitúan en un lugar preferente entre los agentes causales de diarrea aguda, en particular en la infancia. En este contexto el papel de los astrovirus, coronavirus, torovirus y picobirnavirus es emergente. Los astrovirus se han detectado en las heces entre el 1,2 y el 20 % de niños con diarrea que requieren atención médica en una gran variedad de localizaciones geográficas. Se han descrito brotes epidémicos en escuelas, guarderías y salas pediátricas, y son más frecuentes entre niños de menos de 3 años. En climas templados se ha demostrado una mayor incidencia invernal, y en climas tropicales ésta es similar en todo el año, siendo su transmisión preferente por vía orofecal. Se han reconocido siete serotipos de astrovirus humanos, de los cuales el más común es el uno. Los viriones pueden eliminarse durante amplios períodos y detectarse mediante microscopia electrónica. En estudios epidemiológicos se emplean técnicas de enzimoinmunoanálisis para detectar el antígeno común de grupo y se han desarrollado también técnicas basadas en la detección de ácidos nucleicos mediante hibridación y amplificación (reacción en cadena de la polimerasa). Los coronavirus entéricos se han asociado con frecuencia con enfermedad gastrointestinal en recién nacidos y niños menores de 12 años. El papel de los torovirus y picobirnavirus como causa de gastroenteritis es también emergente. Se necesitan estudios epidemiológicos para determinar su verdadera frecuencia en la comunidad, identificar sus mecanismos de transmisión y explicar la fisiopatología de los cuadros provocados por estos agentes. Viral agents are one of the main causes of acute diarrhea, particularly in infants and young children. Astrovirus, coronavirus, torovirus, and picobirnavirus are increasingly being identified as causative agents of gastroenteritis. Astroviruses have been detected in the stools of between 1.2 % and 20 % of children with diarrhea requiring medical care in a variety of geographical areas. Outbreaks have been described in schools, day care settings and pediatric wards. Children younger than 3 years old are the most frequently affected. In temperate climates incidence is greater in winter whereas in tropical areas infection occurs throughout the year. Transmission is mainly through the fecal-oral route. At least seven serotypes of human astroviruses have been recognized and serotype 1 is more common than the other serotypes. Astroviruses are often shed in stools during long periods and can be detected by electron microscopy. An enzyme-immunoassay technique that detects the astrovirus group antigen has been widely used in epidemiological studies. Nucleic acid hybridization and polymerase chain reaction-based techniques have also been used. Enteric coronaviruses have most frequently been associated with gastrointestinal disease in neonates and children younger than 12 years old. The role of toroviruses and picobirnaviruses as causative agents of gastroenteritis is still emerging. Further epidemiological studies to determine the frequency of these viruses in the community and to identify their mechanisms of transmission are needed, as are further studies to elucidate the pathophysiology of diseases due to these agents.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.026339552000000002,-0.055561427999999996,-0.009648459,-0.09556582699999999,0.005159322,0.009673936,0.06300797,-0.021578591,0.040299951,-0.03659222,-0.0076237959999999995,0.034517034,-0.018481291,-0.183131442,0.264738103,0.323770034,0.453354779,0.09900428800000001,-0.04941973400000001,0.08978328199999999,0.049501187,0.104062065,0.040355385,0.048185187000000004,-0.10539792,-0.11772850300000001,0.058900926,-0.002709208,-0.018731046,0.029653312999999997
601,Epidemiology of community acquired pneumonia,"Abstract Despite efforts in prevention worldwide including recent advances in vaccine therapy, childhood community acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality both in the developed and the developing world. Traditionally, qualifying the aetiology of CAP proved to be fraught with challenges particularly due to low yields from blood and sputum specimens. In recent years however, new advances in techniques such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction have dramatically improved detection rates of both bacteria and viruses. In addition to qualifying the true burden of disease by known organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae it has led to the identification of organisms such as human bocavirus which have not previously been associated with CAP. This article aims to provide a brief update to the clinician on the current epidemiology of CAP in this post-vaccination era.

602,Postmortem diagnosis of cytomegalovirus and accompanying other infection agents by real-time PCR in cases of sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI),"Abstract As an opportunistic pathogen with high mortality rates, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) may lead to fatal disseminated CMV infection of the premature and newborn; thus necessitating the demonstration of CMV-DNA with clinical history and/or histopathological findings of CMV infection and defining other bacterial and viral infection agents with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in udden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) cases as we aimed in this study. 314 (144 female, 170 male) SUDI cases were prospectively investigated from January 2013 to January 2015 in Istanbul Forensic Medicine Institution. The study includes 87 tissue samples of 39 cases for post-mortem histopathological examination of interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, meningitis, encephalitis, hepatitis, colitis or tubulointerstitial nephritis and/or accompanying chronic sialadenitis. CMV-DNA was found positive in 35 (40.2%) salivary gland, 19 (21.8%) lung, 1 (1.1%) tonsil, and 1 (1.1%) brain tissues. CMV sialadenitis and/or CMV pneumonia associated with other viral and/or bacterial agents were detected in 23 (60%) of 39 infant cases. The demonstration of CMV-DNA would significantly clarify the cause of death and collection of epidemiological data in SUDI cases with clinical history and histopathological findings of CMV infection accompanying chronic CMV sialadenitis. Furthermore, CMV suppresses the immune system, and may predispose to other bacterial and/or viral infections in these cases.

604,Bartonella-associated inflammatory cardiomyopathy in a dog,"Abstract A 6-year-old, male, mongrel dog was presented for acute onset of dyspnea and cough. At admission, the dog was cachectic and severely depressed. The electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm conducted with left bundle truncular branch block and interrupted by frequent multiform ventricular ectopic beats organized in allorhythmias. Thoracic radiographs revealed a marked cardiomegaly with perihilar edema, whereas transthoracic echocardiography revealed a dilated cardiomyopathy with segmental dyskinesis. Furosemide, enalapril, pimobendan, and mexiletine were prescribed, and a Holter was scheduled after resolution of congestive heart failure. Three days later, the dog died suddenly during sleep. Histopathology revealed diffuse myocyte hypertrophy with multifocal hemorrhages, alternating to areas of severe replacement fibrosis and lymphoplasmocytic infiltrates. Immunohystochemistry stains were strongly positive for T-lymphocyte infiltration (CD3) and weakly positive for B-lymphocytes (CD79). Polymerase chain reaction was positive for Bartonella spp. Based on these results, a post-mortem diagnosis of bacterial inflammatory cardiomyopathy was made.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.016057946,0.000176415,-0.003091199,-0.12185871,-0.016364447,0.023489082,-0.0029101870000000003,0.02700523,-0.028007977000000003,-0.022920237000000003,0.034094335,0.02102197,-0.024350383,-0.015053118999999998,0.018866497,0.015128968999999999,-0.000855828,0.003804398,-0.016697166,-0.023200356000000002,0.009967227,-0.002171073,-0.051454836,-0.052615197,0.030417338999999998,-0.003511414,-0.052270935,0.009738565,0.0057127459999999994,-0.014140603
608,Influenza,"Zusammenfassung Virus Influenzavirus ist ein Mitglied der Orthomyxoviren, welche in der Evolution die Fähigkeit erworben haben, schnelle Wirtswechsel vorzunehmen. Typische Wirte sind Mensch, Haustiere wie Pferd, Schwein, Katze und Geflügel, unter den Vögeln besonders Gans und Ente, und Säugetiere des Wassers. Das Genom von Influenzavirus A und B ist segmentiert und wenn zwei Viren eine Zelle infizieren können ganze Genomsegmente ausgetauscht werden (reassortment), was zu einer hohen Variabilität führt. Diese betrifft sowohl die Oberflächenproteine der Hülle des Influenzavirus wie H (Hämagglutinin) und N (Neuraminidase) als auch die im Partikel liegende Polymerase. Ein Influenzavirus, welches auf der Oberfläche Epitope trägt, die dem tierischen oder menschlichen Immunsystem nicht bekannt sind, hat das Potential eine neue Epidemie auszulösen. Übertragung typisch für Influenzavirus ist die aerogene Übertragung, besonders über Tröpfchen beim Husten und Niesen und Schmierinfektion, meist durch direkten Kontakt. Die Inkubationszeit beträgt normalerweise 24 bis 48 Stunden. Frühe klinische Symptome sind Fieber, Infektionszeichen (Halsschmerzen, Nasensekretion, Niesen) im oberen Respirationstrakt, Augenrötung gepaart mit Myalgie, Schüttelfrost und schwerem Krankheitsgefühl. Prävention wesentlich sind Abstand vom Infizierten, Vermeiden von Aerosolen und - innerhalb der Behandlungseinheiten - Händedesinfektion und Desinfektion von Gebrauchsgegenständen vom Stethoskop bis zur Türklinke. Ein wesentlicher Beitrag zur Prävention wird durch die jährliche Impfung gegen saisonale Stämme Influenzavirus A-H1N1 und A-H3N2 und Influenzavirus B geleistet. Therapie unspezifisch entzündungshemmende Substanzen und Vermeiden bzw. Behandlung der bakteriellen Superinfektion mit Antibiotika. Spezifisch mit Neuraminidase-Inhibitoren wie Oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) und Zanamivir (Relenza®) innerhalb von 48h nach Beginn der Symptomatik. Abstract Virus Influenza virus is the only human-pathogenic member of orthomyxovirus, which during evolution acquired the capability to infect the cells of various mammals and birds. Besides man common hosts are domestic animals as horse, swine, cat and poultry, among the birds especially goose and duck, and nearly all mammals living in water. The influenza virus A and B genome is segmented, when two different viruses infect one cell whole genome-segments can be exchanged (reassortment). This capability leads to a high variability of the envelope surface proteins H (haemagglutinin) and N (neuraminidase), as well as the polymerase inside the virus particle. An influenza virus equipped with epitopes on its surface that are unknown by the human and animal immune system has the potential to initiate a new epidemic. Transmission for influenza virus main route is aerogene, especially by small droplets while coughing and sneezing and by smear infection, mostly by direct contact. Incubation time is usually 24 to 48hours. Early clinical symptoms are fever, all signs of inflammation in the upper respiratory tract with sore throat, nasal secretion, conjunctivitis that are associated with myalgia, chills and malaise. Prevention important is the distance from the infected, to avoid aerosol formation, and within care units disinfection of hands and utensils as from stethoscope to door handle. Essential for prevention of disease is the annual vaccination against the seasonal strains influenza virus A-H1N1, A-H3N2 and influenza virus B. Treatment unspecific by anti-inflammatory drugs and reduction of symptoms by therapy of bacterial superinfection with antibiotics. Specific: by application of neuraminidase inhibitors as oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) and zanamavir (Relenza®) within 48hours after onset of the symptoms.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.005022370999999999,-0.050319829,-0.008919913,0.009193927,-0.020919085,0.14240772599999998,-0.01875455,0.002035295,0.005160147,-0.025895355,0.001289888,0.006863027,0.013738971,-0.01964286,0.034950943,0.023886678999999997,0.000719707,0.010899186000000002,-0.010381007,0.017215098,0.013855718000000001,-0.004710007,-0.02086814,0.005412426999999999,-0.008760941999999999,0.015564025,-0.018978383,0.000473744,0.014420531,-0.005555745999999999
610,Antiproliferative effect of Toona sinensis leaf extract on non–small-cell lung cancer,"Toona sinensis (TS), which is also known as Cedrela sinensis, belongs to Meliaceae family, the compounds identified from this TS leaves possess a wide range of biologic functions, such as hypoglycemic effects, anti–LDL glycative activity, antioxidant activities, and inhibition of sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus replication. However, their effect against cancer cells is not well explored. In this study, to understand the cytotoxic effect and molecular mechanism stimulated by TSL-1 (TS leaf extract fraction) we employed three different non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines: H441 cells (lung adenocarcinoma), H661 cells (lung large cell carcinoma) and H520 cells (lung squamous cell carcinoma). IC50 value was varied between these three cell lines, the least IC50 value was observed in TSL-1–treated H661cells. Exposure of NSCLC cells to TSL-1 caused cell-cycle arrest in subG1 phase and caused apoptosis. Moreover, TSL-1 treatment decreased the cell-cycle regulators; cyclin D1 and CDK4 proteins by up regulating p27 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, the TSL-1–induced apoptosis was further confirmed by cell morphology, subG1 peak accumulation, poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, propidium iodide (PI)-Annexin-V double staining, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay. The decreased Bcl2 protein level was concurrent with an increased Bax protein level in all 3 cell lines. Additionally, the tumoricidal effect of TSL-1 was measured using a xenograft model, after 5 weeks of TSL-1 treatment by various regimen caused regression of tumor. Taken together both these in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that TSL-1 is a potent inhibitor against NSCLC growth and our provoking result suggest that TSL-1 can be a better nutriceutical as a singlet or along with doublet agents (taxane, vinorelbine, and gemcitabine) for treating NSCLC.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.09388338,-0.004949301,-0.038160432,-0.096473128,-0.11303704699999999,0.061453887,0.034856782999999995,-0.068380132,0.056224249000000004,-0.024393777999999998,-0.051728955,-0.025018417999999997,-0.009723886,0.08514126300000001,0.008266099,0.009604551,0.004255693,-0.018450216000000002,0.03093759,-0.009552414,0.029971649,-0.0127485,0.025481777,-0.017707205,0.033809139,0.046631898,-0.032846525,0.035982337,-0.019837963,-0.071019253
611,Next-generation direct-acting influenza therapeutics,"Influenza viruses are a major threat to human health globally. In addition to further improving vaccine prophylaxis, disease management through antiviral therapeutics constitutes an important component of the current intervention strategy to prevent advance to complicated disease and reduce case-fatality rates. Standard-of-care is treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors that prevent viral dissemination. In 2018, the first mechanistically new influenza drug class for the treatment of uncomplicated seasonal influenza in 2 decades was approved for human use. Targeting the PA endonuclease subunit of the viral polymerase complex, this class suppresses viral replication. However, the genetic barrier against viral resistance to both drug classes is low, pre-existing resistance is observed in circulating strains, and resistant viruses are pathogenic and transmit efficiently. Addressing the resistance problem has emerged as an important objective for the development of next-generation influenza virus therapeutics.

616,A duplex RT-PCR assay for detection of H9 subtype avian influenza viruses and infectious bronchitis viruses,"Abstract H9 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) are major pathogens circulating in poultry and have resulted in great economic losses due to respiratory disease and reduced egg production. As similar symptoms are elicited by the two pathogens, it is difficult for their differential diagnosis. So far, no reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay has been found to differentiate between H9 AIV and IBV in one reaction. Therefore, developing a sensitive and specific method is of importance to simultaneously detect and differentiate H9 AIV and IBV. In this study, a duplex RT-PCR (dRT-PCR) was established. Two primer sets target the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of H9 AIV and the nucleocapsid (N) gene of IBV, respectively. Specific PCR products were obtained from all tested H9 AIVs and IBVs belonging to the major clades circulating in China, but not from AIVs of other subtypes or other infectious avian viruses. The sensitivity of the dRT-PCR assay corresponding to H9 AIV, IBV and mixture of H9 AIV and IBV were at a concentration of 1×101, 1.5×101 and 1.5×101 50% egg infective doses (EID50) mL−1, respectively. The concordance rates between the dRT-PCR and virus isolation were 99.1 and 98.2%, respectively, for detection of samples from H9N2 AIV or IBV infected chickens, while the concordance rate was 99.1% for detection of samples from H9N2 AIV and IBV co-infected chickens. Thus, the dRT-PCR assay reported herein is specific and sensitive, and suitable for the differential diagnosis of clinical infections and surveillance of H9 AIVs and IBVs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.01074707,0.017169515,0.170425923,-0.025684697000000003,0.105336245,0.078911362,-0.132372735,-0.08210401099999999,0.083468029,0.249951037,0.067988208,-0.0029315559999999997,-0.059852619,0.073643216,-0.099360078,0.11663842,0.038110797,0.001167806,0.029454147000000003,-0.013687393,-0.041643521,-0.003914204,0.013325544,-0.044302222999999995,0.003630785,0.025267922999999998,-0.015418626999999999,0.004659501,0.063691672,-0.025162467999999997

625,Bronchoalveolar lavage to evaluate new pulmonary infiltrates in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients: impact on antimicrobial optimization,"Summary Background Pulmonary complications cause significant morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT). Bronchoscopy with targeted bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is often used in AHSCT patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) to help guide management. Aim To evaluate how positive BAL results change antimicrobial management of AHSCT recipients with suspected LRTI. Methods We performed a retrospective review of BAL results from January 2014 to July 2016 for 54 AHSCT recipients. A positive BAL was determined by culture, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Aspergillus galactomannan antigen (AGA), and cytology. Findings BAL was positive for infectious etiologies in 63%, and antimicrobials were adjusted in 48/54 (89%) of patients. Antibacterial escalation was predicted by a positive BAL bacterial culture (OR 7.61, P=0.017). Antibiotic de-escalation was more likely with an elevated AGA (OR 3.86, P=0.035). Antiviral initiation was more likely with positive BAL multiplex PCR (OR 17.33, P=0.010). Antifungals were more likely to be escalated or changed with an elevated AGA (OR 4.33, P=0.020). The patients with a negative BAL were more likely to be started on steroids (OR 0.19, P= 0.043). Conclusions BAL was helpful to determine the etiology of pulmonary complications and optimize antimicrobials. The addition of AGA and multiplex PCR to standard BAL significantly impacted de-escalating antibiotics and adjusting antifungals to provide adequate coverage. The association with an elevated AGA with antibacterial de-escalation highlights a new role for BAL in antimicrobial optimization.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.07188615,-0.018651098,-0.007208765,-0.08698049599999999,-0.041460509,-0.019414771,-0.015408268999999999,0.058612562,-0.06345618900000001,0.030017319,-0.011997855,0.0265883,0.011533416999999999,0.030484782999999998,-0.0027219970000000003,-0.016395679,0.028576172,0.038375377999999995,-0.018148348999999998,-0.03790353,0.037231217999999996,-0.0249357,0.010388600999999999,-0.053539055999999995,0.002533409,-0.013616284,-0.006792163,-0.035929687,0.0044043070000000005,-0.012608356000000001

638,Repurposing of clinically approved drugs for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 in a 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) related coronavirus model,"BACKGROUND: Medicines for the treatment of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections are urgently needed. However, drug screening using live 2019-nCoV requires high-level biosafety facilities, which imposes an obstacle for those without such facilities or 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This study aims to repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV related coronavirus model. METHODS: A 2019-nCoV related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/ Guangxi was described. Whether GX_P2X uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor was investigated by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated silencing of ACE2. The pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were screened for their ability to inhibit cytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells by GX_P2X infection. The antiviral activities and antiviral mechanisms of potential drugs were further investigated. Viral yields of RNAs and infectious particles were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and plaque assay, respectively. RESULTS: The spike protein of coronavirus GX_P2V shares 92.2% amino acid identity with that of 2019-nCoV isolate Wuhan-hu-1, and uses ACE2 as the receptor for infection just like 2019-nCoV. Three drugs-cepharanthine (CEP), selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride exhibited complete inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell culture at 10 μmol/L. CEP demonstrated the most potent inhibition of GX_P2V infection, with a concentration for 50% of maximal effect [EC50] of 0.98 μmol/L. The viral RNA yield in cells treated with 10 μmol/L CEP was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without CEP treatment ([6.48 ± 0.02] × 10vs. 1.00 ± 0.12, t = 150.38, P < 0.001) at 72 h post-infection (p.i.). Plaque assays found no production of live viruses in media containing 10 μmol/L CEP at 48 h p.i. Furthermore, we found CEP has potent antiviral activities against both viral entry (1.00 ± 0.37 vs. 0.46 ± 0.12, t = 2.42, P < 0.05) and viral replication (1.00 ± 0.43 vs. [6.18 ± 0.95] × 10, t = 3.98, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V is a workable model for 2019-nCoV research. CEP, selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride are potential drugs for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Our results strongly suggest that CEP is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of pan-betacoronavirus, and clinical trial of CEP for treatment of 2019-nCoV infection is warranted.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.033396208,0.028080402999999997,-0.017533312,-0.073382787,-0.09089930800000001,0.047710014,0.02412715,0.023791708999999998,0.010430514,0.007625279,0.007908557,0.024375737999999997,0.009615717,0.020886356000000002,0.0167572,0.019714594,-0.055129298,0.136184916,0.012077761000000001,-0.03956022,-0.045541845,0.074910725,-0.165677519,-0.074124192,0.061726079,0.142539459,0.202088692,0.001442541,0.06773997,-0.08191606
645,Strategies for the development of drugs targeting novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; There is no specific drug that has been approved for 2019-nCoV. There are a number of factors that pose major challenges in their development. Approaches to the development of anti-2019-nCoV include screening existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, repositioning of readily available clinical compounds, and &lt;italic&gt;de novo&lt;/italic&gt; development of novel and specific agents for 2019-nCoV. Candidate compounds can be developed either to inhibit virus-based targets, such as RNA proteases, polymerase, spike glycoproteins, and viral envelop and membrane proteins, or to inhibit host-based targets, such as receptors and proteases that are utilized by virus for viral entry and endocytosis. Recently, the RNA polymerase remdesivir had demonstrated clinical efficacy in one patient with severe novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). The broad-spectrum viral protease inhibitor Kaletra&lt;sup&gt;&reg;&lt;/sup&gt; is also recommended in the current NCP clinical practice. Both drugs had lately been proceeded into multiple controlled phase III clinical trials to test their safety and efficacy in NCP. Combinational therapies consisting of multiple drugs provide other viable options against 2019-nCoV, based on scientific and clinical rationales. Using bioinformatics and database analysis, we have identified 75 clinically compounds, including 20 marketed compounds, that are efficacious in inhibiting key targets in virus- and host-based approaches, which may facilitate the development of new therapeutic options for 2019-nCoV. &lt;/p&gt;",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.048883036,0.007772317,-0.010067759,-0.021251405,-0.096618186,0.068759072,0.066853178,0.016473387,0.006731343000000001,0.045527924000000004,-0.006131480999999999,0.027597654,0.034523793,-0.047111633,0.008325354,-0.0023999810000000002,-0.042472825,0.12886035,-0.006268805,-0.00607395,-0.044359859,0.059731447,-0.130347083,-0.029141006,0.062182227,0.058625464,0.145626893,-0.030381238999999997,0.07503153900000001,-0.024295503

655,Streptococcus pneumoniae induced c-Jun-N-terminal kinase- and AP-1 -dependent IL-8 release by lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells,"BACKGROUND: Although pneumococcal pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death due to infectious diseases, little is known about pneumococci-lung cell interaction. Herein we tested the hypothesis that pneumococci activated pulmonary epithelial cell cytokine release by c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) METHODS: Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) or epithelial HEK293 cells were infected with S. pneumoniae R6x and cytokine induction was measured by RT-PCR, ELISA and Bioplex assay. JNK-phosphorylation was detected by Western blot and nuclear signaling was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). JNK was modulated by the small molecule inhibitor SP600125 and AP1 by transfection of a dominant negative mutant. RESULTS: S. pneumoniae induced the release of distinct CC and CXC, as well as Th1 and Th2 cytokines and growth factors by human lung epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. Furthermore, pneumococci infection resulted in JNK phosphorylation in BEAS-2B cells. Inhibition of JNK by small molecule inhibitor SP600125 reduced pneumococci-induced IL-8 mRNA expression and release of IL-8 and IL-6. One regulator of the il8 promoter is JNK-phosphorylated activator protein 1 (AP-1). We showed that S. pneumoniae time-dependently induced DNA binding of AP-1 and its phosphorylated subunit c-Jun with a maximum at 3 to 5 h after infection. Recruitment of Ser(63/73)-phosphorylated c-Jun and RNA polymerase II to the endogenous il8 promoter was found 2 h after S. pneumoniae infection by chromatin immunoprecipitation. AP-1 repressor A-Fos reduced IL-8 release by TLR2-overexpressing HEK293 cells induced by pneumococci but not by TNFα. Antisense-constructs targeting the AP-1 subunits Fra1 and Fra2 had no inhibitory effect on pneumococci-induced IL-8 release. CONCLUSION: S. pneumoniae-induced IL-8 expression by human epithelial BEAS-2B cells depended on activation of JNK and recruitment of phosphorylated c-Jun to the il8 promoter.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.055674308,-0.039129969,0.005298719,-0.122024471,-0.103060902,0.024417364,0.028662549,-0.037445093,0.043770043,-0.05101355,-0.058973410999999996,-0.050620403,-0.027319944,0.11108398400000001,-0.02496802,0.03328130000000001,-0.00122407,-0.058069710999999996,-0.012749518,-0.045121163,0.038528609,0.010586706000000001,0.100352629,-0.00854084,0.018900921,-0.00417577,0.02097681,0.082935196,0.053988756,-0.052684842
658,Different rates of (non-)synonymous mutations in astrovirus genes; correlation with gene function,"BACKGROUND: Complete genome sequences of the Astroviridae include human, non-human mammalian and avian species. A consensus topology of astroviruses has been derived from nucleotide substitutions in the full-length genomes and from non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions in each of the three ORFs. Analyses of synonymous substitutions displayed a loss of tree structure, suggesting either saturation of the substitution model or a deviant pattern of synonymous substitutions in certain virus species. RESULTS: We analyzed the complete Astroviridae family for the inference of adaptive molecular evolution at sites and in branches. High rates of synonymous mutations are observed among the non-human virus species. Deviant patterns of synonymous substitutions are found in the capsid structural genes. Purifying selection is a dominant force among all astrovirus genes and only few codon sites showed values for the dN/dS ratio that may indicate site-specific molecular adaptation during virus evolution. One of these sites is the glycine residue of a RGD motif in ORF2 of human astrovirus serotype 1. RGD or similar integrin recognition motifs are present in nearly all astrovirus species. CONCLUSION: Phylogenetic analysis directed by maximum likelihood approximation allows the inclusion of significantly more evolutionary history and thereby, improves the estimation of dN and dS. Sites with enhanced values for dN/dS are prominent at domains in charge of environmental communication (f.i.

661,Identification of new reference genes for the normalisation of canine osteoarthritic joint tissue transcripts from microarray data,"BACKGROUND: Real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-qPCR) is the most accurate measure of gene expression in biological systems. The comparison of different samples requires the transformation of data through a process called normalisation. Reference or housekeeping genes are candidate genes which are selected on the basis of constitutive expression across samples, and allow the quantification of changes in gene expression. At present, no reference gene has been identified for any organism which is universally optimal for use across different tissue types or disease situations. We used microarray data to identify new reference genes generated from total RNA isolated from normal and osteoarthritic canine articular tissues (bone, ligament, cartilage, synovium and fat). RT-qPCR assays were designed and applied to each different articular tissue. Reference gene expression stability and ranking was compared using three different mathematical algorithms. RESULTS: Twelve new potential reference genes were identified from microarray data. One gene (mitochondrial ribosomal protein S7 [MRPS7]) was stably expressed in all five of the articular tissues evaluated. One gene HIRA interacting protein 5 isoform 2 [HIRP5]) was stably expressed in four of the tissues evaluated. A commonly used reference gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was not stably expressed in any of the tissues evaluated. Most consistent agreement between rank ordering of reference genes was observed between Bestkeeper© and geNorm, although each method tended to agree on the identity of the most stably expressed genes and the least stably expressed genes for each tissue. New reference genes identified using microarray data normalised in a conventional manner were more stable than those identified by microarray data normalised by using a real-time RT-qPCR methodology. CONCLUSION: Microarray data normalised by a conventional manner can be filtered using a simple stepwise procedure to identify new reference genes, some of which will demonstrate good measures of stability. Mitochondrial ribosomal protein S7 is a new reference gene worthy of investigation in other canine tissues and diseases. Different methods of reference gene stability assessment will generally agree on the most and least stably expressed genes, when co-regulation is not present.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.069488454,0.01816525,0.11638168,-0.08565851699999999,0.018732581,0.025419395,-0.030759567999999998,-0.052094947999999995,0.04908516,-0.034556375,-0.121935615,-0.045198768,0.000990363,0.053585277,-0.02299138,-0.07444530099999999,0.010899879,-0.075773265,-0.028462414,-0.100177085,0.069452476,0.015704808,0.012224047,0.05169059,-0.09787084800000001,-0.059553599000000006,0.056435762,0.025293097999999997,0.060604226,-0.017562356
663,Deletion of human metapneumovirus M2-2 increases mutation frequency and attenuates growth in hamsters,"BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection can cause acute lower respiratory tract illness in infants, the immunocompromised, and the elderly. Currently there are no licensed preventative measures for hMPV infections. Using a variant of hMPV/NL/1/00 that does not require trypsin supplementation for growth in tissue culture, we deleted the M2-2 gene and evaluated the replication of rhMPV/ΔM2-2 virus in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: In vitro studies showed that the ablation of M2-2 increased the propensity for insertion of U nucleotides in poly-U tracts of the genomic RNA. In addition, viral transcription was up-regulated although the level of genomic RNA remained comparable to rhMPV. Thus, deletion of M2-2 alters the ratio between hMPV genome copies and transcripts. In vivo, rhMPV/ΔM2-2 was attenuated compared to rhMPV in the lungs and nasal turbinates of hamsters. Hamsters immunized with one dose of rhMPV/ΔM2-2 were protected from challenge with 10(6 )PFU of wild type (wt) hMPV/NL/1/00. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that hMPV M2-2 alters regulation of transcription and influences the fidelity of the polymerase complex during viral genome replication. In the hamster model, rhMPVΔM2-2 is attenuated and protective suggesting that deletion of M2-2 may result in a potential live vaccine candidate. A more thorough knowledge of the hMPV polymerase complex and the role of M2-2 during hMPV replication are being studied as we develop a potential live hMPV vaccine candidate that lacks M2-2 expression.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.016299591999999998,-0.079973086,-0.04499735,0.041121001000000004,-0.018399615,-0.059750597,0.038691348,-0.101926611,0.154101078,-0.056212947,0.026191941,-0.040411958,-0.11838864,0.036503242000000005,-0.098781576,-0.032281604,-0.050904839,0.217241115,-0.173227238,0.07771204,0.19583657,0.021898656000000002,0.013424733000000001,-0.083322007,-0.07514900099999999,0.007610846,-0.201051333,-0.17179403,0.016261988999999998,-0.080567542
665,Oct-4 Expression Maintained Cancer Stem-Like Properties in Lung Cancer-Derived CD133-Positive Cells,"CD133 (prominin-1), a 5-transmembrane glycoprotein, has recently been considered to be an important marker that represents the subset population of cancer stem-like cells. Herein we report the isolation of CD133-positive cells (LC-CD133(+)) and CD133-negative cells (LC-CD133(−)) from tissue samples of ten patients with non-small cell lung cancer (LC) and five LC cell lines. LC-CD133(+) displayed higher Oct-4 expressions with the ability to self-renew and may represent a reservoir with proliferative potential for generating lung cancer cells. Furthermore, LC-CD133(+), unlike LC-CD133(−), highly co-expressed the multiple drug-resistant marker ABCG2 and showed significant resistance to chemotherapy agents (i.e., cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel) and radiotherapy. The treatment of Oct-4 siRNA with lentiviral vector can specifically block the capability of LC-CD133(+) to form spheres and can further facilitate LC-CD133(+) to differentiate into LC-CD133(−). In addition, knock-down of Oct-4 expression in LC-CD133(+) can significantly inhibit the abilities of tumor invasion and colony formation, and increase apoptotic activities of caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Finally, in vitro and in vivo studies further confirm that the treatment effect of chemoradiotherapy for LC-CD133(+) can be improved by the treatment of Oct-4 siRNA. In conclusion, we demonstrated that Oct-4 expression plays a crucial role in maintaining the self-renewing, cancer stem-like, and chemoradioresistant properties of LC-CD133(+). Future research is warranted regarding the up-regulated expression of Oct-4 in LC-CD133(+) and malignant lung cancer.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.05185923,-0.023187448,0.00108643,-0.091744569,-0.053577755,0.041637506,0.021506885,-0.012616473999999999,0.016121531,-0.025677004,-0.02438696,0.008037063,-0.013890537,0.011736636000000002,0.007142308000000001,0.020722097,-0.002242167,-0.002674518,-0.004629174000000001,-0.029409393,0.018088748,-0.016036491,-0.004173649000000001,-0.015574621,0.008859956,0.004255341,-0.026698941,0.016045741999999998,0.022223987999999997,-0.041452789
668,Widespread distribution and a new recombinant species of Brazilian virus associated with cotton blue disease,"BACKGROUND: Cotton blue disease (CBD), an important global cotton crop pathology responsible for major economic losses, is prevalent in the major cotton-producing states of Brazil. Typical CBD symptoms include stunting due to internodal shortening, leaf rolling, intense green foliage, and yellowing veins. Atypical CBD symptoms, including reddish and withered leaves, were also observed in Brazilian cotton fields in 2007. Recently, a Polerovirus named Cotton leafroll dwarf virus (CLRDV) was shown to be associated with CBD. RESULTS: To understand the distribution and genetic diversity of CLRDV in Brazil, we analyzed 23 CBD-symptomatic plants from susceptible cotton varieties originating from five of the six most important cotton-growing states, from 2004–2007. Here, we report on CLRDV diversity in plants with typical or atypical CBD symptoms by comparing viral coat protein, RNA polymerase (RdRp), and intergenic region genomic sequences. CONCLUSION: The virus had a widespread distribution with a low genetic diversity; however, three divergent isolates were associated with atypical CBD symptoms. These divergent isolates had a CLRDV-related coat protein but a distinct RdRp sequence, and probably arose from recombination events. Based on the taxonomic rules for the family Luteoviridae, we propose that these three isolates represent isolates of a new species in the genus Polerovirus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.078234157,-0.032668037000000004,-0.020477157,-0.034278582,0.075333702,0.018979158,0.040275889,0.002550215,-0.030001964,0.054372475999999996,0.021749288999999998,0.051847009000000006,-0.036427467000000005,-0.062271087999999995,-0.006801977,-0.014510523999999999,-0.017622814,-0.0005902619999999999,-0.047668762,-0.001048684,0.044841645,-0.010919298000000001,-0.022601793,0.00999944,-0.028292185,0.031893956,0.043929645999999996,0.015225546000000001,0.022959155,0.023453598
669,The role of interleukin-12 in the heavy metal-elicited immunomodulation: relevance of various evaluation methods,"BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence exists that heavy metals modulate T helper cell (Th) responses and thereby elicit various pathological manifestation. Interleukin (IL)-12, a crucial innate cytokine, was found to be regulated by such xenobiotic agents. This study aimed at testing whether IL-12 profiles may be indicative of heavy metals-induced immunomodulation. METHODS: Human immunocompetent cells, activated either by monoclonal antibodies or heat-killed Salmonella enterica, were cultured in the absence or presence of cadmium (Cd) acetate or mercuric (Hg) chloride. In vivo experiments were set up where BALB/c mice were exposed to sub-lethal doses of Cd or Hg salts for 3 or 5 weeks. Cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT-reduction assay. Modulation of cytokine profiles was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), cytometric bead-based array (CBA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); the relevance of these methods of cytokine quantification was explored. RESULTS: Modulation of IL-12 profiles in Cd- or Hg-exposed human PBMC was dose-dependent and significantly related to IFN-γ levels as well as to the Th1- or Th2-polarized responses. Similarly, skewing the Th1/Th2 ratios in vivo correlated significantly with up- or down-regulation of IL-12 levels in both cases of investigated metals. CONCLUSION: It can be inferred that: (i) IL-12 profiles alone may represent a relevant indicator of heavy metal-induced immune modulation; (ii) evaluating cytokine profiles by CBA is relevant and can adequately replace other methods such as ELISA and RT-PCR in basic research as well as in immune diagnostics; and (iii) targeting IL-12 in therapeutic approaches may be promising to modify Th1/Th2-associated immune disorders.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.010076822,0.001977709,0.06156235400000001,-0.112631526,-0.09261910000000001,0.025890822999999997,0.047275026,-0.038538704,0.053110682,-0.06742741599999999,-0.029233422999999998,-0.03516982,-0.028354419,0.096063339,-0.042107307999999996,0.025400002999999997,-0.00032444799999999997,-0.05464585,-0.025681658,-0.095851936,0.041870936,-0.056700792,0.055411645999999995,0.005012569000000001,-0.055797225,-0.031230697,0.075982202,0.025157482000000002,0.078467725,-0.045432525999999994
670,Complete genomic sequence analysis of infectious bronchitis virus Ark DPI strain and its evolution by recombination,"An infectious bronchitis virus Arkansas DPI (Ark DPI) virulent strain was sequenced, analyzed and compared with many different IBV strains and coronaviruses. The genome of Ark DPI consists of 27,620 nucleotides, excluding poly (A) tail, and comprises ten open reading frames. Comparative sequence analysis of Ark DPI with other IBV strains shows striking similarity to the Conn, Gray, JMK, and Ark 99, which were circulating during that time period. Furthermore, comparison of the Ark genome with other coronaviruses demonstrates a close relationship to turkey coronavirus. Among non-structural genes, the 5'untranslated region (UTR), 3C-like proteinase (3CL(pro)) and the polymerase (RdRp) sequences are 100% identical to the Gray strain. Among structural genes, S1 has 97% identity with Ark 99; S2 has 100% identity with JMK and 96% to Conn; 3b 99%, and 3C to N is 100% identical to Conn strain. Possible recombination sites were found at the intergenic region of spike gene, 3'end of S1 and 3a gene. Independent recombination events may have occurred in the entire genome of Ark DPI, involving four different IBV strains, suggesting that genomic RNA recombination may occur in any part of the genome at number of sites. Hence, we speculate that the Ark DPI strain originated from the Conn strain, but diverged and evolved independently by point mutations and recombination between field strains.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.119547674,-0.019792463,0.035772677999999995,-0.080980177,0.17365940300000002,0.026322737000000002,-0.11666045800000001,-0.031386919,0.040070229,0.10600921099999999,0.019380783999999998,0.055473232000000004,-0.030917047000000003,-0.06386660799999999,-0.053263978,0.029295647999999997,-0.017829766,0.014528433,0.003977349,0.012340394,0.03721074,-0.031976465,0.0037714890000000003,0.03532269,-0.004688034000000001,-0.013986107,0.026385686000000002,0.011904000000000001,-0.009895352,0.021475206
673,Avian Influenza Virus Glycoproteins Restrict Virus Replication and Spread through Human Airway Epithelium at Temperatures of the Proximal Airways,"Transmission of avian influenza viruses from bird to human is a rare event even though avian influenza viruses infect the ciliated epithelium of human airways in vitro and ex vivo. Using an in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium (HAE), we demonstrate that while human and avian influenza viruses efficiently infect at temperatures of the human distal airways (37°C), avian, but not human, influenza viruses are restricted for infection at the cooler temperatures of the human proximal airways (32°C). These data support the hypothesis that avian influenza viruses, ordinarily adapted to the temperature of the avian enteric tract (40°C), rarely infect humans, in part due to differences in host airway regional temperatures. Previously, a critical residue at position 627 in the avian influenza virus polymerase subunit, PB2, was identified as conferring temperature-dependency in mammalian cells. Here, we use reverse genetics to show that avianization of residue 627 attenuates a human virus, but does not account for the different infection between 32°C and 37°C. To determine the mechanism of temperature restriction of avian influenza viruses in HAE at 32°C, we generated recombinant human influenza viruses in either the A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) or A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) genetic background that contained avian or avian-like glycoproteins. Two of these viruses, A/Victoria/3/75 with L226Q and S228G mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) from A/Chick/Italy/1347/99 and A/PR/8/34 containing the H7 and N1 from A/Chick/Italy/1347/99, exhibited temperature restriction approaching that of wholly avian influenza viruses. These data suggest that influenza viruses bearing avian or avian-like surface glycoproteins have a reduced capacity to establish productive infection at the temperature of the human proximal airways. This temperature restriction may limit zoonotic transmission of avian influenza viruses and suggests that adaptation of avian influenza viruses to efficient infection at 32°C may represent a critical evolutionary step enabling human-to-human transmission.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.039701415,-0.103755319,-0.026198691,0.176164753,0.055162076,0.309761555,-0.064208485,-0.010072525,-0.007307276999999999,-0.018829814,-0.00730967,-0.0054135,0.037987428999999996,0.029654608,0.008359445,0.021155342,-0.013235725,-0.043032739,-0.020413001,0.036585495,0.053750437000000005,0.00014981,-0.024995751,0.088959821,-0.088659982,5.8299999999999994e-05,-0.066036774,0.016648644,-0.010382056,-0.07178025099999999
677,Increased ATP generation in the host cell is required for efficient vaccinia virus production,"To search for cellular genes up-regulated by vaccinia virus (VV) infection, differential display-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (ddRT-PCR) assays were used to examine the expression of mRNAs from mock-infected and VV-infected HeLa cells. Two mitochondrial genes for proteins that are part of the electron transport chain that generates ATP, ND4 and CO II, were up-regulated after VV infection. Up-regulation of ND4 level by VV infection was confirmed by Western blotting analysis. Up-regulation of ND4 was reduced by the MAPK inhibitor, apigenin, which has been demonstrated elsewhere to inhibit VV replication. The induction of ND4 expression occurred after viral DNA replication since ara C, an inhibitor of poxviral DNA replication, could block this induction. ATP production was increased in the host cells after VV infection. Moreover, 4.5 μM oligomycin, an inhibitor of ATP production, reduced the ATP level 13 hr after virus infection to that of mock-infected cells and inhibited viral protein expression and virus production, suggesting that increased ATP production is required for efficient VV production. Our results further suggest that induction of ND4 expression is through a Bcl-2 independent pathway.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.112870141,-0.05012067,-0.015410584,-0.076352434,-0.122679869,0.047546829000000006,0.020676467,-0.053716667,0.088336565,-0.019207413,-0.04285756,-0.081841377,-0.004428144,0.164105933,0.001638897,0.022429524,-0.00178133,-0.05932673,-0.00583652,0.00641907,0.010971078,0.032741492999999997,0.016185788,-0.012036129,-0.0057686130000000006,-0.014867713999999999,0.0038853309999999997,0.028881813,-0.033644812999999996,0.0058623619999999994
680,"Single Assay for Simultaneous Detection and Differential Identification of Human and Avian Influenza Virus Types, Subtypes, and Emergent Variants","For more than four decades the cause of most type A influenza virus infections of humans has been attributed to only two viral subtypes, A/H1N1 or A/H3N2. In contrast, avian and other vertebrate species are a reservoir of type A influenza virus genome diversity, hosting strains representing at least 120 of 144 combinations of 16 viral hemagglutinin and 9 viral neuraminidase subtypes. Viral genome segment reassortments and mutations emerging within this reservoir may spawn new influenza virus strains as imminent epidemic or pandemic threats to human health and poultry production. Traditional methods to detect and differentiate influenza virus subtypes are either time-consuming and labor-intensive (culture-based) or remarkably insensitive (antibody-based). Molecular diagnostic assays based upon reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have short assay cycle time, and high analytical sensitivity and specificity. However, none of these diagnostic tests determine viral gene nucleotide sequences to distinguish strains and variants of a detected pathogen from one specimen to the next. Decision-quality, strain- and variant-specific pathogen gene sequence information may be critical for public health, infection control, surveillance, epidemiology, or medical/veterinary treatment planning. The Resequencing Pathogen Microarray (RPM-Flu) is a robust, highly multiplexed and target gene sequencing-based alternative to both traditional culture- or biomarker-based diagnostic tests. RPM-Flu is a single, simultaneous differential diagnostic assay for all subtype combinations of type A influenza viruses and for 30 other viral and bacterial pathogens that may cause influenza-like illness.

681,Descriptive distribution and phylogenetic analysis of feline infectious peritonitis virus isolates of Malaysia,"The descriptive distribution and phylogeny of feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) were studied in cats suspected of having feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in Malaysia. Ascitic fluids and/or biopsy samples were subjected to a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeted for a conserved region of 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of the FCoV genome. Eighty nine percent of the sampled animals were positive for the presence of FCoV. Among the FCoV positive cats, 80% of cats were males and 64% were below 2 years of age. The FCoV positive cases included 56% domestic short hair (DSH), 40% Persian, and 4% Siamese cats. The nucleotide sequences of 10 selected amplified products from FIP cases were determined. The sequence comparison revealed that the field isolates had 96% homology with a few point mutations. The extent of homology decreased to 93% when compared with reference strains. The overall branching pattern of phylogenetic tree showed two distinct clusters, where all Malaysian isolates fall into one main genetic cluster. These findings provided the first genetic information of FCoV in Malaysia.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.027582462000000002,0.005591397,0.08990673800000001,-0.176275569,0.12097722400000001,0.024210955,-0.019715437,0.00660196,-0.061078720999999996,-0.153156228,0.4245505,-0.09718280300000001,0.196050678,-0.070261326,-0.133800154,-0.065683119,0.045915650999999995,0.027369315,-0.011984736999999999,0.071662029,-0.020856253999999998,-0.000515155,0.018166202,0.059383222,-0.058484715,0.037331693,0.022111127999999997,0.072968461,0.021855415,0.003890621
682,High-level expression and purification of soluble recombinant FGF21 protein by SUMO fusion in Escherichia coli,"BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a promising drug candidate to combat metabolic diseases. However, high-level expression and purification of recombinant FGF21 (rFGF21) in Escherichia coli (E. coli) is difficult because rFGF21 forms inclusion bodies in the bacteria making it difficult to purify and obtain high concentrations of bioactive rFGF21. To overcome this problem, we fused the FGF21 with SUMO (Small ubiquitin-related modifier) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and expressed the fused gene in E. coli BL21(DE3). RESULTS: By inducing with IPTG, SUMO-FGF21 was expressed at a high level. Its concentration reached 30% of total protein, and exceeded 95% of all soluble proteins. The fused protein was purified by DEAE sepharose FF and Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Once cleaved by the SUMO protease, the purity of rFGF21 by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was shown to be higher than 96% with low endotoxin level (<1.0 EU/ml). The results of in vivo animal experiments showed that rFGF21 produced by using this method, could decrease the concentration of plasma glucose in diabetic rats by streptozotocin (STZ) injection. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that SUMO, when fused with FGF21, was able to promote its soluble expression of the latter in E. coli, making it more convenient to purify rFGF21 than previously. This may be a better method to produce rFGF21 for pharmaceutical research and development.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.065673564,-0.019349586000000002,0.037449425,-0.082796085,-0.062829207,0.025804271,0.015785389,-0.036209094,0.032323891,-0.025674624,-0.060408475999999996,-0.001198504,-0.012634278999999998,-0.005192138,-0.046893131,-0.022302241,0.014703546999999999,-0.030050132,0.0054924119999999995,-0.049423035,-0.01618115,0.007801707,0.043434988,-0.006215473000000001,0.0034437240000000004,0.029207423,0.018892476999999998,-0.043480988,-0.00496983,0.005566609
683,"Secondary Syphilis in Cali, Colombia: New Concepts in Disease Pathogenesis","Venereal syphilis is a multi-stage, sexually transmitted disease caused by the spirochetal bacterium Treponema pallidum (Tp). Herein we describe a cohort of 57 patients (age 18–68 years) with secondary syphilis (SS) identified through a network of public sector primary health care providers in Cali, Colombia. To be eligible for participation, study subjects were required to have cutaneous lesions consistent with SS, a reactive Rapid Plasma Reagin test (RPR-titer ≥1∶4), and a confirmatory treponemal test (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption test- FTA-ABS). Most subjects enrolled were women (64.9%), predominantly Afro-Colombian (38.6%) or mestizo (56.1%), and all were of low socio-economic status. Three (5.3%) subjects were newly diagnosed with HIV infection at study entry. The duration of signs and symptoms in most patients (53.6%) was less than 30 days; however, some patients reported being symptomatic for several months (range 5–240 days). The typical palmar and plantar exanthem of SS was the most common dermal manifestation (63%), followed by diffuse hypo- or hyperpigmented macules and papules on the trunk, abdomen and extremities. Three patients had patchy alopecia. Whole blood (WB) samples and punch biopsy material from a subset of SS patients were assayed for the presence of Tp DNA polymerase I gene (polA) target by real-time qualitative and quantitative PCR methods. Twelve (46%) of the 26 WB samples studied had quantifiable Tp DNA (ranging between 194.9 and 1954.2 Tp polA copies/ml blood) and seven (64%) were positive when WB DNA was extracted within 24 hours of collection. Tp DNA was also present in 8/12 (66%) skin biopsies available for testing. Strain typing analysis was attempted in all skin and WB samples with detectable Tp DNA. Using arp repeat size analysis and tpr RFLP patterns four different strain types were identified (14d, 16d, 13d and 22a). None of the WB samples had sufficient DNA for typing. The clinical and microbiologic observations presented herein, together with recent Cali syphilis seroprevalence data, provide additional evidence that venereal syphilis is highly endemic in this region of Colombia, thus underscoring the need for health care providers in the region to be acutely aware of the clinical manifestations of SS. This study also provides, for the first time, quantitative evidence that a significant proportion of untreated SS patients have substantial numbers of circulating spirochetes. How Tp is able to persist in the blood and skin of SS patients, despite the known presence of circulating treponemal opsonizing antibodies and the robust pro-inflammatory cellular immune responses characteristic of this stage of the disease, is not fully understood and requires further study.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.068083086,0.000816223,0.019761466000000002,-0.110177148,-0.036767802999999995,-0.008566057,-0.015990874,0.041889777999999996,-0.069675764,0.013683435,-0.0039739120000000005,0.016370403000000002,0.003862891,0.005795288000000001,-0.030977096000000003,0.007046436999999999,-0.015114638,-9.8e-05,0.012268603999999999,-0.010105732,0.029443833,-0.037797916,-0.020062737,-0.025429063999999998,-0.024816797,-0.034621808,-0.017954498,0.025222517000000003,-0.017850075,0.044604563
685,A multiplex reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction for detection and differentiation of wild-type and vaccine strains of canine distemper virus,"A multiplex reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) method was developed for the detection and differentiation of wild-type and vaccine strains of canine distemper virus (CDV). A pair of primers (P1 and P4) specific for CDV corresponding to the highly conserved region of the CDV genome were used as a common primer pair in the first-round PCR of the nested PCR. Primers P2 specific for CDV wild-type strains, were used as the forward primer together with the common reverse primer P4 in the second round of nested PCR. Primers P3, P5 specific for CDV wild-type strain or vaccine strain, were used as the forward primer together with the common reverse primer P4+P6 in the second round of nested PCR. A fragment of 177 bp was amplified from vaccine strain genomic RNA, and a fragment of 247 bp from wild-type strain genomic RNA in the RT-nPCR, and two fragments of 247 bp and 177 bp were amplified from the mixed samples of vaccine and wild-type strains. No amplification was achieved for uninfected cells, or cells infected with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), canine parvovirus (CPV), canine coronavirus (CCV), rabies virus (RV), or canine adenovirus (CAV). The RT-nPCR method was used to detect 30 field samples suspected of canine distemper from Heilongjiang and Jilin Provinces, and 51 samples in Shandong province. As a result of 30 samples, were found to be wild-type-like, and 5 to be vaccine-strain-like. The RT-nPCR method can be used to effectively detect and differentiate wild-type CDV-infected dogs from dogs vaccinated with CDV vaccine, and thus can be used in clinical detection and epidemiological surveillance.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.031262489,0.037986609,0.199769375,-0.005458716999999999,0.09271729599999999,0.001678064,-0.06635091,-0.045899023,-0.011424406000000002,0.007890753,0.06642783,0.060394931,-0.060038817,0.007970366,0.058112128,-0.041243725,-0.018287736000000002,-0.039389596,0.063406343,-0.00316547,0.24819852399999998,0.13742169,-0.057073751,0.07006709700000001,0.237690266,-0.12123348199999999,-0.062820943,-0.007759121999999999,-0.085894259,0.120496504
686,An emerging recombinant human enterovirus 71 responsible for the 2008 outbreak of Hand Foot and Mouth Disease in Fuyang city of China,"Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), a common contagious disease that usually affects children, is normally mild but can have life-threatening manifestations. It can be caused by enteroviruses, particularly Coxsackieviruses and human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) with highly variable clinical manifestations. In the spring of 2008, a large, unprecedented HFMD outbreak in Fuyang city of Anhui province in the central part of southeastern China resulted in a high aggregation of fatal cases. In this study, epidemiologic and clinical investigations, laboratory testing, and genetic analyses were performed to identify the causal pathogen of the outbreak. Of the 6,049 cases reported between 1 March and 9 May of 2008, 3023 (50%) were hospitalized, 353 (5.8%) were severe and 22 (0.36%) were fatal. HEV71 was confirmed as the etiological pathogen of the outbreak. Phylogenetic analyses of entire VP1 capsid protein sequence of 45 Fuyang HEV71 isolates showed that they belong to C4a cluster of the C4 subgenotype. In addition, genetic recombinations were found in the 3D region (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a major component of the viral replication complex of the genome) between the Fuyang HEV71 strain and Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), resulting in a recombination virus.

688,Up-regulation of p21 and TNF-α is mediated in lycorine-induced death of HL-60 cells,"BACKGROUND: Leukemia is one of the most life-threatening cancers today, and acute promyelogenous leukemia (APL) is a common type of leukemia. Many natural compounds have already been found to exhibit significant anti-tumor effects. Lycorine, a natural alkaloid extracted from Amaryllidaceae, exhibited anti-leukemia effects in vitro and in vivo. The survival rate of HL-60 cells exposed to lycorine was decreased, cell growth was slowed down, and cell regeneration potential was inhibited. HL-60 cells exhibited typical apoptotic characteristic. Lycorine can suppress leukemia growth and reduce cell survival and inducing apoptosis of tumor cells. The purpose of this work is to elucidate the mechanism by which lycorine induces APL cells. RESULTS: When HL-60 cells were treated with different concentration of lycorine, the expression of p21 and TNF-α was up-regulated in a concentration-dependent manner as shown by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Lycorine also down-regulated p21-related gene expression, including Cdc2, Cyclin B, Cdk2 and Cyclin E, promoted Bid truncation, decreased IκB phosphorylation and blocked NF-κB nuclear import. Cytochrome c was released from mitochondria as observed with confocal laser microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: The TNF-α signal transduction pathway and p21-mediated cell-cycle inhibition were involved in the apoptosis of HL-60 cells induced by lycorine.

689,Diagnostic Methods for Feline Coronavirus: A Review,"Feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) are found throughout the world. Infection with FCoV can result in a diverse range of signs from clinically inapparent infections to a highly fatal disease called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). FIP is one of the most serious viral diseases of cats. While there is neither an effective vaccine, nor a curative treatment for FIP, a diagnostic protocol for FCoV would greatly assist in the management and control of the virus. Clinical findings in FIP are non-specific and not helpful in making a differential diagnosis. Haematological and biochemical abnormalities in FIP cases are also non-specific. The currently available serological tests have low specificity and sensitivity for detection of active infection and cross-react with FCoV strains of low pathogenicity, the feline enteric coronaviruses (FECV). Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used to detect FCoV and is rapid and sensitive, but results must be interpreted in the context of clinical findings. At present, a definitive diagnosis of FIP can be established only by histopathological examination of biopsies.

690,Ambient Influenza and Avian Influenza Virus during Dust Storm Days and Background Days,"BACKGROUND: The spread of influenza and highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) presents a significant threat to human health. Avian influenza outbreaks in downwind areas of Asian dust storms (ADS) suggest that viruses might be transported by dust storms. OBJECTIVES: We developed a technique to measure ambient influenza and avian influenza viruses. We then used this technique to measure concentrations of these viruses on ADS days and background days, and to assess the relationships between ambient influenza and avian influenza viruses, and air pollutants. METHODS: A high-volume air sampler was used in parallel with a filter cassette to evaluate spiked samples and unspiked samples. Then, air samples were monitored during ADS seasons using a filter cassette coupled with a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay. Air samples were monitored during ADS season (1 January to 31 May 2006). RESULTS: We successfully quantified ambient influenza virus using the filtration/real-time qPCR method during ADS days and background days. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the concentration of influenza virus in ambient air. In both the spiked and unspiked samples, the concentration of influenza virus sampled using the filter cassette was higher than that using the high-volume sampler. The concentration of ambient influenza A virus was significantly higher during the ADS days than during the background days.

692,Antiviral Lead Compounds from Marine Sponges,"Marine sponges are currently one of the richest sources of pharmacologically active compounds found in the marine environment. These bioactive molecules are often secondary metabolites, whose main function is to enable and/or modulate cellular communication and defense. They are usually produced by functional enzyme clusters in sponges and/or their associated symbiotic microorganisms. Natural product lead compounds from sponges have often been found to be promising pharmaceutical agents. Several of them have successfully been approved as antiviral agents for clinical use or have been advanced to the late stages of clinical trials. Most of these drugs are used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). The most important antiviral lead of marine origin reported thus far is nucleoside Ara-A (vidarabine) isolated from sponge Tethya crypta. It inhibits viral DNA polymerase and DNA synthesis of herpes, vaccinica and varicella zoster viruses. However due to the discovery of new types of viruses and emergence of drug resistant strains, it is necessary to develop new antiviral lead compounds continuously. Several sponge derived antiviral lead compounds which are hopedto be developed as future drugs are discussed in this review. Supply problems are usually the major bottleneck to the development of these compounds as drugs during clinical trials. However advances in the field of metagenomics and high throughput microbial cultivation has raised the possibility that these techniques could lead to the cost-effective large scale production of such compounds.

Second, the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), a component of sporozoites that contains a B-cell epitope. METHODS: A synthetic chimeric recombinant 516 bp gene encoding containing PvMSP-1, a Pro-Gly linker motif, and PvCSP was synthesized; the gene, named MLC, encoded a total of 172 amino acids. The recombinant gene was modified with regard to codon usage to optimize gene expression in Brassica napus. The Ti plasmid inducible gene transfer system was used for MLC chimeric recombinant gene expression in B. napus. Gene expression was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), beta-glucuronidase reporter gene (GUS) assay, and Western blot. RESULTS: The MLC chimeric recombinant protein expressed in B. napus had a molecular weight of approximately 25 kDa. It exhibited a clinical sensitivity of 84.21% (n = 38) and a clinical specificity of 100% (n = 24) as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Oral immunization of BALB/c mice with MLC chimeric recombinant protein successfully induced antigen-specific IgG1 production. Additionally, the Th1-related cytokines IL-12 (p40), TNF, and IFN-γ were significantly increased in the spleens of the BALB/c mice. CONCLUSIONS: The chimeric MLC recombinant protein produced in B. napus has potential as both as an antigen for diagnosis and as a valuable vaccine candidate for oral immunization against vivax malaria.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.10129930599999999,-0.01608411,0.062259925,-0.111528929,-0.027381867999999997,0.028910677000000003,-0.072997584,-0.06500916799999999,0.089124063,-0.058094607,-0.129129283,-0.053208930999999994,-0.003715412,0.011377095,-0.083753755,-0.081495283,0.051115317,-0.056962397000000005,-0.001875945,-0.031849723999999996,0.04783187,-0.025064945,0.096225807,0.009977078,-0.008722741,0.072126804,0.08547710900000001,-0.038794325,-0.036492649,0.035569025
701,Interplay between SIN3A and STAT3 Mediates Chromatin Conformational Changes and GFAP Expression during Cellular Differentiation,"BACKGROUND: Neurons and astrocytes are generated from common neural precursors, yet neurogenesis precedes astrocyte formation during embryogenesis. The mechanisms of neural development underlying suppression and de-suppression of differentiation- related genes for cell fate specifications are not well understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By using an in vitro system in which NTera-2 cells were induced to differentiate into an astrocyte-like lineage, we revealed a novel role for Sin3A in maintaining the suppression of GFAP in NTera-2 cells. Sin3A coupled with MeCP2 bound to the GFAP promoter and their occupancies were correlated with repression of GFAP transcription. The repression by Sin3A and MeCP2 may be an essential mechanism underlying the inhibition of cell differentiation. Upon commitment toward an astrocyte-like lineage, Sin3A- MeCP2 departed from the promoter and activated STAT3 simultaneously bound to the promoter and exon 1 of GFAP; meanwhile, olig2 was exported from nuclei to the cytoplasm. This suggested that a three-dimensional or higher-order structure was provoked by STAT3 binding between the promoter and proximal coding regions. STAT3 then recruited CBP/p300 to exon 1 and targeted the promoter for histone H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation. The CBP/p300-mediated histone modification further facilitates chromatin remodeling, thereby enhancing H3K4 trimethylation and recruitment of RNA polymerase II to activate GFAP gene transcription. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results provide evidence that exchange of repressor and activator complexes and epigenetic modifications are critical strategies for cellular differentiation and lineage-specific gene expression.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.119461267,-0.035149295,-0.014586439,-0.055475687999999995,-0.040505861000000004,0.023234669,0.010412749,-0.018753601,0.036319838,-0.038071548999999996,-0.048001718,-0.016173824,-0.022351568,0.055568417,-0.021852197,0.028571686000000002,-0.005674651,-0.057782393,-0.050046279000000006,-0.028139297,0.036870895,-0.004045771,0.005591685,0.004860743,0.005693643000000001,-0.019555458,-0.022728386,0.03280976,0.026195976,-0.048390577000000004
706,Viral Double-Strand RNA-Binding Proteins Can Enhance Innate Immune Signaling by Toll-Like Receptor 3,"Toll-like Receptor 3 (TLR3) detects double-stranded (ds) RNAs to activate innate immune responses. While poly(I:C) is an excellent agonist for TLR3 in several cell lines and in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, viral dsRNAs tend to be poor agonists, leading to the hypothesis that additional factor(s) are likely required to allow TLR3 to respond to viral dsRNAs. TLR3 signaling was examined in a lung epithelial cell line by quantifying cytokine production and in human embryonic kidney cells by quantifying luciferase reporter levels. Recombinant 1b hepatitis C virus polymerase was found to enhance TLR3 signaling in the lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells when added to the media along with either poly(I:C) or viral dsRNAs. The polymerase from the genotype 2a JFH-1 HCV was a poor enhancer of TLR3 signaling until it was mutated to favor a conformation that could bind better to a partially duplexed RNA. The 1b polymerase also co-localizes with TLR3 in endosomes. RNA-binding capsid proteins (CPs) from two positive-strand RNA viruses and the hepadenavirus hepatitis B virus (HBV) were also potent enhancers of TLR3 signaling by poly(I:C) or viral dsRNAs. A truncated version of the HBV CP that lacked an arginine-rich RNA-binding domain was unable to enhance TLR3 signaling. These results demonstrate that several viral RNA-binding proteins can enhance the dsRNA-dependent innate immune response initiated by TLR3.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.114930169,-0.048874299,-0.032254205,-0.03009904,-0.06839576900000001,0.00651973,0.026618684,-0.011444448999999999,0.026228137000000002,-0.011536995,-0.01039189,-0.015249903,-0.000616716,0.067313545,0.00369811,0.015865837,0.001720444,-0.00418202,0.025922051,-0.020622769,-0.00392525,0.021044532,0.010568022,-0.01116516,-0.019320598,-0.020076967,-0.020438498,0.027932002,-0.008320987,-0.034384421
708,Neuropathogenesis of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H7N1) in experimentally infected chickens,"In order to understand the mechanism of neuroinvasion of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) into the central nervous system (CNS) of chickens, specific pathogen free chickens were inoculated with a H7N1 HPAIV. Blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), nasal cavity and brain tissue samples were obtained from 1 to 4 days post-inoculation (dpi) of infected and control chickens. Viral antigen topographical distribution, presence of influenza A virus receptors in the brain, as well as, the role of the olfactory route in virus CNS invasion were studied using different immunohistochemistry techniques. Besides, viral RNA load in CSF and blood was quantified by means of a quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Viral antigen was observed widely distributed in the CNS, showing bilateral and symmetrical distribution in the nuclei of the diencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon. Viral RNA was detected in blood and CSF at one dpi, indicating that the virus crosses the blood-CSF-barrier early during infection. This early dissemination is possibly favoured by the presence of Siaα2,3 Gal and Siaα2,6 Gal receptors in brain vascular endothelial cells, and Siaα2,3 Gal receptors in ependymal and choroid plexus cells. No viral antigen was observed in olfactory sensory neurons, while the olfactory bulb showed only weak staining, suggesting that the virus did not use this pathway to enter into the brain. The sequence of virus appearance and the topographical distribution of this H7N1 HPAIV indicate that the viral entry occurs via the haematogenous route, with early and generalized spreading through the CSF.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.030437476,-0.048430083,0.015613053,-0.010589854,-0.036397859,0.068249251,-0.006033293,-0.021235496,0.002032404,0.024897557,0.051021440999999994,-0.07876733400000001,0.033200743,0.04866784,0.040507977,0.011608725,-0.022149426,-0.031719844,-0.009961311,0.023445478999999998,-0.012958629,0.017391195,-0.014645433999999999,-0.011595152,-0.008275059,-0.007227364,-0.010286316,-0.011590348,-0.041739702000000004,0.03092977
709,Inhibition of Interferon Induction and Action by the Nairovirus Nairobi Sheep Disease Virus/Ganjam Virus,"The Nairoviruses are an important group of tick-borne viruses that includes pathogens of man (Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus) and livestock animals (Dugbe virus, Nairobi sheep disease virus (NSDV)). NSDV is found in large parts of East Africa and the Indian subcontinent (where it is known as Ganjam virus). We have investigated the ability of NSDV to antagonise the induction and actions of interferon. Both pathogenic and apathogenic isolates could actively inhibit the induction of type 1 interferon, and also blocked the signalling pathways of both type 1 and type 2 interferons. Using transient expression of viral proteins or sections of viral proteins, these activities all mapped to the ovarian tumour-like protease domain (OTU) found in the viral RNA polymerase. Virus infection, or expression of this OTU domain in transfected cells, led to a great reduction in the incorporation of ubiquitin or ISG15 protein into host cell proteins. Point mutations in the OTU that inhibited the protease activity also prevented it from antagonising interferon induction and action. Interestingly, a mutation at a peripheral site, which had little apparent effect on the ability of the OTU to inhibit ubiquitination and ISG15ylation, removed the ability of the OTU to block the induction of type 1 and the action of type 2 interferons, but had a lesser effect on the ability to block type 1 interferon action, suggesting that targets other than ubiquitin and ISG15 may be involved in the actions of the viral OTU.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.10379888599999999,-0.054831992,-0.031815291,-0.024709814,-0.078234869,0.061455032,0.055545501,-0.021976628999999998,0.035873386,0.019900486999999998,-0.023546097999999998,-0.024848914,-0.008959269,0.045900519,0.004016967,-0.025902967000000002,0.009908896,-0.02855108,0.0017823479999999998,0.048163295,0.024854083,0.034040271000000004,-0.021195637000000003,0.019721891999999998,0.033374971,0.029784077000000003,0.02339953,-0.012772391000000001,-0.047036241,-0.017100446000000002
715,Surveillance of Airborne Adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in a Hospital Pediatric Department,This investigation evaluated the distributions of airborne adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in public areas in the pediatric department of Children's Hospital in northern Taiwan. The airborne viral and bacterial concentrations were evaluated twice a week for a year using filter sampling with an airflow rate of 12 liters per minute for eight hours in the pediatric outpatient department and 24 hours in the pediatric emergency room. Real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were conducted for analysis. Approximately 18% of the air samples from the pediatric emergency room were found to contain adenovirus. Approximately forty-six percent of the air samples from the pediatric outpatient department contained Mycoplasma pneumoniae DNA products. High detection rates of airborne adenovirus DNA were obtained in July and August in the pediatric public areas. Airborne Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected only in July in the pediatric emergency room and the peak levels were found from August to January in the pediatric outpatient department. Airborne particles that contained adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were the most prevalent in the pediatric public areas. The potential relationship between these airborne viral/bacterial particles and human infection should be examined further.

717,The CEA/CD3-Bispecific Antibody MEDI-565 (MT111) Binds a Nonlinear Epitope in the Full-Length but Not a Short Splice Variant of CEA,"MEDI-565 (also known as MT111) is a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE®) antibody in development for the treatment of patients with cancers expressing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). MEDI-565 binds CEA on cancer cells and CD3 on T cells to induce T-cell mediated killing of cancer cells. To understand the molecular basis of human CEA recognition by MEDI-565 and how polymorphisms and spliced forms of CEA may affect MEDI-565 activity, we mapped the epitope of MEDI-565 on CEA using mutagenesis and homology modeling approaches. We found that MEDI-565 recognized a conformational epitope in the A2 domain comprised of amino acids 326–349 and 388–410, with critical residues F(326), T(328), N(333), V(388), G(389), P(390), E(392), I(408), and N(410). Two non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs10407503, rs7249230) were identified in the epitope region, but they are found at low homozygosity rates. Searching the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank® database, we further identified a single, previously uncharacterized mRNA splice variant of CEA that lacks a portion of the N-terminal domain, the A1 and B1 domains, and a large portion of the A2 domain. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of multiple cancers showed widespread expression of full-length CEA in these tumors, with less frequent but concordant expression of the CEA splice variant. Because the epitope was largely absent from the CEA splice variant, MEDI-565 did not bind or mediate T-cell killing of cells solely expressing this form of CEA. In addition, the splice variant did not interfere with MEDI-565 binding or activity when co-expressed with full-length CEA. Thus MEDI-565 may broadly target CEA-positive tumors without regard for expression of the short splice variant of CEA. Together our data suggest that MEDI-565 activity will neither be impacted by SNPs nor by a splice variant of CEA.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.06569418099999999,-0.026281855,0.000401311,-0.080785135,-0.034122135,0.026882483,0.006066345,-0.013181008000000001,0.018800228999999998,-0.029021476,-0.028435548999999997,0.022232972,-0.01562761,-0.009649695,-0.007387928,0.005182948,0.005618255,-0.01066485,-0.015536846000000002,-0.029686241000000002,0.027445457000000003,-0.01741595,0.017583125,-0.005832261,0.016736924,0.025356498999999998,-0.011238123000000001,0.012365667,0.005911441999999999,-0.021282887
722,Clinical Relevance and Discriminatory Value of Elevated Liver Aminotransferase Levels for Dengue Severity,"BACKGROUND: Elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is prominent in acute dengue illness. The World Health Organization (WHO) 2009 dengue guidelines defined AST or ALT≥1000 units/liter (U/L) as a criterion for severe dengue. We aimed to assess the clinical relevance and discriminatory value of AST or ALT for dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and severe dengue. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We retrospectively studied and classified polymerase chain reaction positive dengue patients from 2006 to 2008 treated at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore according to WHO 1997 and 2009 criteria for dengue severity. Of 690 dengue patients, 31% had DHF and 24% severe dengue. Elevated AST and ALT occurred in 86% and 46%, respectively. Seven had AST or ALT≥1000 U/L. None had acute liver failure but one patient died. Median AST and ALT values were significantly higher with increasing dengue severity by both WHO 1997 and 2009 criteria. However, they were poorly discriminatory between non-severe and severe dengue (e.g., AST area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve = 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57–0.67) and between dengue fever (DF) and DHF (AST area under the ROC curve = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.52–0.61). There was significant overlap in AST and ALT values among patients with dengue with or without warning signs and severe dengue, and between those with DF and DHF. CONCLUSIONS: Although aminotransferase levels increased in conjunction with dengue severity, AST or ALT values did not discriminate between DF and DHF or non-severe and severe dengue.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.023659225,-0.007648618,-0.026298357999999997,-0.09968171,-0.047265648,0.016535914,-0.003955228,0.024473131000000002,-0.044285259,-0.039956106,-0.007986119,0.048861102999999996,-0.045973256,-0.022663182999999996,-0.035266989,0.046325619000000005,-0.016214165,0.009026145,-0.002908705,-0.007757587,-0.021357467999999998,-0.018160983000000002,-0.037883016,-0.012361805,-0.004037978,0.027862416,-0.005640945,-0.049525840999999994,-0.02292738,-0.006891171
723,Molecular and Microscopic Analysis of Bacteria and Viruses in Exhaled Breath Collected Using a Simple Impaction and Condensing Method,"Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is increasingly being used as a non-invasive method for disease diagnosis and environmental exposure assessment. By using hydrophobic surface, ice, and droplet scavenging, a simple impaction and condensing based collection method is reported here. Human subjects were recruited to exhale toward the device for 1, 2, 3, and 4 min. The exhaled breath quickly formed into tiny droplets on the hydrophobic surface, which were subsequently scavenged into a 10 µL rolling deionized water droplet. The collected EBC was further analyzed using culturing, DNA stain, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and colorimetry (VITEK 2) for bacteria and viruses. Experimental data revealed that bacteria and viruses in EBC can be rapidly collected using the method developed here, with an observed efficiency of 100 µL EBC within 1 min. Culturing, DNA stain, SEM, and qPCR methods all detected high bacterial concentrations up to 7000 CFU/m(3) in exhaled breath, including both viable and dead cells of various types. Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Kocuria variants were found dominant in EBC samples using VITEK 2 system. SEM images revealed that most bacteria in exhaled breath are detected in the size range of 0.5–1.0 µm, which is able to enable them to remain airborne for a longer time, thus presenting a risk for airborne transmission of potential diseases. Using qPCR, influenza A H3N2 viruses were also detected in one EBC sample. Different from other devices restricted solely to condensation, the developed method can be easily achieved both by impaction and condensation in a laboratory and could impact current practice of EBC collection. Nonetheless, the reported work is a proof-of-concept demonstration, and its performance in non-invasive disease diagnosis such as bacterimia and virus infections needs to be further validated including effects of its influencing matrix.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.041753514,-0.002066961,0.10416794800000001,0.014143882,-0.028271846,0.047765130999999995,0.045314077,0.006635933,-0.027550029,0.035527546,-0.024824089,-0.011783509,0.030056412,-0.039309526000000004,0.030520737000000003,0.006626031,-0.052604933,-0.052141438,-0.006756296,-0.03261096,-0.021815722000000003,0.000632547,0.015270552,0.013757634,-0.013334406000000002,-0.009236956999999999,-0.035347515,0.042344596,-0.014818729,-0.018023025
724,"Detection of porcine circovirus genotypes 2a and 2b in aborted foetuses from infected swine herds in the State of São Paulo, Brazil","BACKGROUND: Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) has been associated with several disease complexes, including reproductive failure. The aim of this study was to identify the subtypes of PCV2 that are associated with reproductive failure in pigs from the State of São Paulo, Brazil and to investigate co-infections with other infectious organisms. FINDINGS: Samples of 168 aborted foetuses or mummified foetuses from five farrow-to-finish swine farms known to be infected with PCV2 and located in the State of São Paulo were tested for PCV2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Positive samples were additionally tested for porcine parvovirus (PPV), Leptospira spp. and Brucella spp. by PCR. PCV2 was detected in 18 of the samples (10.7%). PPV, Brucella spp. and Leptospira spp were found in 2, 10 and 0 cases, respectively. Eleven PCV2 strains were sequenced and determined to be either genotype 2a (n = 1) or 2b (n = 10). CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that the frequency of PCV2 infections in aborted porcine foetuses from the State of São Paulo is rather low (10.7%) and that co-infection with other pathogens is common and may be involved in PCV2 associated reproductive failure. No repeatable, characteristic amino acid motifs for regions of the PCV2 capsid protein seemed to be associated with abortion in sows.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.008366951,-0.016063098999999997,0.053480533,-0.10845160400000001,0.026594091,0.015522565,0.006751394,-0.012732096000000002,0.0015553910000000002,-0.016923087,0.024028888999999998,0.036887469,-0.06352060799999999,-0.006692686999999999,0.098852354,-0.08507072199999999,-0.008396163,-0.030790736000000003,0.014242918,0.009953673,-0.00772535,0.02091274,0.015386027,-0.039008269,0.02962418,-0.026999071,-0.057168422999999996,-0.009068594000000001,0.001051126,-0.011485891000000002
726,Partial and Full PCR-Based Reverse Genetics Strategy for Influenza Viruses,"Since 1999, plasmid-based reverse genetics (RG) systems have revolutionized the way influenza viruses are studied. However, it is not unusual to encounter cloning difficulties for one or more influenza genes while attempting to recover virus de novo. To overcome some of these shortcomings we sought to develop partial or full plasmid-free RG systems. The influenza gene of choice is assembled into a RG competent unit by virtue of overlapping PCR reactions containing a cDNA copy of the viral gene segment under the control of RNA polymerase I promoter (pol1) and termination (t1) signals – herein referred to as Flu PCR amplicons. Transfection of tissue culture cells with either HA or NA Flu PCR amplicons and 7 plasmids encoding the remaining influenza RG units, resulted in efficient virus rescue. Likewise, transfections including both HA and NA Flu PCR amplicons and 6 RG plasmids also resulted in efficient virus rescue. In addition, influenza viruses were recovered from a full set of Flu PCR amplicons without the use of plasmids.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.006828795,-0.055943455999999996,0.057100037,0.112283317,-0.001188877,0.174786473,-0.11982203,-0.005653631,-0.021027915,-0.045925474,-0.016309978,-0.040754151,0.031921464,0.026981542,0.022121005,0.002429036,0.017499982,-0.030211613,-0.022972378999999998,-0.06310729999999999,0.024915695,0.015293319,0.059552140999999996,-0.006936561999999999,-0.055216808,-0.009107784,0.008130552,-0.032202686,-0.007898365,0.042598538
727,Competition between Influenza A Virus Genome Segments,"Influenza A virus (IAV) contains a segmented negative-strand RNA genome. How IAV balances the replication and transcription of its multiple genome segments is not understood. We developed a dual competition assay based on the co-transfection of firefly or Gaussia luciferase-encoding genome segments together with plasmids encoding IAV polymerase subunits and nucleoprotein. At limiting amounts of polymerase subunits, expression of the firefly luciferase segment was negatively affected by the presence of its Gaussia luciferase counterpart, indicative of competition between reporter genome segments. This competition could be relieved by increasing or decreasing the relative amounts of firefly or Gaussia reporter segment, respectively. The balance between the luciferase expression levels was also affected by the identity of the untranslated regions (UTRs) as well as segment length. In general it appeared that genome segments displaying inherent higher expression levels were more efficient competitors of another segment. When natural genome segments were tested for their ability to suppress reporter gene expression, shorter genome segments generally reduced firefly luciferase expression to a larger extent, with the M and NS segments having the largest effect. The balance between different reporter segments was most dramatically affected by the introduction of UTR panhandle-stabilizing mutations. Furthermore, only reporter genome segments carrying these mutations were able to efficiently compete with the natural genome segments in infected cells. Our data indicate that IAV genome segments compete for available polymerases. Competition is affected by segment length, coding region, and UTRs. This competition is probably most apparent early during infection, when limiting amounts of polymerases are present, and may contribute to the regulation of segment-specific replication and transcription.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.11402150800000001,-0.042665927,-0.002069429,-0.029710537000000002,-0.018852561,0.024621534,-0.037683497,-0.007025241999999999,0.010588084,-0.044489697,-0.029676129,-0.024445437999999996,0.0023904779999999997,0.019040836999999998,0.013789488999999999,0.007040741,-0.008524624,-0.025714555,-0.026951628999999998,-0.018035865,0.02483628,0.0015585220000000001,-0.015999327,-0.003494311,-0.052810986,-0.034914106,0.015741142,0.009855324,0.004973184,0.005938842
729,D471G Mutation in LCMV-NP Affects its Ability to Self-associate and Results in a Dominant Negative Effect in Viral RNA Synthesis,"Arenaviruses merit significant interest because several family members are etiological agents of severe hemorrhagic fevers, representing a major burden to public health. Currently, there are no FDA-licensed vaccines against arenaviruses and the only available antiviral therapy is limited to the use of ribavirin that is partially effective. Arenavirus nucleoprotein (NP) is found associated with the genomic RNA forming the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) that together with the polymerase (L) direct viral replication and transcription. Virion formation requires the recruitment of vRNPs into budding sites, a process in which the arenavirus matrix-like protein (Z) plays a major role. Therefore, proper NP-NP and NP-Z interactions are required for the generation of infectious progeny. In this work we demonstrate the role of the amino acid residue D471 in the self-association of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus nucleoprotein (LCMV-NP). Amino acid substitutions at this position abrogate NP oligomerization, affecting its ability to mediate replication and transcription of a minigenome reporter plasmid. However, its ability to interact with the Z protein, counteract the cellular interferon response and bind to dsRNA analogs was retained. Additionally, we also document the dominant negative effect of D471G mutation on viral infection, suggesting that NP self-association is an excellent target for the development of new antivirals against arenaviruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.101494629,-0.04450498,-0.026088497999999998,-0.002251791,-0.084824094,0.050813789000000005,0.038202796000000004,-0.013394541000000001,0.030691767000000002,0.028053426,-0.022258379,-0.00095157,0.011221023,-0.025051427999999997,-0.010588802,-0.018075058999999997,-0.007057899,0.017691598,-0.016180876,0.036663312,-0.027456017000000003,0.015707099,-0.045479217,-0.008307657,0.033756703,0.015911201,0.02932076,-0.049712392,-0.02388418,0.029072052

During a fecal source-tracking study, two genetically novel Leviviridae strains were discovered. Although the novel strains were isolated from coastal waters 1130 km apart (North Carolina and Rhode Island, USA), these strains shared 97% nucleotide similarity and 97–100% amino acid similarity. When the novel strains were compared to nine Levivirus genogroup I strains, they shared 95–100% similarity among the maturation, capsid and lysis proteins, but only 84–85% in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene. Further bioinformatic analyses suggested a recombination event occurred.

731,Bovine herpes virus type 1 induces apoptosis through Fas-dependent and mitochondria-controlled manner in Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells,"BACKGROUND: Bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) is an important pathogen in cattle that is responsible for substantial economic losses. Previous studies suggest that BHV-1 may induce apoptosis in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells via a mechanism only involving caspases and p53. However, the mechanism for BHV-1-induced MDBK cell apoptosis still requires more research. METHODS: MDBK was used as a model to study the precise signaling pathways of apoptosis induced by BHV-1 infection. RESULTS: BHV-1 infection activated a Fas/FasL-mediated apoptotic pathway, resulting in activation of caspase-8 and cleavage of Bid. In addition, BHV-1 infection down-regulated Bcl-2 and up-regulated Bax expression, thereby initiating the release of cytochrome c followed by caspase-9 activation. The combined activation of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways resulted in activation of downstream effecter caspase-3 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), leading to apoptosis. Furthermore, blocking apoptosis using caspase inhibitors improved BHV-1-infected MDBK cell viability to different extent. BHV-1 infection did not induce significant DNA fragmentation in MDBK cells pretreated with ammonium chloride (NH(4)Cl) or cells infected with UV-inactivated BHV-1. Blocking caspases activation increased BHV-1 replication. CONCLUSIONS: BHV-1 induces apoptosis in MDBK cells through extrinsic and intrinsic pathways and there might be cross-talk between the two pathways. In addition, BHV-1 replication may be necessary for the induction of apoptosis in BHV-1-infected cells, and prolonged cell viability benefits BHV-1 replication.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.07126645599999999,-0.035356593,0.00013105,-0.105859303,-0.081426949,0.049583508,0.034171535,-0.036131986,0.060329999,-0.026625053,-0.031078051000000002,-0.01517732,-0.024010781000000002,0.06747180900000001,0.010073709,0.050623932,-0.012960093,-0.029707257,0.008315655,-0.00628814,0.034072846000000004,-0.0008893089999999999,0.01455209,-0.019293758,0.036650782,0.011119823999999999,-0.046731398,0.046215745999999995,0.002551747,-0.06407105099999999
733,Diversity of Salmonella spp. serovars isolated from the intestines of water buffalo calves with gastroenteritis,"BACKGROUND: Salmonellosis in water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) calves is a widespread disease characterized by severe gastrointestinal lesions, profuse diarrhea and severe dehydration, occasionally exhibiting a systemic course. Several Salmonella serovars seem to be able to infect water buffalo, but Salmonella isolates collected from this animal species have been poorly characterized. In the present study, the prevalence of Salmonella spp. in water buffalo calves affected by lethal gastroenteritis was assessed, and a polyphasic characterization of isolated strains of S. Typhimurium was performed. RESULTS: The microbiological analysis of the intestinal contents obtained from 248 water buffalo calves affected by lethal gastroenteritis exhibited a significant prevalence of Salmonella spp. (25%), characterized by different serovars, most frequently Typhimurium (21%), Muenster (11%), and Give (11%). The 13 S. Typhimurium isolates were all associated with enterocolitis characterized by severe damage of the intestine, and only sporadically isolated with another possible causative agent responsible for gastroenteritis, such as Cryptosporidium spp., Rotavirus or Clostridium perfringens. Other Salmonella isolates were mostly isolated from minor intestinal lesions, and often (78% of cases) isolated with other microorganisms, mainly toxinogenic Escherichia coli (35%), Cryptosporidium spp. (20%) and Rotavirus (10%). The S. Typhimurium strains were characterized by phage typing and further genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of 24 virulence genes. The isolates exhibited nine different phage types and 10 different genetic profiles. Three monophasic S. Typhimurium (B:4,12:i:-) isolates were also found and characterized, displaying three different phage types and three different virulotypes. The molecular characterization was extended to the 7 S. Muenster and 7 S. Give isolates collected, indicating the existence of different virulotypes also within these serovars. Three representative strains of S. Typhimurium were tested in vivo in a mouse model of mixed infection. The most pathogenic strain was characterized by a high number of virulence factors and the presence of the locus agfA, coding for a thin aggregative fimbria. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence that Salmonella is frequently associated with gastroenteritis in water buffalo calves, particularly S. Typhimurium. Moreover, the variety in the number and distribution of different virulence markers among the collected S. Typhimurium strains suggests that within this serovar there are different pathotypes potentially responsible for different clinical syndromes.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.012935886,-0.011327781,0.045719191,-0.126256905,0.06409355900000001,0.047913189,0.025020459,-0.022469648999999998,-0.016697852,0.022808553,0.012547275,0.056891035,-0.049731968,-0.034131612,0.05859958,-0.017527131,-0.048235047,-0.000575373,-0.006614086999999999,-0.006044185,0.035817535,0.025542044,-0.016163148000000002,0.028517367999999998,0.020988927,-0.028971679,-0.004135143,-0.007479481,-0.005293594,0.010209156
735,Debate around infection-dependent hemophagocytic syndrome in paediatrics,"BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is clinically defined as a combination of fever, liver dysfunction, coagulation abnormalities, pancytopenia, progressive macrophage proliferation throughout the reticuloendothelial system, and cytokine over-production, and may be primary or secondary to infectious, auto-immune, and tumoral diseases. The most consistent association is with viral infections but, as it is still debated whether any micro-organisms are involved in its pathogenesis, we critically appraised the literature concerning HPS and its relationship with infections. DISCUSSION: Infection-dependent HPS has been widely observed, but there are no data concerning its incidence in children. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of HPS may clarify the interactions between the immune system and the variously implicated potential infectious agents. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has been prominently associated with HPS, with clonal proliferation and the hyperactivation of EBV-infected T cells. However, a number of other viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections have been reported in association with HPS. In the case of low-risk HPS, corticosteroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulin or cyclosporine A may be sufficient to control the biological process, but etoposide is recommended as a means of reversing infection-dependent lymphohistiocytic dysregulation in high-risk cases. SUMMARY: HPS is a potential complication of various infections. A polymerase chain reaction search for infectious agents including EBV, cytomegalovirus and Leishmania is recommended in clinical settings characterised by non-remitting fever, organomegaly, cytopenia and hyperferritinemia.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.032869292,-0.044150942,-0.036462772000000004,-0.06762521099999999,-0.07098982,0.024474737000000003,0.076475614,-0.009792941,0.05261762,0.061195106,0.020358123,-0.048635278,0.03945041,-0.029234312999999998,0.024604339,0.010469474,-0.037112159,0.013276051,-0.040426252999999995,0.008143098,-0.040676118,0.02326558,-0.048318143,-0.018899426,0.008905306,-0.007789038000000001,0.009008699,-0.012768878999999999,0.028160872000000003,0.00484843

As infectious disease and infection control practitioners continue employing contemporary techniques (e.g., computational fluid dynamics to study particle flow, polymerase chain reaction methodologies to quantify particle concentrations in various settings, and epidemiology to track the spread of disease), the central variables affecting the airborne transmission of pathogens are becoming better known. This paper reviews many of these aerobiological variables (e.g., particle size, particle type, the duration that particles can remain airborne, the distance that particles can travel, and meteorological and environmental factors), as well as the common origins of these infectious particles. We then review several real-world settings with known difficulties controlling the airborne transmission of infectious particles (e.g., office buildings, healthcare facilities, and commercial airplanes), while detailing the respective measures each of these industries is undertaking in its effort to ameliorate the transmission of airborne infectious diseases.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.017767814,-0.001079194,0.034669301,-0.068507476,-0.022330575,0.060701612,0.040882304,0.025201399,0.028071348,0.052579611,0.008916691,-0.016254312,0.021498146,-0.060694788,0.053704044000000006,0.046289219000000006,-0.059709295999999995,0.010714649,-0.042638589000000005,-0.007304029,-0.020063348,-0.0014444339999999999,-0.018497637,-0.056158412000000005,-0.003922627,0.010305891999999999,-0.012672712,0.009397902,-0.028549538,-0.001118566
743,Transcription analysis of the porcine alveolar macrophage response to porcine circovirus type 2,"BACKGROUND: Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the causal agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), which has severely impacted the swine industry worldwide. PCV2 triggers a weak and atypical innate immune response, but the key genes and mechanisms by which the virus interferes with host innate immunity have not yet been elucidated. In this study, genes that control the response of primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), the main target of PCV2, were profiled in vitro. RESULTS: PAMs were successfully infected by PCV2-WH strain, as evidenced quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) results. Infection-related differential gene expression was investigated using pig microarrays from the US Pig Genome Coordination Program and validated by real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Microarray analysis at 24 and 48 hours post-infection (HPI) revealed 266 and 175 unique genes, respectively, that were differentially expressed (false discovery rate <0.05; fold-change >2). Only six genes were differentially expressed between 24 and 48 HPI. The up-regulated genes were principally related to immune response, cytokine activity, locomotion, regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell growth arrest, and antigen procession and presentation. The down-regulated genes were mainly involved in terpenoid biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, translation, proteasome degradation, signal transducer activity, and ribosomal proteins, which were representative of the reduced vital activity of PCV2-infected cells. CONCLUSIONS: PCV2 infection of PAMs causes up-regulation of genes related to inflammation, indicating that PCV2 may induce systematic inflammation. PCV2 persistently induced cytokines, mainly through the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1 and TLR9 pathways, which may promote high levels of cytokine secretion. PCV2 may prevent apoptosis in PAMs by up-regulating SERPINB9 expression, possibly to lengthen the duration of PCV2 replication-permissive conditions. The observed gene expression profile may provide insights into the underlying immunological response and pathological changes that occur in pigs following PCV2 infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.07066795099999999,-0.014623208,0.04065685,-0.132540315,-0.059082145,0.06228973,0.019885671,-0.04617098,0.078687652,-0.04583982,-0.065221554,-0.035500408,-0.050115072999999996,0.10342926300000001,0.050424097,-0.074449946,0.0031028270000000003,-0.076139823,-0.025852517999999998,-0.01520884,0.034742685,-0.008293089,0.045909113,-0.025910113999999998,-0.06575932,-0.039169125,-0.001164123,0.039354651000000004,0.038188777,-0.06765800799999999
744,Evaluation and molecular characterization of human adenovirus in drinking water supplies: viral integrity and viability assays,"BACKGROUND: Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are the second-leading cause of childhood gastroenteritis worldwide. This virus is commonly found in environmental waters and is very resistant to water disinfection and environmental stressors, especially UV light inactivation. Molecular techniques, such as PCR-based methods (Polymerase Chain Reaction), are commonly used to detect and identify viral contamination in water, although PCR alone does not allow the discrimination between infectious and non-infectious viral particles. A combination of cell culture and PCR has allowed detection of infectious viruses that grow slowly or fail to produce cytopathic effects (CPE) in cell culture. This study aimed to assess the integrity and viability of human adenovirus (HAdV) in environmental water and evaluate circulating strains by molecular characterization in three sites of the water supply in Florianópolis, Santa Catarina Island, Brazil: Peri Lagoon water, spring source water, and water from the public water supply system. METHODS: Water samples were collected, concentrated and HAdV quantified by real-time PCR. Viral integrity was evaluated by enzymatic assay (DNase I) and infectivity by plaque assay (PA) and integrated cell culture using transcribed mRNA (ICC-RT-qPCR). Samples containing particles of infectious HAdV were selected for sequencing and molecular characterization. RESULTS: The analyzed sites contained 83, 66 and 58% undamaged HAdV particles (defined as those in which the genetic material is protected by the viral capsid) at Peri Lagoon, spring source water and public supply system water, respectively. Of these, 66% of the particles (by PA) and 75% (by ICC-RT-qPCR) HAdV were shown to be infectious, due to being undamaged in Peri Lagoon, 33% (by PA) and 58% (by ICC-RT-qPCR) in spring source water and 8% (by PA) and 25% (by ICC-RT-qPCR) in the public water supply system. ICC-RT-qPCR, a very sensitive and rapid technique, was able to detect as low as 1 × 10(2) HAdV genome copies per milliliter of infectious viral particles in the environmental water samples. The molecular characterization studies indicated that HAdV-2 was the prevalent serotype. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate a lack of proper public health measures. We suggest that HAdV can be efficiently used as a marker of environmental and drinking water contamination and ICC-RT-qPCR demonstrated greater sensitivity and speed of detection of infectious viral particles compared to PA.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.00271302,0.010858868999999998,0.128103679,-0.017708123,-0.008888015,0.011473948999999999,0.030737689,-0.019891521000000002,0.002385039,0.021471719,-0.01995939,-0.008300929,-0.015711385,0.015662664,0.041239099999999994,-0.012975921999999999,-0.039223527,0.0036456659999999997,-0.04990921,-0.068010855,0.00982005,0.150725265,0.0011999369999999999,0.047650912999999996,-0.07873260900000001,0.08577651,0.014917631,0.149308528,-0.09696380199999999,0.012177812
749,Lithium chloride promotes host resistance against Pseudomonas aeruginosa keratitis,"PURPOSE: To explore the role of lithium chloride (LiCl) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) keratitis. METHODS: B6 mice were subconjunctivally injected with LiCl in contrast to appropriate control sodium chloride (NaCl), and then routinely infected with PA. Clinical score, slit-lamp photography, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and bacterial plate counts were used to determine the role of LiCl in PA keratitis. Messenger ribonucleic acid and protein levels of inflammatory cytokines in PA-challenged mouse corneas and in vitro cultured macrophages and neutrophils were measured with real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Apoptosis of the infiltrating inflammatory cells in the PA-infected murine corneas was assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated uridine 5′-triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling staining and propidium iodide staining associated with flow cytometry. In cultured murine macrophages and neutrophils, cell apoptosis was determined with annexin V/propidium iodide double staining associated with flow cytometry and western blot analysis for cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. RESULTS: Treatment with LiCl reduced the severity of corneal disease by reducing corneal inflammatory response and bacterial burden. Moreover, LiCl increased anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 levels, decreased proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α levels, and enhanced apoptosis of infiltrating macrophages and neutrophils in the PA-infected mouse corneas. In vitro studies further confirmed that LiCl elevated anti-inflammatory cytokine expression but reduced proinflammatory cytokine production, as well as promoted cell apoptosis in murine macrophages and neutrophils. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a protective role of LiCl in PA keratitis. LiCl promotes host resistance against PA infection by suppressing inflammatory responses, enhancing inflammatory cell apoptosis, and promoting bacterial clearance.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.055249679,-0.03003794,0.017807836,-0.12442741,-0.10746345300000001,0.063115897,0.029254152000000002,-0.037336729,0.048508752999999995,-0.051644557,-0.052282177,-0.033511677999999996,-0.023367497999999997,0.078060502,-0.022236507000000003,0.027622551000000002,-0.0027852470000000002,-0.046423833,-0.021911731,-0.026154935,0.020907881,-0.024710045,0.040275086,0.006327216,0.015390295,0.03104934,-0.017899296000000002,0.028944622000000003,0.02382449,-0.033785256
750,A Systematic Analysis of Host Factors Reveals a Med23-Interferon-λ Regulatory Axis against Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Replication,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a neurotropic virus causing vesicular oral or genital skin lesions, meningitis and other diseases particularly harmful in immunocompromised individuals. To comprehensively investigate the complex interaction between HSV-1 and its host we combined two genome-scale screens for host factors (HFs) involved in virus replication. A yeast two-hybrid screen for protein interactions and a RNA interference (RNAi) screen with a druggable genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) library confirmed existing and identified novel HFs which functionally influence HSV-1 infection. Bioinformatic analyses found the 358 HFs were enriched for several pathways and multi-protein complexes. Of particular interest was the identification of Med23 as a strongly anti-viral component of the largely pro-viral Mediator complex, which links specific transcription factors to RNA polymerase II. The anti-viral effect of Med23 on HSV-1 replication was confirmed in gain-of-function gene overexpression experiments, and this inhibitory effect was specific to HSV-1, as a range of other viruses including Vaccinia virus and Semliki Forest virus were unaffected by Med23 depletion. We found Med23 significantly upregulated expression of the type III interferon family (IFN-λ) at the mRNA and protein level by directly interacting with the transcription factor IRF7. The synergistic effect of Med23 and IRF7 on IFN-λ induction suggests this is the major transcription factor for IFN-λ expression. Genotypic analysis of patients suffering recurrent orofacial HSV-1 outbreaks, previously shown to be deficient in IFN-λ secretion, found a significant correlation with a single nucleotide polymorphism in the IFN-λ3 (IL28b) promoter strongly linked to Hepatitis C disease and treatment outcome. This paper describes a link between Med23 and IFN-λ, provides evidence for the crucial role of IFN-λ in HSV-1 immune control, and highlights the power of integrative genome-scale approaches to identify HFs critical for disease progression and outcome.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.11835052,-0.053495352999999995,-0.041374977,-0.035508887999999995,-0.095801449,0.035771002999999996,0.037132732,-0.008237145,0.031657599999999994,0.010641699,-0.023607116,-0.050087974,0.012857305,0.081821842,-0.020125853,-0.0060182709999999995,-0.0030705859999999997,-0.021124522000000003,-0.024858257999999998,0.036578324,0.009401474,0.01939985,-0.041143952000000004,0.024343994,-0.016011301999999998,-0.034769779,0.053778224000000006,-0.030852115,-0.015204552,0.00049873
751,Identification and Survey of a Novel Avian Coronavirus in Ducks,"The rapid discovery of novel viruses using next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies including DNA-Seq and RNA-Seq, has greatly expanded our understanding of viral diversity in recent years. The timely identification of novel viruses using NGS technologies is also important for us to control emerging infectious diseases caused by novel viruses. In this study, we identified a novel duck coronavirus (CoV), distinct with chicken infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), using RNA-Seq. The novel duck-specific CoV was a potential novel species within the genus Gammacoronavirus, as indicated by sequences of three regions in the viral 1b gene. We also performed a survey of CoVs in domestic fowls in China using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), targeting the viral nucleocapsid (N) gene. A total of 102 CoV positives were identified through the survey. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral N sequences suggested that CoVs in domestic fowls have diverged into several region-specific or host-specific clades or subclades in the world, and IBVs can infect ducks, geese and pigeons, although they mainly circulate in chickens. Moreover, this study provided novel data supporting the notion that some host-specific CoVs other than IBVs circulate in ducks, geese and pigeons, and indicated that the novel duck-specific CoV identified through RNA-Seq in this study is genetically closer to some CoVs circulating in wild water fowls. Taken together, this study shed new insight into the diversity, distribution, evolution and control of avian CoVs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.075451594,0.126303125,-0.00994696,0.040796646,0.170789744,0.086207961,0.091507095,0.04467402400000001,0.012291317,0.10040892900000001,-0.016752001000000002,-0.067058304,-0.006710644,0.032575521,-0.037174345,0.030856852999999997,-0.020833748,0.016054391,-0.025248892000000002,0.023704898999999998,-0.031845271,0.043816340999999995,-0.004663245,0.033141192,-0.021313448,-0.021550287,0.032958627000000004,-0.013207913,0.019017074,0.022733006

The full-length S genes of representative field strains were sequenced. 33 field strains share 93.5%–99.9% homologies with each other at the nucleotide sequence level and 92.3%–99.8% homologies with each other at the amino acids sequence level. Most field strains have nucleotide deletion and insertion regions, and show lower homologies (93.5%–94.2%) with Chinese classical strain CH/S, however higher homologies (97.1%–99.3%) with recent strain CHGD-1. The phylogenetic analysis showed there are classical strains and variants prevailing in pig herd in China. PEDV has a high detection rate in pig herds in China.

753,Defects in Base Excision Repair Sensitize Cells to Manganese in S. cerevisiae,"Manganese (Mn) is essential for normal physiologic functioning; therefore, deficiencies and excess intake of manganese can result in disease. In humans, prolonged exposure to manganese causes neurotoxicity characterized by Parkinson-like symptoms. Mn(2+) has been shown to mediate DNA damage possibly through the generation of reactive oxygen species. In a recent publication, we showed that Mn induced oxidative DNA damage and caused lesions in thymines. This study further investigates the mechanisms by which cells process Mn(2+)-mediated DNA damage using the yeast S. cerevisiae. The strains most sensitive to Mn(2+) were those defective in base excision repair, glutathione synthesis, and superoxide dismutase mutants. Mn(2+) caused a dose-dependent increase in the accumulation of mutations using the CAN1 and lys2-10A mutator assays. The spectrum of CAN1 mutants indicates that exposure to Mn results in accumulation of base substitutions and frameshift mutations. The sensitivity of cells to Mn(2+) as well as its mutagenic effect was reduced by N-acetylcysteine, glutathione, and Mg(2+). These data suggest that Mn(2+) causes oxidative DNA damage that requires base excision repair for processing and that Mn interferes with polymerase fidelity. The status of base excision repair may provide a biomarker for the sensitivity of individuals to manganese.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.07065258099999999,-0.020055318,0.023724496,-0.061451107000000005,-0.041645036,0.028156611,0.040674381,-0.006197202,0.0061303090000000005,-0.0122296,-0.002114786,0.024997451,-0.031603908,-0.016767802,-0.000775513,0.047667204000000005,-0.033782552,-0.017218845,-0.042461078,-0.024730347000000003,0.031243736,-0.037629416,-0.004580852,0.016164214,-0.004216949,-0.004073136,-0.04765863,0.025589652,-0.005517355,-0.053529007999999996
756,Diagnosis and treatment of viral diseases in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,"Viral infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic stem cell hematopoietic transplantation (allo-HSCT). Although most viral infections present with asymptomatic or subclinical manifestations, viruses may result in fatal complications in severe immunocompromised recipients. Reactivation of latent viruses, such as herpesviruses, is frequent during the immunosuppression that occurs with allo-HSCT. Viruses acquired from community, such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses, are also important pathogens of post-transplant viral diseases. Currently, molecular diagnostic methods have replaced or supplemented traditional methods, such as viral culture and antigen detection, in diagnosis of viral infections. The utilization of polymerase chain reaction facilitates the early diagnosis. In view of lacking efficacious agents for treatment of viral diseases, prevention of viral infections is extremely valuable. Application of prophylactic strategies including preemptive therapy reduces viral infections and diseases.

759,Presence of infectious agents and co-infections in diarrheic dogs determined with a real-time polymerase chain reaction-based panel,"BACKGROUND: Infectious diarrhea can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or protozoan organisms, or a combination of these. The identification of co-infections in dogs is important to determine the prognosis and to plan strategies for their treatment and prophylaxis. Although many pathogens have been individually detected with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a comprehensive panel of agents that cause diarrhea in privately owned dogs has not yet been established. The objective of this study was to use a real-time PCR diarrhea panel to survey the frequencies of pathogens and co-infections in owned dogs attended in a veterinary hospital with and without diarrhea, as well the frequency in different countries. Feces samples were tested for canine distemper virus, canine coronavirus, canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin (CPA), Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., and Salmonella spp. using molecular techniques. RESULTS: In total, 104 diarrheic and 43 control dogs that were presented consecutively at a major private veterinary hospital were included in the study. Overall, 71/104 (68.3%) dogs with diarrhea were positive for at least one pathogen: a single infection in 39/71 dogs (54.9%) and co-infections in 32/71 dogs (45.1%), including 21/32 dogs (65.6%) with dual, 5/32 (15.6%) with triple, and 6/32 (18.8%) with quadruple infections. In the control group, 13/43 (30.2%) dogs were positive, all with single infections only. The most prevalent pathogens in the diarrheic dogs were CPA (40/104 dogs, 38.5%), CPV-2 (36/104 dogs, 34.6%), and Giardia spp. (14/104 dogs, 13.5%). CPV-2 was the most prevalent pathogen in the dual co-infections, associated with CPA, Cryptosporidium spp., or Giardia spp. No statistical difference (P = 0.8374) was observed in the duration of diarrhea or the number of deaths (P = 0.5722) in the presence or absence of single or co-infections. CONCLUSIONS: Diarrheic dogs showed a higher prevalence of pathogen infections than the controls. Whereas the healthy dogs had only single infections, about half the diarrheic dogs had co-infections. Therefore, multiple pathogens should be investigated in dogs presenting with diarrhea. The effects of multiple pathogens on the disease outcomes remain unclear because the rate of death and the duration of diarrhea did not seem to be affected by these factors.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.060074442,-0.028730717000000003,0.06340847200000001,-0.10340211699999999,0.027386682000000002,-0.00021674299999999998,0.050098779,-0.0031078209999999998,-0.030920807999999998,0.011057678,0.052347566,0.03715459,-0.039137415,-0.066309357,0.12390376,-0.066289345,-0.034198424,-0.056444278,0.10979719800000001,-0.014209211000000001,0.16196956699999998,0.103960241,-0.105902784,-0.036674285,0.193873,-0.162196154,-0.108638319,-0.057022574000000006,-0.00301939,0.071423796
763,Emergence of Enteric Viruses in Production Chickens Is a Concern for Avian Health,"Several viruses have been identified in recent years in the intestinal contents of chickens and turkeys with enteric problems, which have been observed in commercial farms worldwide, including Brazil. Molecular detection of these viruses in Brazil can transform to a big threat for poultry production due to risk for intestinal integrity. This disease is characterized by severely delayed growth, low uniformity, lethargy, watery diarrhea, delayed feed consumption, and a decreased conversion rate. Chicken astrovirus (CAstV), rotavirus, reovirus, chicken parvovirus (ChPV), fowl adenovirus of subgroup I (FAdV-1), and avian nephritis virus (ANV) were investigated using the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which may play a role in enteric disease, was included. The viruses most frequently detected, either alone or in concomitance with other viruses, were IBV, ANV, rotavirus, and CAstV followed by parvovirus, reovirus, and adenovirus.

765,Recent developments in antiviral agents against enterovirus 71 infection,"Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is the main etiological agent of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). Recent EV-71 outbreaks in Asia-Pacific were not limited to mild HFMD, but were associated with severe neurological complications such as aseptic meningitis and brainstem encephalitis, which may lead to cardiopulmonary failure and death. The absence of licensed therapeutics for clinical use has intensified research into anti-EV-71 development. This review highlights the potential antiviral agents targeting EV-71 attachment, entry, uncoating, translation, polyprotein processing, virus-induced formation of membranous RNA replication complexes, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The strategies for antiviral development include target-based synthetic compounds, anti-rhinovirus and poliovirus libraries screening, and natural compound libraries screening. Growing knowledge of the EV-71 life cycle will lead to successful development of antivirals. The continued effort to develop antiviral agents for treatment is crucial in the absence of a vaccine.

Although several genes are commonly used as reference genes (such as GAPDH, ACTB, and 18S rRNA), they are also regulated and can be expressed at varying levels. In this study, we evaluated twelve well-known reference genes to identify the most suitable housekeeping gene for normalization of qRT-PCR in human lumbar vertebral endplate with Modic changes, by using the geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper algorithms. Our results showed that the rarely-used SDHA was the most stable single reference gene, and a combination of three, SDHA, B2M, and LDHA, was the most suitable gene set for normalization in all samples. In addition, the commonly-used genes, GAPDH, ACTB and 18S rRNA, were all inappropriate as internal standards. The rankings of reference genes for the three types of Modic change differed, although SDHA and RPL13A uniformly ranked in the first and last position, respectively. Further simulated expression analysis validated that the arbitrary use of a reference gene could lead to the misinterpretation of data. Our study confirmed the necessity of exploring the expression stability of potential reference genes in each specific tissue and experimental situation before quantitative evaluation of gene expression by qRT-PCR.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.050095045,0.016539329,0.104946626,-0.104723792,0.00968294,0.035889145,-0.039012896,-0.051616125,0.052431041,-0.036233454,-0.12113943,-0.055120629000000004,0.006255406,0.070877803,-0.028473726,-0.056019265,0.00014131299999999998,-0.07161816900000001,-0.043059865,-0.147212911,0.071638649,0.00731793,0.049754756,0.029857365,-0.143438392,-0.065403164,0.069150393,0.028056544,0.09030018699999999,-0.02925475
769,Rapid PCR/ESI-MS-based molecular genotyping of Staphylococcus aureus from nasal swabs of emergency department patients,"BACKGROUND: A limitation of both culture-based and molecular methods of screening for staphylococcal infection is that current tests determine only the presence or absence of colonization with no information on the colonizing strain type. A technique that couples polymerase chain reaction to mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) has recently been developed and an assay validated to identify and genotype S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). METHODS: This study was conducted to determine the rates, risk factors, and molecular genotypes of colonizing Staphylococcus aureus in adult patients presenting to an inner-city academic emergency department. Participants completed a structured questionnaire to assess hospital and community risks for infection with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Nasal swabs were analyzed by PCR/ESI-MS to identify and genotype S. aureus and CoNS. RESULTS: Of 200 patients evaluated, 59 were colonized with S. aureus; 27 of these were methicillin-resistant strains. Twenty-four of the 59 S. aureus carriers were co-colonized with a CoNS and 140 of the 200 patients were colonized exclusively with CoNS. The molecular genotypes of the 59 S. aureus strains were diverse; 21 unique molecular genotypes belonging to seven major clonal complexes were identified. Eighty-five of 200 patients carried strains with high-level mupirocin resistance. Of these eighty-five participants, 4 were colonized exclusively with S. aureus, 16 were co-colonized with S. aureus and CoNS, and 65 were colonized exclusively with CoNS. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus colonization in a random sample of patients seeking care in Emergency Department was 29.5% and 13.5%, respectively. A substantial fraction of the S. aureus-colonized patients were co-colonized with CoNS and high-level mupirocin-resistant CoNS. Determining the molecular genotype of S. aureus during intake screening may prove valuable in the future if certain molecular genotypes become associated with increased infection risk.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.042197154,-0.015009325,0.01499391,-0.095121662,-0.017377288,0.012418776000000001,-0.001545274,0.036990546,-0.061403012,0.026521372,-0.021706046,0.061869325999999995,-0.008820754,-0.0055731059999999995,-0.017107438,0.014679303999999999,-0.013549238,0.023373834,-0.0015286289999999999,-0.025996472000000003,0.025088281,-0.01831733,0.023658617000000003,0.000552135,0.007394899999999999,-0.026132017999999996,0.008127968000000001,-0.025169814,-0.020765617,0.010152359
770,Transcriptome Analysis of the Initial Stage of Acute WSSV Infection Caused by Temperature Change,"White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is the most devastating virosis threatening the shrimp culture industry worldwide. Variations of environmental factors in shrimp culture ponds usually lead to the outbreak of white spot syndrome (WSS). In order to know the molecular mechanisms of WSS outbreak induced by temperature variation and the biological changes of the host at the initial stage of WSSV acute infection, RNA-Seq technology was used to analyze the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in shrimp with a certain amount of WSSV cultured at 18°C and shrimp whose culture temperature were raised to 25°C. To analyze whether the expression changes of the DEGs were due to temperature rising or WSSV proliferation, the expression of selected DEGs was analyzed by real-time PCR with another shrimp group, namely Group T, as control. Group T didn’t suffer WSSV infection but was subjected to temperature rising in parallel. At the initial stage of WSSV acute infection, DEGs related to energy production were up-regulated, whereas most DEGs related to cell cycle and positive regulation of cell death and were down-regulated. Triose phosphate isomerase, enolase and alcohol dehydrogenase involved in glycosis were up-regulated, while pyruvate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase with NAD as the coenzyme involved in TCA pathway were down-regulated. Also genes involved in host DNA replication, including DNA primase, DNA topoisomerase and DNA polymerase showed down-regulated expression. Several interesting genes including crustin genes, acting binding or inhibiting protein genes, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 9 (ADAM9) gene and a GRP 78 gene were also analyzed. Understanding the interactions between hosts and WSSV at the initial stage of acute infection will not only help to get a deep insight into the pathogenesis of WSSV but also provide clues for therapies.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.068980258,-0.007666204,0.003399525,-0.091239697,-0.044671018,0.039174689,0.027704053,-0.025196506,0.033690357000000004,-0.015835731000000002,-0.071805162,-0.037257238,0.000403698,0.042989762,-0.017667281,-0.005683238,-0.010009968000000001,-0.047666176,-0.03209826,-0.027343831000000002,0.019855859,-0.00357455,-0.016358143000000002,-0.010338753000000001,-0.080550071,-0.042298725999999995,-0.0020164239999999997,0.029209366,0.011146359,-0.036488087999999995
771,"Prevalence and correlates of influenza-a in piggery workers and pigs in two communities in Lagos, Nigeria","INTRODUCTION: Worldwide, three Influenza-A virus subtypes (H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2) in swine are major public health issues. In Nigeria, the existence of these subtypes in pigs has not been well studied. This study aimed at determining the prevalence and correlates of Influenza-A viruses circulating in piggery workers and pigs in Oke-aro and Goshen communities in Lagos, Nigeria. METHODS: Nasal swabs were taken from 197 consenting piggery workers and 281 randomly selected pigs to determine the prevalence of Influenza-A (H1, H3, H5) using Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction test (gene M). An interviewer administered questionnaire was used to collect information on demography, Influenza-A related symptoms experienced, personal hygiene and management practices from the piggery workers. Descriptive statistics was used and chi square test performed at 5% significant level. RESULTS: All piggery workers and pigs’ nasal swabs tested negative for Influenza-A viruses, hence, association could not be tested. Mean age of piggery workers was 41 ± 13.6 years and 60% were females. Forty two percent were farm attendants, 38.0% were pig farmers and the rest butchers. Nineteen percent had history of headache; 14.0% had catarrh and cough; 4.0% had sore-throat; 5.0% had diarrhea; while 48.0% had muscle pain at the time of data collection. The mean body temperature for the pig workers was 36.5 ± 0.5 °C. A significant difference (p<0.05) existed among piggery workers who had muscle pains. CONCLUSION: Piggery workers and pigs in study area were free of Influenza-A (H1, H3, H5) viruses.

773,Amino acid changes in the spike protein of feline coronavirus correlate with systemic spread of virus from the intestine and not with feline infectious peritonitis,"Recent evidence suggests that a mutation in the spike protein gene of feline coronavirus (FCoV), which results in an amino acid change from methionine to leucine at position 1058, may be associated with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Tissue and faecal samples collected post mortem from cats diagnosed with or without FIP were subjected to RNA extraction and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to detect FCoV RNA. In cats with FIP, 95% of tissue, and 81% of faecal samples were PCR-positive, as opposed to 22% of tissue, and 60% of faecal samples in cats without FIP. Relative FCoV copy numbers were significantly higher in the cats with FIP, both in tissues (P < 0.001) and faeces (P = 0.02). PCR-positive samples underwent pyrosequencing encompassing position 1058 of the FCoV spike protein. This identified a methionine codon at position 1058, consistent with the shedding of an enteric form of FCoV, in 77% of the faecal samples from cats with FIP, and in 100% of the samples from cats without FIP. In contrast, 91% of the tissue samples from cats with FIP and 89% from cats without FIP had a leucine codon at position 1058, consistent with a systemic form of FCoV. These results suggest that the methionine to leucine substitution at position 1058 in the FCoV spike protein is indicative of systemic spread of FCoV from the intestine, rather than a virus with the potential to cause FIP.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.039650706,0.007218958,0.09129678699999999,-0.17457762,0.040077476,0.007817914,0.007857051,-0.014499686999999999,-0.05759841,-0.18410475399999998,0.47110033,-0.143331676,0.231303724,-0.036069252999999996,-0.139757109,-0.071221983,0.08321372099999999,-0.013926133,0.004657903,0.055718378,-0.048184979,-0.007714954,0.055546653,0.036545866,-0.032688661,0.047874545,0.002971655,0.008021571,0.020096001999999998,-0.024363773
775,Haemoproteus iwa in Great Frigatebirds (Fregata minor) in the Islands of the Western Indian Ocean,"Blood parasites of the sub-genus Haemoproteus have been reported in seabirds, in particular in species in the Suliformes order. These parasites are transmitted by hippoboscid flies of the genus Olfersia; strong specificity has been suggested between the vector and its vertebrate host. We investigated the prevalence of Haemoproteus infection in Suliformes and hippoboscid flies in two oceanic islands of the Western Indian Ocean: Europa and Tromelin. In total, 209 blood samples were collected from great frigatebirds (Fregata minor), masked boobies (Sula dactylatra) and red-footed boobies (Sula sula). Forty-one hippoboscid flies were also collected from birds. Seventeen frigatebirds and one fly collected on Europa tested positive for the presence of Haemoproteus parasites by polymerase chain reaction. Phylogenetic analyses based on partial sequences of the Cytochrome b gene showed that parasites were closely related to Haemoproteus iwa reported from frigatebirds in the Pacific Ocean and in the Caribbean. Plasmodium was also detected in a frigatebird on Europa; however, its placement on the phylogenetic tree could not be resolved. We provide strong support for transmission of blood parasites in seabirds in the Western Indian Ocean and suggest that migrations between the Pacific and the Indian oceans could favor the large-scale distribution of Haemoproteus iwa in frigatebird populations.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.026167867,-0.006364934,0.024767415,-0.08975934699999999,0.077341593,0.048817397,0.05567069400000001,0.013559947,-0.01616207,-0.02851509,0.00172359,-0.0040473620000000005,-0.008641302,-0.009490113,0.000979288,0.004319956,-0.008612473,-0.015515498999999999,0.002472951,-0.027727356,0.012189486999999999,0.017014617,-0.031843388,-0.003422986,0.003907575999999999,-0.004129056,-0.022002421,0.015361285,-0.013216658999999999,-9.39e-05
780,RIG-I Enhanced Interferon Independent Apoptosis upon Junin Virus Infection,"Junin virus (JUNV) is the etiological agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF), a human disease with a high case-fatality rate. It is widely accepted that arenaviral infections, including JUNV infections, are generally non-cytopathic. In contrast, here we demonstrated apoptosis induction in human lung epithelial carcinoma (A549), human hepatocarcinoma and Vero cells upon infection with the attenuated Candid#1 strain of, JUNV as determined by phosphatidylserine (PS) translocation, Caspase 3 (CASP3) activation, Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and/or chromosomal DNA fragmentation. Moreover, as determined by DNA fragmentation, we found that the pathogenic Romero strain of JUNV was less cytopathic than Candid#1 in human hepatocarcinoma and Vero, but more apoptotic in A549 and Vero E6 cells. Additionally, we found that JUNV-induced apoptosis was enhanced by RIG-I signaling. Consistent with the previously reported role of RIG-I like helicase (RLH) signaling in initiating programmed cell death, we showed that cell death or DNA fragmentation of Candid#1-infected A549 cells was decreased upon siRNA or shRNA silencing of components of RIG-I pathway in spite of increased virus production. Similarly, we observed decreased DNA fragmentation in JUNV-infected human hepatocarcinoma cells deficient for RIG-I when compared with that of RIG-I-competent cells. In addition, DNA fragmentation detected upon Candid#1 infection of type I interferon (IFN)-deficient Vero cells suggested a type I IFN-independent mechanism of apoptosis induction in response to JUNV. Our work demonstrated for the first time apoptosis induction in various cells of mammalian origin in response to JUNV infection and partial mechanism of this cell death.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.07855668,-0.041306947000000004,-0.010439702,-0.112081164,-0.09226406,0.075797608,0.052932238,-0.069745967,0.10397244300000001,-0.007376014,-0.0500415,-0.04957013,0.01412182,0.11216589099999999,0.011449983,0.030841808,-0.037572238,-0.045990232,0.0026333790000000004,0.030041843,0.075090182,0.016368,0.03116419,0.013249823,0.014868066999999999,0.023901497999999997,-0.069740678,0.095927739,-0.073012646,-0.064951121
786,Involvement of the ERK pathway in the protective effects of glycyrrhizic acid against the MPP(+)-induced apoptosis of dopaminergic neuronal cells,"Glycyrrhizic acid (GA), a major compound separated from Radix Glycyrrhizae, has been shwon to exert various biochemical effects, including neuroprotective effects. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of GA against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-induced damage to differentiated PC12 (DPC12) cells. Compared with the MPP(+)-treated cells, GA markedly improved cell viability, restored mitochondrial dysfunction, suppressed the overexpression of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and suppressed the overproduction of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and intracellular Ca(2+) overload. The protective effects of GA on cell survival were further confirmed in primary cortical neurons. GA markedly increased the expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), as well as its migration from the cytoplasm to nucleus. PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK, blocked GA-enhanced ERK activation and reduced cell viability. However, pre-treatment with GA had no effects on the expression of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) and total AKT (t-AKT). These results indicate that the GA-mediated neuroprotective effects are associated with its modulation of multiple anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic factors, particularly the ERK signaling pathway. This study provides evidence supporting the use of GA as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and neuronal injury.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.066394347,-0.030189436,-0.008370424,-0.11525957199999999,-0.098383579,0.06597520700000001,0.04127929,-0.032837168,0.051789496,-0.030693757999999998,-0.043857352999999995,-0.009840616,-0.016718192,0.048828830999999996,-0.001822176,0.029483215,-0.006425963000000001,-0.020940796,-0.012637727,-0.022234608,0.011396065,-0.012236992,0.006598626,-0.022597133999999998,0.020130909,0.005436105,-0.021754389,0.026477371,0.021681626000000002,-0.04982667599999999
790,Association of Cytokines in Individuals Sensitive and Insensitive to Dust Mites in a Brazilian Population,"INTRODUCTION: Allergic reaction to dust mites is a relatively common condition among children, triggering cutaneous and respiratory responses that have a great impact on the health of this population. Anaphylactic hypersensitivity is characterized by an exacerbated response involving the production of regulatory cytokines responsible for stimulating the production of IgE antibodies. OBJECTIVE: To investigate an association of variants in cytokine genes (IL1A (−889), IL1B (−511, +3962), IL1R (1970), IL1RA (11100), IL4RA (+1902), IL12 (−1188), IFNG (+874), TGFB1 (codon 10, codon 25), TNFA (−308, −238), IL2 (−330, +166), IL4 (−1098, −590, −33), IL6 (−174, nt565), and IL10 (−1082, −819, −592)) between patients sensitive to dust mites and a control group. METHODS: A total of 254 patients were grouped as atopic and non-atopic according to sensitivity as evaluated by the Prick Test and to cytokine genotyping by the polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP) method using the Cytokine Genotyping Kit. RESULTS: A comparison between individuals allergic to Dermatophagoides farinae, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, and Blomia tropicalis and a non-atopic control group showed significant differences between allele and genotype frequencies in the regulatory regions of cytokine genes, with important evidence for IL4 (−590) in T/C (10.2% vs. 43.1%, odd ratio [OR] = 0.15, p = 5.2 10(−8), pc = 0.0000011, and 95% confidence interval [95%CI] = 0.07–0.32) and T/T genotypes (42.9% vs. 13.8%, OR = 4.69, p = 2.5 10(−6), pc = 0.000055, and 95%CI = 2.42–9.09). Other associations were observed in the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1A (−889) (T/T, C, and T) and IL2 (−330) (G/T and T/T) and the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL4RA (+1902) (A and G), IL4 (−590) (T/C, T/T, C, and T), and IL10 (−592) (A/A, C/A, A, and C).

791,"Docetaxel induces moderate ovarian toxicity in mice, primarily affecting granulosa cells of early growing follicles","Advances in cancer therapy have focused attention on the quality of life of cancer survivors. Since infertility is a major concern following chemotherapy, it is important to characterize the drug-specific damage to the reproductive system to help find appropriate protective strategies. This study investigates the damage on neonatal mouse ovary maintained in vitro for 6 days, and exposed for 24 h (on Day 2) to clinically relevant doses of Docetaxel (DOC; low: 0.1 µM, mid: 1 µM, high: 10 µM). Furthermore, the study explores the putative protective action exerted by Tri-iodothyronine (T3; 10(−7) M). At the end of culture, morphological analyses and follicle counts showed that DOC negatively impacts on early growing follicles, decreasing primary follicle number and severely affecting health at the transitional and primary stages. Poor follicle health was mainly due to effects on granulosa cells, indicating that the effects of DOC on oocytes were likely to be secondary to granulosa cell damage. DOC damages growing follicles specifically, with no direct effect on the primordial follicle reserve. Immunostaining and western blotting showed that DOC induces activation of intrinsic, type II apoptosis in ovarian somatic cells; increasing the levels of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 8, Bax and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, while also inducing movement of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol. T3 did not prevent the damage induced by the low dose of DOC. These results demonstrated that DOC induces a gonadotoxic effect on the mouse ovary through induction of somatic cell apoptosis, with no evidence of direct effects on the oocyte, and that the damaging effect is not mitigated by T3.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.06783368,-0.028723406,-0.004965837,-0.114079474,-0.09730547199999999,0.067886306,0.035166908999999996,-0.036960326,0.052842312,-0.018070225,-0.044194868,-0.022575377999999997,-0.021183782,0.046804167,0.007867024,0.030747436,-0.022115543999999997,-0.000135361,0.016016945,-0.0077098309999999995,0.0162395,-0.010221785,0.015234435,-0.016329653,0.032057065,0.025860152,-0.033022752999999995,0.041784447,0.008043782,-0.076357729
793,A novel porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus vector system that stably expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein as a separate transcription unit,"Here we report the rescue of a recombinant porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) carrying an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene as a separate transcription unit. A copy of the transcription regulatory sequence for ORF6 (TRS6) was inserted between the N protein and 3′-UTR to drive the transcription of the EGFP gene and yield a general purpose expression vector. Successful recovery of PRRSV was obtained using an RNA polymerase II promoter to drive transcription of the full-length virus genome, which was assembled in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). The recombinant virus showed growth replication characteristics similar to those of the wild-type virus in the infected cells. In addition, the recombinant virus stably expressed EGFP for at least 10 passages. EGFP expression was detected at approximately 10 h post infection by live-cell imaging to follow the virus spread in real time and the infection of neighbouring cells occurred predominantly through cell-to-cell-contact. Finally, the recombinant virus generated was found to be an excellent tool for neutralising antibodies and antiviral compound screening. The newly established reverse genetics system for PRRSV could be a useful tool not only to monitor virus spread and screen for neutralising antibodies and antiviral compounds, but also for fundamental research on the biology of the virus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.113013031,-0.04398998,0.007701756999999999,-0.010090581999999999,-0.052296869,0.029967712,-0.053498427,-0.058390555,0.09414227800000001,0.009087443,-0.06908307799999999,-0.111524046,0.01506324,0.122778291,0.06644406,-0.074213234,0.022543683,-0.049375977,0.016800682,0.080825871,0.018362911000000003,0.004361373,0.07032840900000001,-0.006102420999999999,0.00732152,0.086283019,0.074268755,-0.0037106979999999997,-0.12738364,0.062050707000000004
796,Verifying the Stability of Selected Genes for Normalization in Q PCR Experiments of Spodoptera frugiperda Cells during AcMNPV Infection,"It is challenging to find genes with stable transcripts for use as reference genes for quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) during viral infection. Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) is known to globally shut off host gene transcription in Sf21 cells and to modify their cytoskeletons. In this study, seven host genes were selected for validation as references for gene expression experiments using qRT-PCR. Two of them, ecdysoneless (ECD) and myosin showed stable RNA levels in our previous microarray study at 6, 12, and 24 hpi for both genes and 48 hpi for ECD. The others, actin, tubulin, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and 28S ribosome (28S), are commonly employed as reference genes for qRT-PCR. Ribosomal protein L35 (L35) gene was selected to test if ribosomal protein genes show stable RNA transcript levels similar to 28S and 18S rRNA and to validate the microarray data. In addition to 28S, previously known to have stable transcript levels, qRT-PCR showed that ECD transcript levels remained constant throughout the time course of AcMNPV infection. Transcripts of cytoskeleton genes such as actin, tubulin, and myosin declined dramatically as the infection progressed. GAPDH and L35 transcripts also declined over time. These results indicate that ECD is a reliable reference gene for qRT-PCR experiments during AcMNPV infection of Spodoptera frugiperda cells. Although 28S could be used as a reference gene for these experiments, it is less useful than ECD because of its abundance, which might make it difficult to establish an accurate baseline value for data analysis.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.075867329,-0.001529846,0.062784432,-0.077370122,-0.003599707,0.01156125,-0.039218203,-0.026552079,0.041715587,-0.02548931,-0.085899865,-0.080217072,0.009606476999999999,0.102172039,-0.016726726,-0.039700112,0.015358793999999999,-0.058578498,-0.042709012000000005,-0.111502752,0.044131475,0.021343404,0.023973893,0.00403813,-0.12256229099999999,-0.055194524,0.076450546,-0.000210285,0.076017677,0.002021656
797,Cryptosporidiosis caused by Cryptosporidium parvum subtype IIdA15G1 at a dairy farm in Northwestern China,"BACKGROUND: Cryptosporidium spp. are zoonotic parasites responsible for diarrhoeal diseases in animals and humans worldwide. Cattle are the most common mammalian species in which Cryptosporidium is detected, with pre-weaned calves considered to be reservoirs for zoonotic C. parvum. In October 2013, severe diarrhoea was observed in 396 pre-weaned calves at a farm in the Ningxia Autonomous Region of Northwestern China. 356 of the infected calves died despite antibiotic therapy. FINDINGS: 252 faecal samples were collected from the investigated farm. The identity of Cryptosporidium species was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, and by DNA sequence analysis of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene. C. parvum was subtyped using sequence analysis of the 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene. The highest infection rate of 83.3% (40/48) was seen in 2–3-week-old calves with diarrhoea, corresponding to the age at which animals died. Three Cryptosporidium species were identified, including C. parvum (n = 51), C. bovis (n = 1), and C. ryanae (n = 1). All C. parvum isolates were further identified as subtype IIdA15G1. CONCLUSIONS: Cryptosporidium parvum was likely to be most responsible for diarrhoea and death. This is the first report of a cryptosporidiosis outbreak caused by C. parvum IIdA15G1 in Chinese dairy cattle.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.025127932999999998,-0.003704945,0.031971636,-0.122001706,0.078136397,0.038621194,0.022752728,-0.0009708130000000001,-0.024215483,-0.040806300000000004,-0.007833475,0.023210847000000003,-0.033553124,-0.045584732999999995,0.038031215,-0.025082307,-0.025819886,0.005859909,0.000627366,-0.033964296,0.024951212,0.013926801,-0.047963194,-0.0014779510000000001,0.025285264,-0.041578229,-0.026908382,-0.056218674,0.016142704,-0.00201898
798,A Novel Psittacine Adenovirus Identified During an Outbreak of Avian Chlamydiosis and Human Psittacosis: Zoonosis Associated with Virus-Bacterium Coinfection in Birds,"Chlamydophila psittaci is found worldwide, but is particularly common among psittacine birds in tropical and subtropical regions. While investigating a human psittacosis outbreak that was associated with avian chlamydiosis in Hong Kong, we identified a novel adenovirus in epidemiologically linked Mealy Parrots, which was not present in healthy birds unrelated to the outbreak or in other animals. The novel adenovirus (tentatively named Psittacine adenovirus HKU1) was most closely related to Duck adenovirus A in the Atadenovirus genus. Sequencing showed that the Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 genome consists of 31,735 nucleotides. Comparative genome analysis showed that the Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 genome contains 23 open reading frames (ORFs) with sequence similarity to known adenoviral genes, and six additional ORFs at the 3′ end of the genome. Similar to Duck adenovirus A, the novel adenovirus lacks LH1, LH2 and LH3, which distinguishes it from other viruses in the Atadenovirus genus. Notably, fiber-2 protein, which is present in Aviadenovirus but not Atadenovirus, is also present in Psittacine adenovirus HKU1. Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 had pairwise amino acid sequence identities of 50.3–54.0% for the DNA polymerase, 64.6–70.7% for the penton protein, and 66.1–74.0% for the hexon protein with other Atadenovirus. The C. psittaci bacterial load was positively correlated with adenovirus viral load in the lung. Immunostaining for fiber protein expression was positive in lung and liver tissue cells of affected parrots, confirming active viral replication. No other viruses were found. This is the first documentation of an adenovirus-C. psittaci co-infection in an avian species that was associated with a human outbreak of psittacosis. Viral-bacterial co-infection often increases disease severity in both humans and animals. The role of viral-bacterial co-infection in animal-to-human transmission of infectious agents has not received sufficient attention and should be emphasized in the investigation of disease outbreaks in human and animals.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.033228586000000004,-0.050253442,-0.03110709,-0.055641154000000005,0.088393184,0.0014842660000000001,0.035905007,-0.012531189,0.014782122,0.021976361,-0.08390982400000001,-0.027079555,0.074645554,-0.024572706,0.0016410829999999998,-0.09293566800000001,-0.027254077999999998,-0.02632419,-0.003751139,-0.004302659,0.025469878999999997,0.13475262400000002,-0.049499398,0.056662752999999996,-0.076759305,0.013976746000000002,0.029598408,0.07518338,-0.070954974,-0.010656187
799,Molecular detection and genotypic characterization of Toxoplasma gondii infection in bats in four provinces of China,"BACKGROUND: Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan parasite that infects a wide variety of warm-blooded hosts, including humans. Limited information about T. gondii infection in bats is available in China. The objective of the present study was to determine prevalence and genetic characterization of T. gondii infection in bats in Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangxi and Guangdong provinces, China. METHODS: During May 2005 to August 2013, bats were sampled from Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces, China, and liver tissues were collected for the detection of T. gondii by a nested PCR targeting the B1 gene. The positive samples were genotyped at 11 genetic markers (SAG1, 5′-and 3′-SAG2, alternative SAG2, SAG3, BTUB, GRA6, L358, PK1, c22-8, c29-2, and Apico) using multilocus polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: A total of 626 bats representing 10 species were examined for T. gondii infection, 38 (6.1%) were tested positive with by PCR, 8 positive DNA samples were completely genotyped, of which 3 samples (2 from Cynopterus sphinx, and 1 from Murina leucogaster) represented ToxoDB#10, and 5 samples (2 from Murina leucogaster, 2 from Myotis chinensis, and 1 from Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) belonged to ToxoDB#9 (http://toxodb.org/toxo/). CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed an overall T. gondii prevalence of 6.1% in bats from Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangxi and Guangdong provinces in China, and reported two T. gondii genotypes (ToxoDB#9 and #10) having a wide geographical distribution in China. These results provide new genetic information about T. gondii infection in bats, and have implications for better understanding of the genetic diversity of T. gondii in China and elsewhere.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.00300615,0.03254554,0.039096278,-0.077469596,0.16348289800000002,0.073781499,0.131824739,0.030723137,-0.07789002,-0.045331999000000005,-0.02017417,-0.033427382,-0.051353852,0.041879638,0.014901798,0.028070301000000002,-0.014925974,0.030258208999999998,0.016826161,-0.040932552000000004,-0.0021288279999999997,0.026354805,-0.012591193,-0.078529652,0.002773247,0.014145421000000002,-0.005385555,0.034097248999999996,-0.011874178,0.016949876000000003
806,Novel adenovirus detected in captive bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) suffering from self-limiting gastroenteritis,"BACKGROUND: Adenoviruses are common pathogens in vertebrates, including humans. In marine mammals, adenovirus has been associated with fatal hepatitis in sea lions. However, only in rare cases have adenoviruses been detected in cetaceans, where no clear correlation was found between presence of the virus and disease status. CASE PRESENTATION: A novel adenovirus was identified in four captive bottlenose dolphins with self-limiting gastroenteritis. Viral detection and identification were achieved by: PCR-amplification from fecal samples; sequencing of partial adenovirus polymerase (pol) and hexon genes; producing the virus in HeLa cells, with PCR and immunofluorescence detection, and with sequencing of the amplified pol and hexon gene fragments. A causative role of this adenovirus for gastroenteritis was suggested by: 1) we failed to identify other potential etiological agents; 2) the exclusive detection of this novel adenovirus and of seropositivity for canine adenoviruses 1 and 2 in the four sick dolphins, but not in 10 healthy individuals of the same captive population; and 3) the virus disappeared from feces after clinical signs receded. The partial sequences of the amplified fragments of the pol and hexon genes were closest to those of adenoviruses identified in sea lions with fatal adenoviral hepatitis, and to a Genbank-deposited sequence obtained from a harbour porpoise. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that adenovirus can cause self-limiting gastroenteritis in dolphins. This adenoviral infection can be detected by serology and by PCR detection in fecal material. Lack of signs of hepatitis in sick dolphins may reflect restricted tissue tropism or virulence of this adenovirus compared to those of the adenovirus identified in sea lions. Gene sequence-based phylogenetic analysis supports a common origin of adenoviruses that affect sea mammals. Our findings suggest the need for vigilance against adenoviruses in captive and wild dolphin populations.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.004439537,-0.021673944,0.066364719,-0.049742655999999996,0.069629429,0.003801303,0.032479838999999996,-0.006745889000000001,-0.012067863,0.00804822,-0.039463053,-0.042993677,0.017982045,-0.029464695,0.036994422,-0.0452286,-0.030046445,-0.028136051000000002,0.00387258,-0.063333877,0.062047221,0.107746824,-0.011685896000000001,0.054981467,-0.013956772,-0.018378315,0.005161486,0.076989403,-0.059188736,-0.018603675
807,Bovine Rhinitis Viruses Are Common in U.S. Cattle with Bovine Respiratory Disease,"Bovine rhinitis viruses (BRV) are established etiological agents of bovine respiratory disease complex however little research into their epidemiology and ecology has been published for several decades. In the U.S., only bovine rhinitis A virus 1 (BRAV1) has been identified while bovine rhinitis A virus 2 (BRAV2) and bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) were previously only identified in England and Japan, respectively. Metagenomic sequencing of a nasal swab from a bovine respiratory disease (BRD) diagnostic submission from Kansas identified contigs with approximately 90% nucleotide similarity to BRAV2 and BRBV. A combination of de novo and templated assemblies using reference genomes yielded near complete BRAV2 and BRBV genomes. The near complete genome of bovine rhinitis A virus 1 (BRAV1) was also determined from a historical isolate to enable further molecular epidemiological studies. A 5’-nuclease reverse transcription PCR assay targeting the 3D polymerase gene was designed and used to screen 204 archived BRD clinical specimens. Thirteen (6.4%) were positive. Metagenomic sequencing of six positive samples identified mixed BRAV1/BRAV2, BRAV1/BRBV and BRAV2/BRBV infections for five samples. One sample showed infection only with BRAV1. Seroprevalence studies using a cell culture adapted BRBV found immunofluorescence assay-reactive antibodies were common in the herds analyzed. Altogether, these results demonstrate that BRV infections are common in cattle with respiratory disease and that BRAV1, BRAV2 and BRBV co-circulate in U.S. cattle and have high similarity to viruses isolated more than 30 years ago from diverse locations.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.030288351,-0.015727459,0.06354338,-0.004451038,0.056933576,-0.018020394,0.015186685,-0.012545916,0.01063749,0.024446008999999998,-0.012216401000000002,-0.0044446979999999995,0.021781236000000002,-0.019041368,0.05810603,-0.060027757,0.009170467,-0.017866038,0.038895717,-0.01338726,0.061354607,-0.017769853000000002,-0.027132701000000002,0.02749175,0.015400473000000001,0.00933606,0.009283129000000001,-0.045435445,0.009005856999999999,-0.058643465
809,Antiviral Activity and Possible Mechanism of Action of Constituents Identified in Paeonia lactiflora Root toward Human Rhinoviruses,"Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are responsible for more than half of all cases of the common cold and cost billions of USD annually in medical visits and missed school and work. An assessment was made of the antiviral activities and mechanisms of action of paeonol (PA) and 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-β-D-glucopyranose (PGG) from Paeonia lactiflora root toward HRV-2 and HRV-4 in MRC5 cells using a tetrazolium method and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results were compared with those of a reference control ribavirin. Based on 50% inhibitory concentration values, PGG was 13.4 and 18.0 times more active toward HRV-2 (17.89 μM) and HRV-4 (17.33 μM) in MRC5 cells, respectively, than ribavirin. The constituents had relatively high selective index values (3.3–>8.5). The 100 μg/mL PA and 20 μg/mL PGG did not interact with the HRV-4 particles. These constituents inhibited HRV-4 infection only when they were added during the virus inoculation (0 h), the adsorption period of HRVs, but not after 1 h or later. Moreover, the RNA replication levels of HRVs were remarkably reduced in the MRC5 cultures treated with these constituents. These findings suggest that PGG and PA may block or reduce the entry of the viruses into the cells to protect the cells from the virus destruction and abate virus replication, which may play an important role in interfering with expressions of rhinovirus receptors (intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and low-density lipoprotein receptor), inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor, interferon beta, and IL-1β), and Toll-like receptor, which resulted in diminishing symptoms induced by HRV. Global efforts to reduce the level of synthetic drugs justify further studies on P. lactiflora root-derived materials as potential anti-HRV products or lead molecules for the prevention or treatment of HRV.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.01948041,-0.057371668,-0.013782167,-0.060194469,-0.093915913,0.022208582999999997,0.069523999,-0.042585884000000004,0.067792646,-0.020827726,-0.012391408000000001,-0.04514656400000001,-0.050868070999999994,0.099493679,0.019524454,0.031373339,-0.023897947000000003,-0.020692527,0.10044627800000001,-0.078316996,0.01877763,-0.114259027,-0.046988392999999996,0.12592357199999998,-0.135182449,0.166622214,-0.075947559,0.021525324,0.134498294,0.25856653
816,Neopterin in Diagnosis and Monitoring of Infectious Diseases,"Neopterin is produced by activated monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells upon stimulation by interferon gamma produced by T-lymphocytes. Quantification of neopterin in body fluids has been achieved by standard high-performance liquid chromatography, radioimmunoassays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Neopterin levels predict HIV-related mortality more efficiently than clinical manifestations. Successful highly active antiretroviral therapy is associated with a decrease in neopterin levels. Elevated neopterin levels were associated with hepatitis by hepatitis A, B, and C viruses. Serum neopterin levels were found to be a predictor of response to treatment of chronic HCV infection with pegylated interferon combined with ribavirin. Neopterin levels of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were found to be higher in patients with more extensive radiological changes. Elimination of blood donors with elevated neopterin levels to reduce risk of transmission of infections with known and unknown viral pathogens has been undertaken. Neopterin measurement is hereby more cost effective but less sensitive than screening using polymerase chain reaction based assays. In conclusion neopterin is a nonspecific marker of activated T-helper cell 1 dominated immune response.

817,CXCR2 is essential for cerebral endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment during neuroinflammation,"BACKGROUND: Chemokines and chemokine receptors cooperate to promote immune cell recruitment to the central nervous system (CNS). In this study, we investigated the roles of CXCR2 and CXCL1 in leukocyte recruitment to the CNS using a murine model of neuroinflammation. METHODS: Wild-type (WT), CXCL1(−/−), and CXCR2(−/−) mice each received an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Esterase staining and intravital microscopy were performed to examine neutrophil recruitment to the brain. To assess endothelial activation in these mice, the expression of adhesion molecules was measured via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting. To identify the cellular source of functional CXCR2, chimeric mice were generated by transferring bone marrow cells between the WT and CXCR2(−/−) mice. RESULTS: Expression levels of the chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5 were significantly increased in the brain following the i.c.v. injection of LPS. CXCR2 or CXCL1 deficiency blocked neutrophil infiltration and leukocyte recruitment in the cerebral microvessels. In the CXCR2(−/−) and CXCL1(−/−) mice, the cerebral endothelial expression of adhesion molecules such as P-selectin and VCAM-1 was dramatically reduced. Furthermore, the bone marrow transfer experiments demonstrated that CXCR2 expression on CNS-residing cells is essential for cerebral endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment. Compared with microglia, cultured astrocytes secreted a much higher level of CXCL1 in vitro. Astrocyte culture conditioned medium significantly increased the expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in cerebral endothelial cells in a CXCR2-dependent manner. Additionally, CXCR2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in cerebral endothelial cells but not in microglia or astrocytes was increased following tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) stimulation. The intravenous injection of the CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 significantly inhibited endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment to cerebral microvessels. CONCLUSIONS: CXCL1 secreted by astrocytes and endothelial CXCR2 play essential roles in cerebral endothelial activation and subsequent leukocyte recruitment during neuroinflammation.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.064804106,-0.032528577,0.007629323,-0.11025522,-0.07651026400000001,0.039083915,0.020285793,-0.025917392,0.03318302,-0.049399926,-0.036788028,-0.020585932,-0.027420556000000002,0.062658499,-0.0038146559999999996,0.031966123,-0.008676835,-0.053582938,-0.024591254,-0.057475209000000006,0.041719361,-0.017513651,0.031238134,-0.012050976000000001,-0.018940721,-0.009718835,-0.004855002,0.018044099999999997,0.020596003,-0.043968583
818,Fecal virome analysis of three carnivores reveals a novel nodavirus and multiple gemycircularviruses,"BACKGROUND: More knowledge about viral populations in wild animals is needed in order to better understand and assess the risk of zoonotic diseases. In this study we performed viral metagenomic analysis of fecal samples from three healthy carnivores: a badger (Meles meles), a mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon) and an otter (Lutra lutra) from Portugal. RESULTS: We detected the presence of novel highly divergent viruses in the fecal material of the carnivores analyzed, such as five gemycircularviruses. Four of these gemycircularviruses were found in the mongoose and one in the badger. In addition we also identified an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene from a putative novel member of the Nodaviridae family in the fecal material of the otter. CONCLUSIONS: Together these results underline that many novel viruses are yet to be discovered and that fecal associated viruses are not always related to disease. Our study expands the knowledge of viral species present in the gut, although the interpretation of the true host species of such novel viruses needs to be reviewed with great caution.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.046880121,-0.023423415,-0.000916116,0.022699445,0.104257087,0.026505794,0.12151588,0.038721555,-0.067201272,0.040278707000000004,0.005643252,-0.039192958,-0.009306546,0.015128807,0.021738345,-0.037189167,-0.020295453,-0.027187253999999998,0.006411472,0.012880553999999999,0.011608188,0.070488072,-0.09403683,0.051544692999999996,-0.030948385,-0.043924248,0.04289508400000001,-0.03282983,-0.007471465,-0.012923728
819,LeishVet update and recommendations on feline leishmaniosis,"Limited data is available on feline leishmaniosis (FeL) caused by Leishmania infantum worldwide. The LeishVet group presents in this report a review of the current knowledge on FeL, the epidemiological role of the cat in L. infantum infection, clinical manifestations, and recommendations on diagnosis, treatment and monitoring, prognosis and prevention of infection, in order to standardize the management of this disease in cats. The consensus of opinions and recommendations was formulated by combining a comprehensive review of evidence-based studies and case reports, clinical experience and critical consensus discussions. While subclinical feline infections are common in areas endemic for canine leishmaniosis, clinical illness due to L. infantum in cats is rare. The prevalence rates of feline infection with L. infantum in serological or molecular-based surveys range from 0 % to more than 60 %. Cats are able to infect sand flies and, therefore, they may act as a secondary reservoir, with dogs being the primary natural reservoir. The most common clinical signs and clinicopathological abnormalities compatible with FeL include lymph node enlargement and skin lesions such as ulcerative, exfoliative, crusting or nodular dermatitis (mainly on the head or distal limbs), ocular lesions (mainly uveitis), feline chronic gingivostomatitis syndrome, mucocutaneous ulcerative or nodular lesions, hypergammaglobulinaemia and mild normocytic normochromic anaemia. Clinical illness is frequently associated with impaired immunocompetence, as in case of retroviral coinfections or immunosuppressive therapy. Diagnosis is based on serology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cytology, histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) or culture. If serological testing is negative or low positive in a cat with clinical signs compatible with FeL, the diagnosis of leishmaniosis should not be excluded and additional diagnostic methods (cytology, histology with IHC, PCR, culture) should be employed. The most common treatment used is allopurinol. Meglumine antimoniate has been administered in very few reported cases. Both drugs are administered alone and most cats recover clinically after therapy. Follow-up of treated cats with routine laboratory tests, serology and PCR is essential for prevention of clinical relapses. Specific preventative measures for this infection in cats are currently not available.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.057449929000000004,0.018455461,0.06461869599999999,-0.151583815,-0.040276695,0.047989427,0.064323637,0.037732076,-0.027397035,-0.065586788,0.323568807,-0.122449283,0.237231618,-0.09358332800000001,-0.058112727,-0.049500987999999996,0.006003069000000001,0.067009307,-0.02202537,0.041156068,0.024293492000000003,-0.013624975,-0.008617988,-0.062970071,0.017086059,0.0016887520000000002,-0.016298889,0.002457081,0.029008925,0.012449696000000001
821,"Alternative divalent cations (Zn(2+), Co(2+), and Mn(2+)) are not mutagenic at conditions optimal for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity","BACKGROUND: Fidelity of DNA polymerases can be influenced by cation co-factors. Physiologically, Mg(2+) is used as a co-factor by HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) to perform catalysis; however, alternative cations including Mn(2+), Co(2+), and Zn(2+) can also support catalysis. Although Zn(2+) supports DNA synthesis, it inhibits HIV RT by significantly modifying RT catalysis. Zn(2+) is currently being investigated as a component of novel treatment options against HIV and we wanted to investigate the fidelity of RT with Zn(2+). METHODS: We used PCR-based and plasmid-based alpha complementation assays as well as steady-state misinsertion and misincorporation assays to examine the fidelity of RT with Mn(2+), Co(2+), and Zn(2+). RESULTS: The fidelity of DNA synthesis by HIV-1 RT was approximately 2.5 fold greater in Zn(2+) when compared to Mg(2+) at cation conditions optimized for nucleotide catalysis. Consistent with this, RT extended primers with mismatched 3′ nucleotides poorly and inserted incorrect nucleotides less efficiently using Zn(2+) than Mg(2+). In agreement with previous literature, we observed that Mn(2+) and Co(2+) dramatically decreased the fidelity of RT at highly elevated concentrations (6 mM). However, surprisingly, the fidelity of HIV RT with Mn(2+) and Co(2+) remained similar to Mg(2+) at lower concentrations that are optimal for catalysis. CONCLUSION: This study shows that Zn(2+), at optimal extension conditions, increases the fidelity of HIV-1 RT and challenges the notion that alternative cations capable of supporting polymerase catalysis are inherently mutagenic.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.048522288,0.030530892,0.089946606,0.01747031,-0.049254328,-0.009727000999999999,0.034458592999999996,-0.0015338139999999999,-0.017677042,-0.028370891000000002,0.051376443,0.08525805800000001,-0.084734244,0.021457173,-0.029014929,0.043649052,0.015759512,0.010192661,-0.08784981900000001,-0.041985456,0.046772460999999994,-0.030286882999999997,0.003742609,0.109746194,0.022801312,0.059934665,0.033509755,-0.055969045,0.016551664,-0.077259175
823,Specificity and Strain-Typing Capabilities of Nanorod Array-Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy for Mycoplasma pneumoniae Detection,"Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a cell wall-less bacterial pathogen of the human respiratory tract that accounts for > 20% of all community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). At present the most effective means for detection and strain-typing is quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), which can exhibit excellent sensitivity and specificity but requires separate tests for detection and genotyping, lacks standardization between available tests and between labs, and has limited practicality for widespread, point-of-care use. We have developed and previously described a silver nanorod array-surface enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (NA-SERS) biosensing platform capable of detecting M. pneumoniae with statistically significant specificity and sensitivity in simulated and true clinical throat swab samples, and the ability to distinguish between reference strains of the two main genotypes of M. pneumoniae. Furthermore, we have established a qualitative lower endpoint of detection for NA-SERS of < 1 genome equivalent (cell/μl) and a quantitative multivariate detection limit of 5.3 ± 1 cells/μl. Here we demonstrate using partial least squares- discriminatory analysis (PLS-DA) of sample spectra that NA-SERS correctly identified M. pneumoniae clinical isolates from globally diverse origins and distinguished these from a panel of 12 other human commensal and pathogenic mycoplasma species with 100% cross-validated statistical accuracy. Furthermore, PLS-DA correctly classified by strain type all 30 clinical isolates with 96% cross-validated accuracy for type 1 strains, 98% cross-validated accuracy for type 2 strains, and 90% cross-validated accuracy for type 2V strains.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.04527599400000001,0.00696087,0.114315578,-0.041931044,0.00025494,0.011199661000000001,0.021816966,0.006915763,-0.049387895999999994,0.059571402999999995,-0.056243873,0.022489073999999998,0.024833219,-0.064241437,0.0019547270000000003,-0.036149305,-0.056069655,-0.017695458,-0.008175217,0.004419894000000001,0.045672159000000004,0.06474716900000001,0.142599574,0.032235343,0.077150139,-0.026643626,-0.008273305,0.067244983,0.006882910999999999,0.003937294
826,A case of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia in an HIV-infected Korean patient successfully treated with clarithromycin,"BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is a type of diffuse interstitial lung disease characterized by the pathology of fibroblastic plugs in the lumens of the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli. The occurrence of BOOP in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients has rarely been described, and there have been no clinical case reports in Korea. CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old female who had been diagnosed with HIV ten years prior was admitted due to a 1-year history of cough and sputum production and a 3-day history of fever. She had poor adherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) due to gastrointestinal troubles. At the time of admission, her CD4 T-cell count was 5 cells/mm(3). A high resolution computed tomography (CT) scan showed tiny centrilobular nodules with a tree-in-bud pattern in both lungs. Bacterial culture, Pneumocystis jirovecii polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Aspergillus galactomannan antigen (Ag) assay, and respiratory virus PCR were negative. Rapid chest x-ray improvement was seen after a 7-day treatment with anti-tuberculosis medication, ceftriaxone, and clarithromycin. Miliary tuberculosis seemed unlikely considering the rapid radiologic improvement and negative tuberculosis PCR results. Due to the unknown etiology, we performed video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) to determine the cause of the diffuse lung infiltration. Pathologic findings were consistent with BOOP, while tissue acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain and tuberculosis PCR results were negative. Tuberculosis medication and intravenous ceftriaxone were discontinued, while treatment with clarithromycin monotherapy was sustained. Five months after discharge, the patient was asymptomatic with a normal chest x-ray and as her adherence to ART improved, her CD4 T-cell count rose to 181 cells/mm(3). Clarithromycin was discontinued at that time and the patient is currently receiving regular outpatient follow-up. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that macrolides are a potential treatment option in HIV-infected patients with mild BOOP. In cases that are otherwise unexplained or unresponsive to treatment, BOOP should be taken into consideration and surgical biopsy performed to confirm a diagnosis of BOOP.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.088897095,0.019427015,-0.001627494,-0.09840807800000001,-0.100172781,0.011310774,-0.017036503999999997,0.055620794,-0.019456531000000003,0.022822772,0.003934018,-0.010602577,0.000218877,0.042073118,0.015264683000000001,-0.000651938,-0.008045579,0.07374668,-0.021885152,-0.021299315,0.020955317,0.024540347,-0.017657776,-0.055986698,-0.01416755,0.054955026,0.024246873,-0.020714535,-0.008605609,-0.025372256
827,Inhibitory effect of Phyllanthus urinaria L. extract on the replication of lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus in vitro,"BACKGROUND: Long-term treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) with nucleos(t)ide analogs results in the emergence of drug-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) harboring mutations in the polymerase (P) gene. The Phyllanthus extract has anti-HBV activity; however, its antiviral activity against lamivudine (LMV)-resistant mutants has not been examined. METHODS: HBV harboring LMV-resistant mutations (rtM204I, rtM204V, and rtM204S) in the P gene at the YMDD ((203)tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate(206)) reverse transcriptase (RT) active site were generated and their sensitivity to Phyllanthus urinaria koreanis extract examined. Southern blotting and real-time PCR were used to determine the concentration of plant extract required to inhibit HBV DNA synthesis by 50 and 90 % (EC(50) and EC(90), respectively). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the EC(50) of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV core antigen (HBcAg) secretion, and the 50 % cytotoxic concentration of the extract was measured in a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Real-time RT-PCR was used to measure mRNA expression levels. RESULTS: The expression of intracellular HBV DNAs in HBV WT- or mutant-transfected HepG2 cells decreased upon treatment with Phyllanthus extract. The secretion of HBsAg and HBcAg also fell in a dose-dependent manner. Phyllanthus extract induced interferon-beta (IFN-β), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA expression in HBV WT-transfected HepG2 cells, possibly via activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases and c-jun N-terminal kinases and the induction of retinoic acid inducible gene-I, toll-like receptor 3, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88, and/or tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 gene expression. HBV transfection in the absence of extract or exposure of cells to extract alone did not trigger these signaling cascades. CONCLUSIONS: Phyllanthus extract inhibited HBV DNA synthesis and HBsAg and HBcAg secretion by replicating cells harboring HBV wild-type and LMV-resistant mutants, likely by inducing the expression of IFN-β, COX-2, and IL-6. These data indicate that Phyllanthus extract may be useful as an alternative therapeutic agent for the treatment of drug-resistant CHB patients.

828,Highly conserved regions in Ebola virus RNA dependent RNA polymerase may be act as a universal novel peptide vaccine target: a computational approach,"PURPOSE: Ebola virus (EBOV) is such kind of virus which is responsible for 23,825 cases and 9675 deaths worldwide only in 2014 and with an average diseases fatality rate between 25 % and 90 %. Although, medical technology has tried to handle the problems, there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutics or vaccines available for the prevention, post exposure, or treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD). METHODS: In the present study, we used the immunoinformatics approach to design a potential epitope-based vaccine against the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-L of EBOV. BioEdit v7.2.3 sequence alignment editor, Jalview v2 and CLC Sequence Viewer v7.0.2 were used for the initial sequence analysis for securing the conservancy from the sequences. Later the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB-AR) was used for the identification of T-cell and B-cellepitopes associated with type I and II major histocompatibility complex molecules analysis. Finally, the population coverage analysis was employed. RESULTS: The core epitope “FRYEFTAPF” was found to be the most potential one, with 100 % conservancy among all the strains of EBOV. It also interacted with both type I and II major histocompatibility complex molecules and is considered as nonallergenic in nature. Finally, with impressive cumulative population coverage of 99.87 % for the both MHC-I and MHC-II class throughout the world population was found for the proposed epitope. CONCLUSION: To end, the projected peptide gave us a solid stand to propose for vaccine consideration and that might be experimented for its potency in eliciting immunity through humoral and cell mediated immune responses in vitro and in vivo.

829,"Concentration, Size Distribution, and Infectivity of Airborne Particles Carrying Swine Viruses","When pathogens become airborne, they travel associated with particles of different size and composition. Particle size determines the distance across which pathogens can be transported, as well as the site of deposition and the survivability of the pathogen. Despite the importance of this information, the size distribution of particles bearing viruses emitted by infectious animals remains unknown. In this study we characterized the concentration and size distribution of inhalable particles that transport influenza A virus (IAV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) generated by acutely infected pigs and assessed virus viability for each particle size range. Aerosols from experimentally infected pigs were sampled for 24 days using an Andersen cascade impactor able to separate particles by size (ranging from 0.4 to 10 micrometer (μm) in diameter). Air samples collected for the first 9, 20 and the last 3 days of the study were analyzed for IAV, PRRSV and PEDV, respectively, using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantified as geometric mean copies/m(3) within each size range. IAV was detected in all particle size ranges in quantities ranging from 5.5x10(2) (in particles ranging from 1.1 to 2.1μm) to 4.3x10(5) RNA copies/m(3) in the largest particles (9.0–10.0μm). PRRSV was detected in all size ranges except particles between 0.7 and 2.1μm in quantities ranging from 6x10(2) (0.4–0.7μm) to 5.1x10(4) RNA copies/m(3) (9.0–10.0μm). PEDV, an enteric virus, was detected in all particle sizes and in higher quantities than IAV and PRRSV (p < 0.0001) ranging from 1.3x10(6) (0.4–0.7μm) to 3.5x10(8) RNA copies/m(3) (9.0–10.0μm). Infectious status was demonstrated for the 3 viruses, and in the case of IAV and PRRSV, viruses were isolated from particles larger than 2.1μm. In summary, our results indicated that airborne PEDV, IAV and PRRSV can be found in a wide range of particle sizes. However, virus viability is particle size dependent.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.035084557,-0.032072154,0.047949132,-0.013738357,0.015380308,0.024769155,-0.019706541,-0.009310618,-0.005401942,-0.015365962,0.029086729,-0.006668321,-0.086103275,0.063268618,0.20018646399999998,-0.091601236,-0.037577267000000004,-0.012946888,-0.000752831,0.09843445,-0.10649148800000001,-0.012920994,0.063840122,-0.057957474,-0.026355517000000002,0.027982607000000003,0.007044308000000001,0.009140534,-0.04034108,0.023407509
831,Controlled Microwave Heating Accelerates Rolling Circle Amplification,"Rolling circle amplification (RCA) generates single-stranded DNAs or RNA, and the diverse applications of this isothermal technique range from the sensitive detection of nucleic acids to analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Microwave chemistry is widely applied to increase reaction rate as well as product yield and purity. The objectives of the present research were to apply microwave heating to RCA and indicate factors that contribute to the microwave selective heating effect. The microwave reaction temperature was strictly controlled using a microwave applicator optimized for enzymatic-scale reactions. Here, we showed that microwave-assisted RCA reactions catalyzed by either of the four thermostable DNA polymerases were accelerated over 4-folds compared with conventional RCA. Furthermore, the temperatures of the individual buffer components were specifically influenced by microwave heating. We concluded that microwave heating accelerated isothermal RCA of DNA because of the differential heating mechanisms of microwaves on the temperatures of reaction components, although the overall reaction temperatures were the same.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.048817872000000005,-0.008051843000000001,0.06031977400000001,-0.037618341,-0.036711706000000004,0.004335053,0.033755589,0.003385211,-0.003901465,-0.011603617,-0.018398083,0.022520655,-0.00288632,-0.052208798,-0.000273548,0.040218339,-0.023830245,-0.009153573,-0.026689111,-0.010146381999999999,-0.030704804,-0.029010473,-0.004013178,-0.008293057,-0.006867771999999999,-0.014711421,-0.05171779,0.027728304,-0.023686943,-0.00048170300000000005
832,"Low prevalence of equine coronavirus in foals in the largest thoroughbred horse breeding region of Japan, 2012–2014","BACKGROUND: Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is considered to be a diarrheic pathogen in foals. In central Kentucky in the United States, it has been shown that approximately 30 % of thoroughbred foals are infected with ECoV and thus it is considered widely prevalent. In contrast, the epidemiology of ECoV and its relationship to diarrhea in foals are poorly understood in Japan. We investigated ECoV in rectal swabs collected from thoroughbred foals in Japan. RESULTS: We collected 337 rectal swabs from 307 diarrheic foals in the Hidaka district of Hokkaido, the largest thoroughbred horse breeding region in Japan, between 2012 and 2014. In addition, 120 rectal swabs were collected from 120 healthy foals in 2012. These samples were tested by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification and a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. All samples collected from diarrheic foals were negative, and only three samples (2.5 %) collected from healthy foals were positive for ECoV. Compared with central Kentucky, ECoV is not prevalent among thoroughbred foals in the Hidaka district of Hokkaido. CONCLUSION: ECoV is not prevalent and was not related to diarrhea in thoroughbred foals in the Hidaka district of Hokkaido between 2012 and 2014.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.001937289,-0.00332695,0.048773744,-0.07638682200000001,0.018452217,0.008704495,0.004020564,0.008568383,-0.005896591999999999,-0.048298444,0.024341309,0.043770655,-0.042514392000000005,-0.015884557,0.035243573,0.008854449,0.002175943,-0.01477384,-0.003029125,-0.035273951,-0.022138993,0.000614422,-0.04725097,-0.002895755,0.041561295,-0.010726083,-0.047935395,0.029682942,0.016352992,-0.036973995
834,Effect of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Infectious Doses on Infection Outcomes in Naïve Conventional Neonatal and Weaned Pigs,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was identified in the United States (U.S.) swine population for the first time in April 2013 and rapidly spread nationwide. However, no information has been published regarding the minimum infectious dose (MID) of PEDV in different pig models. The main objective of this study was to determine the oral minimum infectious dose of PEDV in naïve conventional neonatal piglets and weaned pigs. A U.S. virulent PEDV prototype isolate (USA/IN19338/2013) with known infectious titer was serially ten-fold diluted in virus-negative cell culture medium. Dilutions with theoretical infectious titers from 560 to 0.0056 TCID(50)/ml together with a medium control were orogastrically inoculated (10ml/pig) into 7 groups of 5-day-old neonatal pigs (n = 4 per group) and 7 groups of 21-day-old weaned pigs (n = 6 per group). In 5-day-old pigs, 10ml of inoculum having titers 560–0.056 TCID(50)/ml, corresponding to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) values 24.2–37.6, resulted in 100% infection in each group; 10ml of inoculum with titer 0.0056 TCID(50)/ml (Ct>45) caused infection in 25% of the inoculated pigs. In 21-day-old pigs, 10ml of inoculum with titers 560–5.6 TCID(50)/ml (Ct 24.2–31.4) resulted in 100% infection in each group while 10ml of inoculum with titers 0.56–0.0056 TCID(50)/ml (Ct values 35.3 –>45) did not establish infection in any pigs under study conditions as determined by clinical signs, PCR, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and antibody response. These data reveal that PEDV infectious dose is age-dependent with a significantly lower MID for neonatal pigs compared to weaned pigs. This information should be taken into consideration when interpreting clinical relevance of PEDV PCR results and when designing a PEDV bioassay model. The observation of such a low MID in neonates also emphasizes the importance of strict biosecurity and thorough cleaning/disinfection on sow farms.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.016560371,-0.002996795,0.068406353,-0.145015562,0.022841522000000003,0.052199719000000006,-0.014835736,-0.017755503,-0.005235109,-0.018195863,0.064449201,0.063954107,-0.174669236,0.054799387000000005,0.247807535,-0.161584597,-0.040281325,0.06800712099999999,-0.018393634,0.112489286,-0.184318288,-0.093884436,0.085888329,-0.072112353,-0.07607130599999999,-0.018957711000000002,-0.011294058999999999,-0.009483703000000001,0.017313305,-0.009352813
836,Perspective of Use of Antiviral Peptides against Influenza Virus,"The threat of a worldwide influenza pandemic has greatly increased over the past decade with the emergence of highly virulent avian influenza strains. The increased frequency of drug-resistant influenza strains against currently available antiviral drugs requires urgent development of new strategies for antiviral therapy, too. The research in the field of therapeutic peptides began to develop extensively in the second half of the 20(th) century. Since then, the mechanisms of action for several peptides and their antiviral prospect received large attention due to the global threat posed by viruses. Here, we discussed the therapeutic properties of peptides used in influenza treatment. Peptides with antiviral activity against influenza can be divided into three main groups. First, entry blocker peptides such as a Flupep that interact with influenza hemagglutinin, block its binding to host cells and prevent viral fusion. Second, several peptides display virucidal activity, disrupting viral envelopes, e.g., Melittin. Finally, a third set of peptides interacts with the viral polymerase complex and act as viral replication inhibitors such as PB1 derived peptides. Here, we present a review of the current literature describing the antiviral activity, mechanism and future therapeutic potential of these influenza antiviral peptides.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.034741793,-0.075208334,-0.03916837,0.10052647599999999,-0.101192827,0.265461727,-0.009470505,-0.008920606999999999,0.017479723,-0.006548536999999999,0.006542893,0.036822278,0.026094936000000003,-0.01996944,-0.007643749,-0.015071998,-0.019395784,0.07192591200000001,0.027711807999999997,0.028125132,0.000603173,0.022459924,-0.016111843,0.043168758,0.040781042,0.00423894,0.016617567,-0.039938617999999995,0.076385144,0.053590955
842,Retroviral DNA—the silent winner: blood transfusion containing latent feline leukemia provirus causes infection and disease in naïve recipient cats,"BACKGROUND: The feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a gamma-retrovirus of domestic cats that was discovered half a century ago. Cats that are infected with FeLV may develop a progressive infection resulting in persistent viremia, immunodeficiency, tumors, anemia and death. A significant number of cats mount a protective immune response that suppresses viremia; these cats develop a regressive infection characterized by the absence of viral replication and the presence of low levels of proviral DNA. The biological importance of these latter provirus carriers is largely unknown. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that ten cats that received a transfusion of blood from aviremic provirus carriers developed active FeLV infections, some with a progressive outcome and the development of fatal FeLV-associated disease. The infection outcome, disease spectrum and evolution into FeLV-C in one cat mirrored those of natural infection. Two cats developed persistent antigenemia; six cats were transiently antigenemic. Reactivation of infection occurred in some cats. One recipient developed non-regenerative anemia associated with FeLV-C, and four others developed a T-cell lymphoma, one with secondary lymphoblastic leukemia. Five of the ten recipient cats received provirus-positive aviremic blood, whereas the other five received provirus- and viral RNA-positive but aviremic blood. Notably, the cats that received blood containing only proviral DNA exhibited a later onset but graver outcome of FeLV infection than the cats that were transfused with blood containing proviral DNA and viral RNA. Leukocyte counts and cytokine analyses indicated that the immune system of the latter cats reacted quicker and more efficiently. CONCLUSIONS: Our results underline the biological and epidemiological relevance of FeLV provirus carriers and the risk of inadvertent FeLV transmission via blood transfusion and demonstrate the replication capacity of proviral DNA if uncontrolled by the immune system. Our results have implications not only for veterinary medicine, such as the requirement for testing blood donors and blood products for FeLV provirus by sensitive polymerase chain reaction, but are also of general interest by revealing the importance of latent retroviral DNA in infected hosts. When aiming to eliminate a retroviral infection from a population, provirus carriers must be considered.

845,Two novel regulators of N‐acetyl‐galactosamine utilization pathway and distinct roles in bacterial infections,"Bacterial pathogens can exploit metabolic pathways to facilitate their successful infection cycles, but little is known about roles of d‐galactosamine (GalN)/N‐acetyl‐d‐galactosamine (GalNAc) catabolism pathway in bacterial pathogenesis. Here, we report the genomic reconstruction of GalN/GalNAc utilization pathway in Streptococci and the diversified aga regulons. We delineated two new paralogous AgaR regulators for the GalN/GalNAc catabolism pathway. The electrophoretic mobility shift assays experiment demonstrated that AgaR2 (AgaR1) binds the predicted palindromes, and the combined in vivo data from reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and RNA‐seq suggested that AgaR2 (not AgaR1) can effectively repress the transcription of the target genes. Removal of agaR2 (not agaR1) from Streptococcus suis 05ZYH33 augments significantly the abilities of both adherence to Hep‐2 cells and anti‐phagocytosis against RAW264.7 macrophage. As anticipated, the dysfunction in AgaR2‐mediated regulation of S. suis impairs its pathogenicity in experimental models of both mice and piglets. Our finding discovered two novel regulators specific for GalN/GalNAc catabolism and assigned them distinct roles into bacterial infections. To the best of our knowledge, it might represent a first paradigm that links the GalN/GalNAc catabolism pathway to bacterial pathogenesis.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.058014709000000005,-0.02781611,0.00630415,-0.064485712,-0.059253046,0.019049457,0.048105138,-0.004266633,-0.0029925990000000003,0.018153561000000002,-0.040277995,-0.026508291,0.005998595,0.023333306,0.01381518,-0.010664868999999999,-0.017940472,-0.009416811,-0.039676137,-0.016189439,-0.013107222,0.023211113,0.016984518,0.012253611999999999,0.015593629,-0.030121455,-0.003587383,0.026401561,0.07009677,-0.017712218000000002
846,A simple novel device for air sampling by electrokinetic capture,"BACKGROUND: A variety of different sampling devices are currently available to acquire air samples for the study of the microbiome of the air. All have a degree of technical complexity that limits deployment. Here, we evaluate the use of a novel device, which has no technical complexity and is easily deployable. RESULTS: An air-cleaning device powered by electrokinetic propulsion has been adapted to provide a universal method for collecting samples of the aerobiome. Plasma-induced charge in aerosol particles causes propulsion to and capture on a counter-electrode. The flow of ions creates net bulk airflow, with no moving parts. A device and electrode assembly have been re-designed from air-cleaning technology to provide an average air flow of 120 lpm. This compares favorably with current air sampling devices based on physical air pumping. Capture efficiency was determined by comparison with a 0.4 μm polycarbonate reference filter, using fluorescent latex particles in a controlled environment chamber. Performance was compared with the same reference filter method in field studies in three different environments. For 23 common fungal species by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), there was 100 % sensitivity and apparent specificity of 87 %, with the reference filter taken as “gold standard.” Further, bacterial analysis of 16S RNA by amplicon sequencing showed equivalent community structure captured by the electrokinetic device and the reference filter. Unlike other current air sampling methods, capture of particles is determined by charge and so is not controlled by particle mass. We analyzed particle sizes captured from air, without regard to specific analyte by atomic force microscopy: particles at least as low as 100 nM could be captured from ambient air. CONCLUSIONS: This work introduces a very simple plug-and-play device that can sample air at a high-volume flow rate with no moving parts and collect particles down to the sub-micron range. The performance of the device is substantially equivalent to capture by pumping through a filter for microbiome analysis by quantitative PCR and amplicon sequencing.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.023533036,0.004740914000000001,0.08612900400000001,-0.041387692000000004,-0.017038609,0.026130342,0.034418773,0.00695571,-0.027483922,-0.000154504,-0.022274639,0.001952966,-0.017476888,-0.044809957000000004,0.019090552,0.030764543,-0.047206483,-0.034427585,-0.007071303,-0.047697675,-0.015891443,-0.0050319779999999995,0.02367298,-0.013513865,-0.009106911,-0.010911634,-0.012317443999999999,0.029988581,-0.015972899,0.00444358
847,Subcellular fractionation method to study endosomal trafficking of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus,"BACKGROUND: Virus entry involves multiple steps and is a highly orchestrated process on which successful infection collectively depends. Entry processes are commonly analyzed by monitoring internalized virus particles via Western blotting, polymerase chain reaction, and imaging techniques that allow scientist to track the intracellular location of the pathogen. Such studies have provided abundant direct evidence on how viruses interact with receptor molecules on the cell surface, induce cell signaling at the point of initial contact with the cell to facilitate internalization, and exploit existing endocytic mechanisms of the cell for their ultimate infectious agenda. However, there is dearth of knowledge in regards to trafficking of a virus via endosomes. Herein, we describe an optimized laboratory procedure to isolate individual organelles during different stages of endocytosis by performing subcellular fractionation. This methodology is established using Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection of human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells as a model. With KSHV and other herpesviruses alike, envelope glycoproteins have been widely reported to physically engage target cell surface receptors, such as integrins, in interactions leading to entry and subsequent infection. RESULTS: Subcellular fractionation was used to isolate early and late endosomes (EEs and LEs) by performing a series of centrifugations steps. Specifically, a centrifugation step post-homogenization was utilized to obtain the post-nuclear supernatant containing intact intracellular organelles in suspension. Successive fractionation via sucrose density gradient centrifugation was performed to isolate specific organelles including EEs and LEs. Intracellular KSHV trafficking was directly traced in the isolated endosomal fractions. Additionally, the subcellular fractionation approach demonstrates a key role for integrins in the endosomal trafficking of KSHV. The results obtained from fractionation studies corroborated those obtained by traditional imaging studies. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first of its kind to employ a sucrose flotation gradient assay to map intracellular KSHV trafficking in HFF cells. We are confident that such an approach will serve as a powerful tool to directly study intracellular trafficking of a virus, signaling events occurring on endosomal membranes, and dynamics of molecular events within endosomes that are crucial for uncoating and virus escape into the cytosol.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.053675602999999995,-0.028646384,0.021900551,-0.038982707000000005,-0.068989388,0.055795389,0.049636957999999995,-0.026125025,0.044604205,0.024795357,-0.031504223,-0.04205643,0.020816943,0.039426406000000004,0.049985391,0.039826272999999995,0.005170056,-0.024765692000000002,-0.023524575,0.009492575999999999,0.013989076999999999,0.006758774,0.014126833,-0.0062242109999999995,0.011172133999999998,0.027218122,0.002327239,0.016364048,-0.047504378,-0.012339561
848,"Co-Circulation of Canine Coronavirus I and IIa/b with High Prevalence and Genetic Diversity in Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China","To trace the evolution of canine coronavirus (CCoV), 201 stool samples from diarrheic dogs in northeast China were subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) targeting the partial M and S genes of CCoV, followed by an epidemiological analysis. M gene RT-PCRs showed that 28.36% (57/201) of the samples were positive for CCoV; of the 57 positive samples, CCoV-I and CCoV-II accounted for 15.79% (9/57) and 84.21% (48/57), respectively. A sequence comparison of the partial M gene revealed nucleotide homologies of 88.4%–100% among the 57 CCoV strains, and 88.7%–96.2% identity between the 57 CCoV strains and the Chinese reference strain HF3. The CCoV-I and CCoV-II strains exhibited genetic diversity when compared with reference strains from China and other countries. The 57 CCoV strains exhibited high co-infection rates with canine kobuvirus (CaKV) (33.33%) and canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2) (31.58%). The CCoV prevalence in diarrheic dogs differed significantly with immunization status, regions, seasons, and ages. Moreover, 28 S genes were amplified from the 57 CCoV-positive samples, including 26 CCoV-IIa strains, one CCoV-IIb strain, and one CCoV-I strain. A sequence comparison of the partial S gene revealed 86.3%–100% nucleotide identity among the 26 CCoV-IIa strains, and 89.6%–92.2% identity between the 26 CCoV-IIa strains and the Chinese reference strain V1. The 26 CCoV-IIa strains showed genetic diversity when compared with reference strains from China and other countries. Our data provide evidence that CCoV-I, CCoV-IIa, and CCoV-IIb strains co-circulate in the diarrhoetic dogs in northeast China, high co-infection rates with CaKV and CPV-2 were observed, and the CCoV-II strains exhibited high prevalence and genetic diversity.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.033587322999999995,-0.005129825,0.065435013,-0.10683411,0.08909699300000001,0.042363927999999995,-0.015901823,-0.014305907,-0.001361875,-0.028883959,0.025796081000000002,0.073047558,-0.050528048,-0.019889484,0.029285342000000002,-0.027014177,-0.025889777000000003,-0.017765958000000002,0.03002427,-0.011815146,0.128554205,0.073392521,-0.058590798,0.036242252,0.09349238,-0.084198226,-0.017495739,0.009139768000000001,-0.023034084,0.062690137
854,Pathogenesis and Diagnostic Approaches of Avian Infectious Bronchitis,"Infectious bronchitis (IB) is one of the major economically important poultry diseases distributed worldwide. It is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and affects both galliform and nongalliform birds. Its economic impact includes decreased egg production and poor egg quality in layers, stunted growth, poor carcass weight, and mortality in broiler chickens. Although primarily affecting the respiratory tract, IBV demonstrates a wide range of tissues tropism, including the renal and reproductive systems. Thus, disease outcome may be influenced by the organ or tissue involved as well as pathotypes or strain of the infecting virus. Knowledge on the epidemiology of the prevalent IBV strains in a particular region is therefore important to guide control and preventions. Meanwhile previous diagnostic methods such as serology and virus isolations are less sensitive and time consuming, respectively; current methods, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), and sequencing, offer highly sensitive, rapid, and accurate diagnostic results, thus enabling the genotyping of new viral strains within the shortest possible time. This review discusses aspects on pathogenesis and diagnostic methods for IBV infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.000152179,0.009539501,0.14418385,-0.063847332,0.103937426,0.075305644,-0.104116209,-0.078628142,0.11124454199999999,0.34517891,0.071040353,-0.002167786,-0.008794153,0.021005485,-0.103916916,0.114652751,-0.004089825,0.020371224,-0.022225696,0.039686967000000004,-0.054859475,-0.038870853999999996,-0.002894868,-0.075329114,0.006894745,-0.015228345,-0.003010622,-0.027063597999999998,0.01753014,0.001401718
855,"Construction and characterization of recombinant human adenovirus type 5 expressing foot-and-mouth disease virus capsid proteins of Indian vaccine strain, O/IND/R2/75","AIM: Generation of recombinant human adenovirus type 5 expressing foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) capsid protein genes along with full-length 2B, 3B and 3C(pro) and its characterization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FMD viral RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and polymerase chain reaction were performed to synthesize expression cassettes (P1-2AB3BC(wt) and P1-2AB3BC(m)) followed by cloning in pShuttle-CMV vector. Chemically competent BJ5183-AD-1 cells were transformed with the recombinant pShuttle-CMV to produce recombinant adenoviral plasmids. HEK-293 cells were transfected with the recombinant adenoviral plasmids to generate recombinant adenoviruses (hAd5/P1-2AB3BC(wt) and hAd5/P1-2AB3BC(m)). Expression of the target proteins was analyzed by sandwich ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence assay. The recombinant adenoviruses were purified and concentrated by CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation. Growth kinetics and thermostability of the recombinant adenoviruses were compared with that of non-recombinant replication-defective adenovirus (dAd5). RESULTS: The recombinant adenoviruses containing capsid protein genes of the FMDV O/IND/R2/75 were generated and amplified in HEK-293 cells. The titer of the recombinant adenoviruses was approximately 10(8), 10(9.5) and 10(11) TCID(50)/ml in supernatant media, cell lysate and CsCl purified preparation, respectively. Expression of the FMDV capsid protein was detectable in sandwich ELISA and confirmed by immunofluorescence assay. Growth kinetics of the recombinant adenoviruses did not reveal a significant difference when compared with that of dAd5. A decrement of up to 10-fold at 4°C and 21-fold at 37°C was recorded in the virus titers during 60 h incubation period and found to be statistically significant (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Recombinant adenoviruses expressing capsid proteins of the FMDV O/IND/R2/75 were constructed and produced in high titers.

857,Predominant Bacteria Detected from the Middle Ear Fluid of Children Experiencing Otitis Media: A Systematic Review,"BACKGROUND: Otitis media (OM) is amongst the most common childhood diseases and is associated with multiple microbial pathogens within the middle ear. Global and temporal monitoring of predominant bacterial pathogens is important to inform new treatment strategies, vaccine development and to monitor the impact of vaccine implementation to improve progress toward global OM prevention. METHODS: A systematic review of published reports of microbiology of acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME) from January, 1970 to August 2014, was performed using PubMed databases. RESULTS: This review confirmed that Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, remain the predominant bacterial pathogens, with S. pneumoniae the predominant bacterium in the majority reports from AOM patients. In contrast, H. influenzae was the predominant bacterium for patients experiencing chronic OME, recurrent AOM and AOM with treatment failure. This result was consistent, even where improved detection sensitivity from the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) rather than bacterial culture was conducted. On average, PCR analyses increased the frequency of detection of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae 3.2 fold compared to culture, whilst Moraxella catarrhalis was 4.5 times more frequently identified by PCR. Molecular methods can also improve monitoring of regional changes in the serotypes and identification frequency of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae over time or after vaccine implementation, such as after introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Globally, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae remain the predominant otopathogens associated with OM as identified through bacterial culture; however, molecular methods continue to improve the frequency and accuracy of detection of individual serotypes. Ongoing monitoring with appropriate detection methods for OM pathogens can support development of improved vaccines to provide protection from the complex combination of otopathogens within the middle ear, ultimately aiming to reduce the risk of chronic and recurrent OM in vulnerable populations.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.080531591,-0.022396651,0.034113707,-0.06546735,-0.056784349000000005,-0.011353773999999999,0.047860137000000004,0.043122314,-0.05881731,0.11068878800000001,-0.046578067,-0.019940498,0.017228003000000002,-0.08850598900000001,0.007273256,-0.012682323999999998,-0.030122259,-0.029369032000000003,-0.02713681,-0.054346835,-0.022319589,0.07038456400000001,0.135036677,0.016773273999999998,0.053057312,0.007041974,0.009912792,0.006860665,0.097390802,-0.013527571
859,Phylogenetic evidence for intratypic recombinant events in a novel human adenovirus C that causes severe acute respiratory infection in children,"Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are prevalent in hospitalized children with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). Here, we report a unique recombinant HAdV strain (CBJ113) isolated from a HAdV-positive child with SARI. The whole-genome sequence was determined using Sanger sequencing and high-throughput sequencing. A phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome indicated that the CBJ113 strain shares a common origin with HAdV-C2, HAdV-C6, HAdV-C1, HAdV-C5, and HAdV-C57 and formed a novel subclade on the same branch as other HAdV-C subtypes. BootScan and single nucleotide polymorphism analyses showed that the CBJ113 genome has an intra-subtype recombinant structure and comprises gene regions mainly originating from two circulating viral strains: HAdV-1 and HAdV-2. The parental penton base, pVI, and DBP genes of the recombinant strain clustered with the HAdV-1 prototype strain, and the E1B, hexon, fiber, and 100 K genes of the recombinant clustered within the HAdV-2 subtype, meanwhile the E4orf1 and DNA polymerase genes of the recombinant shared the greatest similarity with those of HAdV-5 and HAdV-6, respectively. All of these findings provide insight into our understanding of the dynamics of the complexity of the HAdV-C epidemic.

861,Discovery of Novel Alphacoronaviruses in European Rodents and Shrews,"Eight hundred and thirteen European rodents and shrews encompassing seven different species were screened for alphacoronaviruses using PCR detection. Novel alphacoronaviruses were detected in the species Rattus norvegicus, Microtus agrestis, Sorex araneus and Myodes glareolus. These, together with the recently described Lucheng virus found in China, form a distinct rodent/shrew-specific clade within the coronavirus phylogeny. Across a highly conserved region of the viral polymerase gene, the new members of this clade were up to 22% dissimilar at the nucleotide level to the previously described Lucheng virus.

869,Direct molecular detection of a broad range of bacterial and viral organisms and Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine serotypes in children with otitis media with effusion,"BACKGROUND: Otitis media with effusion (OME) causes significant morbidity in children, but the causes of OME and methods for prevention are unclear. To look for potential infectious etiologies, we performed a pilot study using multiple-target real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for 27 infectious agents, including nine bacterial organisms and 18 respiratory viruses in middle ear fluids (MEFs) from children with OME. QPCR was also performed for the 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes contained in the current vaccine. RESULTS: Forty-eight MEF samples were obtained and qPCR detected bacterial nucleic acid (NA) in 39/48 (81 %) and viral NA in 7/48 (15 %). Alloiococcus otitidis and S. pneumoniae were both detected in 15/48 (31 %) MEFs, followed by M. catarrhalis in 14/48 (29 %), H. influenzae in 5/48 (10 %) and M. pneumoniae in 4/48 (8 %). Rhinoviruses were most common virus type detected, found in 4/48 (8 %) MEFs. Serotypes included in the current 13-serotype vaccine were detected in only 3/15 (20 %) S. pneumoniae qPCR-positive MEFs. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria may play an important role in OME, since over 80 % of MEFs contained bacterial NA. Further research into the role of A. otitidis in OME will be helpful. Serotypes of S. pneumoniae not included in the current 13-serotype vaccine may be involved in OME. Larger studies of OME S. pneumoniae serotypes are needed to help determine which additional serotypes should be included in future vaccine formulations in order to try to prevent OME.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.059004259,-0.056614174,0.014668876,-0.059097327000000005,-0.006039343000000001,-0.010954951000000001,0.03770023,0.000302548,-0.018825697,0.06533581299999999,-0.010817603,-0.016074305,-0.023811097000000003,-0.076616107,0.013237778,-0.0061529359999999995,-0.017633894,-0.048870461,0.005120258,-0.022985491,-0.036267587999999996,0.093816366,0.102761129,0.024897426,0.028251462,0.037688855,-0.003542865,0.039551843999999996,0.090580778,-0.003084843
872,Molecular Epidemiological Investigation of Porcine kobuvirus and Its Coinfection Rate with PEDV and SaV in Northwest China,"Porcine kobuvirus (PKV) has circulated throughout China in recent years. Although many studies have detected it throughout the world, its molecular epidemiology has not been characterized in northwest China. To understand its prevalence, 203 fecal samples were collected from different regions of Gansu Province and tested with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In this study, we tested these samples for PKV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and sapovirus and analyzed the amplified 2C gene fragments of PKV. Overall, 126 (62.1%) samples were positive for PKV. Of the 74 piglets samples among the 203 fecal samples, 65 (87.8%) were positive for PKV. PKV infection was often accompanied by PEDV, but the relationship between the two viruses must be confirmed. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that the PKV strains isolated from the same regions clustered on the same branches. This investigation shows that PKV infections are highly prevalent in pigs in northwest China, especially in piglets with symptoms of diarrhea.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.005478089,-0.0017416110000000001,0.055865383,-0.09428283400000001,0.090070976,0.033773211000000004,0.004662241,-0.012657781000000002,-0.011369551,-0.027293308,0.038434523,0.072204552,-0.094253639,0.010941417,0.1614191,-0.10601524699999999,-0.024313129,0.010481311,-0.018406372,0.050939763,-0.065532523,0.003526845,-0.006979209,-0.011739451000000001,0.010842032,-0.014457873000000001,-0.03259107,0.030328726,0.027179022999999997,-0.004672269000000001
875,Evidence of Aujeszky’s disease in wild boar in Serbia,"BACKGROUND: Aujeszky’s disease is a viral disease of suids caused by Suid Herpesvirus 1. The disease has worldwide distribution with significant economic impact. In Serbia, there is neither an Aujeszky’s disease eradication nor national vaccination programme of domestic pigs. Since clinical symptoms of Aujeszky’s disease are not specific, it is important to establish a link between clinical signs and presence of ADV active infection in wild boars. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of active infection within wild boar showing signs of ADV and also to examine relationship between isolates from domestic pigs and wild boar. Having in mind that virus has not been previously isolated from wild boars in Serbia, we report the first isolation of Suid Herpesvirus 1 from this species in Serbia. RESULTS: Tissue and serum samples from 40 wild boars from eastern Serbia were examined for evidence of Aujeszky’s disease (AD). Suid Herpesvirus 1 (SHV1), the cause of AD was isolated on PK15 cell line from three tissue samples, inducing cytopathic effect (CPE) with syncytia forming, and viral genome was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in eight samples. Genetic analysis of us4, us9 and ul49.5 partial sequences showed high homology between ADV isolates from wild boars and between isolates from wild boars and domestic animals. Neutralizing antibodies were not detected by virus neutralisation test (VNT) in sera from four out of eight PCR positive wild boars suggesting recent infection in those animals.

876,Hepatitis C Virus Core Protein Promotes miR-122 Destabilization by Inhibiting GLD-2,"The liver-specific microRNA miR-122, which has essential roles in liver development and metabolism, is a key proviral factor for hepatitis C virus (HCV). Despite its crucial role in the liver and HCV life cycle, little is known about the molecular mechanism of miR-122 expression regulation by HCV infection. Here, we show that the HCV core protein downregulates the abundance of miR-122 by promoting its destabilization via the inhibition of GLD-2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase. The decrease in miR-122 expression resulted in the dysregulation of the known functions of miR-122, including its proviral activity for HCV. By high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from human liver biopsies, we found that the 22-nucleotide (nt) prototype miR-122 is modified at its 3′ end by 3′-terminal non-templated and templated nucleotide additions. Remarkably, the proportion of miR-122 isomers bearing a single nucleotide tail of any ribonucleotide decreased in liver specimens from patients with HCV. We found that these single-nucleotide-tailed miR-122 isomers display increased miRNA activity and stability over the 22-nt prototype miR-122 and that the 3′-terminal extension is catalyzed by the unique terminal nucleotidyl transferase activity of GLD-2, which is capable of adding any single ribonucleotide without preference of adenylate to the miR-122 3′ end. The HCV core protein specifically inhibited GLD-2, and its interaction with GLD-2 in the cytoplasm was found to be responsible for miR-122 downregulation. Collectively, our results provide new insights into the regulatory role of the HCV core protein in controlling viral RNA abundance and miR-122 functions through miR-122 stability modulation.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.089804383,-0.041740972,-0.013711982,-0.05601268400000001,-0.054528662,0.007331993,0.017309507,-0.000926125,0.023241856,-0.024777657999999998,-0.025725307000000003,0.054465222,0.0037427520000000002,0.008037248,-0.028098032999999998,-0.01934768,0.027898055,0.12114968599999999,0.137288969,-0.081418579,-0.023723544,-0.016635402,0.04933938400000001,0.022339667999999997,-0.023082587999999998,-0.036712342,-0.055023548,0.037264282999999995,-0.017497392,-0.045976897

Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter (CRA) is becoming a serious concern with increasing patient morbidity, mortality, and lengths of hospital stay. Therefore, the rapid detection of CRA is essential for epidemiological surveillance. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been extensively used for the rapid identification of most pathogens. In this study, we have developed two multiplex real-time PCR assays to detect and differentiate A. baumannii and non-A. baumannii Acinetobacter spp, and common carbapenemase genes, including bla(NDM), bla(OXA-23-like), bla(OXA-40-like), bla(OXA-51-like), and bla(OXA-58-like). We demonstrate the potential utility of these assays for the direct detection of bla(NDM)-, bla(OXA-23-like)-, bla(OXA-40-like)-, bla(OXA-51-like)-, and bla(OXA-58-like)-positive CRA in clinical specimens. Primers were specifically designed, and two multiplex real-time PCR assays were developed: multiplex real-time PCR assay1 for the detection of Acinetobacter baumannii 16S–23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer sequence, the Acinetobacter recA gene, and class-B-metalloenzyme-encoding gene bla(NDM); and multiplex real-time PCR assay2 to detect class-D-oxacillinase-encoding genes (bla(OXA-23-like), bla(OXA-40-like), bla(OXA-51-like),and bla(OXA-58-like)). The assays were performed on an ABI Prism 7500 FAST Real-Time PCR System. CRA isolates were used to compare the assays with conventional PCR and sequencing. Known amounts of CRA cells were added to sputum and fecal specimens and used to test the multiplex real-time PCR assays. The results for target and nontarget amplification showed that the multiplex real-time PCR assays were specific, the limit of detection for each target was 10 copies per 20 μL reaction volume, the assays were linear over six log dilutions of the target genes (r(2) > 0.99), and the Ct values of the coefficients of variation for intra- and interassay reproducibility were less than 5%. The multiplex real-time PCR assays showed 100% concordance with conventional PCR when tested against 400 CRA isolates and their sensitivity for the target DNA in sputum and fecal specimens was 10(2) CFU/mL. Therefore, these novel multiplex real-time PCR assays allow the sensitive and specific characterization and differentiation of bla(NDM)-, bla(OXA-23-like)-, bla(OXA-40-like)-, bla(OXA-51-like)-, and bla(OXA-58-like)-positive CRA, making them potential tools for the direct detection of CRA in clinical specimens and the surveillance of nosocomial infections.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.017366242,0.027016259,0.107319295,-0.009612054,-0.013300322,0.002811389,0.004715775,-0.002357477,-0.000409876,-0.005934799,-0.033666958999999996,0.006151091,0.003505648,-0.011268851000000002,0.010826241,-0.011771047,0.014876189,-0.009318949,0.018307903,-0.08737106,0.02856469,0.011967888999999999,0.0285,-0.059992486,-0.028630739,-0.002991764,0.008158798,-0.009354396,0.021983027000000002,-0.018832854
880,Expression of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator in Ganglia of Human Gastrointestinal Tract,"CF is caused by mutations of the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) which is an anion selective transmembrane ion channel that mainly regulates chloride transport, expressed in the epithelia of various organs. Recently, we have demonstrated CFTR expression in the brain, the spinal cord and the sympathetic ganglia. This study aims to investigate the expression and distribution of CFTR in the ganglia of the human gastrointestinal tract. Fresh tissue and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded normal gastrointestinal tract samples were collected from eleven surgical patients and five autopsy cases. Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, laser-assisted microdissection and nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were performed. Expression of CFTR protein and mRNA was detected in neurons of the ganglia of all segments of the human gastrointestinal tract examined, including the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, appendix, colon and rectum. The extensive expression of CFTR in the enteric ganglia suggests that CFTR may play a role in the physiology of the innervation of the gastro-intestinal tract. The presence of dysfunctional CFTRs in enteric ganglia could, to a certain extent, explain the gastrointestinal symptoms frequently experienced by CF patients.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.001809646,-0.026670502000000002,-0.00688244,-0.123243522,-0.011618688,0.002082366,-0.010213603,-0.025142987000000002,0.011913813,-0.024793474,-0.041381884,-0.00020010700000000001,0.02136038,0.06906893,0.020050616,-0.043128285999999995,0.022719429,-0.025884057999999998,-0.022930866,-0.01692487,0.048546272,-0.02012629,-0.020576487,0.014546085,-0.014126198000000001,-0.014269526000000001,-0.033033704,0.008522382,0.025267281000000003,-0.053741078
887,Emergence of human caliciviruses among diarrhea cases in southwest China,"BACKGROUND: Acute diarrhea is one of the most serious problems in global public health that causes considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. Human caliciviruses (HuCV) including norovirus (NoV, genogroup GI and GII) and sapovirus (SaV), is a leading cause of acute sporadic diarrhea in individuals across all age groups. However, few studies had been conducted clarifying the characteristics of HuCV in diarrhea cases across all age groups in China. Our study was aimed at assessing the HuCV-related diarrhea burden and NoV genotypes distribution in southwest China. METHODS: The study was conducted in four hospitals in Kunming city, Yunnan province, from June 2014 to July 2015. Stool specimens were collected from 1,121 diarrhea cases and 319 healthy controls in outpatient departments. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect NoV (GI, GII) and SaV. Sequencing was applied to confirm the three viral infections and phylogenetic analysis was performed to determine their genotypes. A structured questionnaire was used to record the demographic information and clinical symptoms of subjects. RESULTS: HuCV was detected at an 11.0 % infection rate in 1,121 diarrhea cases and at 3.4 % rate in 319 non-diarrhea subjects (p < 0.0001, OR = 3.5, 95 % CI 1.8–6.5). The prevalence of the NoV genogroup GII and genotype GII.4 in diarrhea cases was significantly higher than that found in healthy controls (p < 0.0001, p = 0.018, respectively). NoV GII (n = 118, 10.5 %) was the most common HuCV subtype in diarrhea cases, followed by SaV (n = 3, 0.3 %) and NoV GI (n = 2, 0.2 %). Of 118 NoV GII strains isolated from diarrhea patients. GII.4 (n = 55, 46.6 %) was the predominant strain, followed by GII.3 (n = 28, 23.7 %), GII.12 (n = 25, 21.2 %), GII.17 (n = 8, 6.8 %), and GII.5 (n = 2, 1.7 %). Of the 55 GII.4 strains, the GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant had absolutely predominant prevalence (n = 52, 94.5 %), followed by the NoV GII.4-2006b variant (n = 3, 5.5 %). The GII.4 Orleans 2009 variant was not found in diarrhea cases of the study. CONCLUSIONS: NoV GII was the major genogroup and GII.4 was the most predominant strain detected in diarrhea patients. The GII.17 is an emergent variant in sporadic diarrhea and might become the predominant strain in diarrhea cases in the near future. Rapid, accurate detection kits need to be developed to help us find and treat NoV-associated diarrhea in clinical settings in a timely manner.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.036446834,-0.012588331000000001,0.021905472999999998,-0.10193736099999999,0.026142437999999997,0.018294966,0.000252748,0.0031036609999999997,-0.027248812999999997,-0.027289137999999998,0.028654615,0.099827181,-0.07743385400000001,-0.046259876,0.052560977,-0.032296097999999995,-0.035157142,0.019438232,-0.008198819,0.0036499429999999997,0.000883384,0.031376659,-0.05732894,0.04557441,0.0360009,-0.019963336,-0.003961511,0.002392995,0.006408987,0.011328185
888,Rescue of the 1947 Zika Virus Prototype Strain with a Cytomegalovirus Promoter-Driven cDNA Clone,"The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak has been linked to severe pathogenesis. Here, we report the construction of a plasmid carrying a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-expressed prototype 1947 Uganda MR766 ZIKV cDNA that can initiate infection following direct plasmid DNA transfection of mammalian cells. Incorporation of a synthetic intron in the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) region of the ZIKV polyprotein reduced viral cDNA-associated toxicity in bacteria. High levels of infectious virus were produced following transfection of the plasmid bearing the wild-type MR766 ZIKV genome, but not one with a disruption to the viral nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) polymerase active site. Multicycle growth curve and plaque assay experiments indicated that the MR766 virus resulting from plasmid transfection exhibited growth characteristics that were more similar to its parental isolate than previously published 2010 Cambodia and 2015 Brazil cDNA-rescued ZIKV. This ZIKV infectious clone will be useful for investigating the genetic determinants of ZIKV infection and pathogenesis and should be amenable to construction of diverse infectious clones expressing reporter proteins and representing a range of ZIKV isolates. IMPORTANCE The study of ZIKV, which has become increasingly important with the recent association of this virus with microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome, would benefit from an efficient strategy to genetically manipulate the virus. This work describes a model system to produce infectious virus in cell culture. We created a plasmid carrying the prototype 1947 Uganda MR766 ZIKV genome that both was stable in bacteria and could produce high levels of infectious virus in mammalian cells through direct delivery of this DNA. Furthermore, growth properties of this rescued virus closely resembled those of the viral isolate from which it was derived. This model system will provide a simple and effective means to study how ZIKV genetics impact viral replication and pathogenesis.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.08779898900000001,-0.043045525999999994,0.012671021999999999,-0.03845943,-0.054431266,0.038499372999999996,0.010729456000000002,-0.024598202000000003,0.032539496,0.04502388400000001,-0.024556909,-0.045036059,0.020490083,0.001359574,0.021084888,0.0020117620000000003,-0.023409476000000002,0.002331366,-0.023546411,0.047607424,-0.001121051,-0.000916245,0.012344405,0.014675035,0.014144728,0.049454587,0.023575658,-0.004733932,-0.09168948199999999,0.040622978
889,Human IFIT1 Inhibits mRNA Translation of Rubulaviruses but Not Other Members of the Paramyxoviridae Family,"We have previously shown that IFIT1 is primarily responsible for the antiviral action of interferon (IFN) alpha/beta against parainfluenza virus type 5 (PIV5), selectively inhibiting the translation of PIV5 mRNAs. Here we report that while PIV2, PIV5, and mumps virus (MuV) are sensitive to IFIT1, nonrubulavirus members of the paramyxoviridae such as PIV3, Sendai virus (SeV), and canine distemper virus (CDV) are resistant. The IFIT1 sensitivity of PIV5 was not rescued by coinfection with an IFIT1-resistant virus (PIV3), demonstrating that PIV3 does not specifically inhibit the antiviral activity of IFIT1 and that the inhibition of PIV5 mRNAs is regulated by cis-acting elements. We developed an in vitro translation system using purified human IFIT1 to further investigate the mechanism of action of IFIT1. While the translations of PIV2, PIV5, and MuV mRNAs were directly inhibited by IFIT1, the translations of PIV3, SeV, and CDV mRNAs were not. Using purified human mRNA-capping enzymes, we show biochemically that efficient inhibition by IFIT1 is dependent upon a 5′ guanosine nucleoside cap (which need not be N7 methylated) and that this sensitivity is partly abrogated by 2′O methylation of the cap 1 ribose. Intriguingly, PIV5 M mRNA, in contrast to NP mRNA, remained sensitive to inhibition by IFIT1 following in vitro 2′O methylation, suggesting that other structural features of mRNAs may influence their sensitivity to IFIT1. Thus, surprisingly, the viral polymerases (which have 2′-O-methyltransferase activity) of rubulaviruses do not protect these viruses from inhibition by IFIT1. Possible biological consequences of this are discussed. IMPORTANCE Paramyxoviruses cause a wide variety of diseases, and yet most of their genes encode structural proteins and proteins involved in their replication cycle. Thus, the amount of genetic information that determines the type of disease that paramyxoviruses cause is relatively small. One factor that will influence disease outcomes is how they interact with innate host cell defenses, including the interferon (IFN) system. Here we show that different paramyxoviruses interact in distinct ways with cells in a preexisting IFN-induced antiviral state. Strikingly, all the rubulaviruses tested were sensitive to the antiviral action of ISG56/IFIT1, while all the other paramyxoviruses tested were resistant. We developed novel in vitro biochemical assays to investigate the mechanism of action of IFIT1, demonstrating that the mRNAs of rubulaviruses can be directly inhibited by IFIT1 and that this is at least partially because their mRNAs are not correctly methylated.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.079373977,-0.041145962,0.000881475,-0.028496255,-0.060484653,0.039718506,0.041348775,-0.00395914,0.02066649,-0.012439038999999999,-0.029104268,-0.004593458,0.0012634389999999999,0.015344193999999999,-0.009086572,0.001199872,-0.006464374,-0.000955931,0.006022726,0.018752232,0.03837269,0.040501857999999995,0.009901827,0.028944367000000002,0.065345474,-0.049647397,-0.021651451000000002,0.00923006,0.065006627,-0.002019659
898,Detection and phylogenetic analysis of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in central China based on the ORF3 gene and the S1 gene,"BACKGROUND: Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) has increased in severity in China since 2010. To investigate further the infectivity, genetic diversity and molecular epidemiology of its causative agent, the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), we assessed 129 clinical samples, which were the intestinal tissue of piglets with severe diarrhea, from 17 cities in central China. Both the spike (S) glycoprotein (S1, 1–789 amino acids (aa)) and the full-length ORF3 gene of 21 representative field strains from 21 farms in 11 cities were sequenced and analysed. METHODS: PEDV was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and S1 and ORF3 sequences were processed by the Clustal W method via DNAMAN 8 software, and phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method using MEGA 6 software. RESULTS: The prevalence of PEDV was 92.25% and was detected in 119 of 129 samples, with 94.03% (63 of 67) of pig farms harbouring the disease. According to the phylogenetic analysis of the S1 genes, our isolates all fell into group G2 (variants) and showed a close relationship to isolates from Chinese (HN1303, CH/ZMDZY/11 and AJ1102), Korean (AD01), American (MN, IA1, IA2 and 13–019349) sources, and these isolates differed genetically from other Chinese (LZC, CH/HNZZ/2011 and SD-M) and Korean (SM98) strains as well Japanese (83-P5 and MK) strains. In addition, our isolates differed from attenuated vaccine strains, CV777 (used in China) and DR13 (used in Korea). According to our derived amino acid sequence analysis, we detected one novel variant PEDV, viz: CH/HNLY, with 4-aa insertion/deletion (RSSS/T) at position 375 and 1-aa (D) deletion at position 430 compared to the CV777 attenuated strain. These mutations were located on the receptor binding domain. Our ORF3 gene analyses showed that the prevalent PEDV isolates were variants, and the isolated strains differed genetically from the vaccine strains. CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrated the existence of genetic diversity among geographically distinct PEDV strains, and our study has provided an impetus to conduct further research on the PEDV receptor binding protein and on the new and efficacious vaccines design.

899,Interferon α Induces the Apoptosis of Cervical Cancer HeLa Cells by Activating both the Intrinsic Mitochondrial Pathway and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Induced Pathway,"The interferon α (IFN-α) has been often used as a sensitizing agent for the treatment of various malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma, malignant melanoma, and renal cell cancer by promoting the apoptosis of thesetumor cell types. However, the effect of IFN-α on cervical cancer remains unknown. In this study, HeLa cells were used as a testing model for the treatment of IFN-α on cervical cancer. The results indicate that IFN-α markedly inhibits the proliferation and induces the apoptosis of HeLa cells. The activation of caspase 3, the up-regulation of both Bim and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1, the down-regulation of Bcl-xL, as well as the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria were significantly induced upon IFN-α treatment, indicating that the intrinsic apoptotic pathway could be activated by IFN-α treatment. In addition, caspase 4—which is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis—was activated in response to IFN-α treatment. Knocking down caspase 4 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) markedly reduced the IFN-α-mediated cell apoptosis. However, no significant changes in the expressions of caspases 8 and 10 were observed upon IFN-α treatment, indicating that the apoptosis caused by IFN-α might be independent of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. These findings suggest that IFN-α may possess anti-cervical cancer capacity by activating cell apoptosis via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and caspase-4-related ER stress-induced pathway.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.081237901,-0.036409536,-0.016413633,-0.139911808,-0.130800894,0.08110189200000001,0.057591015,-0.033364166,0.07763913,-0.032033104,-0.03371573,-0.037068738999999996,-0.024384633,0.102768724,-0.01161728,0.047184214,-0.013808653999999998,-0.021753157000000002,0.00955435,-0.012439034,0.035816352,-0.021037764,0.014118567,-0.011868822,0.029927269,-0.005531291,-0.026319477,0.048767263,0.006766411,-0.088700961
904,Viral factors in influenza pandemic risk assessment,"The threat of an influenza A virus pandemic stems from continual virus spillovers from reservoir species, a tiny fraction of which spark sustained transmission in humans. To date, no pandemic emergence of a new influenza strain has been preceded by detection of a closely related precursor in an animal or human. Nonetheless, influenza surveillance efforts are expanding, prompting a need for tools to assess the pandemic risk posed by a detected virus. The goal would be to use genetic sequence and/or biological assays of viral traits to identify those non-human influenza viruses with the greatest risk of evolving into pandemic threats, and/or to understand drivers of such evolution, to prioritize pandemic prevention or response measures. We describe such efforts, identify progress and ongoing challenges, and discuss three specific traits of influenza viruses (hemagglutinin receptor binding specificity, hemagglutinin pH of activation, and polymerase complex efficiency) that contribute to pandemic risk.

908,Pseudorabies virus infection (Aujeszky’s disease) in an Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) in Spain: a case report,"BACKGROUND: The only natural hosts of Pseudorabies virus (PRV) are members of the family Suidae (Sus scrofa scrofa). In species other than suids infection is normally fatal. In these mammals, including carnivores, PRV typically causes serious neurologic disease. The endangered Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is a wild feline endemic to south-western Europe (Iberian Peninsula). The Iberian lynx was found to be the world’s most endangered felid species in 2002. In wild felines, PRV infection has only been previously reported once in a Florida panther in 1994. No seropositive lynxes have ever been found, nor has PRV been detected in dead Iberian lynxes to date. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the first reported case of pseudorabies in an Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus). Pseudorabies was diagnosed in a young wild Iberian lynx from Extremadura (SW Spain) by histopathological examination, immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequence analysis. Gross lesions included alopecia of the ventral neck, bloody gastro-intestinal contents and congestion of the brain. Histopathological analysis showed a moderate nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis with diffuse areas of demyelination, necrotizing gastritis and enteritis of the small intestine. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) antigen was found in neuronal and non-neuronal cells of the brain, tonsils, and gastric glandular epithelial cells by immunohistochemical analysis. The presence of the virus in the brain was confirmed by nested PCR. The sequence analysis of the 146 bp fragment (from the viral glycoprotein B gene) showed that the amplified sequence matched (with 100% identity) the PRV genome. Furthermore, specific DNA from glycoprotein D and E encoding-genes was detected by conventional and real-time PCR, respectively, confirming the latter that this infection was produced by a wild-type PRV strain. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the suspicion that PRV could infect the Iberian lynx. The detection of PRV in a dead Iberian lynx suggests that the virus may have a negative impact on the survival of endangered lynxes in the wild. However, because this is the first verified instance of lynx mortality resulting from pseudorabies, its true impact on the population is unknown.

911,Preparation of MS2 Phage-Like Particles and Their Use As Potential Process Control Viruses for Detection and Quantification of Enteric RNA Viruses in Different Matrices,"The detection and quantification of enteric RNA viruses is based on isolation of viral RNA from the sample followed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). To control the whole process of analysis and in order to guarantee the validity and reliability of results, process control viruses (PCV) are used. The present article describes the process of preparation and use of such PCV– MS2 phage-like particles (MS2 PLP) – in RT-qPCR detection and quantification of enteric RNA viruses. The MS2 PLP were derived from bacteriophage MS2 carrying a unique and specific de novo-constructed RNA target sequence originating from the DNA of two extinct species. The amount of prepared MS2 particles was quantified using four independent methods – UV spectrophotometry, fluorimetry, transmission electron microscopy and a specifically developed duplex RT-qPCR. To evaluate the usefulness of MS2 PLP in routine diagnostics different matrices known to harbor enteric RNA viruses (swab samples, liver tissue, serum, feces, and vegetables) were artificially contaminated with specific amounts of MS2 PLP. The extraction efficiencies were calculated for each individual matrix. The prepared particles fulfill all requirements for PCV – they are very stable, non-infectious, and are genetically distinct from the target RNA viruses. Due to these properties they represent a good morphological and physiochemical model. The use of MS2 PLP as a PCV in detection and quantification of enteric RNA viruses was evaluated in different types of matrices.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.072258752,0.002067065,0.084301683,0.057751672000000004,0.005185536,-0.031316954,0.029897748,0.02739371,-0.041754602,0.013768623999999998,0.024303311,-0.010135094,-0.000304666,0.01166877,0.036127418,0.008584589,-0.02170671,-0.013052643000000001,-0.00353313,-0.046777112999999995,-0.035308024,0.014942963,-0.021708323999999998,0.021542485,-0.035070627,-0.027984152,-0.002796968,-0.0029951170000000003,-0.014220885,-0.015585708

922,An in vivo system for directed experimental evolution of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus,"The calicivirus Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is widely used in Australia as a biocontrol agent to manage wild European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) populations. However, widespread herd immunity limits the effectiveness of the currently used strain, CAPM V-351. To overcome this, we developed an experimental platform for the selection and characterisation of novel RHDV strains. As RHDV does not replicate in cell culture, variant viruses were selected by serially passaging a highly virulent RHDV field isolate in immunologically naïve laboratory rabbits that were passively immunised 18–24 hours post-challenge with a neutralising monoclonal antibody. After seven passages, two amino acid substitutions in the P2 domain of the capsid protein became fixed within the virus population. Furthermore, a synonymous substitution within the coding sequence of the viral polymerase appeared and was also maintained in all subsequent passages. These findings demonstrate proof-of-concept that RHDV evolution can be experimentally manipulated to select for virus variants with altered phenotypes, in this case partial immune escape.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.07107973,-0.033163057999999995,0.028336225,-0.054388717,0.024285577000000003,0.069816777,-0.005561231999999999,-0.019470488,0.016368883,0.034103019,-0.008715965,0.004229672,0.004174825,-0.06296217700000001,0.034324436,-0.057096170999999994,-0.013541245,-0.00777194,-0.036797723,0.030910383,0.044729847,-0.017247894,0.019800997,0.032927088,-0.0040066120000000005,0.033641597,0.044162414000000004,-0.036250062,-0.082176731,0.011035298
924,Evaluation of biosecurity measures to prevent indirect transmission of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus,"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of biosecurity methods to mitigate the transmission of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) via farm personnel or contaminated fomites is poorly understood. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of biosecurity procedures directed at minimizing transmission via personnel following different biosecurity protocols using a controlled experimental setting. RESULTS: PEDV RNA was detected from rectal swabs of experimentally infected (INF) and sentinel pigs by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Virus shedding in INF pigs peaked at 1 day post infection (dpi) and viral RNA levels remained elevated through 19 dpi. Sentinel pigs in the low biosecurity group (LB) became PEDV positive after the first movement of study personnel from the INF group. However, rectal swabs from pigs in the medium biosecurity (MB) and high biosecurity (HB) groups were negative during the 10 consecutive days of movements and remained negative through 24 days post movement (dpm) when the first trial was terminated. Viral RNA was detected at 1 dpm through 3 dpm from the personal protective equipment (PPE) of LB personnel. In addition, at 1 dpm, 2 hair/face swabs from MB personnel were positive; however, transmission of virus was not detected. All swabs of fomite from the HB study personnel were negative. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that indirect PEDV transmission through contaminated PPE occurs rapidly (within 24 h) under modeled conditions. Biosecurity procedures such as changing PPE, washing exposed skin areas, or taking a shower are recommended for pig production systems and appear to be an effective option for lowering the risk of PEDV transmission between groups of pigs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.002014049,-0.003938481,0.035057301,-0.080086478,0.02235009,0.03531945,-0.0058662459999999994,0.036491981,-0.013510639,-0.036002074,0.07574128599999999,0.037417515,-0.143444499,0.051084222,0.220578315,-0.10495584,-0.044382319,0.008762494000000001,-0.022287047999999997,0.09829959699999999,-0.179184273,-0.062353687000000005,0.025277416,-0.078101894,-0.061461851,-0.020125371,-0.009332073,0.014156661000000001,0.030839941000000003,-0.029208747
926,Cross-sectional survey of selected enteric viruses in Polish turkey flocks between 2008 and 2011,"BACKGROUND: Enteric diseases are an important health problem for the intensive poultry industry, resulting in considerable economic losses. Apart from such microbiological agents associated with enteritis as bacteria and parasites, a lot of research has been recently conducted on viral origin of enteric diseases. However, enteric viruses have been identified in intestinal tract of not only diseased but also healthy poultry, so their role in enteritis is still unclear. The present study aimed at determination of the prevalence of four enteric viruses, namely astrovirus, coronavirus, parvovirus and rotavirus in meat-type turkey flocks in Poland as well as at statistical evaluation of the occurrence of the studied viruses and their relationships with the health status and the age of birds. Two hundred and seven flocks of birds aged 1-20 weeks originating from different regions of the country were investigated between 2008 and 2011. Clinical samples (10 individual faecal swabs/flock) were duly processed and examined using molecular methods targeting the conservative regions of viral genomes: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of astrovirus, non-structural 1 gene of parvovirus, non-structural protein 4 gene of rotavirus, and 5′ untranslated region fragment of turkey coronavirus. Different statistical methods (i.e. the independence chi-square test, the correspondence analysis and the logistic regression model) were used to establish any relationships between the analyzed data. RESULTS: Overall, 137 (66.2%, 95% CI: 59.3-72.6) of the 207 turkey flocks sampled were infected with one or more enteric viruses. Among the 137 flocks, 74 (54%, 95% CI: 45.3-62.6) were positive for one virus, whereas 54 (39.4%, 9 5% CI: 31.2-48.1) and 9 (6.6%, 95% CI: 3.1-12.1) were co-infected with two or three different enteric viruses, respectively. No flock was simultaneously infected with all four viruses studied. The prevalence of astrovirus infection was 44.9% (95% CI: 38.0-52.0), parvovirus 27.5% (95% CI: 21.6-34.2), rotavirus 18.8% (95% CI: 13.8-24.8), and coronavirus 9.7% (95% CI: 6.0-14.5). Young turkeys aged 1-4 weeks old had the highest (82.1%, 95% CI:71.7-89.8) prevalence of viral infection. Applied statistical methods have indicated the dependence of rotavirus infection as well as the co-infection with multiple viruses and the health status of turkeys. Furthermore, our results statistically confirm that especially young birds are susceptible to infection with rotavirus and astrovirus. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated the presence of astrovirus, coronavirus, parvovirus and rotavirus infections in Polish turkey farms. These viruses were detected in both healthy and diseased birds. However, the presented results provide valuable feedback which could help to evaluate the role of some enteric viruses in the etiology of enteritis in turkey.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.04412696,-0.056017754,-0.005459238000000001,-0.06087582,0.091089696,0.014603817,0.004058417,-0.025589722000000002,-0.035290891,-0.0014814960000000001,0.051028280999999995,0.037552475,-0.048928569000000005,-0.038695143,-0.038930972,0.055667531,-0.063806398,-0.11385451,0.070905551,-0.008227476,-0.12208742300000001,0.120447957,-0.022986735,0.09990656199999999,0.020649077,-0.088091167,-0.014869002,-0.234551619,-0.096607087,-0.044666091
927,"Stable Internal Reference Genes for Normalizing Real-Time Quantitative PCR in Baphicacanthus cusia under Hormonal Stimuli and UV Irradiation, and in Different Plant Organs","Baphicacanthus cusia (Nees) Bremek, the plant source for many kinds of drugs in traditional Chinese medicine, is widely distributed in South China, especially in Fujian. Recent studies about B. cusia mainly focus on its chemical composition and pharmacological effects, but further analysis of the plant's gene functions and expression is required to better understand the synthesis of its effective compounds. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a powerful method for gene expression analysis. It is necessary to select a suitable reference gene for expression normalization to ensure the accuracy of RT-qPCR results. Ten candidate reference genes were selected from the transcriptome datasets of B. cusia in this study, and the expression stability was assessed across 60 samples representing different tissues and organs under various conditions, including ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, hormonal stimuli (jasmonic acid methyl ester and abscisic acid), and in different plant organs. By employing different algorithms, such as geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper, which are complementary approaches based on different statistical procedures, 18S rRNA was found to be the most stable gene under UV irradiation and hormonal stimuli, whereas ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 was the best suitable gene for different plant organs. This novel study aimed to screen for suitable reference genes and corresponding primer pairs specifically designed for gene expression studies in B. cusia, in particular for RT-qPCR analyses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.075909907,0.026018213,0.12204190599999999,-0.067578532,-0.0017780810000000001,0.034895584,-0.000580566,-0.038964592,0.037539625,-0.044092572999999996,-0.09745217099999999,-0.022742547000000002,-0.010162951,0.050453095,-0.033546777,-0.033405074,-0.001056868,-0.025248679,-0.042606385,-0.06604136099999999,0.017587318,0.004135878,-0.004836201,0.062280859,-0.070934938,-0.026684778,0.06596872,0.029453646,0.09626837699999999,-0.018351221
928,Antiviral activity of phenanthrenes from the medicinal plant Bletilla striata against influenza A virus,"BACKGROUND: Influenza represents a serious public health concern. The emergence of resistance to anti-influenza drugs underlines the need to develop new drugs. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-influenza viral activity and possible mechanisms of 12 phenanthrenes from the medicinal plant Bletilla striata (Orchidaceae family). METHODS: Twelve phenanthrenes were isolated and identified from B. striata. Influenza virus A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2) propagated in embryonated chicken eggs was used. Phenanthrenes mixed with the virus were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then inoculated into 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs via the allantoic route to survey the antiviral activity in vivo. A (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H–tetrazolium) (MTS)-based assay was performed to evaluate the reduction of cytopathic effect induced by H3N2 on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The hemagglutination inhibition assay was used to study the blockage of virus receptors by the phenanthrenes, and the neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assay to evaluate the effects of the release of virus. The synthesis of influenza viral matrix protein mRNA in response to compound treatment was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: This study showed that phenanthrenes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12 significantly inhibited the viruses in vivo, with inhibition rates of 20.7, 79.3, 17.2, 34.5, 34.5, 34.5, 44.8, 75.9, and 34.5%, respectively. In MDCK models, the phenanthrenes did not show significant antiviral activity when administered as pretreatment, while phenanthrenes 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 10, and 11 exhibited inhibitory activities as simultaneous treatment with 50% inhibition concentration (IC(50)) ranging from 14.6 ± 2.4 to 43.3 ± 5.3 μM. The IC(50) ranged from 18.4 ± 3.1 to 42.3 ± 3.9 μM in the post-treatment assays. Compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, and 11 exhibited an inhibitory effect on NA; and compounds 2, 3, 4 6, 7, 10, and 11 resulted in the reduced transcription of virus matrix protein mRNA. However, no compound could inhibit hemagglutination by the influenza virus. CONCLUSION: Phenanthrenes from B. striata had strong anti-influenza viral activity in both embryonated eggs and MDCK models, and diphenanthrenes seemed to have stronger inhibition activity compared with monophenanthrenes.

935,Sensitivity and specificity of a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction detecting feline coronavirus mutations in effusion and serum/plasma of cats to diagnose feline infectious peritonitis,"BACKGROUND: Feline coronavirus (FCoV) exists as two pathotypes, and FCoV spike gene mutations are considered responsible for the pathotypic switch in feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) specifically designed to detect FCoV spike gene mutations at two nucleotide positions. It was hypothesized that this test would correctly discriminate feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). METHODS: The study included 63 cats with signs consistent with FIP. FIP was confirmed in 38 cats. Twenty-five control cats were definitively diagnosed with a disease other than FIP. Effusion and/or serum/plasma samples were examined by real-time RT-PCR targeting the two FCoV spike gene fusion peptide mutations M1058 L and S1060A using an allelic discrimination approach. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values including 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. RESULTS: FIPV was detected in the effusion of 25/59 cats, one of them being a control cat with chronic kidney disease. A mixed population of FIPV/FECV was detected in the effusion of 2/59 cats; all of them had FIP. RT-PCR was negative or the pathotype could not be determined in 34/59 effusion samples. In effusion, sensitivity was 68.6% (95% CI 50.7–83.2), specificity was 95.8% (95% CI 78.9–99.9). No serum/plasma samples were positive for FIPV. CONCLUSIONS: Although specificity of the test in effusions was high, one false positive result occurred. The use of serum/plasma cannot be recommended due to a low viral load in blood.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.036729996,0.035212099999999996,0.141599933,-0.148316185,0.028229497000000003,-0.000599929,-0.014481522,-0.010456553,-0.062689793,-0.191822634,0.391221294,-0.096161804,0.159427471,-0.02904616,-0.157511641,-0.007319966,0.024693987999999997,-0.031153396,0.023183343999999998,0.022617846,-0.111577929,0.034899254,0.071392847,0.080157673,-0.032652659,0.017034129,0.026206751,-0.116270446,-0.022946296,-0.037263556
940,Prevalence of enteropathogens and their antibiotic sensitivity pattern in puppies with hemorrhagic gastroenteritis,"AIM: Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (HGE) ranging from mild to severe forms is commonly encountered in puppies. The aim of the study was to identify the prevalence of common enteropathogens and the antibiotic sensitivity pattern in puppies reported with HGE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The canine HGE activity index, with little modification, was adopted to identify Grade III/severely affected puppies below 6 months of age. Fecal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was employed to screen and compare the enteropathogens in puppies with hemorrhagic diarrhea and healthy control. RESULTS: Canine parvovirus 2b was identified in 90.3% of the diarrheic and 10% of the non-diarrheic healthy puppies. Clostridium difficile was identified in all the diarrheic puppies and in 80% of the healthy puppies. Among the diarrheic puppies, 17.7% were positive for Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin, 9.7% were positive for C. perfringens alpha toxin, 6.4% were positive for Escherichia coli shiga toxin, 6.4% were positive for E. coli enterotoxin (LT), and 3.2% were positive for canine distemper virus. Whereas, none of the healthy puppies were positive for these bacteria and toxins. Fecal antibiotic sensitivity test pattern revealed gentamicin to be sensitive in 95% of the cases, azithromycin in 50%, enrofloxacin in 25%, cefotaxime in 20%, and tetracycline in 5% of the cases.

947,"Molecular characterization of infectious bronchitis viruses isolated from broiler flocks in Bushehr province, Iran: 2014 - 2015","The aim of this study was to provide information on the molecular characteristic and the phylogenic relationship of infectious bronchitis viruses (IBV) strains in Bushehr province in comparison to other strains reported in the Middle East. Samples were collected from broiler flocks in Bushehr province during 2014 - 2015. These flocks had respiratory problems such as gasping, sneezing and bronchial rales. A number of 135 tracheal swabs were taken from fifteen flocks (nine swabs per flock). Each three swabs collected from each flock were pooled in one tube (finally, we had three tubes for each flock). The samples were subjected to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The PCR products of positive samples were analyzed by sequencing of a (392 bp) segment of the spike gene and the related results were compared with the other IBV sequences in GenBank database. Samples from twelve farms (80.0%) were found to be positive. The viruses from seven farms (46.6%) were identified as field viruses closely related to variant 2. The viruses from three farms (20.0%) were characterized as Mass type and were related to vaccine strains. Two different IB viruses (variant 2 and Mass) were detected in samples from two farms (13.3%). The variant 2 genotype detected in Bushehr had high similarity to variant 2 reported from the Middle East. These variants displayed homologies ranging from 72.9% to 76.5%, and 78.8% to 80.0% with H120 and 4/91, respectively. It is necessary to design vaccination program of poultry farms using IBV strains circulating in the region.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.022266537000000003,0.00491352,0.11098831699999999,-0.075987326,0.22526635399999997,0.06868273400000001,-0.09854883099999999,-0.029776086,0.068850372,0.22427599899999998,0.092702515,0.06140029599999999,-0.090110417,0.032917133,-0.038475739,0.02871354,-0.00316141,-0.046160861,0.04804850099999999,-0.010569978,-0.011336902,0.033208654,-0.028912027000000003,0.035704659,0.022013737999999998,-0.015094596000000002,-0.01460724,0.006987352,0.029335262999999997,-0.040823336
948,Characterizing the rapid spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) through an animal food manufacturing facility,"New regulatory and consumer demands highlight the importance of animal feed as a part of our national food safety system. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the first viral pathogen confirmed to be widely transmissible in animal food. Because the potential for viral contamination in animal food is not well characterized, the objectives of this study were to 1) observe the magnitude of virus contamination in an animal food manufacturing facility, and 2) investigate a proposed method, feed sequencing, to decrease virus decontamination on animal food-contact surfaces. A U.S. virulent PEDV isolate was used to inoculate 50 kg swine feed, which was mixed, conveyed, and discharged into bags using pilot-scale feed manufacturing equipment. Surfaces were swabbed and analyzed for the presence of PEDV RNA by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Environmental swabs indicated complete contamination of animal food-contact surfaces (0/40 vs. 48/48, positive baseline samples/total baseline samples, positive subsequent samples/total subsequent samples, respectively; P < 0.05) and near complete contamination of non-animal food-contact surfaces (0/24 vs. 16/18, positive baseline samples/total baseline samples, positive subsequent samples/total subsequent samples, respectively; P < 0.05). Flushing animal food-contact surfaces with low-risk feed is commonly used to reduce cross-contamination in animal feed manufacturing. Thus, four subsequent 50 kg batches of virus-free swine feed were manufactured using the same system to test its impact on decontaminating animal food-contact surfaces. Even after 4 subsequent sequences, animal food-contact surfaces retained viral RNA (28/33 positive samples/total samples), with conveying system being more contaminated than the mixer. A bioassay to test infectivity of dust from animal food-contact surfaces failed to produce infectivity. This study demonstrates the potential widespread viral contamination of surfaces in an animal food manufacturing facility and the difficulty of removing contamination using conventional feed sequencing, which underscores the importance for preventing viruses from entering and contaminating such facilities.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.0085818,-0.004787436,0.058019647,-0.060319389,0.014058903999999999,0.025620222999999998,0.021724462000000003,0.014673262,-0.016451194,-0.004913824000000001,0.032300839,0.027970012000000002,-0.06949164299999999,0.0014202779999999999,0.130347243,-0.059955253,-0.019103775,-0.001335285,-0.015749346,0.032255683,-0.07784299900000001,-0.012687658999999999,0.000815282,-0.042453637999999995,-0.034258299,-0.009336484,-0.025687726,-0.007435398,0.012548914,-0.015637586999999998
949,Construction and characterization of an improved DNA-launched infectious clone of duck hepatitis a virus type 1,"BACKGROUND: DNA-launched infectious system is a useful tool with high rescue efficiency that allows the introduction of mutations in specific positions to investigate the function of an individual viral element. Rescued virus particles could be harvested by directly transfecting the DNA-launched recombinant plasmid to the host cells, which will reduce labor and experimental cost by skipping the in vitro transcription assay. METHODS: A total of four overlapping fragments covering the entire viral genome were amplified and then were assembled into a transformation vector based on pIRES2-EGFP to establish the DNA-launched infectious system of duck hepatitis A virus type 1 (DHAV-1), named pIR-DHAV-1. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blotting assay and indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) were conducted for rescued virus identification. A total of 4.0 μg of recombinant plasmid of pIR-DHAV-1 and in vitro transcribed product of 4.0 μg of RNA-launched infectious clone named pR-DHAV-1 were transfected into BHK-21 cells to analyze the rescue efficiency. Following that, tissue tropism of rescued virus (rDHAV-1) and parental virus (pDHAV-1) were assayed for virulence testing in 1-day-old ducklings. RESULTS: Rescued virus particles carry the designed genetic marker which could be harvested by directly transfecting pIR-DHAV-1 to BHK-21 cells. The qRT-PCR and western blotting results indicated that rDHAV-1 shared similar growth characteristics with pDHAV-1. Furthermore, DNA-launched infectious system possessed much higher rescue efficiency assay compared to RNA-launched infectious system. The mutation at position 3042 from T to C has no impact on viral replication and tissue tropism. From 1 h post infection (hpi) to 48 hpi, the viral RNA copies of rDHAV-1 in liver were the highest among the six tested tissues (with an exception of thymus at 6 hpi), while the viral RNA copy numbers in heart and kidney were alternately the lowest. CONCLUSION: We have constructed a genetically stable and highly pathogenic DNA-launched infectious clone, from which the rescued virus could be harvested by direct transfection with recombinant plasmids. rDHAV-1 shared similar growth characteristics and tissue tropism with pDHAV-1. The DNA-launched infectious system of DHAV-1 possessed higher rescue efficiency compared to the traditional RNA-launched infectious system.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.077499914,-0.01448204,0.077218161,0.012355013,-0.038232496,-0.008912163,-0.011200822,-0.019178286,0.008359255,0.042250407999999996,0.015149083,-0.057334435999999996,0.008940713000000001,0.050430327999999996,0.023782422,0.029520732,-0.024128289,-0.016988951000000002,-0.004007983,-0.006819331999999999,-0.001459846,0.00731486,0.036375456,-0.009773329,-0.05562366,0.01385271,0.015298079,0.0062459609999999995,-0.08595347,0.040586436000000004
951,No evidence of enteric viral involvement in the new neonatal porcine diarrhoea syndrome in Danish pigs,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the syndrome New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome (NNPDS) is associated with a viral aetiology. Four well-managed herds experiencing neonatal diarrhoea and suspected to be affected by NNPDS were included in a case-control set up. A total of 989 piglets were clinically examined on a daily basis. Samples from diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic piglets at the age of three to seven days were selected for extensive virological examination using specific real time polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs) and general virus detection methods. RESULTS: A total of 91.7% of the animals tested positive by reverse transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR) for porcine kobuvirus 1 (PKV-1) while 9% and 3% were found to be positive for rotavirus A and porcine teschovirus (PTV), respectively. The overall prevalence of porcine astrovirus (PAstV) was 75% with 69.8% of the PAstV positive pigs infected with PAstV type 3. No animals tested positive for rotavirus C, coronavirus (TGEV, PEDV and PRCV), sapovirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, saffoldvirus, cosavirus, klassevirus or porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). Microarray analyses performed on a total of 18 animals were all negative, as were eight animals examined by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Using Next Generation de novo sequencing (de novo NGS) on pools of samples from case animals within all herds, PKV-1 was detected in four herds and rotavirus A, rotavirus C and PTV were detected in one herd each. CONCLUSIONS: Our detailed analyses of piglets from NNPDS-affected herds demonstrated that viruses did not pose a significant contribution to NNPDS. However, further investigations are needed to investigate if a systemic virus infection plays a role in the pathogenesis of NNPDS.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.028876457999999997,0.00803743,0.079428693,-0.087215291,0.06062651,0.024653125,0.01514456,0.005386706999999999,-0.02223524,-0.031368055,0.055860380999999994,0.032603731000000004,-0.09267363599999999,0.03989879,0.18351193100000002,-0.12094680699999999,-0.008654094000000001,-0.039048777,-0.005127342,0.046880034,-0.058669505,0.017840045,-0.033083004,-0.014163691,0.03414686,-0.029817292999999998,-0.043613226,-0.031160025,-0.004237360999999999,-0.0332231
953,Peripheral immune tolerance alleviates the intracranial lipopolysaccharide injection-induced neuroinflammation and protects the dopaminergic neurons from neuroinflammation-related neurotoxicity,"BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the onset and development of neurodegeneration disorders such as Parkinson’s disease. The immune activities of the central nervous system are profoundly affected by peripheral immune activities. Immune tolerance refers to the unresponsiveness of the immune system to continuous or repeated stimulation to avoid excessive inflammation and unnecessary by-stander injury in the face of continuous antigen threat. It has been proved that the immune tolerance could suppress the development of various peripheral inflammation-related diseases. However, the role of immune tolerance in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases was not clear. METHODS: Rats were injected with repeated low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.3 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 4 days to induce peripheral immune tolerance. Neuroinflammation was produced using intracranial LPS (15 μg) injection. Inflammation cytokines were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Microglial activation were measured using immunostaining of Iba-1 and ED-1. Dopaminergic neuronal damage was evaluated using immunochemistry staining and stereological counting of TH-positive neurons. Behavioral impairment was evaluated using amphetamine-induced rotational behavioral assessment. RESULTS: Compared with the non-immune tolerated animals, pre-treatment of peripheral immune tolerance significantly decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines, suppressed the microglial activation, and increased the number of dopaminergic neuronal survival in the substantia nigra. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that peripheral immune tolerance attenuated neuroinflammation and inhibited neuroinflammation-induced dopaminergic neuronal death.

954,Effectiveness of composting as a biosecure disposal method for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)-infected pig carcasses,"BACKGROUND: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enteric disease of swine that has emerged as a worldwide threat to swine herd health and production. Substantial research has been conducted to assess viability of the virus on surfaces of vehicles and equipment, in feed and water, and on production building surfaces, but little is known about the persistence in PEDV-infected carcasses and effective disposal methods thereof. This study was conducted to quantify the persistence of PEDV RNA via quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) at various time-temperature combinations and in infected piglet carcasses subjected to composting. Although this method does not distinguish between infectious and noninfectious virus, it is a rapid and sensitive test to evaluate materials for evidence of virus genome. RESULTS: In the first study, PEDV was suspended in cell culture media at 1 × 10(5) TCID50 per sample (1 mL sample size) and subjected to various time and temperature combinations in triplicate including temperatures of 37, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70 °C and exposure times of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 14 days. At all temperatures, viral RNA copies declined over time, with the decline most marked and rapid at 65 and 70 °C. Detectable RNA did persist throughout the trial in all but the most extreme condition, where two of three samples incubated at 70 °C yielded undetectable viral RNA after 14 days. In the second study, PEDV-infected piglet carcasses were subjected to two cycles of composting lasting 36 and 37 days, respectively, for a total compost time of 73 days. Composting was performed in triplicate windrow sections housed inside biosecure, climate-controlled rooms using insulated bins designed to represent a continuous windrow compost pile. Temperatures reached 35–57 °C for 26 days of cycle 1 and 35–45 °C for 3 days of cycle 2. Samples consisting of carbon material with or without decomposed tissue as available per sample site collected at ten locations throughout the cross-section of each windrow section following the primary and secondary compost cycles yielded no detectable viral RNA. CONCLUSIONS: Composting appears to be an effective disposal method for PEDV-infected piglet carcasses under the conditions examined. The combination of time and high temperature of the compost cycle effectively degraded viral RNA in cell culture media that should provide optimum stability. Complex compost material matrices collected from windrow sections yielded undetectable PEDV RNA by qRT-PCR after one 36-day compost cycle despite incomplete decomposition of soft tissue.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.024839611,0.005804841999999999,0.088905645,-0.017128367,-0.010124351,-0.005771391999999999,-0.021267895,0.003539875,-0.026084291000000003,0.000478348,0.069857661,0.021749445,-0.133249981,0.085750978,0.224249941,-0.11881381699999999,-0.063630215,0.021904249,-0.008227876,0.11541859300000001,-0.185703531,-0.050908967,0.05820505,-0.09093863,-0.107041267,-0.024910472000000003,-0.002154847,0.022280465,0.025092893999999998,0.007411877
955,Evaluation of an accelerated hydrogen peroxide disinfectant to inactivate porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in swine feces on aluminum surfaces under freezing conditions,"BACKGROUND: Since its emergence in 2013, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) spread rapidly throughout the country due, in part, to contaminated livestock trailers. The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of an accelerated hydrogen peroxide (AHP) disinfectant for inactivating PEDV in swine feces on metal surfaces under freezing conditions. One 15.24 X 15.24 X 2.54 cm aluminum coupon, contaminated with swine feces, and randomly matched to one pig was the experimental unit. Eight treatment groups representing two AHP concentrations (1:16 and 1:32) in a 10% propylene glycol solution, two contact times in a -10 °C freezer (40 min and 60 min), and two levels of fecal contamination (5 mL and 10 mL) in addition to negative and positive control groups were evaluated. Forty 3-week-old pigs, intragastrically inoculated with the contents of the coupons after treatment, were used as a bioassay to determine the infectivity of PEDV after treatment. Infectivity was determined by detection of virus with a nucleocapsid (N) gene-based quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) on rectal swabs collected from the inoculated pigs on days three and seven post-inoculation. RESULTS: All post-treatment swabs from the negative control coupons were negative for PEDV via RT-qPCR. All post-treatment swabs collected from coupons in the AHP disinfectant treatment groups and the positive control group were positive for PEDV via RT-qPCR. For the bioassay, no rectal swabs from pigs in the negative control (0 of 4) or the AHP disinfectant treatment groups (0 of 32) were positive for PEDV. Rectal swabs from all pigs within the positive control group (4 of 4) were positive for PEDV by RT-qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, 1:16 and 1:32 dilutions of the AHP disinfectant successfully inactivated PEDV in swine feces on metal surfaces when applied at -10 °C with 40 or 60 min of contact time. This study also suggests that a positive RT-qPCR result for PEDV on an environmental sample should be expected when the AHP disinfectant is applied under freezing conditions, but does not necessarily indicate that an infectious dose of PEDV remains after disinfection.

959,"Clinical, pathological, and molecular investigation of Mycoplasma pulmonis-induced murine respiratory mycoplasmosis in a rat (Rattus norvegicus) colony","AIM: Mycoplasma pulmonis (MP) remains potentially important rodent pathogen causing murine respiratory mycoplasmosis (MRM) which may go undiagnosed due to its asymptomatic nature. In the present study, we carried out clinical, pathological, and molecular investigations of MP-induced MRM in a rat colony. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two female Wistar rats were observed to be diseased in animal facility of NISER, Bhubaneswar, and were kept in isolation for further investigation. Both the animals were found to be positive for MP after serological and molecular tests. Thereafter, whole rat colony comprising of 36 animals was segregated based on clinical symptoms and further sampled for histopathological, serological, and molecular investigations. Tracheal washing and infected lung tissue were collected during necropsy examination for DNA extraction. Molecular diagnosis was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using species-specific primers. RESULT:: Classical symptoms of MP-associated respiratory tract infection were observed in only 2 of 36 infected animals, and most of the animals were found asymptomatic to the disease; however, all the animals were found to be carrier after necropsy and PCR assay. Gross and histopathological finding suggested severe congestion of the lungs along with suppurative and necrotizing pneumonia. The disease is confirmed by molecular diagnosis using species-specific primers in PCR assay. CONCLUSION: MRM may go undiagnosed due to asymptomatic nature.

962,A Low-Cost Palmtop High-Speed Capillary Electrophoresis Bioanalyzer with Laser Induced Fluorescence Detection,"In this work, we developed a miniaturized palmtop high-speed capillary electrophoresis (CE) system integrating whole modules, including picoliter-scale sample injection, short capillary-based fast CE, high-voltage power supply, orthogonal laser induced fluorescence (LIF) detection, battery, system control, on-line data acquisition, processing, storage, and display modules. A strategy of minimalist miniaturization combining minimal system design and low-cost system construction was adopted to achieve the instrument miniaturization with extremely low cost, which is differing from the current microfabrication strategy used in most reported miniaturized CE systems. With such a strategy, the total size of the bioanalyzer was minimized to 90 × 75 × 77 mm (length × width × height) and the instrument cost was reduced to ca. $500, which demonstrated the smallest and lowest-cost CE instrument with LIF detection in so far reported systems. The present bioanalyzer also exhibited comparable analytical performances to previously-reported high-speed CE systems. A limit of detection of 1.02 nM sodium fluorescein was obtained. Fast separations were achieved for multiple types of samples as amino acids, amino acid enantiomers, DNA fragments, and proteins with high efficiency. We applied this instrument in colorectal cancer diagnosis for detecting KRAS mutation status by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.029930021,0.006560633000000001,0.09289398300000001,-0.032936241,-0.04171467,0.008883214,0.028772621,0.001228545,0.002310682,0.006934526,-0.029447091,0.016639539,0.019887079,-0.08853986900000001,0.004584739,0.024186427000000003,-0.023046973,-0.021017023,-0.020692443,-0.040356491,-0.01695192,-0.039882577,0.018267253,-0.028923585,-0.0017193070000000002,-0.0037941259999999997,-0.029485794,-0.007542349,-0.044470032,0.011992926000000001
964,Molecular analysis of carnivore Protoparvovirus detected in white blood cells of naturally infected cats,"BACKGROUND: Cats are susceptible to feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) and canine parvovirus (CPV) variants 2a, 2b and 2c. Detection of FPV and CPV variants in apparently healthy cats and their persistence in white blood cells (WBC) and other tissues when neutralising antibodies are simultaneously present, suggest that parvovirus may persist long-term in the tissues of cats post-infection without causing clinical signs. The aim of this study was to screen a population of 54 cats from Sardinia (Italy) for the presence of both FPV and CPV DNA within buffy coat samples using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The DNA viral load, genetic diversity, phylogeny and antibody titres against parvoviruses were investigated in the positive cats. RESULTS: Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 DNA was detected in nine cats (16.7%). Viral DNA was reassembled to FPV in four cats and to CPV (CPV-2b and 2c) in four cats; one subject showed an unusually high genetic complexity with mixed infection involving FPV and CPV-2c. Antibodies against parvovirus were detected in all subjects which tested positive to DNA parvoviruses. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of FPV and CPV DNA in the WBC of asymptomatic cats, despite the presence of specific antibodies against parvoviruses, and the high genetic heterogeneity detected in one sample, confirmed the relevant epidemiological role of cats in parvovirus infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.01355269,-0.012183801000000001,0.09327787400000001,-0.159520965,0.000130384,0.023344432000000002,0.074432017,0.001163409,-0.040432016,-0.114831295,0.304176102,-0.099707714,0.152420671,-0.06313313799999999,-0.070411595,-0.012045665,-0.014659574,-0.07043553799999999,0.07551461200000001,0.083350349,0.06864580099999999,0.037084631,-0.0019228189999999999,-0.009670618,0.011075322,-0.050731425999999996,-0.07880609599999999,0.054653321,-0.04807953400000001,0.059487675
968,Clinical implications of rapid ePlex® Respiratory Pathogen Panel testing compared to laboratory-developed real-time PCR,"Rapid diagnosis of respiratory infections is of great importance for adequate isolation and treatment. Due to the batch-wise testing, laboratory-developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays (LDT) often result in a time to result of one day. Here, LDT was compared with rapid ePlex® Respiratory Pathogen (RP) Panel testing of GenMark Diagnostics (Carlsbad, CA, USA) with regard to time to result, installed isolation precautions, and antibacterial/antiviral treatment. Between January and March 2017, 68 specimens of 64 patients suspected of an acute respiratory infection were tested with LDT and the ePlex® RP panel. The time to result was calculated as the time between sample reception and result reporting. Information regarding isolation and antibacterial/antiviral treatment was obtained from the patient records. Thirty specimens tested LDT positive (47%) and 29 ePlex® RP panel positive (45%). The median time to result was 27.1 h (range 6.5–96.6) for LDT versus 3.4 h (range 1.5–23.6) for the RP panel, p-value < 0.001. In 14 out of 30 patients, isolation was discontinued based on the ePlex® RP panel results, saving 21 isolation days. ePlex® RP panel test results were available approximately one day ahead of the LDT results in the 19 patients receiving antiviral/antibacterial treatment. In addition, two bacterial pathogens, not requested by the physician, were detected using the RP panel. Analysis of respiratory infections with the ePlex® RP panel resulted in a significant decrease in time to result, enabling a reduction in isolation days in half of the patients. Furthermore, syndromic RP panel testing increased the identification of causative pathogens.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.09225441300000001,0.008215186,0.019051973,-0.051574685999999995,-0.065830695,-0.010785776,0.001043622,0.058573637000000005,-0.037495406,0.043627902,-0.013696244,0.013060066,0.017712665,0.001883087,0.020061779,-0.007791903,0.004459221,0.038305041,0.041444932000000004,-0.045837204000000006,0.042034799000000005,-0.062707057,-0.005351275,-0.097421195,0.005169121,0.013814807,-0.011319508999999998,-0.036635219,0.018045136,-0.027928752999999997
970,Identification of a novel compound targeting the nuclear export of influenza A virus nucleoprotein,"Although antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of influenza infection, it is an urgent requirement to develop new antiviral drugs regarding the emergence of drug‐resistant viruses. The nucleoprotein (NP) is conserved among all influenza A viruses (IAVs) and has no cellular equivalent. Therefore, NP is an ideal target for the development of new IAV inhibitors. In this study, we identified a novel anti‐influenza compound, ZBMD‐1, from a library of 20,000 compounds using cell‐based influenza A infection assays. We found that ZBMD‐1 inhibited the replication of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A virus strains in vitro, with an IC (50) ranging from 0.41–1.14 μM. Furthermore, ZBMD‐1 inhibited the polymerase activity and specifically impaired the nuclear export of NP. Further investigation indicated that ZBMD‐1 binds to the nuclear export signal 3 (NES3) domain and the dimer interface of the NP pocket. ZBMD‐1 also protected mice that were challenged with lethal doses of A/PR/8/1934 (H1N1) virus, effectively relieving lung histopathology changes, as well as strongly inhibiting the expression of pro‐inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, without inducing toxicity effects in mice. These results suggest that ZBMD‐1 is a promising anti‐influenza compound which can be further investigated as a useful strategy against IAVs in the future.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.016234979,-0.082889609,-0.03650096,0.105851501,-0.126167649,0.324045089,-0.040632662,-0.02672535,0.029722147999999997,-0.058928957000000004,-0.011879269,0.035065776,0.0054634290000000005,0.0302828,-0.015213589,-0.009350509,-0.015200616,0.06265287,0.045789446,-0.010637483,0.02044572,0.01412892,0.014498098999999999,0.039499917999999995,0.024203405,0.021154633,0.010861445,-0.010385996,0.07327336200000001,0.045016434
973,Near-Patient Sampling to Assist Infection Control—A Case Report and Discussion,"Air sampling as an aid to infection control is still in an experimental stage, as there is no consensus about which air samplers and pathogen detection methods should be used, and what thresholds of specific pathogens in specific exposed populations (staff, patients, or visitors) constitutes a true clinical risk. This case report used a button sampler, worn or held by staff or left free-standing in a fixed location, for environmental sampling around a child who was chronically infected by a respiratory adenovirus, to determine whether there was any risk of secondary adenovirus infection to the staff managing the patient. Despite multiple air samples taken on difference days, coinciding with high levels of adenovirus detectable in the child’s nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs), none of the air samples contained any detectable adenovirus DNA using a clinically validated diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Although highly sensitive, in-house PCR assays have been developed to detect airborne pathogen RNA/DNA, it is still unclear what level of specific pathogen RNA/DNA constitutes a true clinical risk. In this case, the absence of detectable airborne adenovirus DNA using a conventional diagnostic assay removed the requirement for staff to wear surgical masks and face visors when they entered the child’s room. No subsequent staff infections or outbreaks of adenovirus have so far been identified.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.05167352,0.007286684,0.081265056,-0.016806278,-0.024484053999999998,-0.031796694,0.029396514,0.021743528999999998,-0.019713793,0.032175866000000004,-0.0013370489999999999,-0.034985023,0.015965343,-0.025471677999999998,0.034825771,0.006284481,-0.040396237,-0.033792254,0.011690778999999998,-0.065490439,-0.000677165,0.051030055,0.018211094,-0.028521023,-0.028897022999999997,-0.018286621,-0.04598465400000001,0.050098535,-0.055157597,-0.019344562
974,Epidemiological study of hemotropic mycoplasmas (hemoplasmas) in cats from central Spain,"BACKGROUND: Hemotropic mycoplasmas (hemoplasmas) have been found infecting cats worldwide. However, studies about feline hemoplasma infections in Spain are scarce. Therefore, the purpose of the research was to evaluate the prevalence of feline hemotropic mycoplasmas and to characterize risk factors and clinical findings associated with these infections in a cat population from the Madrid area, Spain. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to detect Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf), “Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum” (CMhm) and “Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis” (CMt) in blood samples from 456 client-owned and 138 stray cats from Madrid. In order to assess associations between these hemoplasma infections and epidemiological parameters, data regarding signalment, environment, prophylaxis measures, retrovirus status, clinical signs and laboratory findings were compiled, whenever possible. RESULTS: DNA of feline hemoplasmas was detected from the blood of 63 out of 594 cats (10.6%), with a prevalence of 3.7% (22/594) for Mhf, 8.1% (48/594) for CMhm and 0.5% (3/594) for CMt. Stray cats had statistically higher prevalences of feline hemoplasmas (15.9%) and, specifically, of Mhf (8.7%) than client-owned cats (9 and 2.2%, respectively). A total of seven cats (1.17%) were co-infected with “Candidatus M. haemominutum” and M. haemofelis, two (0.33%) with “Candidatus M. haemominutum” and “Candidatus M. turicensis” and another one (0.17%) with M. haemofelis and Candidatus “M. turicensis”. Male gender, collection of blood during warm months and FeLV/FIV positivity status were associated with hemotropic mycoplasma infection in cats from Madrid. Additionally, within the group of client-owned cats, hemoplasma infection was associated with adult age, outdoor access, and the existence of low haematocrit, erythrocyte count and haemoglobin concentration values. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first epidemiological survey of feline hemoplasmas performed in central Spain (Madrid). Our study confirms that “Ca. Mycoplasma haemominutum”, Mycoplasma haemofelis and “Ca. Mycoplasma turicensis” are infecting client-owned and stray cats in this region of Spain, “Ca. Mycoplasma haemominutum” being the most prevalent species.

975,"Avian viral surveillance in Victoria, Australia, and detection of two novel avian herpesviruses","Viruses in avian hosts can pose threats to avian health and some have zoonotic potential. Hospitals that provide veterinary care for avian patients may serve as a site of exposure of other birds and human staff in the facility to these viruses. They can also provide a useful location to collect samples from avian patients in order to examine the viruses present in wild birds. This study aimed to investigate viruses of biosecurity and/or zoonotic significance in Australian birds by screening samples collected from 409 birds presented to the Australian Wildlife Health Centre at Zoos Victoria’s Healesville Sanctuary for veterinary care between December 2014 and December 2015. Samples were tested for avian influenza viruses, herpesviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses, using genus- or family-wide polymerase chain reaction methods coupled with sequencing and phylogenetic analyses for detection and identification of both known and novel viruses. A very low prevalence of viruses was detected. Columbid alphaherpesvirus 1 was detected from a powerful owl (Ninox strenua) with inclusion body hepatitis, and an avian paramyxovirus most similar to Avian avulavirus 5 was detected from a musk lorikeet (Glossopsitta concinna). Two distinct novel avian alphaherpesviruses were detected in samples from a sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita) and a tawny frogmouth (Podargus strigoides). Avian influenza viruses and avian coronaviruses were not detected. The clinical significance of the newly detected viruses remains undetermined. Further studies are needed to assess the host specificity, epidemiology, pathogenicity and host-pathogen relationships of these novel viruses. Further genome characterization is also indicated, and would be required before these viruses can be formally classified taxonomically. The detection of these viruses contributes to our knowledge on avian virodiversity. The low level of avian virus detection, and the absence of any viruses with zoonotic potential, suggests low risk to biosecurity and human health.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.048300059000000006,-0.04258619599999999,0.020240386000000003,0.088839051,0.12117803699999999,0.14134855699999999,0.054024563,0.029508332999999998,-0.06414109900000001,0.091108811,-0.008115575,-0.018444981000000003,0.03420067,0.024620446,0.020758178999999998,-0.010616955,-0.013888446,-0.046904176,0.012011148999999999,0.022489231000000002,0.036690466,0.024566887000000003,-0.06458145400000001,0.087535456,-0.060904707,-0.02193946,-0.028790142,-0.001103162,-0.023067171,-0.116116229
977,Comparison of Respiratory Pathogen Detection in Upper versus Lower Respiratory Tract Samples Using the BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel in the Immunocompromised Host,"BACKGROUND: The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (FARP) (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc.) is a multiplex, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique that can detect 17 respiratory viruses and 3 bacterial targets in a single reaction. Immunocompromised hosts (ICH) with respiratory illnesses often undergo bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). This prospective study aimed to evaluate the yield and concordance of NP and BAL FARP testing when performed on the same patient concurrently. METHODS: From February to December 2016, 125 patients (100 ICH and 25 non-ICH) were enrolled. NP swabs and BAL samples were sent for FARP testing. RESULTS: The yield of the BAL FARP among ICH and non-ICH was 24% (24/100) and 8% (2/25), respectively. The yield of positive NP swabs in ICH was 27% (27/100) versus 4% (1/25) in non-ICH. The majority of patients (89%; 111/125) had concordant results between NP and BAL specimens. Of the 24 ICH patients who had a positive BAL FARP, the majority (79%) had the same pathogen detected from the NP swab. CONCLUSION: The FARP may be useful in the ICH. Given the high concordance, in patients whom a pathogen is identified on the NP FARP, a FARP performed on BAL will likely yield the same result. However, if the NP FARP is negative, performing the test on a BAL sample may have an incremental yield.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.051183775,-0.016442379,0.003383345,-0.071226941,-0.030044872,-0.009191423,-0.005270655999999999,0.037295953,-0.04313735,0.005277325,-0.013918482,0.026547953,-0.011266928999999998,0.0011870160000000002,-1.92e-05,0.005778622,0.012743184,0.00093043,0.001037276,-0.034679069,0.019772428999999998,-0.030829062999999997,0.004833132,-0.039229613999999996,0.017827535,0.0040146,-0.023543419,-0.014748505,-0.014784195,-0.033212631
980,Enteric Virus Diversity Examined by Molecular Methods in Brazilian Poultry Flocks,"Enteric viruses play an important role in the Brazilian poultry industry due to the economic impact of resulting low yields of broilers, layers, and breeders. The most common enteric viruses affecting commercial flocks in Brazil include Fowl Adenovirus of group I (FAdV-I), Chicken Parvovirus (ChPV), Chicken Astrovirus (CAstV), Avian Nephritis Virus (ANV), Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), Avian Reovirus (AReo), and Avian Rotavirus (ARtV). The aim of this study was to identify single and multiple infections using data obtained from 270 samples from eleven Brazilian states, corresponding to the period between 2010 and 2017. This was accompanied by an analysis of the relationship between the age of birds, clinical signs, and geographical distribution, using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) techniques. Twenty-five profiles of virus combinations were detected. Single infections were encountered in 86.3% of samples, and multiple infections were present in the remaining 13.7%. Both single and multiple infections affected all kinds of commercial chickens with digestive problems, stunting syndrome, decreases in egg and meat production, increased mortality, and respiratory signs.

981,Differential Shape of Geminivirus Mutant Spectra Across Cultivated and Wild Hosts With Invariant Viral Consensus Sequences,"Geminiviruses (family Geminiviridae) possess single-stranded circular DNA genomes that are replicated by cellular polymerases in plant host cell nuclei. In their hosts, geminivirus populations behave as ensembles of mutant and recombinant genomes, known as viral quasispecies. This favors the emergence of new geminiviruses with altered host range, facilitating new or more severe diseases or overcoming resistance traits. In warm and temperate areas several whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses of the genus Begomovirus cause the tomato yellow leaf curl disease (TYLCD) with significant economic consequences. TYLCD is frequently controlled in commercial tomatoes by using the dominant Ty-1 resistance gene. Over a 45 day period we have studied the diversification of three begomoviruses causing TYLCD: tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV) and tomato yellow leaf curl Malaga virus (TYLCMaV, a natural recombinant between TYLCV and TYLCSV). Viral quasispecies resulting from inoculation of geminivirus infectious clones were examined in plants of susceptible tomato (ty-1/ty-1), heterozygous resistant tomato (Ty-1/ty-1), common bean, and the wild reservoir Solanum nigrum. Differences in virus fitness across hosts were observed while viral consensus sequences remained invariant. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of the quasispecies were high, especially in common bean and the wild host. Interestingly, the presence or absence of the Ty-1 allele in tomato did not lead to differences in begomovirus mutant spectra. However, the fitness decrease of TYLCSV and TYLCV in tomato at 45 dpi might be related to an increase in CP (Coat protein) mutation frequency. In Solanum nigrum the recombinant TYLCMaV, which showed lower fitness than TYLCSV, at 45 dpi actively explored Rep (Replication associated protein) ORF but not the overlapping C4. Our results underline the importance of begomovirus mutant spectra during infections. This is especially relevant in the wild reservoir of the viruses, which has the potential to maintain highly diverse mutant spectra without modifying their consensus sequences.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.07703462900000001,-0.043437559,-0.004720552,-0.025942736,0.003611362,0.040855164,0.052535885,-0.004369213,0.006201757,0.032659667999999996,-0.018007229,-0.019604279,0.00452619,-0.011613761,0.002834797,0.007918876,-0.018439202,-0.01539077,-0.034841603,0.033878908,0.022148654,-0.00649132,-0.029023887,0.062907122,-0.037488044,0.002236105,0.031956854,-0.034669282,-0.03371356,-0.012487881000000001
982,Expression Profiles of mRNA and lncRNA in HCT-8 Cells Infected With Cryptosporidium parvum IId Subtype,"Cryptosporidium parvum is one of the most important enteric protozoan pathogens, responsible for severe diarrhea in immunocompromised human and livestock. However, few effective agents were available for controlling this parasite. Accumulating evidences suggest that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) played key roles in many diseases through regulating the gene expression. Here, the expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs were analyzed in HCT-8 cells infected with C. parvum IId subtype using microarray assay. A total of 821 lncRNAs and 1,349 mRNAs were differentially expressed in infected cells at 24 h post infection (pi). Of them, all five types of lncRNAs were identified, including 22 sense, 280 antisense, 312 intergenic, 44 divergent, 33 intronic lncRNAs, and 130 lncRNAs that were not found the relationship with mRNAs’ location. Additionally, real-time polymerase chain reactions of 10 lncRNAs and 10 mRNAs randomly selected were successfully confirmed the microarray results. The co-expression and target prediction analysis indicated that 27 mRNAs were cis-regulated by 29 lncRNAs and 109 were trans-regulated by 114 lncRNAs. These predicted targets were enriched in several pathways involved in the interaction between host and C. parvum, e.g., hedgehog signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, and tight junction, suggesting that these differentially expressed lncRNAs would play important regulating roles during the infection of C. parvum IId subtype.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.065693153,-0.030534087,0.013131921000000001,-0.089620928,-0.039618297000000004,0.022095899,0.012563961,-0.015456308,0.03009915,-0.044536898,-0.051435133,-0.019427975,-0.009456252,0.037544939,0.008756758,0.0043296179999999995,-0.012469168999999999,-0.02428026,-0.006672499,-0.018835615,0.020233045,0.010654278,-0.007653615,-0.017465891,-0.01515491,-0.047742612000000004,-0.003656017,0.009856875,0.045880357999999996,-0.020427581
985,Inhibition of enterovirus 71 replication and viral 3C protease by quercetin,"BACKGROUND: Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of the major causative agents of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), which is sometimes associated with severe central nervous system disease in children. There is currently no specific medication for EV71 infection. Quercetin, one of the most widely distributed flavonoids in plants, has been demonstrated to inhibit various viral infections. However, investigation of the anti-EV71 mechanism has not been reported to date. METHODS: The anti-EV71 activity of quercetin was evaluated by phenotype screening, determining the cytopathic effect (CPE) and EV71-induced cells apoptosis. The effects on EV71 replication were evaluated further by determining virus yield, viral RNA synthesis and protein expression, respectively. The mechanism of action against EV71 was determined from the effective stage and time-of-addition assays. The possible inhibitory functions of quercetin via viral 2Apro, 3C(pro) or 3D(pol) were tested. The interaction between EV71 3C(pro) and quercetin was predicted and calculated by molecular docking. RESULTS: Quercetin inhibited EV71-mediated cytopathogenic effects, reduced EV71 progeny yields, and prevented EV71-induced apoptosis with low cytotoxicity. Investigation of the underlying mechanism of action revealed that quercetin exhibited a preventive effect against EV71 infection and inhibited viral adsorption. Moreover, quercetin mediated its powerful therapeutic effects primarily by blocking the early post-attachment stage of viral infection. Further experiments demonstrated that quercetin potently inhibited the activity of the EV71 protease, 3C(pro), blocking viral replication, but not the activity of the protease, 2A(pro), or the RNA polymerase, 3D(pol). Modeling of the molecular binding of the 3C(pro)-quercetin complex revealed that quercetin was predicted to insert into the substrate-binding pocket of EV71 3C(pro), blocking substrate recognition and thereby inhibiting EV71 3C(pro) activity. CONCLUSIONS: Quercetin can effectively prevent EV71-induced cell injury with low toxicity to host cells. Quercetin may act in more than one way to deter viral infection, exhibiting some preventive and a powerful therapeutic effect against EV71. Further, quercetin potently inhibits EV71 3C(pro) activity, thereby blocking EV71 replication.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.076011567,-0.036386872,-0.015202872,-0.051765150999999995,-0.087711665,0.031149182,0.048894055,-0.020197665,0.039609218,-0.011067826999999999,-0.011855943,0.014404768,-0.015621201000000001,0.023560876,-0.014841222,0.013959891,0.012164465,0.021537732999999996,0.009796651,-0.022251165,-0.008632096,0.004041436,-0.020174092,0.014137213999999999,0.041748931,0.018701376000000002,-0.020366072,0.016997234,0.009702231,-0.029074991
987,Enhanced pathogenicity of low-pathogenic H9N2 avian influenza virus after vaccination with infectious bronchitis live attenuated vaccine,"AIM: In the present study, two experiments were carried out for studying the pathogenicity of H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) in broiler chickens after vaccination with different live respiratory viral vaccines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicks were divided into four groups in each experiment. In experiment 1, Groups 1 and 2 were inoculated with H9N2 AIV through nasal route in 1 day old, Groups 1 and 3 were vaccinated with live infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) vaccine in 5 days old, and Group 4 was left as a negative control. In experiment 2, Groups 5 and 6 were inoculated with AIV subtype H9N2 through nasal route in 1 day old, Group 5 was vaccinated with live IBV vaccine and live Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine in 5 and 18 days old, respectively, Groups 6 and 7 were vaccinated with live NDV vaccine in 18 days old, and Group 8 was left as a negative control. Chicks were kept in isolators for 18 days in the first experiment and 35 days in the second experiment. Tracheal and cloacal swabs were collected from 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, and 15 day’s old chicks from all groups in experiment 1 and 21, 23, 25, and 28 days old from all groups in experiment 2. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was applied on the collected tracheal swabs for detecting RNA copies of H9N2 AIV. Cloacal swabs and the positive rRT-PCR tracheal swabs were inoculated in 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) to confirm rRT-PCR results. Internal organs (kidney, trachea, and spleen) from all chicken groups were collected weekly for histopathological examination to determine severity of the lesions. Serum samples were collected on a weekly basis for the detection of humoral immune response against H9N2, NDV, and IBV from all chicken groups. RESULTS: rRT-PCR results with virus titration in ECEs revealed a significant increase in H9N2 AIV titer with extension in the period of viral shedding in Groups 1 and 5. Severe lesion score was observed for Groups 1 and 5. The humoral immune response against H9N2 AIV, NDV, and IBV revealed a significant increase in H9N2 AIV titer in Groups 1 and 5, NDV titer showed a significant increase in Group 7, and IBV titer increased in Groups 1, 3, and 5. CONCLUSION: Results demonstrated the increase in pathogenicity of H9N2 AIV, especially when H9N2-infected chicks vaccinated with live IBV vaccine.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.021268787999999997,-0.0166668,0.048011369000000005,-0.10142020199999999,0.074427263,0.08540191,-0.09344968699999999,-0.038634094,0.048111617,0.154976093,0.085877185,-0.0042081290000000006,-0.097644705,0.053536423,-0.049911607000000004,0.096350694,-0.003318342,-0.0190053,0.027101458,-0.0039920070000000005,-0.058438619000000004,-0.043717927000000004,-0.004421967,-0.059002007,-0.008821686,0.008028862,-0.022180996,-0.014051671000000002,0.024082579,-0.034951271
988,Coxsackievirus A6 Induces Cell Cycle Arrest in G0/G1 Phase for Viral Production,"Recent epidemiological data indicate that outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), which can be categorized according to its clinical symptoms as typical or atypical, have markedly increased worldwide. A primary causative agent for typical HFMD outbreaks, enterovirus 71 (EV71), has been shown to manipulate the cell cycle in S phase for own replication; however, it is not clear whether coxsackievirus (CVA6), the main agent for atypical HFMD, also regulates the host cell cycle. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that CVA6 infection arrests the host cell cycle in G0/G1-phase. Furthermore, synchronization in G0/G1 phase, but not S phase or G2/M phase, promotes viral production. To investigate the mechanism of cell cycle arrest induced by CVA6 infection, we analyzed cell cycle progression after cell cycle synchronization at G0/G1 or G2/M. Our results demonstrate that CVA6 infection promotes G0/G1 phase entry from G2/M phase, and inhibits G0/G1 exit into S phase. In line with its role to arrest cells in G0/G1 phase, the expression of cyclinD1, CDK4, cyclinE1, CDK2, cyclinB1, CDK1, P53, P21, and P16 is regulated by CVA6. Finally, the non-structural proteins of CVA6, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D and protease 3C , are demonstrated to be responsible for the G0/G1-phase arrest. These findings suggest that CVA6 infection arrested cell cycle in G0/G1-phase via non-structural proteins 3D and 3C, which may provide favorable environments for virus production.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.078525535,-0.032827003,-0.019393883,-0.076658191,-0.085316274,0.040302886,0.045883006,-0.026012707000000003,0.031481964,0.003822585,-0.024323332000000003,-0.008124258,-0.015152003999999998,0.045998405,0.007663766999999999,0.019070437,0.006755318000000001,-0.016813353,-0.009088836,0.008850773000000001,0.011152201,-0.002586351,-0.024308262999999997,-0.031366042000000004,0.017487304,0.028335721,-0.013067075,0.037826667,-0.024912699,-0.043297304
989,Overview of Trends in the Application of Metagenomic Techniques in the Analysis of Human Enteric Viral Diversity in Africa’s Environmental Regimes,"There has been an increase in the quest for metagenomics as an approach for the identification and study of the diversity of human viruses found in aquatic systems, both for their role as waterborne pathogens and as water quality indicators. In the last few years, environmental viral metagenomics has grown significantly and has enabled the identification, diversity and entire genome sequencing of viruses in environmental and clinical samples extensively. Prior to the arrival of metagenomics, traditional molecular procedures such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing, were mostly used to identify and classify enteric viral species in different environmental milieu. After the advent of metagenomics, more detailed reports have emerged about the important waterborne viruses identified in wastewater treatment plant effluents and surface water. This paper provides a review of methods that have been used for the concentration, detection and identification of viral species from different environmental matrices. The review also takes into consideration where metagenomics has been explored in different African countries, as well as the limitations and challenges facing the approach. Procedures including sample processing, experimental design, sequencing technology, and bioinformatics analysis are discussed.

990,Potential Therapeutic Agents for Feline Calicivirus Infection,"Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a major cause of upper respiratory tract disease in cats, with widespread distribution in the feline population. Recently, virulent systemic diseases caused by FCV infection has been associated with mortality rates up to 50%. Currently, there are no direct-acting antivirals approved for the treatment of FCV infection. Here, we tested 15 compounds from different antiviral classes against FCV using in vitro protein and cell culture assays. After the expression of FCV protease-polymerase protein, we established two in vitro assays to assess the inhibitory activity of compounds directly against the FCV protease or polymerase. Using this recombinant enzyme, we identified quercetagetin and PPNDS as inhibitors of FCV polymerase activity (IC(50) values of 2.8 μM and 2.7 μM, respectively). We also demonstrate the inhibition of FCV protease activity by GC376 (IC(50) of 18 µM). Using cell culture assays, PPNDS, quercetagetin and GC376 did not display antivirals effects, however, we identified nitazoxanide and 2′-C-methylcytidine (2CMC) as potent inhibitors of FCV replication, with EC(50) values in the low micromolar range (0.6 μM and 2.5 μM, respectively). In conclusion, we established two in vitro assays that will accelerate the research for FCV antivirals and can be used for the high-throughput screening of direct-acting antivirals.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.048691547,-0.022770058,0.005279582,-0.071346603,-0.077918532,0.057222313,0.059916679,-0.019100565,0.036174605,-0.031556048999999996,0.06739813,0.008464196,0.045172509000000007,-0.010873697,-0.034993362,-0.026057536,0.014715106,0.07571971,0.086888695,-0.01898595,-0.00050693,-0.01396416,0.033352963,0.020045598,0.019717257,0.034830164,-0.00961859,-0.024905566,0.032710694,-0.015122225
997,Temperature Sensitive Mutations in Influenza A Viral Ribonucleoprotein Complex Responsible for the Attenuation of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine,"Live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) have prevented morbidity and mortality associated with influenza viral infections for many years and represent the best therapeutic option to protect against influenza viral infections in humans. However, the development of LAIV has traditionally relied on empirical methods, such as the adaptation of viruses to replicate at low temperatures. These approaches require an extensive investment of time and resources before identifying potential vaccine candidates that can be safely implemented as LAIV to protect humans. In addition, the mechanism of attenuation of these vaccines is poorly understood in some cases. Importantly, LAIV are more efficacious than inactivated vaccines because their ability to mount efficient innate and adaptive humoral and cellular immune responses. Therefore, the design of potential LAIV based on known properties of viral proteins appears to be a highly appropriate option for the treatment of influenza viral infections. For that, the viral RNA synthesis machinery has been a research focus to identify key amino acid substitutions that can lead to viral attenuation and their use in safe, immunogenic, and protective LAIV. In this review, we discuss the potential to manipulate the influenza viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex to generate attenuated forms of the virus that can be used as LAIV for the treatment of influenza viral infections, one of the current and most effective prophylactic options for the control of influenza in humans.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.018168541,-0.08605385199999999,-0.058263605999999996,0.138728902,-0.071894199,0.180663915,-0.003292405,0.009912272,-0.005994214,0.018904093,0.025258031,-0.00343764,0.011455418,-0.03165061,-0.001771831,-0.010613185,-0.024875391,-0.014213433999999999,-0.046094336,0.029823198,-0.017050841,0.0027805679999999998,-0.020668878,0.015303212,0.002216978,-0.017006302,0.0066267719999999995,-0.048414175,0.045495797000000004,0.038274008
1000,CHAC1 Is Differentially Expressed in Normal and Cystic Fibrosis Bronchial Epithelial Cells and Regulates the Inflammatory Response Induced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"In cystic fibrosis (CF), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) colonizes the lungs, leading to chronic inflammation of the bronchial epithelium. ChaC glutathione-specific γ-glutamylcyclotransferase 1 (CHAC1) mRNA is differentially expressed in primary human airway epithelial cells from bronchi (hAECBs) from patients with CF and healthy patients at baseline and upon infection with Pa. CHAC1 degrades glutathione and is associated with ER stress and apoptosis pathways. In this study, we examined the roles of CHAC1 in the inflammatory response and apoptosis in lung epithelial cells. First, we confirmed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction that CHAC1 mRNA was overexpressed in hAECBs from patients without CF compared with the expression in hAECBs from patients with CF upon Pa (PAK strain) infection. Moreover, the Pa virulence factors LPS and flagellin were shown to induce CHAC1 expression in cells from patients without CF. Using NCI-H292 lung epithelial cells, we found that LPS-induced CHAC1 mRNA expression was PERK-independent and involved ATF4. Additionally, using CHAC1 small interfering RNA, we showed that reduced CHAC1 expression in the context of LPS and flagellin stimulation was associated with modulation of inflammatory markers and alteration of NF-κB signaling. Finally, we showed that Pa was not able to induce apoptosis in NCI-H292 cells. Our results suggest that CHAC1 is involved in the regulation of inflammation in bronchial cells during Pa infection and may explain the excessive inflammation present in the respiratory tracts of patients with CF.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.030699816,-0.036173218,-0.034655538,-0.139902569,-0.09224209,0.034747577,-0.014328071999999999,-0.006943325,0.003366543,-0.035380502,-0.064125166,-0.029362199,-0.01322947,0.144923047,-0.019333955,0.026831722000000002,0.005041142,-0.049170843,-0.025568191,-0.015890147,0.076051493,-0.03182003,0.018133896,5.43e-06,-0.016037411,-0.022660017999999997,-0.027448345,0.053741650999999994,0.011481732,-0.035464181000000004
1002,Rotavirus A in wild and domestic animals from areas with environmental degradation in the Brazilian Amazon,"Acute gastroenteritis is one of the main causes of mortality in humans and young animals. Domestic and mainly wild animals such as bats, small rodents and birds are highly diversified animals in relation to their habitats and ecological niches and are widely distributed geographically in environments of forest fragmentation in some areas of the Amazon, being considered important sources for viruses that affect humans and other animals. Due to the anthropical activities, these animals changed their natural habitat and adapted to urbanized environments, thus representing risks to human and animal health. Although the knowledge of the global diversity of enteric viruses is scarce, there are reports demonstrating the detection of rotavirus in domestic animals and animals of productive systems, such as bovines and pigs. The present study investigated the prevalence of Rotavirus A in 648 fecal samples of different animal species from the northeastern mesoregion of the state of Pará, Brazil, which is characterized as an urbanized area with forest fragments. The fecal specimens were collected from October 2014 to April 2016 and subjected to a Qualitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR), using the NSP3 gene as a target. It was observed that 27.5% (178/648) of the samples presented positive results for RVA, with 178 samples distributed in birds (23.6%), canines (21.35%), chiropterans (17.98%), bovines (14.6%), horses (8.43%), small rodents (6.74%), pigs (3.93%) and felines (3.37%), demonstrating the circulation of RVA in domestic animals and suggesting that such proximity could cause transmissions between different species and the occurrence of rearrangements in the genome of RVA as already described in the literature, associated to the traces of environmental degradation in the studied areas.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.003534088,0.013778064,0.060672698,-0.060963030999999994,0.105340117,0.054254221,0.10452258800000001,0.007385249,-0.043635388,-0.022494167000000002,0.017312301999999998,0.003270685,-0.037900611,0.00512467,0.072173733,-0.031221176,-0.022867194,-0.021460653,0.010278719,-0.005747621999999999,0.019946400000000003,0.029124887000000002,-0.06818204,0.001948783,0.028750932000000003,-0.034728371,-0.029140064,-0.021698444,0.003094482,-0.031844835
1003,The first evidence of a new genotype of nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus circulating in vaccinated and unvaccinated broiler flocks in Algeria,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) frequently infects broilers and is responsible for severe economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. It has also been associated with kidney damage in the broiler flocks. The aim of the present study is to determine the presence of IBV and its possible involvement in kidney damage of broiler chicks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 14 clinically diseased broiler flocks from Western and Central Algeria were sampled and analyzed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by phylogenic analysis. RESULTS: The QX (100%) and 4/91 (60%) IBV serotypes were the most prevalent in the kidney damaged broilers regardless of vaccination status. The molecular detection of avian IBV by RT-PCR identified six samples as positive, of which only two isolates were typable by sequencing. We identified a novel IBDZ13a genotype which showed 93% sequence homology to the partial-S1 gene sequence of the IB 4/91 commercial vaccine strain. Sequencing analysis characterized this virus as a novel and divergent IB 4/91 field virus with eight amino acid substitutions that might have resulted in altered immunogenicity. CONCLUSION: The isolation of a new IBV strain (IBDZ13a) from vaccinated broiler flocks may explain the failure of the vaccination programs against IBV field strains. Combination of the HI test and RT-PCR indicated that the nephropathogenic IB outbreaks in broilers are related to this novel strain.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.01956505,0.015596752,0.16204305800000002,-0.109675274,0.214010395,0.102855023,-0.193952493,-0.09928926800000001,0.11502190300000001,0.34993074,0.094726105,0.047000528,-0.097992008,0.045937475,-0.148691707,0.130291498,0.023659508,0.025339028,0.022289717,0.026075015,-0.039792941,0.018380135,-0.011747391999999999,-0.019555039,0.024343943,0.026589041,0.012022153,0.00531557,0.049640000999999996,-0.019110923999999998
1006,Molecular epidemiology of chicken anaemia virus in sick chickens in China from 2014 to 2015,"Chicken anaemia virus (CAV), a member of the genus Gyrovirus, is the etiological agent of chicken infectious anaemia. CAV infects bone marrow-derived cells, resulting in severe anaemia and immunosuppression in young chickens and a compromised immune response in older birds. We investigated the molecular epidemiology of CAV in sick chickens in China from 2014 to 2015 and showed that the CAV-positive rate was 13.30%, in which mixed infection (55.56%) was the main type of infection. We isolated and identified 15 new CAV strains using different methods including indirect immunofluorescence assay and Western Blotting. We used overlapping polymerase chain reaction to map the whole genome of the strains. Phylogenetic analyses of the obtained sequences and related sequences available in GenBank generated four distinct groups (A–D). We built phylogenetic trees using predicted viral protein (VP) sequences. Unlike CAV VP2s and VP3s that were well conserved, the diversity of VP1s indicated that the new strains were virulent. Our epidemiological study provided new insights into the prevalence of CAV in clinical settings in recent years in China.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.030706622000000003,-0.016338366,0.023834697999999998,-0.083301489,0.08102135099999999,0.057156322,0.0032871370000000003,-0.019615879,0.01313057,0.033978118,-0.011659263000000001,0.018318321999999998,-0.011325335,-0.016718157,0.0056345480000000005,-0.023060052,-0.017367405,0.016387093999999998,-0.005813855,0.030200414,0.038652117,0.023679626000000002,-0.019270469,0.009463688,0.01288781,-0.010476626,0.020187505,0.026607564,-0.029867697000000002,0.045510083
1008,Involvement of PRRSV NSP3 and NSP5 in the autophagy process,"BACKGROUND: Autophagy is an essential process in eukaryotic cells in which autophagosomes form to deliver cellular organelles and long-lived proteins to lysosomes for degradation. Many studies have recently identified the regulatory mechanisms involved in the interaction between viral infection and autophagy. METHODS: LC3 turnover and the proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway were investigated using western blot analysis. The formation and degradation of autophagosomes were detected using immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: Autophagy was activated by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) NSP3, NSP5 and NSP9, which are two transmembrane proteins and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, respectively. The formation of autophagosomes was induced by NSP3 and NSP5 and developed from the ER; the fusion of these autophagosomes with lysosomes was limited. Although NSP3 and NSP5 are ER transmembrane proteins, these proteins did not activate the ER stress signaling pathways. In addition, the cytoplasmic domain of NSP3 plays a pivotal role in activating autophagy. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented in this study reveal an important relationship between PRRSV NSPs and autophagy and provide new insights that improve our understanding of the involvement of PRRSV NSPs in the autophagy process.

1010,Viral infection detection using metagenomics technology in six poultry farms of eastern China,"With rapidly increasing animal pathogen surveillance requirements, new technologies are needed for a comprehensive understanding of the roles of pathogens in the occurrence and development of animal diseases. We applied metagenomic technology to avian virus surveillance to study the main viruses infecting six poultry farms in two provinces in eastern China. Cloacal/throat double swabs were collected from 60 birds at each farm according to a random sampling method. The results showed that the method could simultaneously detect major viruses infecting farms, including avian influenza virus, infectious bronchitis virus, Newcastle disease virus, rotavirus G, duck hepatitis B virus, and avian leukemia virus subgroup J in several farms. The test results were consistent with the results from traditional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription-PCR analyses. Five H9N2 and one H3N8 avian influenza viruses were detected at the farms and were identified as low pathogenic avian influenza viruses according to HA cleavage sites analysis. One detected Newcastle disease virus was classified as Class II genotype I and avirulent type according to F0 cleavage sites analysis. Three avian infectious bronchitis viruses were identified as 4/91, CK/CH/LSC/99I and TC07-2 genotypes by phylogenetic analysis of S1 genes.

1011,"Prevalence of Wēnzhōu virus in small mammals in Yunnan Province, China","BACKGROUND: Mammarenaviruses are associated with human hemorrhagic fever diseases in Africa and America. Recently, a rodent mammarenavirus, Wēnzhōu virus (WENV) and related viruses, have been reported in China, Cambodia, and Thailand. Moreover, in Cambodia, these viruses were suspected to be associated with human disease. In China, Yunnan Province is famous for its abundant animal and plant diversity and is adjacent to several South-eastern Asia countries. Therefore, it is necessary to know whether WENV-related viruses, or other mammarenaviruses, are prevalent in this province. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Small mammals were trapped, euthanized, and sampled. Mammarenavirus RNA was detected using a nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantified by real-time RT-PCR. A total of 1040 small mammals belonging to 13 genera and 26 species were trapped in Yunnan Province. WENV-related mammarenaviruses were detected in 41 rodent liver samples, mainly in brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) and oriental house rats (R. tanezumi).Viral nucleocapsid protein was detected in liver sections by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Full-length-genomes were amplified by RT-PCR and used for phylogenetic analysis with the MEGA package. Recombination analysis was performed using the SimPlot and Recombination Detection Program. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: WENV related viruses circulated in small mammals in Yunnan Province. Whole genome sequence analysis of five selected viral strains showed that these viruses are closely related to WENVs discovered in Asia and form an independent branch in the phylogenetic tree in the WENV clade.

1012,Multiplex PCR methods for detection of several viruses associated with canine respiratory and enteric diseases,"Viral respiratory and intestinal infections are the most common causes of canine viral illness. Infection with multiple pathogens occurs in many cases. Rapid diagnosis of these multiple infections is important for providing timely and effective treatment. To improve diagnosis, in this study, two new multiplex polymerase chain reactions (mPCRs) were developed for simultaneous detection of canine respiratory viruses (CRV) and canine enteric viruses (CEV) using two separate primer mixes. The viruses included canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine influenza virus (CIV), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine circovirus (CanineCV), canine coronavirus (CCoV) and canine parvovirus (CPV). The sensitivity of the mPCR results showed that the detection limit of both mPCR methods was 1×10(4) viral copies. Twenty nasal swabs (NS) and 20 anal swabs (AS) collected from dogs with symptoms of respiratory disease or enteric disease were evaluated using the novel mPCR methods as a clinical test. The mPCR protocols, when applied to these respiratory specimens and intestinal samples, could detect 7 viruses simultaneously, allowing rapid investigation of CRV (CAV-2, CDV, CIV and CPIV) and CEV (CAV-2, CanineCV, CCoV and CPV) status and prompt evaluation of coinfection.

1013,Selection of reference genes for the quantitative real-time PCR normalization of gene expression in Isatis indigotica fortune,"BACKGROUND: Isatis indigotica, a traditional Chinese medicine, produces a variety of active ingredients. However, little is known about the key genes and corresponding expression profiling involved in the biosynthesis pathways of these ingredients. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a powerful, commonly-used method for gene expression analysis, but the accuracy of the quantitative data produced depends on the appropriate selection of reference genes. RESULTS: In this study, the systematic analysis of the reference genes was performed for quantitative real-Time PCR normalization in I. indigotica. We selected nine candidate reference genes, including six traditional housekeeping genes (ACT, α-TUB, β-TUB, UBC, CYP, and EF1-α), and three newly stable internal control genes (MUB, TIP41, and RPL) from a transcriptome dataset of I. indigotica, and evaluated their expression stabilities in different tissues (root, stem, leaf, and petiole) and leaves exposed to three abiotic treatments (low-nitrogen, ABA, and MeJA) using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and comprehensive RefFind algorithms. The results demonstrated that MUB and EF1-α were the two most stable reference genes for all samples. TIP41 as the optimal reference gene for low-nitrogen stress and MeJA treatment, while ACT had the highest ranking for ABA treatment and CYP was the most suitable for different tissues. CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that the selection and validation of appropriate reference genes for normalizing data is mandatory to acquire accurate quantification results. The necessity of specific internal control for specific conditions was also emphasized. Furthermore, this work will provide valuable information to enhance further research in gene function and molecular biology on I. indigotica and other related species.

1014,Leishmania infantum-specific IFN-γ production in stimulated blood from cats living in areas where canine leishmaniosis is endemic,"BACKGROUND: Feline leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum is considered a rare disease in endemic areas, whereas subclinical infections are common. Immune response plays a key role in driving the course of L. infantum infection in other host species; however, the feline cell-mediated immune response to L. infantum infection has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the cell-mediated immune response specific to L. infantum by means of interferon (IFN)-γ release in whole blood assay from cats living in endemic areas (66 in Sicily and 113 in Catalonia) and to compare with antibody levels to L. infantum [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT)], blood parasite load and retroviral infections. RESULTS: Most cats (n = 140) were L. infantum antibody negative and only 22% (n = 39) were positive. Only 9 and 2% of tested cats had a feline immunodeficency virus (FIV) infection or a feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection, respectively. Thirty-two cats out of 179 (18%) produced IFN-γ after stimulation with L. infantum soluble antigen (LSA) while the majority of cats (93%) produced IFN-γ after stimulation with concanavalin A (ConA). Six LSA-IFN-γ-producer cats were seropositive (three to ELISA and five to IFAT) but they were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative, while only one cat was antibody- and PCR-positive. Significant positive correlations were found between IFN-γ concentrations after stimulation with LSA and ConA, and between serology and PCR testing. No association was found between FIV status and LSA or ConA-IFN-γ production. Combining PCR, serology and specific IFN-γ concentration results, we found that 36% of cats studied were exposed to L. infantum. CONCLUSIONS: As expected, cats from endemic areas produce IFN-γ after ex vivo blood stimulation with LSA and therefore are able to activate a cell-mediated adaptive immune response against the parasite that is variably associated with antibody or blood PCR positivity. The association of this assay to serological and molecular tests provides a better estimate of cat exposure to L. infantum.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.000983165,-0.001184999,0.07622936599999999,-0.17024884699999998,-0.055344484000000006,0.046373806,0.060244197,-0.007009128000000001,0.001749964,-0.121229109,0.278403272,-0.139370728,0.159670393,0.022518087000000003,-0.086129845,-0.027865941,0.040892488,-0.020137595,-0.005262643000000001,0.02933975,-0.001524954,-0.036535073,0.065481039,-0.010317388,-0.027124235,0.024632842000000002,0.016178316,0.010908761999999999,-0.001421624,-0.012922958
1015,Molecular characterization of pathogenic 4/91-like and QX-like infectious bronchitis virus infecting commercial poultry farms in Indonesia,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Existing data on the characteristics of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) gathered throughout Indonesia have been recognized to indicate variants similar to globally distributed vaccine strains. Despite past and current intensive vaccination programs, IBV infections in the country’s poultry industry have not been effectively controlled. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the genotype of several isolates based on partial S1 gene sequences. In particular, the investigation is directed to focus on layer chickens in actively vaccinated farms indicating IBV symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples were isolated from ten different layer chicken flocks experiencing respiratory problem, drops in egg production, and a “penguin-like” stance, which were collected from commercial poultry farms in Central Java and Yogyakarta regions, Indonesia, within the periods of 2012-2018. Fragment of the S1 gene of IBV sampled from actively vaccinated commercial poultry farms was amplified using primer 5’-aca tgg taa ttt ttc aga tgg-3’ (forward) and 5’-cag att gct tac aac cac c-3’ (reverse) with the length of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product at 383 bp. The sequence of samples was then compared with the sequence of reference S1 gene nucleotides of IBV from NCBI GenBank database. The amino acid analysis and multiple alignment sequence were conducted using Mega X. RESULTS: During necropsy, enlargement of the oviduct and swollen kidney were observed. Reverse transcription-PCR diagnosis of their 383 bp S1 gene showed that all samples were IBV positive. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene discovered seven samples to be clustered as 4/91-like strains. Meanwhile, the remaining three samples were grouped in QX-like strain cluster. CONCLUSION: This study is a pioneering report providing molecular evidence of pathogenic QX-like and 4/91-like strains circulating in Indonesia. Findings discovered, in this study, strongly suggested the importance of improving protections by available IBV vaccines through updated circulating strain clusters. It is critical to ensure the delivery of an effective control measurement of and vaccination protocols against IBV infections in the country’s commercial poultry industry in particular and worldwide in general.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.036728567000000004,-0.011517767,0.11890012300000001,-0.129198418,0.264104116,0.10674733300000001,-0.201289245,-0.09746448699999999,0.128371693,0.34476994200000005,0.063649802,0.046888297999999995,-0.081469677,0.003728129,-0.131273059,0.094639924,-0.00034405300000000003,0.006176322,0.038221371000000004,0.01208666,-0.02438199,-0.0042538770000000005,-0.008619663,-0.031550483,0.011715026000000002,-0.016011646,-0.018454736,0.016878094,0.064450575,0.0057189730000000005
1016,Coinfection of diarrheagenic bacterial and viral pathogens in piglets of Northeast region of India,"AIM: This study aimed to study the prevalence of the coinfection of enteric bacterial and viral pathogens, namely Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Rotavirus, and Picobirnavirus from fecal samples of pre-weaned piglets in Northeast region of India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 457 fresh fecal samples were collected from piglets under 9 weeks old during 2013-2015 from organized (n=225) and unorganized (n=232) farms of Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland. Samples were collected from diarrheic (n =339) and non-diarrheic (n=118) piglets including local indigenous (n=130) and crossbreed (n=327) piglets in different seasons during the study period. The samples were processed for the isolation of E. coli and Salmonella and detection of their putative virulence genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Samples were also processed for the detection of Rotavirus and Picobirnavirus by RNA-polyacrylamide agarose gel electrophoresis and reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). RESULTS: A total of 11 (2.40%) samples were found positive for two or more coinfecting enteric bacterial and viral pathogens. All the 11 positive fecal samples were recovered from diarrheic piglets. Salmonella Typhimurium (enterotoxin, stn gene) and Picobirnavirus genogroup 1 were found to be more frequent as coinfecting agents. Coinfection was recorded higher in unorganized (3.87%) compared to organized farm (0.88%). Again, higher detection was recorded in crossbreed (2.75%) than local indigenous piglets (1.53%). The occurrence of coinfection was found to be more common during summer (4.68%) followed by winter (2.27%) season. CONCLUSION: The present study highlighted the significance of E. coli, Salmonella, Rotavirus, and Picobirnavirus as important diarrheagenic pathogens causing coinfection in piglets in Northeast region of India. Probably, this is the first systematic study of the coinfection of four important diarrheagenic bacterial and viral agents associated with piglet diarrhea in India.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.041796931,-0.011200735,0.08376114900000001,-0.070820208,0.051215652,-0.025006987,0.01297536,-0.008191087,-0.04814183,0.017506116999999998,0.032922879,0.013473462,-0.06331307900000001,0.005807206999999999,0.080286723,-0.069041418,0.020170698,-0.035423088,0.02106881,-0.036931239,-0.028906333,0.06372488,-0.015320408,0.011484228999999999,0.057681961,-0.043733232000000004,-0.010232586,-0.039910907999999995,0.046197935999999995,-0.007333136999999999
1017,"Genetic characterization of S1 gene of infectious bronchitis virus isolated from commercial poultry flocks in West Java, Indonesia","BACKGROUND AND AIM: Infectious bronchitis (IB) is still a major problem among poultry industry in Indonesia, IB outbreaks continue to happen even in vaccinated flocks. The emergence of new IB virus (IBV) variants might lead to mismatching between vaccine virus strain and circulating virus strain, this may be a reason of vaccination failure. Information about circulating IBV in a region is important to decide which IB vaccine should be used. However, information about recent IBV strains which circulated in Indonesia and their genetic characters were limited; therefore, the aim of our research was to determine the genetic characterization of S1 gene of IBV isolated from commercial poultry flocks in West Java, Indonesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 47 viral isolate samples collected from chickens with clinical sign and reduced in egg production. Six IB live vaccines were used as control, the reference vaccines represent IBV strains including H120, H52, 4/91, CR88, 233A, and 1-96. Primers XCe2+ and XCe2- were used to amplify S1 gene partially. RESULTS: Twenty-six of 47 samples showed positive result to S1 gene of IBV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Three IBV isolates, Indonesia/K233A31/18, Indonesia/K4A9/17, and Indonesia/P3/17, were selected for nucleotide sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of 352 nucleotides of the partial S1 gene shows that isolates Indonesia/K4A9/17 and Indonesia/K233A31/18 have 100% homology with IBV vaccine strain 4/91, while isolate Indonesia/P3/17 has 100% homology with IBV vaccine strain 233A. CONCLUSION: Our result indicates that at least two IBV strains were circulating among poultry in West Java, Indonesia, which is IBV close to vaccine strain 4/91 and 233A. The present study provides updates on the circulating IBV in commercial poultry flocks in West Java, Indonesia, and might use as guidance on selecting a proper IB vaccine strain to improve IB vaccination efficacy in certain region.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.048963335999999996,-0.022338351,0.094663136,-0.133670795,0.19570411699999998,0.118129217,-0.18056943399999997,-0.09347322300000001,0.125968931,0.34340508299999994,0.083829104,0.055904681,-0.103209335,0.003820901,-0.141397616,0.136040415,-0.017522571,0.012516405,0.028566717999999998,0.038977169,-0.017718772,-0.003103979,0.014976761000000002,-0.02006336,0.025079819,0.0013428160000000001,-0.012162393999999998,0.024052443,0.039178318999999996,0.012414221000000001
1021,Cloning and characterization of a tyrosine decarboxylase involved in the biosynthesis of galanthamine in Lycoris aurea,"BACKGROUND: Galanthamine, one kind of Amaryllidaceae alkaloid extracted from the Lycoris species, is used in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. In regards to medical and economic importance, the biosynthesis and regulatory mechanism of the secondary metabolites in Lycoris remain uninvestigated. METHODS: BLAST was used to identify the sequence of tyrosine decarboxylase in the transcriptome of Lycoris aurea (L’Hér) Herb. The enzyme activity of this TYDC was determined by using heterologous expressed protein in the Escherichia coli cells. The related productive contents of tyramine were detected using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). According to the available micro RNA sequencing profiles and degradome database of L. aurea, microRNA396 were isolated, which targets to LaTYDC1 and RNA Ligase-Mediated-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RLM-RACE) were used to confirm the cleavage. The expression levels of miR396 and LaTYDC1 were measured using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: LaTYDC1 was mainly expressed in root, bulb, leaf and flower fitting the models for galanthamine accumulation. This decarboxylase efficiently catalyzes tyrosine to tyramine conversion. Under methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment, the expression of LaTYDC1 and the content of tyramine sharply increase. The use of RLM-RACE confirms that miR396 promotes the degradation of LaTYDC1 mRNA. Under MeJA treatment, the expression of miR396 was suppressed while the expression level of LaTYDC1 sharply increased. Following the increase of the miR396 transcriptional level, LaTYDC1 was significantly repressed. CONCLUSION: LaTYDC1 participates in the biosynthesis of galanthamine, and is regulated by miR396. This finding also provides genetic strategy for improving the yield of galanthamine in the future.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.09455036800000001,-0.016593131,0.046931278,-0.055172581,-0.076482465,0.01439352,0.013764374,-0.021317696,0.032170124,-0.013588662,-0.07583564200000001,-0.053980152999999996,0.020832213,0.053824910999999996,-0.034192951,-0.011388438999999998,-0.020878089,-0.039042064,-0.020096974,-0.075815957,0.018418054,-0.016851216999999998,0.034790016,-0.033494965,-0.068521971,-0.022153151,0.040357652,0.019011689,0.048370735,0.012140671
1023,"Infectious bronchitis virus from chickens in Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia 2015-2016","AIM: This study aimed to isolate some of the currently circulating infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains from some broiler chicken farms in Al-Hasa and to do some molecular characteristics of these strains. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected 300 tissue specimens, including the trachea, bronchi, lungs, and kidneys from some four commercial chicken farms showing respiratory manifestations. We tested these tissue specimens by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and gel-based PCR. We selected some PCR positive samples for isolation in the embryonated chicken eggs (ECE). We sequenced some PCR-positive samples and conducted phylogenetic analysis based on the obtained sequences. RESULTS: Our molecular surveillance revealed that 31.6% of the tested specimens were IBV positive by PCR. We selected some positive specimens showing low Ct values by the qRT-PCR for virus isolation by the ECE. The infected eggs showed hemorrhage, dwarfing, and death in some cases after three passages in the ECE. We sequenced some of the positive PCR specimens and used the obtained sequences to draw the phylogenetic tree based on the partial IBV-ORF-1a, N, and S1 gene sequences. The phylogenetic trees based on the IBV-N and S1 gene sequences showed that the circulating IBV strains in Al-Hasa during 2016 was showing a high degree of identity to some strains from Taiwan and Italy. Meanwhile, the grouping of these strains based on the IBV-S1 sequences revealed that the currently circulating IBV strains in Al-Hasa belonged to Gr.I.7 along with strains from Taiwan. CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed the continuous circulation of the IBV among the chicken population in Al-Hasa despite the intensive application of vaccines against this virus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.005410853,0.02738871,0.160429241,-0.10376420900000001,0.260618772,0.086916761,-0.199273932,-0.076600591,0.09636144099999999,0.313773065,0.099545952,0.046998988,-0.069439582,0.066791192,-0.105190441,0.083961776,0.021703185,0.02460421,0.031250573999999996,-0.043821709,-0.015714768,0.040690421000000004,-0.001846369,-0.078352361,0.010043209,0.010746813999999999,0.020657962,0.0047030629999999995,0.045449827000000005,0.026689475
1024,"Analysis of the spike, ORF3, and nucleocapsid genes of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus circulating on Thai swine farms, 2011–2016","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) outbreaks on pig farms have caused significant economic loss in the swine industry since it was first reported in Thailand a decade ago. Anecdotal evidence suggests that PEDV is now endemic in this region, therefore genome information of circulating PEDV is important for molecular surveillance and evaluation of potential benefits of field vaccination. Here, we characterized PEDV infection on commercial Thai swine farms by screening 769 samples of feces and small intestinal contents from pigs with diarrhea between 2011 and 2016. Using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction targeting the spike (S) gene, 153 PEDV-positive samples were further subjected to analysis of the open reading frame 3 and nucleocapsid (N) genes. Comparison of 95 samples in which nucleotide sequencing was successfully obtained for all three genes revealed evolutionary diversity among the Thai PEDV strains. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that although some Thai strains changed little from years past, others resembled more closely to the recent strains reported in China. Interestingly, eight Thai PEDV strains possessed amino acid deletions in the N protein. The PEDV sequence divergence may be responsible for driving periodic outbreaks and continued persistence of PEDV on commercial swine farms. Our findings provide important insight into regional PEDV strains in circulation, which may assist future inclusions of suitable strains for future PEDV vaccines.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.050938475,0.007259956,0.10570289699999999,-0.137345612,0.153532104,0.095581946,-0.045979954,-0.026136574,0.018129267,-0.018369849,0.04468914,0.14978445099999999,-0.19569336199999998,0.0035776379999999997,0.31854683100000003,-0.28386179100000003,-0.07684591,0.069070904,-0.079231295,0.24430728300000001,-0.217394993,-0.088081559,0.10512925,-0.030998294,-0.07556196400000001,-0.06624505900000001,-0.014145526,0.034248753,0.085883946,0.003930976
1027,Transcriptome analysis of responses to bluetongue virus infection in Aedes albopictus cells,"BACKGROUND: Bluetongue virus (BTV) causes a disease among wild and domesticated ruminants which is not contagious, but which is transmitted by biting midges of the Culicoides species. BTV can induce an intense cytopathic effect (CPE) in mammalian cells after infection, although Culicoides- or mosquito-derived cell cultures cause non-lytic infection with BTV without CPE. However, little is known about the transcriptome changes in Aedes albopictus cells infected with BTV. METHODS: Transcriptome sequencing was used to identify the expression pattern of mRNA transcripts in A. albopictus cells infected with BTV, given the absence of the Culicoides genome sequence. Bioinformatics analyses were performed to examine the biological functions of the differentially expressed genes. Subsequently, quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction was utilized to validate the sequencing data. RESULTS: In total, 51,850,205 raw reads were generated from the BTV infection group and 51,852,293 from the control group. A total of 5769 unigenes were common to both groups; only 779 unigenes existed exclusively in the infection group and 607 in the control group. In total, 380 differentially expressed genes were identified, 362 of which were up-regulated and 18 of which were down-regulated. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that the differentially expressed genes mainly participated in endocytosis, FoxO, MAPK, dorso-ventral axis formation, insulin resistance, Hippo, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: This study represents the first attempt to investigate transcriptome-wide dysregulation in A. albopictus cells infected with BTV. The understanding of BTV pathogenesis and virus–vector interaction will be improved by global transcriptome profiling.

1031,Relationship of α2‐Macroglobulin with Steroid‐Induced Femoral Head Necrosis: A Chinese Population‐Based Association Study in Southeast China,"OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to identify the relationship of α‐2‐macroglobulin and microvascular vessel pathology with steroid‐induced femoral head necrosis in the Southeast Chinese population. METHODS: This study enrolled 40 patients diagnosed with steroid‐induced necrosis of the femoral head. Patients had various stages of femoral head necrosis. The differential expression of serum proteins and mRNA from patients with steroid‐induced necrosis of the femoral head (SINFH) and healthy volunteers was analyzed by western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QT‐PCR). The pathological change in osteocyte necrosis was indicated by hematoxylin and eosin stain and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Hematoxylin and eosin stain showed histopathology changes in the necrotic area of patients with steroid‐induced INFH: bone trabeculae were fewer and thinner, became broken, fragmented and structurally disordered; intraosseous adipose cells became enlarged; the arrangement of the osteoblasts became irregular; and vacant bone lacunae increased. QT‐PCR showed significantly lower levels of α‐2‐macroglobulin in the serum of patients with SINFH than in controls (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemical staining and western blotting demonstrated that the expression of α‐2‐macroglobulin was significantly decreased in the necrotic area of SINFH patients (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The α‐2‐macroglobulin may be associated with the pathology of SINFH. The multiple pathological reactions occur in SINFH and α‐2‐macroglobulin may serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of SINFH or a promising therapeutic target.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.03059284,-0.016416286000000002,-0.021414084,-0.15954499800000002,-0.09001819900000001,-0.000560077,-0.026465507000000003,0.016466756000000003,-0.06418066900000001,-0.011149561,-0.05250396,-0.004926418,-0.01633523,0.108343365,-0.046258756,0.003065503,0.025955452,-0.013337867,-0.02535121,-0.038863051,0.061413485999999996,-0.057965082,0.019763244,-0.005175123,-0.008576277,-0.021285662,0.005122983,-0.004621415,0.00602309,-0.0032137529999999997
1033,"Assessing the value of PCR assays in oral fluid samples for detecting African swine fever, classical swine fever, and foot-and-mouth disease in U.S. swine","INTRODUCTION: Oral fluid sampling and testing offers a convenient, unobtrusive mechanism for evaluating the health status of swine, especially grower and finisher swine. This assessment evaluates the potential testing of oral fluid samples with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to detect African swine fever, classical swine fever, or foot-and-mouth disease for surveillance during a disease outbreak and early detection in a disease-free setting. METHODS: We used a series of logical arguments, informed assumptions, and a range of parameter values from literature and industry practices to examine the cost and value of information provided by oral fluid sampling and rRT-PCR testing for the swine foreign animal disease surveillance objectives outlined above. RESULTS: Based on the evaluation, oral fluid testing demonstrated value for both settings evaluated. The greatest value was in an outbreak scenario, where using oral fluids would minimize disruption of animal and farm activities, reduce sample sizes by 23%-40%, and decrease resource requirements relative to current individual animal sampling plans. For an early detection system, sampling every 3 days met the designed prevalence detection threshold with 0.95 probability, but was quite costly. LIMITATIONS: Implementation of oral fluid testing for African swine fever, classical swine fever, or foot-and-mouth disease surveillance is not yet possible due to several limitations and information gaps. The gaps include validation of PCR diagnostic protocols and kits for African swine fever, classical swine fever, or foot-and-mouth disease on swine oral fluid samples; minimal information on test performance in a field setting; detection windows with low virulence strains of some foreign animal disease viruses; and the need for confirmatory testing protocol development.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.034797415,0.031247173,0.09851834,-0.032591047000000005,-0.036111646000000004,0.05035394,0.017212886,0.022681998999999998,-0.011447532,0.023410463,0.007108963,0.019435397,-0.000500896,-0.060801220999999996,0.060225267,-0.012271954,-0.048589626,0.0027661390000000004,-0.034093379,-0.044836623,-0.023359336,-0.007296635,0.00406443,-0.074235041,-0.021219577000000003,0.013914793,-0.008451974000000001,-0.013691797,-0.001688482,-0.011262423999999998
1034,Development of oligonucleotide microarray for accurate and simultaneous detection of avian respiratory viral diseases,"BACKGROUND: Avian influenza virus (AIV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are important avian pathogens that can cause enormous economic loss on the poultry industry. Different respiratory etiological agents may induce similar clinical signs that make differential diagnosis difficult. Importantly, AIV brings about severe threat to human public health. Therefore, a novel method that can distinguish these viruses quickly and simultaneously is urgently needed. RESULTS: In this study, an oligonucleotide microarray system was developed. AIV, including H5, H7, and H9 subtypes; NDV; and IBV were simultaneously detected and differentiated on a microarray. Three probes specific for AIV, NDV, and IBV, as well as three other probes for differentiating H5, H7, and H9 of AIV, were first designed and jet-printed to predetermined locations of initiator-integrated poly(dimethylsiloxane) for the synchronous detection of the six pathogens. The marked multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were hybridized with the specific probes, and the results of hybridization were read directly with the naked eyes. No cross-reaction was observed with 10 other subtypes of AIV and infectious bursal disease virus, indicating that the oligonucleotide microarray assay was highly specific. The sensitivity of the method was at least 100 times higher than that of the conventional PCR, and the detection limit of NDV, AIV, H5, H7, and H9 can reach 0.1 EID(50) (50% egg infective dose), except that of IBV, which was 1 EID(50) per reaction. In the validation of 93 field samples, AIV, IBV, and NDV were detected in 53 (56.99%) samples by oligonucleotide microarray and virus isolation and in 50 (53.76%) samples by conventional PCR. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully developed an approach to differentiate AIV, NDV, IBV, H5, H7, and H9 subtypes of AIV using oligonucleotide microarray. The microarray is an accurate, high-throughput, and relatively simple method for the rapid detection of avian respiratory viral diseases. It can be used for the epidemiological surveillance and diagnosis of AIV, IBV, and NDV.

1035,Acute phase response in bovine coronavirus positive post-weaned calves with diarrhea,"Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is associated with severe diarrhea in calves, winter dysentery in adult cattle, and respiratory diseases in cattle of all ages. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between white blood cell counts and haptoglobin (Hp) and serum amyloid A (SAA) levels in post-weaned calves with diarrhea caused by BCoV and those that recovered from diarrhea. Blood and fecal samples were collected twice from the same animals; 17 post-weaned calves with diarrhea (first) and 15 post-weaned calves that recovered from diarrhea (second). Real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that all 17 fecal samples from post-weaned calves with diarrhea and one out of 15 from diarrhea-recovered calves were positive for BCoV and negative for Cryptosporidium spp., Escherichia coli K99, Salmonella spp., bovine rotavirus, and bovine viral diarrhea virus. No Eimeria oocysts were detected using the flotation method. In comparison with post-weaned calves with diarrhea, in diarrhea-recovered calves, the lymphocyte count was significantly higher (P = 0.018), and the monocyte count was significantly lower (P = 0.001); however, the number of monocytes was still high. Post-weaned calves with diarrhea had a significantly higher Hp concentration (P < 0.001) compared with diarrhea-recovered calves. The results indicated that increased Hp concentration and monocytosis but not SAA may be associated with diarrhea caused by BCoV. The present study suggests that the monitoring of Hp concentration and monocyte count is useful in the diagnosis of post-weaned calves with diarrhea caused by BCoV in this field.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.002949145,-0.00422638,0.056641147999999995,-0.138298711,0.008687367,0.013764335,0.011550611,-0.014893864,-0.025738367,-0.044901332,0.03737915,0.058320887,-0.080929614,-0.005120617,0.116511306,-0.058311284000000005,-0.012366586,-0.00338634,0.016488543999999997,-0.012770483000000001,-0.012524908999999999,-0.005839986,-0.052509372,-0.002124981,0.048216707000000004,-0.036559576,-0.025425347999999997,-0.12243446599999999,0.053373665,-0.037938166
1036,"Molecular detection and genetic characterization of Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplama synoviae, and infectious bronchitis virus in poultry in Myanmar","BACKGROUND: In Southeast Asian countries, including Myanmar, poultry farming is a major industry. In order to manage and maintain stable productivity, it is important to establish policies for biosecurity. Infectious respiratory diseases are a major threat to poultry farming. Avian influenza and Newcastle disease have been reported in Myanmar, but no scientific information is available for other respiratory pathogens, such as mycoplasmas and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Identifying the genotypes and serotypes of IBVs is especially important to inform vaccination programs. In this study, we detected Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), M. synoviae (MS), and IBV in several poultry farms in Myanmar. RESULTS: Samples were collected from 20 farms in three major poultry farming areas in Myanmar, and MG, MS, and IBV were detected on two, four, and eight farms, respectively, by polymerase chain reaction. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the observed MG and MS isolates were not identical to vaccine strains. Three different genotypes of IBV were detected, but none was an unknown variant. CONCLUSIONS: Mycoplasmas and IBV were detected on poultry farms in Myanmar. Periodic surveillance is required to establish the distribution of each pathogen, and to institute better vaccine protocols.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.014356456,-0.041215375,0.07047898,-0.084992061,0.16174081699999998,0.121808179,-0.11291632800000001,-0.075886364,0.08560599599999999,0.305647328,0.079753416,0.034222991,-0.073253153,0.007478158,-0.09060285400000001,0.111583894,-0.016713298999999997,-0.006425925999999999,0.036313943,0.025914031,-0.040221515,-0.016267842,0.004058768,-0.043599195,0.023816357000000003,-0.002736255,-0.044759796,0.040779864,0.06430133099999999,-0.051108235999999994
1037,Prevalence and molecular characterization of infectious bronchitis virus isolated from chicken in Bangladesh,"AIM: The present study was aimed to determine the prevalence of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) as well as virus isolation, identification, and molecular characterization of various strains circulating in Bangladesh. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 371 swabs and organ samples were collected from four types of chicken including layer, Sonali (local), broiler, and broiler breeder under eight districts (Rangpur, Bogura, Tangail, Dhaka, Gazipur, Mymensingh, Jamalpur, and Cumilla) during 2014-2016 in Bangladesh. RESULTS: Out of 371 samples, 65 samples were positive in reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for molecular identification of IBV. The overall prevalence was 17.52% recorded and among the selected types of chicken, the highest prevalence of IBV was found in layer that was 42.22% followed by 17.24% in Sonali, 14.93% in broiler breeder, and lowest prevalence was 11.94% in broiler chicken, respectively. Moreover, the prevalence of IBV was recorded highest in aged chicken at 41-60 weeks, which was 54.55% in layer, 27.27% in Sonali, and, afterward, 14.68% was found in broiler breeder, respectively. Frequency of IBV more frequently in winter (22.67%) followed by rainy (15.87%) and summer season (11.58%). The highest prevalence of IBV was found Tangail district (41.67%) followed by Mymensingh (24.42%), Gazipur (19.32%), Dhaka (15.38%), Jamalpur (16.67%), Bogura (13.68%), Cumilla (5.88%), and Rangpur (9.26%), respectively. Samples that were found high positive in IBV RT-PCR (Ct value below 30) were subjected to inoculation into chicken egg embryo to observe characteristic changes in chicken embryo. Swabs and organ samples were processed and passaged in 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs through allantoic cavity route. IBV virus suspected samples inoculated into chicken egg embryos after 3-5 passages showed dwarfing and curling of the embryos which are characteristic lesions of IBV. Allantoic fluid was collected from all inoculated eggs and performed partial sequencing of S1 gene for three isolates. After sequencing, the phylogenetic tree was constructed from the nucleotide sequences of IBV isolates. Two of the isolates are 4/91 IBV and another one matched with QX-like IBV. CONCLUSION: The results revealed that the three isolates from different places in Bangladesh were identified for the 1(st) time as which will help for IBV control strategy.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.019465703,-0.014439152,0.111369496,-0.138144279,0.22013032600000002,0.07835893099999999,-0.19065539899999998,-0.096242089,0.09815725900000001,0.346890097,0.124918894,0.040936365,-0.132855807,0.06742617,-0.14809238800000002,0.164965633,0.018455277,0.000731833,0.064048673,0.004025377,-0.073461985,0.021416967999999998,0.001295704,-0.063745935,0.008329342,0.037040895,-0.005126327,0.040213646,0.049127212,-0.031864248
1038,"Naturally occurring mutations in PB1 affect influenza A virus replication fidelity, virulence, and adaptability","BACKGROUND: Mutations in the PB1 subunit of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of influenza A virus can affect replication fidelity. Before the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in 2009, most human influenza A/H1N1 viruses contained the avian-associated residue, serine, at position 216 in PB1. However, near the onset of the 2009 pandemic, human viruses began to acquire the mammalian-associated residue, glycine, at PB1–216, and PB1–216G became predominant in human viruses thereafter. METHODS: Using entropy-based analysis algorithm, we have previously identified several host-specific amino-acid signatures that separated avian and swine viruses from human influenza viruses. The presence of these host-specific signatures in human influenza A/H1N1 viruses suggested that these mutations were the result of adaptive genetic evolution that enabled these influenza viruses to circumvent host barriers, which resulted in cross-species transmission. We investigated the biological impact of this natural avian-to-mammalian signature substitution at PB1–216 in human influenza A/H1N1 viruses. RESULTS: We found that PB1–216G viruses had greater mutation potential, and were more sensitive to ribavirin than PB1–216S viruses. In oseltamivir-treated HEK293 cells, PB1–216G viruses generated mutations in viral neuraminidase at a higher rate than PB1–216S viruses. By contrast, PB1–216S viruses were more virulent in mice than PB1–216G viruses. These results suggest that the PB1-S216G substitution enhances viral epidemiological fitness by increasing the frequency of adaptive mutations in human influenza A/H1N1 viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results thus suggest that the increased adaptability and epidemiological fitness of naturally arising human PB1–216G viruses, which have a canonical low-fidelity replicase, were the biological mechanisms underlying the replacement of PB1–216S viruses with a high-fidelity replicase following the emergence of pdmH1N1. We think that continued surveillance of such naturally occurring PB1–216 variants among others is warranted to assess the potential impact of changes in RdRp fidelity on the adaptability and epidemiological fitness of human A/H1N1 influenza viruses.

1048,Effects of Xinjiaxiangruyin on the TLR7 pathway in influenza virus-infected lungs of mice housed in a hygrothermal environment,"BACKGROUND: To investigate the effects and immunological mechanisms of the traditional Chinese medicine Xinjiaxiangruyin on controlling influenza virus (FM1 strain) infection in mice housed in a hygrothermal environment. METHODS: Mice were housed in normal and hygrothermal environments, and intranasally infected with influenza virus (FM1). A high-performance liquid chromatography fingerprint of Xinjiaxiangruyin was used to provide an analytical method for quality control. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to measure messenger RNA expression of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65 in the TLR7 signaling pathway and virus replication in the lungs. Western blotting was used to measure the expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 proteins. Flow cytometry was used to detect the proportion of Th17/T-regulatory cells. RESULTS: Xinjiaxiangruyin effectively alleviated lung inflammation in C57BL/6 mice in hot and humid environments. Guizhimahuanggebantang significantly reduced lung inflammation in C57BL/6 mice. The expression of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 mRNA in lung tissue of WT mice in the normal environment, GZMHGBT group was significantly lower than that in the model group (P < 0.05). In WT mice exposed to the hot and humid environment, the expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 mRNA in the XJXRY group were significantly different from those in the virus group. The expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 protein in lung tissue of WT mice exposed to the normal environment, GZMHGBT group was significantly lower than those in the model group. In WT mice exposed to hot and humid environments, the expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 protein in XJXRY group were significantly different from those in the virus group. CONCLUSION: Guizhimahuanggebantang demonstrated a satisfactory therapeutic effect on mice infected with the influenza A virus (FM1 strain) in a normal environment, and Xinjiaxiangruyin demonstrated a clear therapeutic effect in damp and hot environments and may play a protective role against influenza through downregulation of the TLR7 signal pathway.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.04354787,-0.04656131,0.00329488,-0.088246517,-0.066743842,0.10239273800000001,-0.015755349,-0.04586293,0.028736397,-0.077431325,-0.054304937000000005,-0.040691965,-0.031799006,0.099995575,-0.018755629,0.016697279,-0.002403135,-0.067174135,-0.028668016,-0.034277687,0.037645625,-0.059909577,0.033791349,0.006284694,-0.033551797,-0.012921563999999998,0.005841984000000001,-0.00554313,0.002819382,-0.044933982000000004

To clarify the evolution of both VP1 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) regions of GII.P17-GII.17, we analyzed both global and novel Japanese strains detected during 2013–2017. Time-scaled phylogenetic trees revealed that the ancestral GII.17 VP1 region diverged around 1949, while the ancestral GII.P17 RdRp region diverged around 2010. The evolutionary rates of the VP1 and RdRp regions were estimated at ~2.7 × 10(−3) and ~2.3 × 10(−3) substitutions/site/year, respectively. The phylogenetic distances of the VP1 region exhibited no overlaps between intra-cluster and inter-cluster peaks in the GII.17 strains, whereas those of the RdRp region exhibited a unimodal distribution in the GII.P17 strains. Conformational epitope positions in the VP1 protein of the GII.P17-GII.17 strains were similar, although some substitutions, insertions and deletions had occurred. Strains belonging to the same cluster also harbored substitutions around the binding sites for the histo-blood group antigens of the VP1 protein. Moreover, some amino acid substitutions were estimated to be near the interface between monomers and the active site of the RdRp protein. These results suggest that the GII.P17-GII.17 virus has produced variants with the potential to alter viral antigenicity, host-binding capability, and replication property over the past 10 years.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.09552708900000001,-0.032270475,-0.012199848999999999,-0.041087344,0.045279779000000006,0.018945882,0.025423063,0.003629179,-0.023859672000000002,-0.003862145,0.038934506,0.11694998300000001,-0.07244191,-0.06525326099999999,-0.027095868,-0.051668430999999994,0.014203994,-0.00419274,-0.014658444,-0.00859126,0.061800448,0.000366457,0.006686445,0.022266962999999997,0.02553002,0.034516253999999996,0.025042196,0.026567989,0.002847352,0.052009781
1055,Dudleya brittonii extract promotes survival rate and M2-like metabolic change in porcine 3D4/31 alveolar macrophages,"OBJECTIVE: Although alveolar macrophages play a key role in the respiratory immunity of livestock, studies on the mechanism of differentiation and survival of alveolar macrophages are lacking. Therefore, we undertook to investigate changes in the lipid metabolism and survival rate, using 3D4/31 macrophages and Dudleya brittonii which has been used as a traditional asthma treatment. METHODS: 3D4/31 macrophages were used as the in vitro porcine alveolar macrophages model. The cells were activated by exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Dudleya brittonii extraction was performed with distilled water. For evaluating the cell survival rate, we performed the water-soluble tetrazolium salt cell viability assay and growth curve analysis. To confirm cell death, cell cycle and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured using flow cytometric analysis by applying fluorescence dye dichlorofluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide. Furthermore, we also evaluated cellular lipid accumulation with oil red O staining, and fatty acid synthesis related genes expression levels using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with SYBR green dye. Glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle related gene expression levels were measured using qPCR after exposure to Dudleya brittonii extract (DB) for 12 h. RESULTS: The ROS production and cell death were induced by PMA treatment, and exposure to DB reduced the PMA induced downregulation of cell survival. The PMA and DB treatments upregulated the lipid accumulation, with corresponding increase in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha, fatty acid synthase mRNA expressions. DB-PMA co-treatment reduced the glycolysis genes expression, but increased the expressions of fatty acid oxidation and TCA cycle genes.

1056,"Nipah virus: epidemiology, pathology, immunobiology and advances in diagnosis, vaccine designing and control strategies – a comprehensive review","Nipah (Nee-pa) viral disease is a zoonotic infection caused by Nipah virus (NiV), a paramyxovirus belonging to the genus Henipavirus of the family Paramyxoviridae. It is a biosafety level-4 pathogen, which is transmitted by specific types of fruit bats, mainly Pteropus spp. which are natural reservoir host. The disease was reported for the first time from the Kampung Sungai Nipah village of Malaysia in 1998. Human-to-human transmission also occurs. Outbreaks have been reported also from other countries in South and Southeast Asia. Phylogenetic analysis affirmed the circulation of two major clades of NiV as based on currently available complete N and G gene sequences. NiV isolates from Malaysia and Cambodia clustered together in NiV-MY clade, whereas isolates from Bangladesh and India clusterered within NiV-BD clade. NiV isolates from Thailand harboured mixed population of sequences. In humans, the virus is responsible for causing rapidly progressing severe illness which might be characterized by severe respiratory illness and/or deadly encephalitis. In pigs below six months of age, respiratory illness along with nervous symptoms may develop. Different types of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays along with molecular methods based on polymerase chain reaction have been developed for diagnostic purposes. Due to the expensive nature of the antibody drugs, identification of broad-spectrum antivirals is essential along with focusing on small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). High pathogenicity of NiV in humans, and lack of vaccines or therapeutics to counter this disease have attracted attention of researchers worldwide for developing effective NiV vaccine and treatment regimens.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.015826482,0.011372687,0.006441361,-0.01886271,0.075249281,0.100608677,0.095662735,0.002451717,0.042031716,0.057958025,-0.02455802,-0.026039392999999997,0.026351443,-0.043743537,0.033546318,-0.019860758,-0.083067055,0.07187333900000001,-0.030678632,0.024987042999999997,0.041064485,-0.005341299,-0.037601327999999996,0.000960096,-0.0042231840000000005,-0.00379763,0.02524555,0.006505668,0.047025045,0.005425121
1057,Recombinant adenoviral vaccine encoding the spike 1 subunit of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus elicits strong humoral and cellular immune responses in mice,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has rapidly spread throughout the Middle East since its discovery in 2012. The virus poses a significant global public health threat with potentially devastating effects. In this study, a recombinant adenoviral-based vaccine encoding the spike 1 (S1) subunit of the MERS-CoV genome was constructed, and its humoral, and cellular immune responses were evaluated in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were immunized initially by intramuscular injection and boosted 3 weeks later by intranasal application. Expression of the S1 protein in the lungs and kidneys was detected using conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) targeting specific regions within the S1 subunit at weeks 3, 4, 5, and 6 after the first vaccination. Antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated in serum and in cell culture following in vitro stimulation with a specific 9-mer epitope within the S1 protein (CYSSLILDY). RESULTS: S1 protein expression was only detected by IHC in the kidneys of the Ad-MERS-S1 group at week 6 from first immunization, and in both lungs and kidneys of Ad-MERS-S1 group by conventional PCR at weeks 3 and 5 post-prime. The vaccine elicited a specific S1-immunoglobulin G antibody response, which was detected in the sera of the vaccinated mice at weeks 4 and 6 from the onset of the first immunization. There was a significant increase in the amount of Th1-related cytokines (interferon-γ and interleukin [IL] 12), and a significant decrease in the Th2-related cytokine IL-4 in splenocyte cell culture of the vaccinated group compared with the control groups. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that this recombinant adenovirus vaccine encoding the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV elicits potentially protective antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. This study demonstrates a promising vaccine for the control and/or prevention of MERS-CoV infection in humans.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.012318788,0.135155478,-0.042615102,-0.107311575,-0.004147427,0.07164515099999999,-0.026109342999999997,0.141434523,0.22920469699999999,0.020596809,-0.0037333809999999996,-0.053986837,-0.056201390999999996,0.031653901,-0.033328036,-0.022593954,0.005026921,-0.09067760300000001,-0.02068769,-0.036247416,0.005410599,-0.024567402000000002,0.092020978,0.035494964,-0.0055518930000000005,-0.01542828,0.028014723,-0.015683412,-0.004260807,0.017252289
1058,Portable sequencer in the fight against infectious disease,"Infectious disease is still a major threat in the world today. Five decades ago, it was considered soon to be eradicated, but the adaptation of pathogens to environmental pressure, such as antimicrobials, encouraged the emergence and reemergence of infectious disease. The fight with infectious disease starts with prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Diagnosis can be upheld by observing the cause of disease under the microscope or detecting the presence of nucleic acid and proteins of the pathogens. The molecular techniques span from classical polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to sequencing the nucleic acid composition.

1059,Development of an Immunochromatographic Strip for Rapid Detection of Canine Adenovirus,"Although canine adenovirus (CAdV) is highly prevalent in dogs, there is currently a lack of a quick diagnostic method. In this study, we developed a rapid immunochromatographic strip (ICS) assay using colloidal gold coupled to CAdV-2-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). BALB/c mice were immunized with a purified CAdV-2 suspension, and four mAbs (belonging to two different epitopes) were generated and designated as 2C1, 7D7, 10D1, and 4G1. Western blot and protein spectral analysis indicated that the hexon protein of CAdV-2 recognized all four mAbs. The colloidal gold-coupled 7D7 and 2C1 mAbs were chosen for inclusion in the rapid ICS assay. The optimal concentrations of the coating antibody (2C1), the capture antibody (7D7), and the goat anti-mouse antibody were 1.0 mg/ml, 10 μg/ml, and 2.0 mg/ml, respectively. The limit of detection was approximately 2.0 × 10(2) tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50))/ml. Other common canine viruses were tested to evaluate the specificity of the ICS, and positive results were observed for only CAdV-1 and CAdV-2. The ICS test was conducted on 360 samples to detect CAdV, and the results were compared with those of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. The ICS test was found to be a sufficiently sensitive and specific detection method for the convenient and rapid detection of CAdV.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.0047823779999999995,0.014527103000000001,0.116421833,-0.037575815,-0.030222508,0.003946653,0.011725775,-0.015340252,-0.004282237,-0.029864329,-0.01736685,0.009786524,-0.019323682,-0.022017632999999998,0.014214398999999999,-0.03202289,0.006234106999999999,-0.018623772,0.033134838,-0.03697064,0.044877375,0.003184868,0.039322787000000005,-0.025427285,0.051386577999999995,0.003172297,-0.029191234,-0.004782328,-0.064278289,0.054084115
1061,"Preclinical evaluation of AT-527, a novel guanosine nucleotide prodrug with potent, pan-genotypic activity against hepatitis C virus","Despite the availability of highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, sustained viral response (SVR) rates remain suboptimal for difficult-to-treat patient populations such as those with HCV genotype 3, cirrhosis or prior treatment experience, warranting development of more potent HCV replication antivirals. AT-527 is the hemi-sulfate salt of AT-511, a novel phosphoramidate prodrug of 2’-fluoro-2’-C-methylguanosine-5'-monophosphate that has potent in vitro activity against HCV. The EC(50) of AT-511, determined using HCV laboratory strains and clinical isolates with genotypes 1–5, ranged from 5–28 nM. The active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, AT-9010, specifically inhibited the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. AT-511 did not inhibit the replication of other selected RNA or DNA viruses in vitro. AT-511 was approximately 10-fold more active than sofosbuvir (SOF) against a panel of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HCV genotypes 1–5 and remained fully active against S282T resistance-associated variants, with up to 58-fold more potency than SOF. In vitro, AT-511 did not inhibit human DNA polymerases or elicit cytotoxicity or mitochondrial toxicity at concentrations up to 100 μM. Unlike the other potent guanosine analogs PSI-938 and PSI-661, no mutagenic O(6)-alkylguanine bases were formed when incubated with cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, and AT-511 had IC(50) values ≥25 μM against a panel of CYP enzymes. In hepatocytes from multiple species, the active triphosphate was the predominant metabolite produced from the prodrug, with a half-life of 10 h in human hepatocytes. When given orally to rats and monkeys, AT-527 preferentially delivered high levels of AT-9010 in the liver in vivo. These favorable preclinical attributes support the ongoing clinical development of AT-527 and suggest that, when used in combination with an HCV DAA from a different class, AT-527 may increase SVR rates, especially for difficult-to-treat patient populations, and could potentially shorten treatment duration for all patients.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.09373663900000001,-0.039157048,-0.029552522999999997,-0.0005900640000000001,-0.106756318,0.041101233,0.08581453300000001,0.015193135,0.030620439,0.052777305,0.019540535,0.110636737,0.024631015,0.055108305,-0.03183721,-0.036323568,-0.024602197000000003,0.322869788,0.340017917,-0.123838258,-0.04847778,-0.012315516,0.096363802,0.10603970300000001,-0.080388955,-0.08522043900000001,-0.050107205,0.052795855999999995,-0.077512158,-0.03101545
1062,Tilapia Lake Virus Does Not Hemagglutinate Avian and Piscine Erythrocytes and NH(4)Cl Does Not Inhibit Viral Replication In Vitro,"Tilapia lake virus (TiLV) is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA (-ssRNA) icosahedral virus classified to be the only member in the family Amnoonviridae. Although TiLV segment-1 shares homology with the influenza C virus PB1 and has four conserved motifs similar to influenza A, B, and C polymerases, it is unknown whether there are other properties shared between TiLV and orthomyxovirus. In the present study, we wanted to determine whether TiLV agglutinated avian and piscine erythrocytes, and whether its replication was inhibited by lysosomotropic agents, such as ammonium chloride (NH(4)Cl), as seen for orthomyxoviruses. Our findings showed that influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8 (PR8) was able to hemagglutinate turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L), and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) red blood cells (RBCs), while infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) only agglutinated Atlantic salmon, but not turkey or tilapia, RBCs. In contrast to PR8 and ISAV, TiLV did not agglutinate turkey, Atlantic salmon, or tilapia RBCs. qRT-PCR analysis showed that 30 mM NH(4)Cl, a basic lysosomotropic agent, neither inhibited nor enhanced TiLV replication in E-11 cells. There was no difference in viral quantities in the infected cells with or without NH(4)Cl treatment during virus adsorption or at 1, 2, and 3 h post-infection. Given that hemagglutinin proteins that bind RBCs also serve as ligands that bind host cells during virus entry leading to endocytosis in orthomyxoviruses, the data presented here suggest that TiLV may use mechanisms that are different from orthomyxoviruses for entry and replication in host cells. Therefore, future studies should seek to elucidate the mechanisms used by TiLV for entry into host cells and to determine its mode of replication in infected cells.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.101184915,-0.092287305,-0.038252834,0.06828556200000001,-0.065195342,0.155754437,-0.031395308,-0.036733037,0.026212243,0.009170368,0.022294374,-0.070814016,0.006784819,0.140780863,0.038076427999999995,0.019199928,-0.003942501,-0.03013873,0.018069649,0.055917964,0.020691254,0.05651585,-0.0034696329999999997,0.006431996999999999,-0.007955443000000001,0.032627228,0.021147085,0.004280536,-0.097908593,0.030302906
1064,Molecular survey and interaction of common respiratory pathogens in chicken flocks (field perspective),"AIM: The present study was designed for the detection of the most prevalent respiratory infections in chicken flocks and clarifying their interaction and impact on flock health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 359 serum samples were collected from 55 backyard chickens and tested using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits to determine the seroprevalence of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), influenza type A, Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), and Mycoplasma synoviae (MS). Molecular prevalence of NDV, IBV, low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) H9N2, MG, and MS was carried out on swab, and tissue samples collected from 55 backyard flocks and 11 commercial broiler flocks suffered from respiratory infections using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription-PCR. RESULTS: Seroprevalence of NDV, IBV, Influenza type A virus, MG, and MS in chicken backyard flocks was 56.4%, 50.9%, 12.7%, 14.5%, and 3.6%, respectively. Specific antibodies against one or more respiratory viruses and mycoplasma were detected in 36.4% of backyard flocks, indicating concurrent viral infections. The molecular survey showed that 90.9% of chicken backyard flocks were infected with common respiratory viruses (NDV, IBV, and LPAIV H9N2) while 81.8% of commercial broiler flocks were infected. The molecular prevalence rate of NDV, IBV, and LPAIV H9N2 was 46.97%, 56.1%, and 19.7% in backyard flocks, respectively. Combined viral and bacterial infection represented 40% and 63.6% of the respiratory infections, resulting in enhanced pathogenicity and increased mortalities of up to 87.5% and 27.8% in backyard and commercial flocks, respectively. Mixed infection of IBV, LPAIV H9N2, and/or Escherichia coli is the most prevalent mixed infection in broiler flocks, inducing severe clinical outcomes. Avian pathogenic E. coli was, respectively, isolated from 40% of backyard flocks and 81.82% of broiler flocks. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from three backyard chicken flocks mixed with other respiratory pathogens with elevated mortality. Mixed infection of E. coli and MG reported in 9.1% of broiler flock. MG was detected in 14.5% of backyard flocks and 9.1% of broiler flocks while MS was detected only in 3.6% of backyard chickens mixed with E. coli, and other viruses. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that mixed infections are more commonly prevalent and associated with dramatic exacerbation in clinical outcomes than a single infection. Bidirectional synergistic interaction between these concurrently interacted respiratory pathogens explains the severe clinical impact and high mortality rate. The high prevalence of IBV (either as a single or combined infection) with LPAIV H9N2 and/or E. coli, in spite of intensive use of commercial vaccines, increases the need for revising vaccination programs and the application of standard biosecurity measures. Backyard chickens impose a great risk and threaten commercial flocks due to the high prevalence of viral respiratory pathogens.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.059946762,-0.041856878,0.044647799,-0.05696559,0.084431566,0.067888071,-0.077933774,-0.051563257,0.065209369,0.23045770899999998,0.069496255,0.001051215,-0.045741992999999995,0.031197753999999998,-0.069344868,0.093696154,0.014832854,-0.023725358999999998,0.0454266,0.011118447,-0.032849317999999995,-0.013895136,-0.006369367,-0.03151551,0.042780405,0.011014007,-0.047359168,0.00368887,0.036802515,-0.051169722
1066,Antiviral activity of iridoid glycosides extracted from Fructus Gardeniae against influenza A virus by PACT-dependent suppression of viral RNA replication,"Epidemic and pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) poses a significant threat to human populations worldwide. Iridoid glycosides are principal bioactive components from the Gardenia jasminoides J. Ellis fruit that exhibit antiviral activity against several strains of IAV. In the present study, we evaluated the protective effect of Fructus Gardeniae iridoid glycoside extracts (IGEs) against IAV by cytopathogenic effect(CPE), MTT and a plaque formation assay in vitro and examined the reduction in the pulmonary index (PI), restoration of body weight, reduction in mortality and increases in survival time in vivo. As a host factor, PACT provides protection against the pathogenic influenza A virus by interacting with IAV polymerase and activating the IFN-I response. To verify the whether IGEs suppress IAV replication in a PACT-dependent manner, IAV RNA replication, expression of PACT and the phosphorylation of eIF2α in A549 cells were detected; the levels of IFNβ, PACT and PKR in mouse lung tissues were determined; and the activity of IAV polymerase was evaluated in PACT-compromised cells. The results indicated that IGEs sufficiently alleviated cell damage and suppressed IAV replication in vitro, protecting mice from IAV-induced injury and lethal IAV infection. These anti-IAV effects might be related to disrupted interplay between IVA polymerase and PACT and/or prevention of a PACT-dependent overactivated IFN-I antiviral response. Taken together, our findings reveal a new facet of the mechanisms by which IGEs fight the influenza A virus in a PACT-dependent manner.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.077365746,-0.060478924,-0.028212401,0.00591098,-0.097166217,0.140299163,0.015854441,-0.019910745,0.038630155,-0.040374515,0.004713523,-0.005108601,-0.032366087,0.10063719300000001,0.015866401000000002,0.023861933,-0.02151271,-0.008593946,0.017439565,0.012477779,0.032470503,0.011142815,0.029380676,-0.008676124,0.0013697179999999998,-0.001350511,0.00994917,0.018415413999999998,0.014495812,0.0035153709999999998
1072,Development and characterization of a continuous cell line (EL) from the liver of European eel Anguilla anguilla,"In the present study, a new hepatic tissue‐origin cell line from European eel Anguilla anguilla has been developed and characterized. This cell line designated EL has been maintained in Leibovitz L‐15 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum over 72 months, and subcultured more than 90 times. The EL cell line consisted predominantly of fibroblast‐like cells, which could survive over 100 days in vitro, and could grow at 15–32°C. The optimum temperature for growth was 27°C. The chromosome analysis revealed a modal diploid karyotype of 2n = 38. The origin of this cell line was confirmed by the 18S recombinant (r)RNA sequencing. The susceptibility test indicated significant cytopathic effects in the EL cells with regard to the Rana grylio virus and the Herpesvirus anguillae. The viral replication was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and polymerase chain reaction analysis. Following poly (I:C) exposure, the expression levels of the immune‐related molecules interferon regulatory factor‐7 (irf7) and transforming growth factor‐β (TGF‐β) were downregulated in EL cells, whereas the expression levels of the rf3 and the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) were upregulated.

In this study, we investigated the relationship between Kawasaki disease and insertion/deletion polymorphism of ACE gene. Fifty five Kawasaki disease patients and 43 healthy children were enrolled. ACE genotype was evaluated from each of the subjects' DNA fragments through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Frequencies of ACE genotypes (DD, ID, II) were 12.7%, 60.0%, 27.3% in Kawasaki group, and 41.9%, 30.2%, 27.9% in control group respectively, indicating low rate of DD and high rate of ID genotype among Kawasaki patients (p<0.01). Comparing allelic (I, D) frequencies, I allele was more prevalent in Kawasaki group than in control group (57.3% vs. 43.0%, p<0.05).

1080,Attenuated Salmonella choleraesuis-mediated RNAi targeted to conserved regions against foot-and-mouth disease virus in guinea pigs and swine,"In this study, specific sequences within three genes (3D, VP4 and 2B) of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) genome were determined to be effective RNAi targets. These sequences are highly conserved among different serotype viruses based on sequence analysis. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-expressing plasmids (p3D-NT19, p3D-NT56, pVP4-NT19, pVP4-NT65 and p2B-NT25) were constructed to express siRNA targeting 3D, VP4 and 2B, respectively. The antiviral potential of these siRNA for various FMDV isolates was investigated in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells and suckling mice. The results show that these siRNA inhibited virus yield 10- to 300-fold for different FMDV isolates of serotype O and serotype Asia I at 48 h post infection in BHK-21 cells compared to control cells. In suckling mice, p3D-NT56 and p2B-NT25 delayed the death of mice. Twenty percent to 40% of the animals that received a single siRNA dose survived 5 days post infection with serotype O or serotype Asia I. We used an attenuated Salmonella choleraesuis (C500) vaccine strain, to carry the plasmid that expresses siRNA directed against the polymerase gene 3D (p3D-NT56) of FMDV. We used guinea pigs to evaluate the inhibitory effects of recombinant S. cho (p3D-NT56/S. cho) on FMDV infection. The results show that 80% of guinea pigs inoculated with 10(9) CFU of p3D-NT56/S. cho and challenged 36 h later with 50 ID(50) of homologous FMDV were protected. We also measured the antiviral activity of p3D-NT56/S. cho in swine. The results indicate that 100% of the animals treated with 5 × 10(9) CFU of p3D-NT56/S. cho were protected in 9 days.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.070896862,-0.028723672999999998,0.020513148000000002,-0.081914721,-0.024172202,0.062240580999999996,-0.004781213,-0.023197028999999997,0.030146925,-0.000583031,-0.001708511,0.000785992,-0.048555942000000005,0.032399385,0.043317197,-0.01795025,-0.043170522,0.020995541,0.02034488,0.002098929,0.03647724,-0.024906812,0.029379041,0.057796075,-0.033921772,0.015986289,0.02210291,0.018711323999999998,-0.023342042,0.004123028
1082,Detection and Identification of Common Food-Borne Viruses with a Tiling Microarray,"Microarray hybridization based identification of viral genotypes is increasingly assuming importance due to outbreaks of multiple pathogenic viruses affecting humans causing wide-spread morbidity and mortality. Surprisingly, microarray based identification of food-borne viruses, one of the largest groups of pathogenic viruses, causing more than 1.5 billion infections world-wide every year, has lagged behind. Cell-culture techniques are either unavailable or time consuming for routine application. Consequently, current detection methods for these pathogens largely depend on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based techniques, generally requiring an investigator to preselect the target virus of interest. Here we describe the first attempt to use the microarray as an identification tool for these viruses. We have developed methodology to synthesize targets for virus identification without using PCR, making the process genuinely sequence independent. We show here that a tiling microarray can simultaneously detect and identify the genotype and strain of common food-borne viruses in a single experiment.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.020615182,-0.013755645,0.092203798,0.051459977999999997,0.0010660539999999999,0.031306525,0.078255174,0.001895161,-0.005947346,0.11714080699999999,-0.044231503,-0.036968264,0.085387361,-0.055269939000000004,0.061752546,-0.032906463,-0.018243395,-0.02206411,-0.046876728,-0.03987876,0.010091636,0.007857946999999999,0.012007413,0.023547125,-0.036258279,-0.032063559,0.010794323,-0.0452954,-0.001982901,-0.011900329
1083,Gene Expression Profile during Chondrogenesis in Human Bone Marrow derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells using a cDNA Microarray,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the capacity to proliferate and differentiate into multiple connective tissue lineages, which include cartilage, bone, and fat. Cartilage differentiation and chondrocyte maturation are required for normal skeletal development, but the intracellular pathways regulating this process remain largely unclear. This study was designed to identify novel genes that might help clarify the molecular mechanisms of chondrogenesis. Chondrogenesis was induced by culturing human bone marrow (BM) derived MSCs in micromass pellets in the presence of defined medium for 3, 7, 14 or 21 days. Several genes regulated during chondrogenesis were then identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using an ABI microarray system, we determined the differential gene expression profiles of differentiated chondrocytes and BM-MSCs. Normalization of this data resulted in the identification of 1,486 differentially expressed genes. To verify gene expression profiles determined by microarray analysis, the expression levels of 10 genes with high fold changes were confirmed by RT-PCR. Gene expression patterns of 9 genes (Hrad6B, annexinA2, BMP-7, contactin-1, peroxiredoxin-1, heat shock transcription factor-2, synaptotagmin IV, serotonin receptor-7, Axl) in RT-PCR were similar to the microarray gene expression patterns.

1086,Uterine adenocarcinoma with feline leukemia virus infection,"Feline endometrial adenocarcinomas are uncommon malignant neoplasms that have been poorly characterized to date. In this study, we describe a uterine adenocarcinoma in a Persian cat with feline leukemia virus infection. At the time of presentation, the cat, a female Persian chinchilla, was 2 years old. The cat underwent surgical ovariohystectomy. A cross-section of the uterine wall revealed a thickened uterine horn. The cat tested positive for feline leukemia virus as detected by polymerase chain reaction. Histopathological examination revealed uterine adenocarcinoma that had metastasized to the omentum, resulting in thickening and the formation of inflammatory lesions. Based on the histopathological findings, this case was diagnosed as a uterine adenocarcinoma with abdominal metastasis.

1092,Characteristics of human infection with avian influenza viruses and development of new antiviral agents,"Since 1997, several epizootic avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have been transmitted to humans, causing diseases and even deaths. The recent emergence of severe human infections with AIV (H7N9) in China has raised concerns about efficient interpersonal viral transmission, polygenic traits in viral pathogenicity and the management of newly emerging strains. The symptoms associated with viral infection are different in various AI strains: H5N1 and newly emerged H7N9 induce severe pneumonia and related complications in patients, while some H7 and H9 subtypes cause only conjunctivitis or mild respiratory symptoms. The virulence and tissue tropism of viruses as well as the host responses contribute to the pathogenesis of human AIV infection. Several preventive and therapeutic approaches have been proposed to combat AIV infection, including antiviral drugs such as M2 inhibitors, neuraminidase inhibitors, RNA polymerase inhibitors, attachment inhibitors and signal-transduction inhibitors etc. In this article, we summarize the recent progress in researches on the epidemiology, clinical features, pathogenicity determinants, and available or potential antivirals of AIV.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.01383078,-0.034495832000000004,-0.051365324000000004,0.020091717,-0.030164575,0.157908419,0.052719925,0.0020422929999999997,0.027220327000000002,0.107226591,0.008771247,0.02256041,0.044791022,0.011652495,-0.000410439,-0.012278743,-0.043003715,0.11790954199999999,0.013788483,0.07985116,0.024703422000000003,0.032451897,-0.085664765,0.07745523900000001,0.009234893000000001,-0.023761736000000002,0.010218116,-0.026847985,0.089644214,-0.0026961290000000002
1093,"Outbreak of febrile respiratory illness associated with human adenovirus type 14p1 in Gansu Province, China","OBJECTIVES: Human adenovirus (HAdV) type 14 had been infrequently associated with outbreaks of febrile respiratory illness (FRI) until the HAdV‐14p1 emerged in 2006 and rapidly spread in the United States. Here, we report an outbreak of FRI caused by HadV‐14p1 that occurred in 2011 at a primary and middle school in China. DESIGN: The basic information of the outbreak was recored; throat swabs were collected from 17 patients, polymerase chain reaction, A549 cell culture, and sequencing were used to identify the pathogen of the outbreak.. RESULTS: Total of 43 students were infected in this outbreak. Boys were more than girls. We identified 11 HAdV‐positive specimens and 6 HAdV isolates. Genetic analysis showed that the complete hexon, fiber, and E1A sequences of isolates were nearly 100% identical with other HAdV‐14p1 sequences deposited in GenBank. CONCLUSIONS: HadV‐14p1 has caused outbreaks of pneumonia and mortality among adults in the United States and Europe. It may cause similar conditions among Chinese adults due to poor hygiene and sanitation. It seems prudent for China to develop a national surveillance system to determine the etiology of severe respiratory diseases and deaths among adults and school‐aged children.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.08568226,-0.02147147,-0.035323734,-0.090707705,0.055213701,0.002838771,0.001587321,0.0012461430000000001,0.00998518,0.00957291,-0.028248426,0.052550778,-0.04657000099999999,-0.078992897,0.034898277000000005,-0.045097387,-0.117387672,0.053043701,-0.054084002,-0.051401330999999995,0.04799286,0.23037650399999998,-0.02896463,0.046483508,-0.124636614,0.128753107,-0.035415971,0.362189242,-0.15783412800000002,0.012514174
1097,Relationship between the GOLD combined COPD assessment staging system and bacterial isolation,"BACKGROUND: Acute exacerbations, which are a significant cause of mortality and morbidity, adversely affect chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) prognosis by accelerating loss of lung function. It is important to know the microorganisms that commonly cause exacerbations in the patient groups classified according to clinical and functional characteristics for fast and accurate treatment of acute exacerbations. OBJECTIVES: The last Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) publication recommended a new staging system containing obstruction degree, frequency of exacerbations, and quality of life questionnaires. This study is designed to analyze the relationship between the bacteria isolated in acute exacerbations and new GOLD stages. METHODS: Potentially pathogenic bacteria (PPB) isolation with culture and polymerase chain reaction methods were obtained from 114 acute exacerbation COPD patients, classified into A, B, C, and D groups by analyzing the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) value, COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score, and exacerbation frequency according to the new GOLD staging system. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between exacerbation frequency and PPB isolation (P=0.002). There was no relationship between GOLD stage, FEV(1), and CAT score with PPB isolation. The isolated bacteria diversity and mixed infection frequency were higher in the GOLD stage D group. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated only from D group patients. CONCLUSION: Bacterial infection may cause an acute exacerbation equally in each stage for COPD. The difference in bacterial etiology is more related to exacerbation frequency than FEV(1) and CAT scores for an acute exacerbation. Determining exacerbation frequency is significant for treatment success in empirical antibiotic selection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.059043368,-0.029547824,-0.028220996,-0.129390536,-0.050253958,-0.010836513999999998,0.0287765,0.019781808999999997,-0.078567577,0.056877900999999995,-0.02683065,-0.027017377999999998,0.007625253,-0.015207935,0.0061467909999999995,0.012953641,0.006417511999999999,-0.011987911,-0.006405405,-0.018249028,0.008975325,-0.134326597,-0.012466723,0.045504848,-0.012762327,0.048403414000000006,-0.036679458,-0.010470865,0.061725672999999995,0.10084182300000001
1100,Identification of highly conserved regions in L-segment of Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and immunoinformatic prediction about potential novel vaccine,"Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne zoonotic viral disease with a disease fatality rate between 15% and 70%. Despite the wide range of distribution, the virus (CCHFV) is basically endemic in Africa, Asia, eastern Europe, and the Middle East. Acute febrile illness associated with petechiae, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiple-organ failure are the main symptoms of the disease. With all these fatal effects, CCHFV is considered a huge threat as no successful therapeutic approach is currently available for the treatment of this disease. In the present study, we have used the immunoinformatics approach to design a potential epitope-based vaccine against the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-L of CCHFV. Both the T-cell and B-cell epitopes were assessed, and the epitope “DCSSTPPDR” was found to be the most potential one, with 100% conservancy among all the strains of CCHFV. The epitope was also found to interact with both type I and II major histocompatibility complex molecules and is considered nonallergenic as well. In vivo study of our proposed peptide is advised for novel universal vaccine production, which might be an effective path to prevent CCHF disease.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.045465017,-0.009021346999999999,-0.017282598,-0.041393413999999996,-0.036275757,0.061066710999999996,0.048855105,0.015211491,0.043401028,0.043701168,0.022815192,0.00701361,-0.011201276999999999,-0.026032352999999998,0.011661216,0.0058813319999999995,-0.05313333,0.021493002999999997,-0.024062424,0.016645771,0.025890088,0.004293252,-0.047654765,-0.002177554,0.032591338,-0.008378301,0.012568103999999998,0.00533378,0.009812709000000001,0.0022140989999999998

1108,A multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction panel for detecting neurologic pathogens in dogs with meningoencephalitis,"Meningoencephalitis (ME) is a common inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system in dogs. Clinically, ME has both infectious and non-infectious causes. In the present study, a multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (mqPCR) panel was optimized for the detection of eight canine neurologic pathogens (Blastomyces dermatitidis, Cryptococcus spp., Neospora caninum, Borrelia burgdorferi, Bartonella spp., Toxoplasma gondii, Ehrlichia canis, and canine distemper virus [CDV]). The mqPCR panel was subsequently applied to 53 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected from dogs with ME. The analytic sensitivity (i.e., limit of detection, expressed as molecules per 1 µL of recombinant vector) was 3.8 for CDV, 3.7 for Ehrlichia canis, 3.7 for Bartonella spp., 3.8 for Borrelia burgdorferi, 3.7 for Blastomyces dermatitidis, 3.7 for Cryptococcus spp., 38 for Neospora caninum, and 3.7 for Toxoplasma gondii. Among the tested CSF samples, seven (15%) were positive for the following pathogens in decreasing order of frequency: Cryptococcus spp. (3/7), Blastomyces dermatitidis (2/7), and Borrelia burgdorferi (2/7).

In this study, the deadly agent of hemorrhagic diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome, Escherichia coli O157:H7 was investigated with extensive computational approaches aimed at identifying novel and broad-spectrum antibiotic targets. A systematic in silico workflow consisting of comparative genomics, metabolic pathways analysis, and additional drug prioritizing parameters was used to identify novel drug targets that were essential for the pathogen’s survival but absent in its human host. Comparative genomic analysis of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotated metabolic pathways identified 350 putative target proteins in E. coli O157:H7 which showed no similarity to human proteins. Further bio-informatic approaches including prediction of subcellular localization, calculation of molecular weight, and web-based investigation of 3D structural characteristics greatly aided in filtering the potential drug targets from 350 to 120. Ultimately, 44 non-homologous essential proteins of E. coli O157:H7 were prioritized and proved to have the eligibility to become novel broad-spectrum antibiotic targets and DNA polymerase III alpha (dnaE) was the top-ranked among these targets. Moreover, druggability of each of the identified drug targets was evaluated by the DrugBank database. In addition, 3D structure of the dnaE was modeled and explored further for in silico docking with ligands having potential druggability. Finally, we confirmed that the compounds N-coeleneterazine and N-(1,4-dihydro-5H-tetrazol-5-ylidene)-9-oxo-9H-xanthene-2-sulfon-amide were the most suitable ligands of dnaE and hence proposed as the potential inhibitors of this target protein. The results of this study could facilitate the discovery and release of new and effective drugs against E. coli O157:H7 and other deadly human bacterial pathogens.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.062608552,-0.006989694,-0.002506267,-0.039420565,-0.06152377,0.07404472299999999,0.092158535,-0.014817611999999999,0.027805569,0.051178324000000004,-0.066566684,0.024658332,0.032516903,-0.070973228,-0.009027557,-0.06763633200000001,-0.010147976,0.062281897999999995,0.006444841,0.01531849,-0.010892767,0.041963640999999996,-0.054480939000000006,0.037150058,0.038619586000000004,0.016174167,0.048802265,-0.025239107,0.092658336,-0.021260477000000003

1125,Sendai virus intra-host population dynamics and host immunocompetence influence viral virulence during in vivo passage,"In vivo serial passage of non-pathogenic viruses has been shown to lead to increased viral virulence, and although the precise mechanism(s) are not clear, it is known that both host and viral factors are associated with increased pathogenicity. Under- or overnutrition leads to a decreased or dysregulated immune response and can increase viral mutant spectrum diversity and virulence. The objective of this study was to identify the role of viral mutant spectra dynamics and host immunocompetence in the development of pathogenicity during in vivo passage. Because the nutritional status of the host has been shown to affect the development of viral virulence, the diet of animal model reflected two extremes of diets which exist in the global population, malnutrition and obesity. Sendai virus was serially passaged in groups of mice with differing nutritional status followed by transmission of the passaged virus to a second host species, guinea pigs. Viral population dynamics were characterized using deep sequence analysis and computational modeling. Histopathology, viral titer and cytokine assays were used to characterize viral virulence. Viral virulence increased with passage and the virulent phenotype persisted upon passage to a second host species. Additionally, nutritional status of mice during passage influenced the phenotype. Sequencing revealed the presence of several non-synonymous changes in the consensus sequence associated with passage, a majority of which occurred in the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and polymerase genes, as well as the presence of persistent high frequency variants in the viral population. In particular, an N1124D change in the consensus sequences of the polymerase gene was detected by passage 10 in a majority of the animals. In vivo comparison of an 1124D plaque isolate to a clone with 1124N genotype indicated that 1124D was associated with increased virulence.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.07546355099999999,-0.056234687,-0.025617202999999998,-0.040673876,0.005544896999999999,0.064490272,0.076895277,-0.012252965,0.001871479,0.039588006,-0.009868581999999999,-0.045922740999999996,0.004235895,0.019352868,0.028799169,-0.000606422,-0.062655079,-0.034369125,-0.061128052999999995,0.025229215,0.037044975,-0.007585479,-0.022892423,0.104968851,-0.057915132,-0.034739888999999996,0.08520680300000001,-0.07150073700000001,-0.028051435,0.0038477790000000004
1127,Production of specific IgY antibody to the recombinant FanC protein produced in Escherichia coli,"OBJECTIVE(S): Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains are one of the primary causes of diarrhea in newborn calves and in humans, pigs, and sheep. IgY technology has been identified as a promising alternative to generating a mass amount of specific antibody for use in immunotherapy and immunodiagnostics. The purpose of this study was to produce specific antibody by egg yolk antibody (IgY) to recombinant FanC protein from ETEC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FanC (K99) gene was amplified from ETEC by specific primers and polymerase chain reaction. The gene was cloned and subcloned into pTZ57R/T and pET32a (+) vectors, respectively. Recombinant vector was transferred into E. coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3). Protein expression was investigated by 1 mM IPTG induction. Hens were immunized by the purified recombinant FanC protein. The activity and specificity of the IgY antibody were detected by dot-blotting, Western blotting, and indirect ELISA. RESULTS: We obtained FanC specific IgYs by immunizing the hens with the recombinant FanC protein. The anti-FanC IgY showed binding specifically to the FanC protein of ETEC. CONCLUSION: The results emphasize that specific IgY against the recombinant FanC protein could be recommended as a candidate for passive immunization against ETEC infection in animals and humans.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.09818726300000001,-0.014844038,0.049024102,-0.10724152199999999,-0.01580383,0.035966177,-0.045182768,-0.070743618,0.069755415,-0.029001019,-0.08565715300000001,-0.016058613,-0.009690695,0.013335875,-0.027841398,-0.111347935,0.058631978,-0.036868492999999995,0.0037803409999999996,-0.0041827520000000005,0.003318133,-0.001100432,0.068261732,-0.01100875,0.06850795400000001,0.108416358,0.035751964,-0.062420709000000005,-0.062072052999999995,0.094309177
1128,Impact of a porcine epidemic diarrhea outbreak on swine productivity in Japan: a retrospective cohort study,"The objective was to investigate porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) outbreak that occurred in 2014 in Japan and its effects on herd-level productivity using a data recording system (PigINFO). The study herds were selected from farrow-to-finish herds (n=99) that entered in the PigINFO system between July 2013 and March 2015. From 1 April to 30 June 2014 (PED epidemic), any herds with clinical signs of PED and feces positive for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) on polymerase chain reaction analysis and/or immunohistochemical staining were defined as PED-positive (n=38). They were further classified into those with long PED periods (L-PED-positive; n=28) and those with short PED periods (S-PED-positive; n=10). Herds with no clinical signs of PED were classified as PED-negative (n=61). Herd-level production data, including preweaning mortality (%; PRWM), postweaning mortality (%; POWM), pigs weaned per litter (PWL), pigs born alive per litter, litters per mated female per year and pigs marketed per sow (MP), were calculated every 3 months during study period. During the PED epidemic, L-PED-positive herds had significantly higher PRWM and POWM than PED-negative herds, and L-PED-positive and S-PED-positive herds had significantly lower PWL. During October–December 2014, L-PED-positive herds had significantly fewer MP than PED-negative herds. The PED outbreak increased mortality and consequently reduced the numbers of marketed pigs. The rapid control of an outbreak is important for reducing the financial losses arising from PED infections.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.003672598,-0.013288783,0.022747025,-0.100394861,0.004183981,0.032445565,0.0023801720000000003,0.007856554,-0.0057498,-0.035678236,0.025738487,0.05402058,-0.07310676099999999,-0.009514256,0.108774547,-0.046290977000000004,-0.022865706,0.008821198,-0.021630813999999998,0.030075597000000003,-0.05284724,-0.031627747000000005,-0.00042602,-0.035107808,-0.013729015,-0.01155197,-0.028302057999999998,0.006714845,0.020132826,-0.026777462000000002
1129,Human bocavirus: Current knowledge and future challenges,"Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a parvovirus isolated about a decade ago and found worldwide in both respiratory samples, mainly from early life and children of 6-24 mo of age with acute respiratory infection, and in stool samples, from patients with gastroenteritis. Since then, other viruses related to the first HBoV isolate (HBoV1), namely HBoV2, HBoV3 and HBoV4, have been detected principally in human faeces. HBoVs are small non-enveloped single-stranded DNA viruses of about 5300 nucleotides, consisting of three open reading frames encoding the first two the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and nuclear phosphoprotein (NP1) and the third the viral capsid proteins 1 and 2 (VP1 and VP2). HBoV pathogenicity remains to be fully clarified mainly due to the lack of animal models for the difficulties in replicating the virus in in vitro cell cultures, and the fact that HBoV infection is frequently accompanied by at least another viral and/or bacterial respiratory and/or gastroenteric pathogen infection. Current diagnostic methods to support HBoV detection include polymerase chain reaction, real-time PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and enzyme immunoassay using recombinant VP2 or virus-like particle capsid proteins, although sequence-independent amplification techniques combined with next-generation sequencing platforms promise rapid and simultaneous detection of the pathogens in the future. This review presents the current knowledge on HBoV genotypes with emphasis on taxonomy, phylogenetic relationship and genomic analysis, biology, epidemiology, pathogenesis and diagnostic methods. The emerging discussion on HBoVs as true pathogen or innocent bystander is also emphasized.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.047082175999999996,-0.040323245,0.029909752,0.011490323,0.01613352,-0.066957303,0.066677563,-0.02191425,0.021678675,0.067367784,-0.066156391,-0.034125848,0.082530194,-0.036264494,0.013714275,-0.079247818,-0.016946331000000002,-0.037625591,0.009848813,0.024433557999999998,0.029732439,0.043471239,-0.014263584,0.020714876,-0.059565328,0.0029325609999999998,-0.068863767,-0.0021376060000000002,-0.028906115,0.045797157000000005

1136,Progress of small molecular inhibitors in the development of anti-influenza virus agents,"The influenza pandemic is a major threat to human health, and highly aggressive strains such as H1N1, H5N1 and H7N9 have emphasized the need for therapeutic strategies to combat these pathogens. Influenza anti-viral agents, especially active small molecular inhibitors play important roles in controlling pandemics while vaccines are developed. Currently, only a few drugs, which function as influenza neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors and M2 ion channel protein inhibitors, are approved in clinical. However, the acquired resistance against current anti-influenza drugs and the emerging mutations of influenza virus itself remain the major challenging unmet medical needs for influenza treatment. It is highly desirable to identify novel anti-influenza agents. This paper reviews the progress of small molecular inhibitors act as antiviral agents, which include hemagglutinin (HA) inhibitors, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors, NA inhibitors and M2 ion channel protein inhibitors etc. Moreover, we also summarize new, recently reported potential targets and discuss strategies for the development of new anti-influenza virus drugs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.018652352,-0.081026798,-0.049735522000000004,0.19678610100000002,-0.12036191800000001,0.36108602799999995,-0.020590492,-0.00535902,0.008838294,-0.004670217,0.010408363,0.066490361,0.058806085,-0.059367320999999994,-0.010131751999999999,-0.036424351,-0.018198971,0.142535309,0.040714885,0.025124014,0.010596021,0.032208263,-0.024181252,0.05608762,0.048541613,0.002262365,0.022504264,-0.054747172999999996,0.157435529,0.074131182
1139,Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin as a potential novel biomarker for ventilator-associated lung injury,"Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a 25-kDa protein of the lipocalin superfamily and its presence was initially observed in activated neutrophils. It has previously been demonstrated that the expression of NGAL is markedly increased in stimulated epithelia, and is important in the innate immunological response to various pathophysiological conditions, including infection, cancer, inflammation and kidney injury. The present study constructed a ventilator-associated lung injury model in mice. NGAL mRNA and protein expression levels in lung tissue were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. In addition, NGAL protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum were measured via western blotting. The results of the present study suggested that NGAL expression increased under all mechanical ventilation treatments. The increase was most prominent in the high peak inflation pressure and high-volume mechanical ventilation groups, where there was the greatest extent of lung injury. In addition, NGAL expression increased in a time-dependent manner under high-volume mechanical ventilation, consistent with the degree of lung injury.

1141,A novel cause of chronic viral meningoencephalitis: Cache Valley virus,"OBJECTIVE: Immunodeficient patients are particularly vulnerable to neuroinvasive infections that can be challenging to diagnose. Metagenomic next generation sequencing can identify unusual or novel microbes and is therefore well suited for investigating the etiology of chronic meningoencephalitis in immunodeficient patients. METHODS: We present the case of a 34‐year‐old man with X‐linked agammaglobulinemia from Australia suffering from 3 years of meningoencephalitis that defied an etiologic diagnosis despite extensive conventional testing, including a brain biopsy. Metagenomic next generation sequencing of his cerebrospinal fluid and brain biopsy tissue was performed to identify a causative pathogen. RESULTS: Sequences aligning to multiple Cache Valley virus genes were identified via metagenomic next generation sequencing. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry subsequently confirmed the presence of Cache Valley virus in the brain biopsy tissue. INTERPRETATION: Cache Valley virus, a mosquito‐borne orthobunyavirus, has only been identified in 3 immunocompetent North American patients with acute neuroinvasive disease. The reported severity ranges from a self‐limiting meningitis to a rapidly fatal meningoencephalitis with multiorgan failure. The virus has never been known to cause a chronic systemic or neurologic infection in humans. Cache Valley virus has also never previously been detected on the Australian continent. Our research subject traveled to North and South Carolina and Michigan in the weeks prior to the onset of his illness. This report demonstrates that metagenomic next generation sequencing allows for unbiased pathogen identification, the early detection of emerging viruses as they spread to new locales, and the discovery of novel disease phenotypes.

Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed bilateral papilledema in both calves. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction tests for bovine viral diarrhea virus, rotavirus and coronavirus were all negative. The levels of serum vitamin A in the two affected calves were 0.317 µg/dl and 0.481 µg/dl, respectively. These values are much lower than the normal vitamin A levels; therefore, the calves were diagnosed with hypovitaminosis A.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.012253323,-0.006861875,0.034693903,-0.131495285,-0.003220277,0.017126878,-0.002222777,-0.00945844,-0.011094827,-0.04227380000000001,0.032597689,0.038469791,-0.053766482000000004,-0.000796772,0.081046123,-0.027265854,-0.001489085,-0.001439626,-0.012053638,-0.032267261,-0.019439867,-0.0038511770000000003,-0.052231228,-0.0037573359999999996,0.042324369,-0.029765122,-0.008896935,-0.116782845,0.034835298,-0.030455975
1151,Isolation and characterization of a new porcine epidemic diarrhea virus variant that occurred in Korea in 2014,"Outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) have resulted in significant economic losses in the swine industry, and another PED outbreak occurred in 2014 in Korea. Isolating and culturing PED virus (PEDV) allow investigations into its pathogenesis and the development of vaccines and diagnostic assays. In this study, we successfully isolated two PEDV isolates (QIAP1401 and QIAP1402) from naturally infected piglets at Jeju-do, Korea. Viral propagation was confirmed in Vero cells based on cytopathic effect, immunofluorescence assay, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and electron microscopic analyses. The QIAP401 isolate propagated well in Vero cells for 70 passages, with titers of 10(6.5) to 10(7.0) 50% tissue culture infectious dose/mL, which increased gradually with passaging. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the QIAP1401 isolate were determined and compared with those of other PEDV isolates. The QIAP1401 isolate was determined to be closely related to the USA/Minnesota271/2014 strain (> 99.9% nucleotide similarity) that was isolated in the USA in 2014. Phylogenetic analysis based on several PEDV genes suggested that a new PEDV variant is circulating in the Korean swine industry, with 93.08% similarity to the SM98 strain isolated in 1998. In addition, the QIAP1401 strain showed strong virulence in 3-day-old piglets and 11-week-old growing pigs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.048358343,0.006468753000000001,0.093987655,-0.143337186,0.077329836,0.08554871900000001,-0.047041402999999996,-0.048205952,0.029567436000000002,0.013667543,0.027199262000000002,0.095124389,-0.165292911,0.017460569,0.259683131,-0.20784646399999998,-0.07505814599999999,0.062084408,-0.044548742999999995,0.174296972,-0.127715498,-0.079919118,0.121738142,-0.01538076,-0.08534244199999999,-0.013826321,-0.003382439,0.040750503,-0.00552805,0.018078971
1155,Discrimination of Kawasaki disease with concomitant adenoviral detection differentiating from isolated adenoviral infection,"PURPOSE: Human adenovirus infection mimics Kawasaki disease (KD) but can be detected in KD patients. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical differences between KD with adenovirus infection and only adenoviral infection and to identify biomarkers for prediction of adenovirus-positive KD from isolated adenoviral infection. METHODS: A total of 147 patients with isolated adenovirus were identified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, 11 patients having KD with adenovirus, who were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy during the acute phase of KD were also evaluated. RESULTS: Compared with the adenoviral infection group, the KD with adenovirus group was significantly associated with frequent lip and tongue changes, skin rash and changes in the extremities. In the laboratory parameters, higher C-reactive protein (CRP) level and presence of hypoalbuminemia and sterile pyuria were significantly associated with the KD group. In the multivariate analysis, lip and tongue changes (odds ratio [OR], 1.416; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.151–1.741; P=0.001), high CRP level (OR, 1.039; 95% CI 1.743–1.454; P= 0.021) and sterile pyuria (OR 1.052; 95% CI 0.861–1.286; P=0.041) were the significant predictive factors of KD. In addition, the cutoff CRP level related to KD with adenoviral detection was 56 mg/L, with a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 75.9%. CONCLUSION: Lip and tongue changes, higher serum CRP level and sterile pyuria were significantly correlated with adenovirus-positive KD.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.063430871,-0.038946306,-0.020013776,-0.115961429,-0.007366343000000001,-0.017680746,0.004404819,0.004925847,-0.056810245,-0.039807404,-0.025634907000000002,0.041067165,-0.031255154,0.021840749,-0.04391025900000001,0.026292372999999997,-0.024870998999999998,-0.045727309,0.01220855,-0.04276149,-0.04252109900000001,0.003876922,-0.013382828999999999,0.046709405999999995,-0.041105372,-0.008367015,-0.00433307,-0.093815841,-0.081756103,-0.047973423
1158,Nucleoside analogs as a rich source of antiviral agents active against arthropod-borne flaviviruses,"Nucleoside analogs represent the largest class of small molecule-based antivirals, which currently form the backbone of chemotherapy of chronic infections caused by HIV, hepatitis B or C viruses, and herpes viruses. High antiviral potency and favorable pharmacokinetics parameters make some nucleoside analogs suitable also for the treatment of acute infections caused by other medically important RNA and DNA viruses. This review summarizes available information on antiviral research of nucleoside analogs against arthropod-borne members of the genus Flavivirus within the family Flaviviridae, being primarily focused on description of nucleoside inhibitors of flaviviral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, methyltransferase, and helicase/NTPase. Inhibitors of intracellular nucleoside synthesis and newly discovered nucleoside derivatives with high antiflavivirus potency, whose modes of action are currently not completely understood, have drawn attention.

1161,Juglanin ameliorates UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis via anti-inflammatory and proapoptotic effects in vivo and in vitro,"Ultraviolet (UV) radiation induces skin injury, and is associated with the development and formation of melanoma, which is a highly lethal form of skin cancer. Juglanin is a natural product, which is predominantly extracted from Polygonum aviculare, and is considered a functional component among its various compounds. Juglanin has been reported to exert marked protective effects in various diseases via the inhibition of inflammation and tumor cell growth. The present study aimed to explore the effects of juglanin on human skin cancer induced by UV and to reveal the underlying molecular mechanism. In the present study, immunohistochemical analysis, western blot analysis, RT-qPCR analysis and flow cytometry assays were mainly used in vivo and/or in vitro. The results indicated that in mice, UVB exposure increased susceptibility to carcinogens, and accelerated disease pathogenesis. Conversely, juglanin was able to ameliorate this condition via inhibition of inflammation, suppression of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis via p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) blockage, nuclear factor (NF)-κB inactivation and caspase stimulation in vivo. In addition, in vitro, the present study demonstrated that treatment of UVB-stimulated B16F10 melanoma cells with juglanin resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability, as well as increased apoptosis via the upregulation of caspase expression and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. In addition, juglanin markedly attenuated p38/JNK signaling, inactivated the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway and suppressed UVB-induced NF-κB activation. Taken together, these results indicated the possibility of applying juglanin in combination with UVB as a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing skin cancer.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.091559054,-0.027293487999999998,0.0045995920000000004,-0.12267374800000001,-0.11754495599999999,0.072994588,0.048789264000000006,-0.053680685,0.078449293,-0.03298093,-0.069427451,-0.013765405,-0.013909091,0.092852411,-0.023787265,0.013789458999999999,0.002784742,-0.034070339,-0.011634452,-0.035039187,0.047597253,-0.018936265,0.030647121,-0.004872611,0.02737407,0.026166472000000003,-0.011028563,0.041488321,0.047447573,-0.09090129599999999
1162,Viral Fitness Correlates with the Magnitude and Direction of the Perturbation Induced in the Host’s Transcriptome: The Tobacco Etch Potyvirus—Tobacco Case Study,"Determining the fitness of viral genotypes has become a standard practice in virology as it is essential to evaluate their evolutionary potential. Darwinian fitness, defined as the advantage of a given genotype with respect to a reference one, is a complex property that captures, in a single figure, differences in performance at every stage of viral infection. To what extent does viral fitness result from specific molecular interactions with host factors and regulatory networks during infection? Can we identify host genes in functional classes whose expression depends on viral fitness? Here, we compared the transcriptomes of tobacco plants infected with seven genotypes of tobacco etch potyvirus that differ in fitness. We found that the larger the fitness differences among genotypes, the more dissimilar the transcriptomic profiles are. Consistently, two different mutations, one in the viral RNA polymerase and another in the viral suppressor of RNA silencing, resulted in significantly similar gene expression profiles. Moreover, we identified host genes whose expression showed a significant correlation, positive or negative, with the virus' fitness. Differentially expressed genes which were positively correlated with viral fitness activate hormone- and RNA silencing-mediated pathways of plant defense. In contrast, those that were negatively correlated with fitness affect metabolism, reducing growth, and development. Overall, these results reveal the high information content of viral fitness and suggest its potential use to predict differences in genomic profiles of infected hosts.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.09576128800000001,-0.047207745,-0.019799332,-0.027681319,-0.043336873,0.01627982,0.05971913,-0.009539844,0.010325059000000001,0.018972726000000002,-0.022956027,-0.026709281,-0.005954915999999999,0.065654073,-0.01100815,-0.000992349,-0.028232074,-0.044710302,-0.063898375,-0.015645096,0.019745378,0.00137947,-0.027812682999999998,0.057898622000000004,-0.09344239,-0.056726509,0.076820532,-0.042849295999999995,0.0008041410000000001,-0.002498022
1165,CXCL9 promotes prostate cancer progression through inhibition of cytokines from T cells,"Chemokines have been demonstrated to serve an important role in a variety of diseases, particularly in tumor progression. There have been numerous studies that have reported that T cells serve major roles in tumor progression. However, the function of CXC motif chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9) in prostate cancer remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the role of CXCL9 in prostate cancer. A prostate cancer mouse model was generated by treating C57/BL-6 and B6.Cg-Selplgtm1Fur/J mice with 3,2′-dimethyl 4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB). Hematoxylin and eosin staining detected the histopathological alterations of mouse prostate tissues. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining determined cell proliferation of the mice. Flow cytometry was used to detect the alterations of T cells in C57+DMAB or CXCL9+DMAB mice. Immunofluorescence revealed that there was positive expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β in the mouse tissues. The survival rates of C57+DMAB and CXCL9+DMAB mice was analyzed. The association of CXCL9 expression and clinical stages was also evaluated. Results revealed that prostate cancer pathology and cell proliferation in CXCL9+DMAB mice were significantly greater compared with the C57+DMAB mice. Compared with C57+DMAB mice, the number of T cells in peripheral blood and spleen of CXCL9+DMAB mice was significantly reduced. IHC demonstrated that the expression of IL-6 and TGF-β was significantly downregulated in the CXCL9+DMAB mice. The survival rate of CXCL9+DMAB mice was significantly decreased compared with the C57+DMAB mice. In addition, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that CXCL9 mRNA expression in clinical samples was positively associated with clinical pathological stages of prostate cancer. In conclusion, CXCL9 may promote prostate cancer progression via inhibition of cytokines from T cells.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.046675905,-0.028397366,0.01187688,-0.113654873,-0.060408209000000004,0.040672545,0.021649518,-0.027341793,0.031835296,-0.042864872000000005,-0.027429917999999998,-0.017845007,-0.015845707,0.041326576000000004,0.004067652,0.02816152,-0.012221391000000002,-0.036530428999999996,-0.027049719,-0.044449975,0.038086225,-0.032481319,0.021737591,0.006204014,0.001532652,-0.000565389,-0.008365991,0.014261718,0.015920135,-0.043523022
1167,Emodin induces apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepaRG cells via the mitochondrial caspase-dependent pathway,"Emodin-induced hepatotoxicity in vivo and in vitro has been gaining increasing attention. However, the exact molecular pathways underlying these effects remain poorly clarified. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of emodin on HepaRG cells and to define the underlying mechanism. The results demonstrated that emodin evidently inhibited HepaRG cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner by blocking cell cycle progression in the S and G2/M phase and by inducing apoptosis. Emodin treatment also resulted in generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which abrogated mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). The above effects were all suppressed by antioxidants, such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Further studies by western blot analysis howed that emodin upregulated p53, p21, Bax, cyclin E, cleaved caspase-3, 8 and 9, and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP). However, the protein expression of Bcl-2, cyclin A and CDK2 was downregulated. Taken together, our results suggest that emodin induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway through cell cycle arrest and ROS generation in HepaRG cells.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.087687808,-0.034039115,-0.010506157,-0.116060281,-0.096323428,0.06756894299999999,0.051056225,-0.040930108,0.061925554,-0.024924673999999997,-0.05796214,-0.016964171,-0.016337598999999998,0.07808465099999999,-0.008151166999999999,0.028185319,0.003258935,-0.015527187,0.014688813,-0.02185687,0.029574887,-0.008677489,0.020592337,-0.033811561000000004,0.030735954,0.03532532,-0.031837172999999996,0.046397441,0.002437505,-0.061102018
1168,Elevated serum LAMC2 is associated with lymph node metastasis and predicts poor prognosis in penile squamous cell carcinoma,"PURPOSE: Molecular biomarkers, especially serologic factors, have been widely applied in cancer diagnosis and patient follow-up. However, there are few valuable prognostic factors in penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC). Here, the authors investigated whether laminin gamma 2 (LAMC2) expression, especially serum LAMC2 (sLAMC2) level, was a suitable prognostic factor that could aid in the prediction of survival in PSCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 114 PSCC patients. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were performed to detect LAMC2 expression; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to test sLAMC2 concentration; and a Transwell assay and an in vivo experiment in nude mice were used to test PSCC cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. The chi-squared test was used to analyze the association between LAMC2 level and clinical parameters, the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate the hazard ratio for death, and Kaplan–Meier analysis with a log-rank test was used for the survival analysis. RESULTS: LAMC2 was overexpressed in PSCC tissues, and the LAMC2 expression level was higher in metastatic lymph node (LN) tissues than in primary cancer tissues; moreover, the LAMC2 levels in primary cancer tissues and sLAMC2 were higher in patients with LN metastasis than in those without LN metastasis. Upregulated LAMC2 facilitated the migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of PSCC cells in vitro and promoted LN metastasis of PSCC cells in nude mice. Elevated LAMC2 levels were strongly correlated with advanced clinicopathologic parameters, especially LN metastasis, in PSCC patients and predicted shorter disease-specific survival. The predictive value of sLAMC2 is superior to that of C-reactive protein and squamous cell carcinoma antigen previously reported in PSCC patients, and a stratification analysis revealed that the level of sLAMC2 had a higher predictive value for disease-specific survival in early penile cancer (especially at the N(0/X) stage) than in later-stage penile cancer. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that sLAMC2 is a potential serologic prognostic marker in PSCC and could aid in risk stratification in early-stage PSCC patients.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.006040493,-0.007907028,0.0075673630000000006,-0.11911722599999999,-0.075217467,0.021693545,-0.0027173490000000004,0.007270186,-0.017886603,-0.017309087,-0.043025992,-0.006094154,-0.001966722,0.044074037999999996,-0.021426353999999998,0.014527181,0.0044960090000000005,-0.009517073000000001,-0.027249225,-0.035968673,0.031000955,-0.04267611599999999,0.016292972,-0.016986558,-0.018966285,-0.006394901,-0.002701902,-0.008169878,-0.013968623000000001,-0.019168583
1169,Identification of Cystoisospora ohioensis in a Diarrheal Dog in Korea,"A 3-month-old female Maltese puppy was hospitalized with persistent diarrhea in a local veterinary clinic. Blood chemistry and hematology profile were analyzed and fecal smear was examined. Diarrheal stools were examined in a diagnostic laboratory, using multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) against 23 diarrheal pathogens. Sequence analysis was performed using nested PCR amplicon of 18S ribosomal RNA. Coccidian oocysts were identified in the fecal smear. Although multiplex real-time PCR was positive for Cyclospora cayetanensis, the final diagnosis was Cystoisospora ohioensis infection, confirmed by phylogenetic analysis of 18S rRNA.

1170,Restriction of H1N1 influenza virus infection by selenium nanoparticles loaded with ribavirin via resisting caspase-3 apoptotic pathway,"INTRODUCTION: Ribavirin (RBV) is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug. Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) attract much attention in the biomedical field and are used as carriers of drugs in current research studies. In this study, SeNPs were decorated by RBV, and the novel nanoparticle system was well characterized. Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells were infected with H1N1 influenza virus before treatment with RBV, SeNPs, and SeNPs loaded with RBV (Se@RBV). METHODS AND RESULTS: MTT assay showed that Se@RBV nanoparticles protect cells during H1N1 infection in vitro. Se@RBV depressed virus titer in the culture supernatant. Intracellular localization detection revealed that Se@RBV accumulated in lysosome and escaped to cytoplasm as time elapsed. Furthermore, activation of caspase-3 was resisted by Se@RBV. Expressions of proteins related to caspase-3, including cleaved poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, caspase-8, and Bax, were downregulated evidently after treatment with Se@RBV compared with the untreated infection group. In addition, phosphorylations of phosphorylated 38 (p38), JNK, and phosphorylated 53 (p53) were inhibited as well. In vivo experiments indicated that Se@RBV was found to prevent lung injury in H1N1-infected mice through hematoxylin and eosin staining. Tunel test of lung tissues present that DNA damage reached a high level but reduced substantially when treated with Se@RBV. Immunohistochemical test revealed an identical result with the in vitro experiment that activations of caspase-3 and proteins on the apoptosis pathway were restrained by Se@RBV treatment. CONCLUSION: Taken together, this study elaborates that Se@RBV is a novel promising agent against H1N1 influenza virus infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.030178015,-0.033513842,0.010460203000000001,-0.061413579,-0.059980085,0.09407420699999999,0.005127746,-0.009838737,0.023989879,-0.038757856,-0.012703478999999998,0.012672788999999999,-0.015683989,-0.006627241,0.041368294,0.069642763,0.058547952,0.023662222000000004,-0.002033645,0.008520021,0.03068594,0.014535421000000001,-0.002519313,-0.018475312,-0.0022058489999999997,0.002476435,-0.023719059,0.021900011,0.007486119,-0.002199108
1171,"Molecular detection and phylogenetic properties of isolated infectious bronchitis viruses from broilers in Ahvaz, southwest Iran, based on partial sequences of spike gene","Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious disease involving mostly upper respiratory tract in chickens, leading to significant economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. One of the major concerns regarding to IB is the emergence of new types of infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs). The purpose of this study was to identify the IBVs isolated from Iranian broiler chickens with respiratory symptoms. Twenty-five broiler flocks around Ahwaz (southwest of Iran) were examined for IBV. The specimens including trachea, lung, liver, kidney, and ceacal tonsil, were collected from diseased birds and inoculated into chicken embryonated eggs. Harvested allantoic fluids were subjected to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers in order to amplify spike 1 (S1) gene of IBV. The RT-PCR products of four IBV isolates were sequenced. The results showed that from 25 examined flocks with respiratory disease, 12 flocks (48.00%) were positive for IBV. In phylogenetic analysis, our isolates were closely related to the QX-like viruses such as PCRLab/06/2012 (Iran), QX, HC9, HC10, CK/CH/GX/NN11-1, CK/CH/JS/YC11-1, CK/CH/JS/2010/13, CK/CH/JS/2011/2 (China), QX/SGK-21, QX/SGK-11 (Iraq) with nucleotide homology up to 99.00%. This study indicates the role of IBVs in the respiratory disorders of broiler flocks located in southwest Iran, and also the existence of a variant of IBV, which is distinguishable from the other Iranian variants.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.012636917,-0.006561795,0.089550445,-0.093570965,0.17647734199999998,0.06705657,-0.13336958,-0.08842991900000001,0.10967600699999999,0.30264503800000003,0.084233105,0.037555286,-0.079899976,0.060303920999999996,-0.112987891,0.11521685699999999,0.024566439,0.010237233,0.030037855,0.020474366,-0.039500263,-0.018149389,-0.020911806,-0.034801556000000004,0.005026588,0.022794172,-0.02405618,0.024366949,0.066448269,-0.074533074
1173,p53- and ROS-mediated AIF pathway involved in TGEV-induced apoptosis,"We previously demonstrated that transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) could induce apoptosis through caspase signaling. However, apoptosis was not completely prevented by caspases inhibitors, suggesting that there may be a caspase-independent pathway involved in TGEV-induced cell apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the regulation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) on TGEV-induced apoptotic pathway. Results indicated that AIF translocated from the mitochondria to nucleus during TGEV infection, and the AIF inhibitor, N-phenylmaleimide (NP), significantly attenuated the apoptosis. In addition, the translocation of AIF was inhibited by Veliparib (ABT-888), an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). And the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamic (PDTC), redistributed AIF in the mitochondria and nucleus in TGEV-infected cells. Moreover, the protein levels in nucleus and the mRNA levels of AIF were inhibited in the presence of the p53 inhibitor, piﬁthrin-α (PFT-α) or in TGEV-infected p53−/−cells. Furthermore, TGEV-induced apoptosis was blocked by combination of three or more inhibitors, such as pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, NP, ABT-888, PDTC, PFT-α, to treat PK-15 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the p53- and ROS-mediated AIF pathway and caspase-dependent pathway were involved in TGEV-induced apoptosis.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.096577933,-0.042394492,-0.005268582,-0.12449432199999999,-0.084029151,0.06596842,0.022923077000000004,-0.053412812000000004,0.073330595,-0.053544862,-0.051498372,-0.013745085,-0.046663379000000005,0.088643375,0.012837326999999999,0.015456177,0.011051196000000001,-0.024478497000000002,0.028032254,0.026795995,0.029379834,0.0038843420000000003,0.027317321000000002,-0.000399926,0.088772655,0.021791672999999998,-0.043882677,0.032105411,0.024615497000000004,-0.032084097
1174,Xanthine-based acyclic nucleoside phosphonates with potent antiviral activity against varicella-zoster virus and human cytomegalovirus,"While noncanonic xanthine nucleotides XMP/dXMP play an important role in balancing and maintaining intracellular purine nucleotide pool as well as in potential mutagenesis, surprisingly, acyclic nucleoside phosphonates bearing a xanthine nucleobase have not been studied so far for their antiviral properties. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of xanthine-based acyclic nucleoside phosphonates and evaluation of their activity against a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses. Two acyclic nucleoside phosphonates within the series, namely 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]xanthine (PMEX) and 9-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]xanthine (HPMPX), were shown to possess activity against several human herpesviruses. The most potent compound was PMEX, a xanthine analogue of adefovir (PMEA). PMEX exhibited a single digit µM activity against VZV (EC(50) = 2.6 µM, TK(+) Oka strain) and HCMV (EC(50) = 8.5 µM, Davis strain), while its hexadecyloxypropyl monoester derivative was active against HSV-1 and HSV-2 (EC(50) values between 1.8 and 4.0 µM). In contrast to acyclovir, PMEX remained active against the TK(–) VZV 07–1 strain with EC(50) = 4.58 µM. PMEX was suggested to act as an inhibitor of viral DNA polymerase and represents the first reported xanthine-based acyclic nucleoside phosphonate with potent antiviral properties.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.08611641099999999,-0.032690448,-0.008801635,-0.031059881,-0.061686542999999996,0.053278013,0.05185667099999999,-0.008812128,0.023743101000000003,0.008394363,0.02038058,0.063943189,-0.009047525,-0.023159365,0.001633058,0.007454608000000001,-0.019490625,0.089281148,0.078863794,-0.043218874000000004,0.006493129,-0.000318132,0.018948993,0.053275660999999995,0.028916845,0.001114147,-0.029521834,0.008961963,0.013215315,0.005677078
1176,Construction and next-generation sequencing analysis of a large phage-displayed V(NAR) single-domain antibody library from six naïve nurse sharks,"BACKGROUND: Shark new antigen receptor variable domain (V(NAR)) antibodies can bind restricted epitopes that may be inaccessible to conventional antibodies. METHODS: Here, we developed a library construction method based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-Extension Assembly and Self-Ligation (named “EASeL”) to construct a large V(NAR) antibody library with a size of 1.2 × 10(10) from six naïve adult nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum). RESULTS: The next-generation sequencing analysis of 1.19 million full-length V(NAR)s revealed that this library is highly diversified because it covers all four classical V(NAR) types (Types I–IV) including 11% of classical Type I and 57% of classical Type II. About 30% of the total V(NAR)s could not be categorized as any of the classical types. The high variability of complementarity determining region (CDR) 3 length and cysteine numbers are important for the diversity of V(NAR)s. To validate the use of the shark V(NAR) library for antibody discovery, we isolated a panel of V(NAR) phage binders to cancer therapy-related antigens, including glypican-3, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and programmed cell death-1 (PD1). Additionally, we identified binders to viral antigens that included the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spike proteins. The isolated shark single-domain antibodies including Type I and Type II V(NAR)s were produced in Escherichia coli and validated for their antigen binding. A Type II V(NAR) (PE38-B6) has a high affinity (K(d) = 10.1 nM) for its antigen. CONCLUSIONS: The naïve nurse shark V(NAR) library is a useful source for isolating single-domain antibodies to a wide range of antigens. The EASeL method may be applicable to the construction of other large diversity gene expression libraries.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.029722528999999998,0.025237356000000002,0.005461646999999999,-0.06042034599999999,-0.020170905,0.024764533999999998,0.011582872,-0.003117891,0.034243295,-0.005278403,-0.029363525,0.008983348,-0.001426945,-0.028812147000000003,0.011466687,-0.015167311999999999,-0.008090387,-0.02084964,-0.022227135,-0.006631056,0.021691942000000002,-0.011406683999999999,0.015928496,-0.011555628,0.015123929,0.00032617599999999996,-0.009180101999999999,0.011735052,-0.017635388999999998,-0.010713417
1179,SOX2 knockdown inhibits the migration and invasion of basal cell carcinoma cells by targeting the SRPK1-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway,"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of human skin cancer, which is driven by the aberrant activation of Hedgehog signaling. Previous evidence indicated that sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2) is associated with the tumor metastasis. However, the expression and role of SOX2 in BCC remain unknown. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to analyze the possible mechanism of SOX2 in the progression of BCC. The levels of SOX2 in BCC cells were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Transwell assays were also used to determine the migration and invasion of BCC cells. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence were used for analyzing the role of SOX2 knockdown in the serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1)-mediated phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway in BCC cells. The results demonstrated that SOX2 is overexpressed in BCC tissues and cells. In addition, SOX2 knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of BCC cells, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress of BCC cells. It was also observed that SOX2 knockdown decreased SRPK1 expression, which further led to the downregulation of PI3K and AKT expression levels in BCC cells. Furthermore, SRPK1 transfection or PI3K/AKT pathway activation abolished the inhibitory effects of SOX2 knockdown on the migration, invasion and EMT progress of BCC cells. In conclusion, these results indicated that SOX2 may potentially serve as a target for BCC therapy by targeting the SRPK1-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.063348596,-0.028626952,0.005403163000000001,-0.097352572,-0.062906435,0.036049813,0.019119603,-0.029870272000000003,0.037904347000000005,-0.03573309,-0.036769073,-0.008909911999999999,-0.012277274,0.044097591,0.004133742,0.026327864,-0.0015398,-0.024152607000000003,-0.008015685,-0.025786391000000002,0.02346145,-0.007395276,0.020905253000000002,-0.004321011,0.010897367,0.012351477,-0.018568437,0.031745059,0.00256453,-0.029203713
1180,"Molecular Characterization of Two Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases: p38 MAP Kinase and Ribosomal S6 Kinase From Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae), and Insight Into Their Roles in Response to BmNPV Infection","Proteins p38 map kinase and ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) as members of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play important roles against pathogens. In this study, Bmp38 and BmS6K were identified as differentially expressed proteins from iTRAQ database. Bmp38 and BmS6K were expressed, and recombinant proteins were purified. The bioinformatics analysis showed that both proteins have serine/threonine-protein kinases, catalytic domain (S_TKc) with 360 and 753 amino acids, respectively. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results suggest that Bmp38 and BmS6K had high expression in the midgut and hemolymph. The comparative expression level of Bmp38 and BmS6K in BC9 was upregulated than in P50 in the midgut after Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) infection. Western bolt results showed a positive correlation between RT-qPCR and iTRAQ data for Bmp38, but BmS6K data showed partial correlation with iTRAQ. Injection of anti-Bmp38 and anti-BmS6K serum suggested that Bmp38 may be involved against BmNPV infection, whereas BmS6K may require phosphorylation modification to inhibit BmNPV infection. Taken together, our results suggest that Bmp38 and BmS6k might play an important role in innate immunity of silkworm against BmNPV.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.082258125,-0.0067731959999999996,0.028874897000000004,-0.079512628,-0.06077698,0.017773831,-0.003023588,-0.045931770999999996,0.06339714099999999,-0.06120681,-0.094859839,-0.013437097,-0.01701154,0.072046033,-0.06488809200000001,-0.090131562,0.09836384199999999,-0.06581360900000001,-0.01198564,-0.018757931999999998,-0.0061508019999999995,0.04666838400000001,-0.01407151,-0.029372407000000003,0.043476595,0.080587559,0.059711521,-0.009159843,0.010597407,-0.018025518

First, an artificial single-unit chimeric enzyme made by fusing an mRNA capping enzyme and a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Second, specific DNA templates designed to operate with the C3P3-G1 enzyme, which encode for the transcripts and their artificial polyadenylation. This system, which can potentially be adapted to any in cellulo or in vivo eukaryotic expression applications, was optimized for transient expression in mammalian cells.

1182,Evaluation of equine coronavirus fecal shedding among hospitalized horses,"BACKGROUND: Currently, diagnosis of equine coronavirus (ECoV) relies on the exclusion of other infectious causes of enteric disease along with molecular detection of ECoV in feces or tissue. Although this approach is complete, it is costly and may not always be achievable. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the overall fecal shedding of ECoV in hospitalized horses is low. Our objective was to determine whether systemically healthy horses and horses with gastrointestinal disorders shed ECoV in their feces at the time of admission to a referral hospital and after 48 hours of stress associated with hospitalization. ANIMALS: One‐hundred thirty adult horses admitted to the Washington State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital for gastrointestinal disease (n = 65) or for imaging under anesthesia (n = 65) that were hospitalized for 48 hours. Owner consent was obtained before sampling. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected at admission and 48 hours later. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for ECoV and electron microscopy (EM) were performed on all samples. RESULTS: Only 1 of 258 fecal samples was PCR‐positive for ECoV. Electron microscopy identified ECoV‐like particles in 9 of 258 samples, parvovirus‐like particles in 4 of 258 samples, and rotavirus‐like particles in 1 of 258 samples. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The presence of ECoV in feces of hospitalized adult horses was low. Thus, fecal samples that are PCR‐positive for ECoV in adult horses that have clinical signs consistent with this viral infection are likely to be of diagnostic relevance. The clinical relevance of the viruses observed using EM remains to be investigated.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.041466246,0.001408196,0.063867408,-0.075433683,0.026641755,-0.00077664,0.017111604,0.013765811999999999,-0.031991496,-0.023176332999999997,0.044197367,0.018287999,-0.023805826000000002,-0.001174304,0.04730879599999999,-0.015014848,0.016156839,0.0010583539999999998,-0.004451549,-0.05453945599999999,0.01225135,0.034510427999999996,-0.060819001,-0.026622809,0.039824911,-0.022347988,-0.039657812,-0.019252321,-0.013784023000000001,-0.00890556
1183,Plant-derived antiviral drugs as novel hepatitis B virus inhibitors: Cell culture and molecular docking study,"Despite high anti-HBV efficacies, while the nucleoside analogs (e.g., lamivudine) lead to the emergence of drug-resistance, interferons (e.g., IFN-α causes adverse side-effects.

Hence, new antiviral strategies must focus not only on synthetic molecules but also on potential natural compounds. In this report, we have combined the in vitro cell culture and in silico molecular docking methods to assess the novel anti-HBV activity and delineate the inhibitory mechanism of selected plant-derived pure compounds of different classes. Of the tested (2.5-50 μg/ml) twelve non-cytotoxic compounds, ten (10 μg/ml) were found to maximally inhibit HBsAg production at day 5. Compared to quercetin (73%), baccatin III (71%), psoralen (67%), embelin (65%), menisdaurin (64%) and azadirachtin (62%) that showed high inhibition of HBeAg synthesis, lupeol (52%), rutin (47%), β-sitosterol (43%) and hesperidin (41%) had moderate efficacies against HBV replication. Further assessment of quercetin in combination with the highly active compounds, enhanced its anti-HBV activity up to 10%. Being the most important drug target, a 3-D structure of HBV polymerase (Pol/RT) was modeled and docked with the active compounds, including lamivudine as standard. Docking of lamivudine indicated strong interaction with the modeled HBV Pol active-site residues that formed stable complex (∆G = −5.2 kcal/mol). Similarly, all the docked antiviral compounds formed very stable complexes with HBV Pol (∆G = −6.1 to −9.3 kcal/mol). Taken together, our data suggest the anti-HBV potential of the tested natural compounds as novel viral Pol/RT inhibitors.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.092364888,-0.019736591,0.001724342,-0.031269623999999996,-0.13124301300000002,0.080773857,0.08677541400000001,-0.020042058,0.045553869000000004,-0.00994525,-0.00774991,0.053186575,-0.035335941,0.026679545,-0.034464102999999996,0.0013866120000000002,-0.006285412,0.11268082800000001,0.067322244,-0.034938034,-0.007272829000000001,0.028067922999999998,-0.011361467,0.084297685,0.04096485,0.018554618999999998,0.048853174000000006,-0.024315079,0.089076705,-0.021298228
1185,Nested–polymerase chain reaction detection of Pneumocystis carinii f. sp. canis in a suspected immunocompromised Cavalier King Charles spaniel with multiple infections,"A 7-month-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel female was referred due to a chronic cough refractory to antibiotic treatments. Laboratory findings showed leukocytosis, increased serum C-reactive protein, hypogammaglobulinemia, and decreased total serum immunoglobulin G concentration. Thoracic radiographs showed a mild bronchial pattern. Cytology of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid revealed a septic inflammation. Bordetella bronchiseptica, Mycoplasma spp., and Pneumocystis carinii were identified by polymerase chain reaction testing, and Klebsiella pneumonia was cultured from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Moreover, Escherichia coli was also cultured from urine. Pneumocystis spp. identification was done by sequencing of genetic amplicons. The dog died due to cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to a spontaneous pneumothorax on the day following the procedure. This report documents the detection of Pneumocystis carinii f. sp. canis in a suspected immunocompromised Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with concurrent pulmonary and urinary tract infections involving four different pathogens, and highlights the importance of the use of polymerase chain reaction testing to detect canine Pneumocystis spp. in cases with negative bronchoalveolar lavage cytology.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.026284597000000003,-0.010355536,0.01806938,-0.121575592,-0.035992154,0.013458168000000001,0.011695913,0.037193275,-0.03841291,0.015506166000000002,-0.010472179,0.009421745,0.0008755389999999999,-0.041313768,0.014486833999999999,-0.005280914,-0.010225965,0.003415166,-0.016683883,-0.026456506,0.053590585999999996,0.01926801,-0.004093033,-0.05700876,0.05396979,0.0064571609999999995,-0.039114229,-0.011078573999999999,-0.003755915,-0.013655744
1186,"Occurrence of infectious bronchitis in layer birds in Plateau state, north central Nigeria","A flock of 54 wk-old layer birds exhibiting signs of respiratory distress, greenish diarrhea, and drop in egg production was investigated. A marked drop in egg production (55%) was recorded with eggs appearing white and soft-shelled. Mortality was in the range of 1%–2% with post-mortem lesions revealing cloudy air sacs, frothy, and congested lungs. Viral RNA was extracted from pooled tissue samples (trachea, lungs, spleen, and liver) and tested for Avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, virus isolation was attempted in 9–11 day-old embryonating chicken eggs (ECE). In order to determine the prevalence of IBV serotype(s) in the flock, serum samples were screened by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test using IBV antigens and antisera (Arkansas, Connecticut, and Massachusetts). Neither AIV nor NDV but IBV was detected in the tissue samples by RT-PCR. In addition, virus isolate obtained after four serial passages in ECE produced dwarfed, stunted, and hemorrhagic embryos, and the isolate was confirmed by RT-PCR to be IBV. The serum samples were 100% seropositive for three serotypes with HI titres ranging from 5 to 12 Log(2). In this study, IBV was confirmed as the causative agent of the observed respiratory distress and drop in egg production. Also, the evidence of co-circulation of multiple IBV serotypes was established, this to the best of our knowledge is the first of such report in Nigeria. We recommend extensive molecular and sero-epidemiology of circulating IBV genotypes and serotypes in Nigeria with the aim of developing better control strategies, including vaccination.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.01781741,-0.00190507,0.138046254,-0.068189122,0.160243408,0.09471324099999999,-0.179712777,-0.101540611,0.106468614,0.337680489,0.1357388,0.00027531,-0.09921723800000001,0.120492061,-0.123247494,0.152740455,0.046414532,0.006343685999999999,0.040181099,0.021030682000000002,-0.07593562599999999,0.011479379,-0.021822253,-0.05506133,0.018977011000000002,0.036183746,-0.014410214,0.014178721000000002,0.064630776,-0.048035139000000004
1191,Causative agents and epidemiology of diarrhea in Korean native calves,"Calf diarrhea caused by infectious agents is associated with economic losses in the cattle industry. The purpose of this study was to identify the causative agents and epidemiological characteristics of diarrhea in Korean native calves (KNC). In total, 207 diarrheal KNC aged less than 7 months were investigated. Fecal samples collected from the rectum were examined for causative agents using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time PCR and the number of oocysts were counted. Fourteen causative agents were detected from 164 of the 207 diarrheal KNC. Rotavirus was the most common agent (34.8%), followed by Eimeria spp. (31.7%), Escherichia coli (22.0%), Giardia spp. (14.0%), Clostridium difficile (9.8%), bovine viral diarrhea virus (8.5%), coronavirus (7.9%), Cryptosporidium spp. (7.3%), torovirus (6.7%), parvovirus (5.5%), norovirus (4.9%), kobuvirus (1.8%), adenovirus (1.2%), and Salmonella spp. (0.6%). About 95 (57.9%) of 164 calves were infected with a single causative agent and 42.1% were infected by multiple agents. No significant difference was observed in mortality between calves infected with a single agent and multiple agents. The occurrence of diarrhea caused by rotavirus, Eimeria spp., kobuvirus, and Giardia spp. was significantly different based on onset age, and the prevalence of diarrhea caused by rotavirus or C. difficile was significantly different between seasons. This study help the understanding of KNC diarrhea for the development of an effective strategy for disease prevention and control, especially in Eastern provinces of South Korea.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.028615761,-0.012378898000000001,0.058074945,-0.10919674800000001,0.019582798999999998,0.019256723,0.038076235,-0.023629782000000002,-0.013675505,0.007516979,0.034325133,0.043651985,-0.067810702,-0.035423605,0.113579407,-0.047554478,-0.02900657,-0.002019369,0.04202527599999999,-0.009885320999999999,-0.005617696,0.061707832000000004,-0.055057336,-0.000443925,0.059695318,-0.059389424,-0.010800252,-0.09849247,0.030279191,-0.011659382
1193,Prevalence of feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukaemia virus in domestic cats in Hungary,"OBJECTIVES: Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) are retroviruses affecting cats worldwide. The objectives of the study were to estimate the prevalence of these retroviruses in domestic cats in Hungary and to characterise the phylogenetic relationships of FIV strains. METHODS: A total of 335 anticoagulated whole-blood samples obtained from both a healthy and ill cat population were examined for the presence of FIV and FeLV with two methods: ELISA and PCR. Statistical analysis was carried out to analyse the data obtained. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of partial polymerase (pol) gene sequences was performed to describe circulating FIV subtypes. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed 11.8% and 9.9% true prevalence of FeLV and FIV, respectively, with ELISA. The apparent prevalence calculated from the PCR results were 17.3% for FeLV and 13.1% for FIV. Phylogenetic analysis of partial pol gene sequences obtained from 22 FIV strains showed that all observed Hungarian strains belonged to FIV subtype B. The strains were grouped into several monophyletic subgroups reflecting the geographic locations of the origin of the samples. The overall mean genetic similarity between the analysed strains was 98.2%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We report the first thorough overview of the prevalence of FeLV and FIV in Hungary, which is relatively high, and give insight into the genetic diversity of Hungarian strains of FIV.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.023976794,-0.012314502,0.06201492,-0.125808604,0.098006624,0.048075225,0.011191439,-0.007509602,-0.019708655,-0.044906438,0.124635276,-0.007598759,0.050693592999999995,-0.024841066000000002,-0.039070548999999996,-0.019967301,0.001778916,-0.006674812,-0.007667861999999999,-0.002103446,0.03979043,0.015754283,0.024043807,0.031684397999999996,-0.0014612479999999998,-0.017216659,0.00043677300000000005,0.019607177,-0.00749756,0.03187172
1198,Gene-Specific Countermeasures against Ebola Virus Based on Antisense Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomers,"The filoviruses Marburg virus and Ebola virus (EBOV) quickly outpace host immune responses and cause hemorrhagic fever, resulting in case fatality rates as high as 90% in humans and nearly 100% in nonhuman primates. The development of an effective therapeutic for EBOV is a daunting public health challenge and is hampered by a paucity of knowledge regarding filovirus pathogenesis. This report describes a successful strategy for interfering with EBOV infection using antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs). A combination of EBOV-specific PMOs targeting sequences of viral mRNAs for the viral proteins (VPs) VP24, VP35, and RNA polymerase L protected rodents in both pre- and post-exposure therapeutic regimens. In a prophylactic proof-of-principal trial, the PMOs also protected 75% of rhesus macaques from lethal EBOV infection. The work described here may contribute to development of designer, “druggable” countermeasures for filoviruses and other microbial pathogens.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.053092752,-0.027799407999999998,-0.000100716,-0.028817122999999997,-0.065636932,0.054034537,0.05959783900000001,0.020058065,0.021224659,0.02092415,-0.00666623,-0.024543745,0.013304578000000001,-0.017782358999999998,0.013129412,0.012142988,-0.034659201,0.028033823,-0.041104217,0.008137944,-0.012471494,0.0040449679999999995,-0.059674272,0.021918112000000003,0.02475496,-0.015395522,0.034276647,-0.009439052,0.016397561,0.010001600000000001
1202,Quantitative measurement of thyroglobulin mRNA in peripheral blood of patients after total thyroidectomy,"Previous studies have reported the clinical usefulness of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of thyroglobulin (TG) mRNA in the peripheral blood of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma. To evaluate this usefulness, we measured TG mRNA in the peripheral blood of patients diagnosed with thyroid carcinoma after total thyroidectomy by real-time quantitative RT-PCR using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA as an internal control. Surprisingly, we detected TG mRNA in all samples obtained after total thyroidectomy, including those from 4 medullary carcinomas. Further, there was no statistical difference in expression levels of TG mRNA in the patients with or without metastasis, and no significant correlation was found between serum TG concentrations and the expression levels of TG mRNA. These results give rise to a question regarding the clinical applications of not only RT-PCR detection but also quantitative measurement of TG mRNA in peripheral blood. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign http://www.bjcancer.com",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.042114773,0.03637444,0.10358441300000001,-0.090240975,-0.079064644,-0.047538471,-0.048260488,0.013968068,-0.056822951,-0.063031584,-0.031856421,-0.052993862,0.017002178,0.150493285,-0.056572605,0.0036968659999999996,0.048794739000000004,-0.031595212000000004,-0.050563448,-0.08780352,0.038720169,0.013446461000000002,0.0074710259999999995,0.019303708,-0.032342287000000004,-0.080947767,0.011580833,0.010828615,0.13289492,-0.025461661
1203,Norwalk-like calicivirus genes in farm animals.,"Viruses closely related to Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) were recently found in stored stool samples from two calves (United Kingdom and Germany) and four pigs (Japan), sparking discussions about the potential for zoonotic transmission. To investigate if NLVs are commonly present in farm animals, pooled stool samples from 100 pig farms, 48 chicken farms, 43 dairy cow herds, and 75 veal calf farms from the Netherlands were assayed by reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction amplification, using primers specific for the detection of NLVs from humans. NLV RNA was detected in 33 (44%) of the specimens from veal calf farms and two (2%) specimens from pig farms. Our data show that NLV infections until recently thought to be restricted to humans occur often in calves and sometimes in pigs. While zoonotic transmission has not been proven, these findings suggest that calves and pigs may be reservoir hosts of NLVs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.013196831000000001,0.000995352,0.06107226,-0.050187552,0.074925593,0.039453981,0.03269838,0.010660286000000001,-0.012666695,-0.0008995889999999999,0.021202241,0.036760153999999996,-0.057760233,-0.009775984,0.08701207300000001,-0.036179041,-0.019198231,-0.011123248999999998,0.0050283,-0.010883905,-0.019571764,-0.004889565,-0.053120198,0.0042853629999999995,0.009076387,-0.033929397,-0.044772027,-0.042377486,0.015682611000000003,-0.050897159000000004

1208,Examining Landscape Factors Influencing Relative Distribution of Mosquito Genera and Frequency of Virus Infection,"Mosquito-borne infections cause some of the most debilitating human diseases, including yellow fever and malaria, yet we lack an understanding of how disease risk scales with human-driven habitat changes. We present an approach to study variation in mosquito distribution and concomitant viral infections on the landscape level. In a pilot study we analyzed mosquito distribution along a 10-km transect of a West African rainforest area, which included primary forest, secondary forest, plantations, and human settlements. Variation was observed in the abundance of Anopheles, Aedes,Culex, and Uranotaenia mosquitoes between the different habitat types. Screening of trapped mosquitoes from the different habitats led to the isolation of five uncharacterized viruses of the families Bunyaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Rhabdoviridae, as well as an unclassified virus. Polymerase chain reaction screening for these five viruses in individual mosquitoes indicated a trend toward infection with specific viruses in specific mosquito genera that differed by habitat. Based on these initial analyses, we believe that further work is indicated to investigate the impact of anthropogenic landscape changes on mosquito distribution and accompanying arbovirus infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.000994025,-0.040630501,0.0007124360000000001,-0.021971525,0.006812994,0.036063273,0.084270711,-0.002416075,0.010675457,0.038934865,-0.012554711000000001,0.001433715,0.02673537,-0.010953143,0.030868806000000002,-0.005769299,-0.025893987,-0.010982738,-0.038132569,0.006908437,0.01955695,-0.004843258,-0.041589153999999996,0.034809279,-0.02715755,0.0049342909999999995,0.004247927,-0.005163203,-0.0096749,-0.036381107999999995
1210,Sequence analysis of the S1 glycoprotein gene of infectious bronchitis viruses: identification of a novel phylogenetic group in Korea,"Twelve Korean infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs) were isolated in the field from chickens suspected of being carriers of infectious bronchitis between 2001 and 2003. The S1 glycoprotein genes of these IBV isolates were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. These Korean IBV isolates were classified into three groups according to their RFLP patterns obtained using the restriction enzyme HaeIII. Half of the twelve isolates were similar to the KM91 RFLP pattern, which is a common pattern in Korea. Three more isolates were related to the Arkansas strain pattern, but with some unique variations. The other three viruses showed variant RFLP patterns. For a comparison with the published sequences for non-Korean IBV strains, amplified PCR products from the twelve isolates were cloned and sequenced. The Korean IBV field isolates had 71.2-99.7% nucleotide sequence homology with each other and 45.9-80.7% nucleotide sequence homology with non-Korean IBV strains. With respect to the deduced amino acid sequence, the Korean IBV isolates had 71.5-99.3% similarity with each other and 44.9-80.3% similarity with non-Korean IBV strains.

1218,"Molecular Epidemiology of SARS-associated Coronavirus, Beijing","Single nucleotide variations (SNVs) at 5 loci (17564, 21721, 22222, 23823, and 27827) were used to define the molecular epidemiologic characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from Beijing patients. Five fragments targeted at the SNV loci were amplified directly from clinical samples by using reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), before sequencing the amplified products. Analyses of 45 sequences obtained from 29 patients showed that the GGCTC motif dominated among samples collected from March to early April 2003; the TGTTT motif predominanted afterwards. The switch from GGCTC to TGTTT was observed among patients belonging to the same cluster, which ruled out the possibility of the coincidental superposition of 2 epidemics running in parallel in Beijing. The Beijing isolates underwent the same change pattern reported from Guangdong Province.

1239,Genetic variation analysis of reemerging porcine epidemic diarrhea virus prevailing in central China from 2010 to 2011,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea has re-emerged with devastating impact in central China since October 2010. To investigate and analyze the reason of this outbreak, the M and ORF3 genes of 15 porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDV), which were collected from different areas of central China during October 2010 and December 2011, were amplified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, cloned, sequenced, and analyzed. Sequence analyses showed that the nucleotides and amino acids were changed at some sites in the M and ORF3 genes of the 15 PEDV strains compared with those genes of CV777 reference strain. Based on the phylogenetic analyses, PEDVs in central China and reference strains could be separated into three groups: G1, G2, and G3. The 15 PEDV strains belonged to G3 group and showed a close relationship with Korean strains (2007), Thai strains (2007–2008), and partial other Chinese strains (2010–2011), but differed genetically from European strains (Br1/87) and the vaccine strain (CV777 vs) being used in China. Furthermore, all 15 PEDV strains from central China and some other isolates in China from 2003 to 2007 (LJB-03, QH, and LZC) belonged to different group.

1251,Influenza virus assays based on virus‐inducible reporter cell lines,"Background Virus‐inducible reporter genes have been used as the basis of virus detection and quantitation assays for a number of viruses. A strategy for influenza A virus‐induction of a reporter gene was recently described. In this report, we describe the extension of this strategy to influenza B virus, the generation of stable cell lines with influenza A and B virus‐inducible reporter genes, and the use of these cells in various clinically relevant viral assays. Each of the cell lines described herein constitutively express an RNA transcript that contains a reporter gene coding region flanked by viral 5′‐ and 3′‐untranslated regions (UTR) and therefore mimics an influenza virus genomic segment. Upon infection of the cells with influenza virus the virus‐inducible reporter gene segment (VIRGS) is replicated and transcribed by the viral polymerase complex resulting in reporter gene expression. Findings Reporter gene induction occurs after infection with a number of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of influenza virus including several H5N1 strains. The induction is dose‐dependent and highly specific for influenza A or influenza B viruses. Conclusions These cell lines provide the basis of simple, rapid, and objective assays that involve virus quantitation such as determination of viral titer, assessment of antiviral susceptibility, and determination of antibody neutralization titer.

1252,Genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses isolated from pigs during 2000 to 2005 in Thailand,"Background Recent studies have revealed the existence of genetic diversity in swine influenza viruses (SIVs) in the world. In Thailand, there has been a little information on the molecular characteristics of the SIVs since the first isolation of viruses of H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes in the late 1970s. Our previous study demonstrated that Thai H1N1 SIVs possessed the classical swine H1 and avian‐like swine N1 genes (Takemae et al., Proceedings of the Options for the Control of Influenza VI.2007;350–353). Objectives In the present study, we genetically characterized 12 SIVs including those of H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 subtypes isolated between 2000 and 2005. Methods We determined the entire nucleotide sequences of the eight gene segments of those isolates. Results Phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of nine distinct genotypes amongst the Thai SIVs. These genotypes arose from multiple introductions of classical swine, avian‐like swine and human viruses. The existence of two distinct sublineages within classical swine H1 and NS, avian‐like swine PA and M and human H3 and N2 genes of the Thai SIVs suggested that introduction of viruses of classical swine, avian‐like swine and human origins occurred twice respectively into the Thai pig population. The predominance of avian‐like swine genes amongst the Thai SIVs was evident. In particular, three polymerase (PB1, PB2 and PA) and matrix genes of avian‐like swine origin were retained in all the Thai SIVs examined. Conclusions These observations may suggest that genes of avian‐like swine lineages have some advantages to be maintained in pigs as seen in the SIVs established through multiple introductions in other regions.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.025284756000000002,-0.042896685,0.023768919,-0.009476815,0.051474045,0.15524600800000002,-0.026748629,-0.007901855,-0.002733498,-0.022827925,-0.018916864,0.03760701,-0.024898431000000002,-0.008274149,0.052244062,-0.030058141,-0.007843634,-0.007923241,-0.044931325,-0.000439761,0.009060644,-0.013134971,-0.001464531,0.006050473000000001,-0.08638233,-0.000676488,-0.031997093,0.023935893,0.026987752,-0.02720474
1264,Association between IFN-γ +874 T/A (Rs2430561) Polymorphisms and Bipolar 1 Disorder: A Study in an Ethnic Iranian Population,"BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of bipolar 1 disorder (B1D), a major psychiatric disorder with inflammatory origins and structural changes in the brain, is of great interest to researchers. Pro-inflammatory biomarkers and specific gene expression play pivotal roles in B1D development, and IFN-γ has emerged as an important inflammatory marker. The aim of this research was to determine whether the INF-γ +874 T/A polymorphism is associated with B1D susceptibility in an ethnic Iranian population. METHODS: The IFN-γ +874 T/A (rs2430561) gene polymorphism was studied in 106 B1D patients and 109 control subjects using sequence specific primers (SSPs) and amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR). RESULTS: Significant statistical differences in IFN-γ +874 T/A polymorphism genotype distribution were found between the patients and control subjects (P = 0.0006). Decreased risk of B1D was detected in the codominant model (T/T vs T/A and A/A, OR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.07-0.49 for T/A, OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.12-1.24 for A/A, P value=0.0006), and in the dominant model (T/T vs T/A-A/A, OR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.08-0.54, P = 0.0005). However, no significant difference in the IFN-γ polymorphism allele distribution was found between the two groups (P = 0.25).

1266,Development and biochemical and immunological characterization of early passage and immortalized bovine intestinal epithelial cell lines from the ileum of a young calf,"The intestinal epithelium is a major site of interaction with pathogens. In bovine intestinal epithelial cells (BIECs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in innate immune responses against enteric pathogens. This study is aimed at establishing a stable bovine intestinal epithelial cell line that can be maintained by a continuous passage so that studies on innate immune responses against various enteric pathogens can be performed. The main goal was to establish pure cultures of primary and immortalized bovine intestinal epithelial cells from the ileum and then characterize them biochemically and immunologically. Mixed epithelial and fibroblast bovine ileal intestinal cultures were first established from a 2-day old calf. Limiting dilution method was used to obtain a clone of epithelial cells which was characterized using immunocytochemistry (ICC). The selected clone BIEC-c4 was cytokeratin positive and expressed low levels of vimentin, confirming the epithelial cell phenotype. Early passage BIEC-c4 cells were transfected with either simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen or human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), or human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16E6/E7 genes to establish three immortalized BIEC cell lines. The expression of SV40, hTERT and HPV E6/E7 genes in immortalized BIECs was confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence assays also confirmed the expression of SV40, hTERT and HPV E6 proteins. The immortalized BIECs were cytokeratin positive and all except HPV-BIECs expressed low levels of vimentin. A growth kinetics study indicated that there were no significant differences in the doubling time of immortalized BIECs as compared to early passage BIEC-c4 cells. All four BIEC types expressed TLR 1-10 genes, with TLR 3 and 4 showing higher expression across all cell types. These newly established early passage and immortalized BIEC cell lines should serve as a good model for studying infectivity, pathogenesis and innate immune responses against enteric pathogens.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.058442245,-0.028235082999999998,0.036465263,-0.112373405,-0.062421285,0.047447277,0.017984454,-0.059434162,0.057285204000000006,-0.026631644,-0.066982607,-0.067266132,0.0066591309999999996,0.114200673,0.052840730999999995,-0.025218979,-0.020649001,-0.06818093,-0.005544352,-0.047964242000000004,0.065282016,0.007023199,0.055627314000000004,0.006887366,-0.021444817999999997,0.004518908,0.017426673,0.013046518,-0.004810229,-0.093108045
1267,Genotyping of avian infectious bronchitis virus in Afghanistan (2016-2017): the first report,"BACKGROUND: Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious viral disease which affects the poultry industry. The virus exists in a wide variety of genotypes, and phylogenetic analysis has been used to classify infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains. AIMS: The object of the study is a molecular characterization of circulating IBV in Afghanistan as a first study. METHODS: The tracheal tissue specimens from 100 different commercial broiler flocks with respiratory distress in Afghanistan were collected during 2016-2017. After real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR), IBV-positive samples were further characterized. A 390 bp hypervariable spike glycoprotein gene segment was amplified using Nested PCR, sequenced, and analyzed. RESULTS: The results of real-time RT-PCR showed that 45/100 of the mentioned flocks were IBV positive. Phylogenetic analysis of all positive samples revealed that IBV strains were clustered into two distinct genotypes: LX4 (GI-19) (9/45) and IS-1494 like (GI-23) (34/45). Also, 2 of the 45 samples remained uncharacterized. CONCLUSION: It is the first study focusing on the molecular epidemiology of IBV in Afghanistan, extending our understanding of IB in the region. These results showed the high rate of IB infection in Afghanistan broiler farms and confirm the continuing monitoring of IBVs to modify the vaccination program.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.022767142999999997,0.023998277000000002,0.16524455400000002,-0.096756291,0.23941927300000002,0.075842462,-0.18118683800000002,-0.093844914,0.11246224699999999,0.37114412799999996,0.113508075,0.034769872,-0.095845186,0.093833924,-0.13985039,0.124907608,0.031475212999999995,0.003436276,0.051863134000000005,-0.011382856,-0.04604081,0.02941666,-0.018672172,-0.081385122,0.009327506,0.012466208999999999,-0.001253825,0.017787402,0.059773294000000005,-0.007155702
1269,"Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerases in Host-Pathogen Interactions, Inflammation, and Immunity","The literature review presented here details recent research involving members of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of proteins. Among the 17 recognized members of the family, the human enzyme PARP1 is the most extensively studied, resulting in a number of known biological and metabolic roles. This review is focused on the roles played by PARP enzymes in host-pathogen interactions and in diseases with an associated inflammatory response. In mammalian cells, several PARPs have specific roles in the antiviral response; this is perhaps best illustrated by PARP13, also termed the zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP). Plant stress responses and immunity are also regulated by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. PARPs promote inflammatory responses by stimulating proinflammatory signal transduction pathways that lead to the expression of cytokines and cell adhesion molecules. Hence, PARP inhibitors show promise in the treatment of inflammatory disorders and conditions with an inflammatory component, such as diabetes, arthritis, and stroke. These functions are correlated with the biophysical characteristics of PARP family enzymes. This work is important in providing a comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis of pathogenesis and host responses, as well as in the identification of inhibitors. This is important because the identification of inhibitors has been shown to be effective in arresting the progression of disease.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.091992613,-0.033692374,-0.021634119,-0.068925158,-0.119373626,0.094603165,0.104670901,-0.020338577,0.059425277,0.017859437,-0.060026129000000004,-0.002361315,0.031873885,0.006971494,-0.029653677000000003,-0.015271953000000001,0.005832115,0.019216054,-0.031950807000000005,0.009520656,0.002013983,0.017220668,-0.046954662,-0.017071568,0.032530328,-0.007929255,0.006484724,-0.002330093,0.083641758,-0.048011622000000004
1275,Recurring and Emerging Questions Related to Management of HIV-Related Opportunistic Infections,"The incidence of HIV-related opportunistic infections (OIs) has dramatically declined with the ability to achieve viral suppression and immune reconstitution with potent antiretroviral therapy. However, a large number of patients remain at risk for OIs because they are diagnosed at late stages of HIV disease, fail to stay in treatment, or fail to maintain viral suppression. Clinicians should remain vigilant for OIs and for changes in recommended management strategies. Issues that often arise in this regard include how to interpret polymerase chain reaction diagnostic results in individuals with HIV infection; whether primary prophylaxis for Mycobacterium avium complex is still needed; whether clinicians should screen asymptomatic patients for cryptococcal antigen; and need for amphotericin B in treatment regimens for cryptococcal meningitis.

1276,The HIV Integrase Inhibitor Raltegravir Inhibits Felid Alphaherpesvirus 1 Replication by Targeting both DNA Replication and Late Gene Expression,"Alphaherpesvirus-associated ocular infections in humans caused by human alphaherpesvirus 1 (HHV-1) remain challenging to treat due to the frequency of drug application required and the potential for the selection of drug-resistant viruses. Repurposing on-the-market drugs is a viable strategy to accelerate the pace of drug development. It has been reported that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) integrase inhibitor raltegravir inhibits HHV-1 replication by targeting the DNA polymerase accessory factor and limits terminase-mediated genome cleavage of human betaherpesvirus 5 (HHV-5). We have previously shown, both in vitro and in vivo, that raltegravir can also inhibit the replication of felid alphaherpesvirus 1 (FeHV-1), a common ocular pathogen of cats with a pathogenesis similar to that of HHV-1 ocular disease. In contrast to what was reported for HHV-1, we were unable to select for a raltegravir-resistant FeHV-1 strain in order to define any basis for drug action. A candidate-based approach to explore the mode of action of raltegravir against FeHV-1 showed that raltegravir did not impact FeHV-1 terminase function, as described for HHV-5. Instead, raltegravir inhibited DNA replication, similarly to HHV-1, but by targeting the initiation of viral DNA replication rather than elongation. In addition, we found that raltegravir specifically repressed late gene expression independently of DNA replication, and both activities are consistent with inhibition of ICP8. Taken together, these results suggest that raltegravir could be a valuable therapeutic agent against herpesviruses. IMPORTANCE The rise of drug-resistant herpesviruses is a longstanding concern, particularly among immunocompromised patients. Therefore, therapies targeting viral proteins other than the DNA polymerase that may be less likely to lead to drug-resistant viruses are urgently needed. Using FeHV-1, an alphaherpesvirus closely related to HHV-1 that similarly causes ocular herpes in its natural host, we found that the HIV integrase inhibitor raltegravir targets different stages of the virus life cycle beyond DNA replication and that it does so without developing drug resistance under the conditions tested. This shows that the drug could provide a viable strategy for the treatment of herpesvirus infections.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.073404281,-0.036317463,-0.01233354,-0.029501749,-0.09366024,0.061654247,0.085407237,-0.011974948999999999,0.028706831000000002,0.024705843999999998,0.004604409,0.0026871990000000004,0.037957763,0.002609961,-0.011838603,0.009297255,-0.031690123,0.052379589000000004,0.015968483999999998,0.035925685,0.003882661,0.025300053,-0.038852221,0.048807838,0.008706343,-0.00010693200000000001,-0.019590642,-0.011379675,0.032934701000000004,-0.0043939470000000005
1280,Feed batch sequencing to decrease the risk of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) cross-contamination during feed manufacturing,"Feed has been identified as a vector of transmission for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The objective of this study was to determine if feed batch sequencing methods could minimize PEDV cross-contamination. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus-free swine feed was manufactured to represent the negative control. A 50 kg feed batch was mixed in a pilot scale feed mill for 5 min, sampled, then discharged for 10 min into a bucket elevator and sampled again upon exit. Next, a pathogenic PEDV isolate was used to inoculate 49.5 kg of PEDV-free feed to form the positive control. The positive control was mixed, conveyed and sampled similar to the negative control. Subsequently, 4 sequence batches (sequence 1 to 4) were formed by adding a 50 kg batch of PEDV-negative feed to the mixer after the prior batch was mixed and conveyed; all sequences were mixed, conveyed, and sampled similar to the negative and positive control batches. None of the equipment was cleaned between batches within a replicate. This entire process was replicated 3 times with cleaning the feed mill between replicates. Feed was then analyzed for PEDV RNA by real-time reverse transcriptase semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) as measured by cycle threshold (Ct) and for infectivity by bioassay. Sequence 1 feed had higher (P ˂ 0.05) rRT-PCR Ct values than the positive batch and sequence 2 feed had higher (P ˂ 0.05) Ct values than sequence 1, regardless of sampled location. Feed sampled from the mixer from sequence 2, 3, and 4 was rRT-PCR negative whereas feed sampled from the bucket elevator was rRT-PCR negative from sequence 3 and 4. Bioassay was conducted using 66 mixed sex 10-d-old pigs confirmed negative for PEDV allocated to 22 different rooms. Pigs were initially 10-d old. Control pigs remained PEDV negative for the study. All pigs from the mixer positive batch (9/9) and bucket elevator positive batch (3/3) were rRT-PCR positive on fecal swabs by the end of the study. One replicate of pigs from mixer sequence 1 was rRT-PCR positive (3/3) by 7 dpi. One replicate of mixer pigs from sequence 2 was rRT-PCR positive (3/3) by 7 dpi although no detectable PEDV RNA was found in the feed. The results demonstrate sequenced batches had reduced quantities of PEDV RNA although sequenced feed without detectible PEDV RNA by rRT-PCR can be infectious. Therefore, a sequencing protocol can reduce but not eliminate the risk of producing infectious PEDV carryover from the first sequenced batch of feed.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.02816174,0.013559783999999998,0.07849782,-0.08943713199999999,0.061126209,0.014297583,-0.051316082,0.033642795,-0.022241498,-0.037009278,0.058816602999999995,0.065081472,-0.146033002,0.034287582000000004,0.240508809,-0.149880974,-0.035224592,0.03787804,-0.040891074,0.082139983,-0.18156647199999998,-0.051283265,0.075975276,-0.09267004400000001,-0.08704040199999999,-0.027888307999999997,-0.010868987,0.006092225,0.06853464599999999,-0.010756726000000001
1281,Orally Efficacious Broad-Spectrum Ribonucleoside Analog Inhibitor of Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Viruses,"Morbidity and mortality resulting from influenza-like disease are a threat, especially for older adults. To improve case management, next-generation broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics that are efficacious against major drivers of influenza-like disease, including influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), are urgently needed. Using a dual-pathogen high-throughput screening protocol for influenza A virus (IAV) and RSV inhibitors, we have identified N(4)-hydroxycytidine (NHC) as a potent inhibitor of RSV, influenza B viruses, and IAVs of human, avian, and swine origins. Biochemical in vitro polymerase assays and viral RNA sequencing revealed that the ribonucleotide analog is incorporated into nascent viral RNAs in place of cytidine, increasing the frequency of viral mutagenesis. Viral passaging in cell culture in the presence of an inhibitor did not induce robust resistance. Pharmacokinetic profiling demonstrated dose-dependent oral bioavailability of 36 to 56%, sustained levels of the active 5′-triphosphate anabolite in primary human airway cells and mouse lung tissue, and good tolerability after extended dosing at 800 mg/kg of body weight/day. The compound was orally efficacious against RSV and both seasonal and highly pathogenic avian IAVs in mouse models, reducing lung virus loads and alleviating disease biomarkers. Oral dosing reduced IAV burdens in a guinea pig transmission model and suppressed virus spread to uninfected contact animals through direct transmission. Based on its broad-spectrum efficacy and pharmacokinetic properties, NHC is a promising candidate for future clinical development as a treatment option for influenza-like diseases.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.047877335,-0.10902120800000001,-0.058250653,0.167028824,-0.065267488,0.22370931600000002,-0.007595378000000001,-0.046102383,0.0718169,-0.017499007,0.024065952999999998,-0.063882525,-0.018931428,0.000483525,-0.010055332,-0.017683475,-0.05822915,0.085726951,-0.002268505,0.016298244,0.019912728,-0.051582685999999996,0.008187321,0.005533924,0.029693185,-0.07503026900000001,0.121391554,0.031012152999999997,-0.004202803,0.035032363999999996
1283,Evaluation of the effects of flushing feed manufacturing equipment with chemically treated rice hulls on porcine epidemic diarrhea virus cross-contamination during feed manufacturing,"Various strategies have been proposed to mitigate potential risk of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) transmission via feed and feed ingredients. Wet disinfection has been found to be the most effective decontamination of feed mill surfaces; however, this is not practical on a commercial feed production scale. Another potential mitigation strategy would be using chemically treated rice hulls flushed through the feed manufacturing equipment. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) or formaldehyde-treated rice hull flush batches as potential chemical mitigation strategies for PEDV during feed manufacturing. Feed without evidence of PEDV RNA contamination was inoculated with PEDV. Based on polymerase chain reaction analysis, this feed had a cycle threshold (Ct) = 30.2 and was confirmed infective in bioassay. After manufacturing the PEDV-positive feed, untreated rice hulls, formaldehyde-treated rice hulls, 2% MCFA- (a 1:1:1 blend of hexanoic, octanoic, and decanoic acid) treated rice hulls, or 10% MCFA-treated rice hulls were flushed through laboratory scale mixers. For the untreated rice hulls, 3 of 6 samples had detectable PEDV RNA, whereas 1 of 6 formaldehyde-treated rice hull flush samples and 2 of 6 of the 2% MCFA rice hull flush samples had detectable PEDV RNA. However, PEDV RNA was not detected in any of the 10% MCFA rice hull flush samples. Then, rice hulls treated with 10% MCFA were mixed and discharged through a production scale mixer and bucket elevator following PEDV-positive feed. No rice hull flush or feed samples from the mixer following chemically treated rice hull flush had detectible PEDV RNA. However, one 10% MCFA rice hull sample collected from the bucket elevator discharge spout had detectible PEDV RNA. Dust collected following mixing of PEDV contaminated feed had detectable PEDV RNA (Ct = 29.4) and was infectious. However, dust collected immediately after the 10% MCFA rice hull flush batch had a reduced quantity of PEDV RNA (Ct = 33.7) and did not cause infection. Overall, the use of rice hull flushes effectively reduced the quantity of detectible RNA present after mixing a batch of PEDV-positive feed. Chemical treatment of rice hulls with formaldehyde or 10% MCFA provided additional reduction in detectible RNA. Finally, dust collected after manufacturing PEDV-inoculated feed has the potential to serve as a vector for PEDV transmission.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.050684695999999994,-0.009484626999999999,0.043250319,-0.08160268400000001,0.017121714,0.02041187,-0.0023898820000000003,0.008432551,-0.0130554,-0.029397753999999998,0.060342032000000004,0.080219794,-0.15076127,0.02896525,0.229579247,-0.129663947,-0.052145286,0.044506042,-0.033946517,0.124707988,-0.178883848,-0.072640373,0.07087946099999999,-0.074680071,-0.067015748,-0.039805147,-0.029783713,0.03064576,0.058636238,-0.015926146999999998
1284,A Processive Protein Chimera Introduces Mutations Across Defined DNA Regions In Vivo,"Laboratory time scale evolution in vivo relies on the generation of large, mutationally diverse gene libraries to rapidly explore biomolecule sequence landscapes. Traditional global mutagenesis methods are problematic because they introduce many off-target mutations that are often lethal and can engender false positives. We report the development and application of the MutaT7 chimera, a potent and highly targeted in vivo mutagenesis agent. MutaT7 utilizes a DNA-damaging cytidine deaminase fused to a processive RNA polymerase to continuously direct mutations to specific, well-defined DNA regions of any relevant length.

1286,Xenotransplantation panel for the detection of infectious agents in pigs,"Recent advances in xenotransplantation have produced organs from pigs that are well tolerated in primate models because of genetic changes engineered to delete major antigens from donor animals. To ensure the safety of human transplant recipients, it will be essential to understand both the spectrum of infectious agents in donor pigs and their potential to be transmitted to immunocompromised transplant recipients. Equally important will be the development of new highly sensitive diagnostic methods for use in the detection of these agents in donor animals and for the monitoring of transplant recipients. Herein, we report results from a panel of 30 quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays for infectious agents with the potential to be transmitted to the human host. The reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity of each assay were evaluated and were found to exhibit analytic sensitivity that was similar to that of quantitative assays used to perform viral load testing of human viruses in clinical laboratories. This analytical approach was used to detect nucleic acids of infectious agents present in specimens from 9 sows and 22 piglets derived by caesarean section. The most commonly detected targets in adult animals were Mycoplasma species and two distinct herpesviruses, porcine lymphotrophic herpesvirus 2 and 3. A total of 14 piglets were derived from three sows infected with either or both herpesviruses, yet none tested positive for the viruses indicating that vertical transmission of these viruses is inefficient.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.009958003,0.007796934,0.09559017199999999,0.00031205,-0.007838715,0.036243049,0.095591476,0.002126724,-0.013306267,0.054540325,-0.018632289,-0.012931322,0.038527029,-0.02312657,0.069138675,-0.062766522,-0.052008784,0.019792721,-0.016123852,0.010834913,0.00108685,-0.005181206,0.000463506,-0.006427655,-0.016232506,-0.032930429,-0.011172142,-0.03829544,-0.017294225,-0.016584275

However, the standards widely used in laboratories are mainly based on plasmids or cDNA, which cannot accurately reflect the process of RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. Therefore, we aimed to develop armored RNA‐based standards for p210 and p190 BCR‐ABL1 FG transcripts’ quantification. METHODS: Using overlapping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, we first linked a segment of the p210 or p190 BCR‐ABL1 FG transcript with four control genes (CGs; ABL1,BCR,GUSB, and B2M) to form p210FG‐CG and p190FG‐CG. Subsequently, using armored RNA technology, we prepared p210FG‐CG‐ and p190FG‐CG‐armored RNAs and the p210FG‐CG and p190FG‐CG standards, the values of which were assigned by digital PCR (dPCR). RESULTS: The p210FG‐CG and p190FG‐CG standards were stable and homogeneous, and were significantly linear with r (2) > 0.98. A field trial including 52 laboratories across China showed that the coefficient of variation (CV%) of BCR‐ABL1 values among samples was in the range of 58.6%‐129.6% for p210 samples and 73.2%‐194.0% for p190 samples when using local standards. By contrast, when using the p210FG‐CG and p190FG‐CG standards, the CV% of BCR‐ABL1 values was decreased to 35.6%‐124.9% and 36.6%‐170.6% for p210 and p190 samples, respectively. In addition, 33.3% (3/9) of the p210 and p190 samples had CV% values <50.0%, whereas 44.4% (4/9) and 77.8% (7/9) of the samples had lower CV% values when using the p210FG‐CG and p190FG‐CG standards. CONCLUSION: The overall variability of detection of BCR‐ABL1 transcripts decreased significantly when using the p210FG‐CG or p190FG‐CG standards, especially the p190FG‐CG standard.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.034873146,-0.004955099,0.049846735,-0.046976959000000006,-0.004695084,-0.005252822,0.0016466229999999998,0.0025826720000000003,-0.009273102,-0.020927953,0.003046923,0.01155886,-0.020487617,-0.008905616,0.02122678,0.019351876,-0.014279776000000001,-0.013817886000000001,0.00025983,-0.060491852,-0.00689741,-5.89e-06,0.007878289,-0.021482757999999998,-0.009577378000000001,-0.018190388999999998,-0.00893155,-0.012406543999999999,0.016054908,0.004761617
1288,"Urban Rodent Surveillance, Climatic Association, and Genomic Characterization of Seoul Virus Collected at U.S. Army Garrison, Seoul, Republic of Korea, 2006–2010","Rodent-borne pathogens pose a critical public health threat in urban areas. An epidemiological survey of urban rodents was conducted from 2006 to 2010 at the U.S. Army Garrison (USAG), Seoul, Republic of Korea (ROK), to determine the prevalence of Seoul virus (SEOV), a rodent-borne hantavirus. A total of 1,950 rodents were captured at USAG, Yongsan, near/in 19.4% (234/1,206) of the numbered buildings. Annual mean rodent infestation rates were the highest for food service facilities, e.g., the Dragon Hill Lodge complex (38.0 rodents) and the Hartell House (18.8 rodents). The brown rat, Rattus norvegicus, accounted for 99.4% (1,939/1,950) of all the rodents captured in the urban area, whereas only 0.6% (11/1,950) of the rodents was house mice (Mus musculus). In November 2006, higher numbers of rats captured were likely associated with climatic factors, e.g., rainfall and temperatures as rats sought harborage in and around buildings. Only 4.7% (34/718) of the rodents assayed for hantaviruses was serologically positive for SEOV. A total of 8.8% (3/34) R. norvegicus were positive for SEOV RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, of which two SEOV strains were completely sequenced and characterized. The 3′ and 5′ terminal sequences revealed incomplete complementary genomic configuration. Seoul virus strains Rn10-134 and Rn10-145 formed a monophyletic lineage with the prototype SEOV strain 80-39. Seoul virus Medium segment showed the highest evolutionary rates compared with the Large and Small segments. In conclusion, this report provides significant insights into continued rodent-borne disease surveillance programs that identify hantaviruses for analysis of disease risk assessments and development of mitigation strategies.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.019682974,-0.02817378,0.009547501,-0.053991168,0.038403234,0.035338472,0.010389504,0.007548409,-0.00260636,-0.010796567,0.011720681,0.028026115,-0.020654182,-0.029266392999999998,0.022398536,0.012998006999999999,-0.023952787000000003,0.0020356379999999998,-0.014729651000000002,-0.003917968,0.0074120340000000005,-0.002594772,-0.029399165,-9.49e-05,0.020158618,0.0019192179999999999,0.00463319,0.012119398,-0.007223238000000001,0.007130951999999999
1289,Wheat streak mosaic virus: a century old virus with rising importance worldwide,"Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) causes wheat streak mosaic, a disease of cereals and grasses that threatens wheat production worldwide. It is a monopartite, positive‐sense, single‐stranded RNA virus and the type member of the genus Tritimovirus in the family Potyviridae. The only known vector is the wheat curl mite (WCM, Aceria tosichella), recently identified as a species complex of biotypes differing in virus transmission. Low rates of seed transmission have been reported. Infected plants are stunted and have a yellow mosaic of parallel discontinuous streaks on the leaves. In the autumn, WCMs move from WSMV‐infected volunteer wheat and other grass hosts to newly emerged wheat and transmit the virus which survives the winter within the plant, and the mites survive as eggs, larvae, nymphs or adults in the crown and leaf sheaths. In the spring/summer, the mites move from the maturing wheat crop to volunteer wheat and other grass hosts and transmit WSMV, and onto newly emerged wheat in the fall to which they transmit the virus, completing the disease cycle. WSMV detection is by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) or quantitative RT‐PCR (RT‐qPCR). Three types of WSMV are recognized: A (Mexico), B (Europe, Russia, Asia) and D (USA, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, Turkey, Canada). Resistance genes Wsm1, Wsm2 and Wsm3 have been identified. The most effective, Wsm2, has been introduced into several wheat cultivars. Mitigation of losses caused by WSMV will require enhanced knowledge of the biology of WCM biotypes and WSMV, new or improved virus detection techniques, the development of resistance through traditional and molecular breeding, and the adaptation of cultural management tactics to account for climate change.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.028806332,0.004926407,0.072014643,-0.004530811,-0.006655365999999999,0.025533485,0.032759448999999996,0.000744144,0.0036070509999999996,-0.000621054,0.0035962309999999996,-0.001545095,-0.01565366,0.012594481000000001,0.021310227999999997,0.010086563,0.005921831,0.013219756000000001,-0.039403666000000004,-0.006988937,0.005462548,0.0036538240000000004,-0.027095161,0.02401431,-0.006725355,0.014693285,0.021880866000000002,-0.007697582,0.015169641999999999,-0.010781178999999998
1290,Anti–Ebola Virus Antibody Levels in Convalescent Plasma and Viral Load After Plasma Infusion in Patients With Ebola Virus Disease,"BACKGROUND: Ebola virus (EBOV) neutralizing antibody in plasma may reduce viral load following administration of plasma to patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD), but measurement of these antibodies is complex. METHODS: Anti-EBOV antibody was measured by 2 neutralization and 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) in convalescent plasma (ECP) from 100 EVD survivor donors in Liberia. Viral load was assessed repetitively in patients with EVD participating in a clinical trial of enhanced standard of care plus ECP. RESULTS: All 4 anti-EBOV assays were highly concordant for detection of EBOV antibody. Antibodies were not detected in plasma specimens obtained from 15 of 100 donors, including 7 with documented EBOV-positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction during EVD. Viral load was reduced following each dose in the 2 clinical trial participants who received ECP with higher antibody levels but not in the 2 who received ECP with lower antibody levels. CONCLUSIONS: Recovery from EVD can occur with absence of detectable anti-EBOV antibody several months after disease onset. ELISAs may be useful to select ECP donors or identify ECP units that contain neutralizing antibody. ECP with higher anti-EBOV antibody levels may have greater effect on EBOV load—an observation that requires further investigation.

1296,β-d-N(4)-Hydroxycytidine Is a Potent Anti-alphavirus Compound That Induces a High Level of Mutations in the Viral Genome,"Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a representative member of the New World alphaviruses. It is transmitted by mosquito vectors and causes highly debilitating disease in humans, equids, and other vertebrate hosts. Despite a continuous public health threat, very few compounds with anti-VEEV activity in cell culture and in mouse models have been identified to date, and rapid development of virus resistance to some of them has been recorded. In this study, we investigated the possibility of using a modified nucleoside analog, β-d-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (NHC), as an anti-VEEV agent and defined the mechanism of its anti-VEEV activity. The results demonstrate that NHC is a very potent antiviral agent. It affects both the release of genome RNA-containing VEE virions and their infectivity. Both of these antiviral activities are determined by the NHC-induced accumulation of mutations in virus-specific RNAs. The antiviral effect is most prominent when NHC is applied early in the infectious process, during the amplification of negative- and positive-strand RNAs in infected cells. Most importantly, only a low-level resistance of VEEV to NHC can be developed, and it requires acquisition and cooperative function of more than one mutation in nsP4. These adaptive mutations are closely located in the same segment of nsP4. Our data suggest that NHC is more potent than ribavirin as an anti-VEEV agent and likely can be used to treat other alphavirus infections. IMPORTANCE Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) can cause widespread epidemics among humans and domestic animals. VEEV infections result in severe meningoencephalitis and long-term sequelae. No approved therapeutics exist for treatment of VEEV infections. Our study demonstrates that β-d-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (NHC) is a very potent anti-VEEV compound, with the 50% effective concentration being below 1 μM. The mechanism of NHC antiviral activity is based on induction of high mutation rates in the viral genome. Accordingly, NHC treatment affects both the rates of particle release and the particle infectivity. Most importantly, in contrast to most of the anti-alphavirus drugs that are under development, resistance of VEEV to NHC develops very inefficiently. Even low levels of resistance require acquisition of multiple mutations in the gene of the VEEV-specific RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsP4.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.085027326,-0.02901707,-0.012623285,-0.007464172,-0.077431287,0.059947537,0.054557662,-0.003089615,0.02642692,0.020007379,0.017392693,0.013194156,-0.00026345299999999997,-0.002683985,0.032528012,0.017946438999999998,-0.0432025,0.065743997,0.026797457,-0.005295896,0.013880926000000002,-0.011060255,-0.004982539,0.029191468999999998,0.013080082,0.02058222,0.022452136,-0.018086451,0.025356242,-0.00040234

1303,Expression profile and promoter analysis of HEPIS,"Human embryo lung cellular protein interacting with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus nonstructural protein-10 (HEPIS) is a novel transcriptional repressor, the expression profile and promoter activity of which have not been well studied. In the present study, in situ hybridization of RNA was used to study differential HEPIS expression levels in different types of cancer and normal tissues. A total of six truncated lengths of the HEPIS promoter regulatory sequences were cloned into the pGL3-basic vector, and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and dual luciferase reporter assays were performed. The results of RT-qPCR demonstrated that HEPIS expression levels differed across four breast cancer cell lines. The results of the dual luciferase reporter assays revealed that the activities of the reporter gene fragments spanning −1334/+373, −1203/+373, −1060/+373 and −899/+373 bp were higher compared with the reporter gene fragments spanning −759/+373 and −279/+373 bp. A search of the transcription factor database TRANSFAC identified numerous octamer transcription factor-1 (OCT-1), nuclear factor (NF)-κB and C-JUN transcription factor binding sites located on the HEPIS promoter (pHEPIS). Furthermore, the results revealed that mutations of the OCT-1 (−1236/−1223 bp), NF-κB (−1186/−1176 bp) and C-JUN (−856/−846 bp) sites on the human pHEPIS resulted in a decrease in luciferase activity. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that OCT-1, NF-κB and C-JUN bound to pHEPIS in a site-dependent manner at the basal state. The TRANSFAC database was used to analyze the pHEPIS of multiple species and several activator protein-1, NF-κB and OCT-1 transcription factor binding sites were predicted. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that HEPIS is expressed at different levels in multiple organs and breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, these findings indicate that OCT-1, NF-κB and C-JUN transcription factors are associated with transcriptional regulation of the HEPIS gene.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.088241944,-0.010858381,0.022446282999999997,-0.077182633,-0.029207646,0.012093767,-0.011478171,-0.049671567,0.052252564,-0.062026922000000005,-0.079242648,-0.028238343,-0.018057913000000002,0.096884015,-0.033471862000000005,-0.016313308000000002,0.030069024,-0.062616177,-0.03044434,-0.04602212,0.026458733999999998,-0.010178187,0.024749976,0.01322386,-0.00621618,-0.007688385,0.013127149,0.030839327000000003,0.054888211,-0.037240337000000005
1304,Zinc Salts Block Hepatitis E Virus Replication by Inhibiting the Activity of Viral RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes an acute, self-limiting hepatitis in healthy individuals and leads to chronic disease in immunocompromised individuals. HEV infection in pregnant women results in a more severe outcome, with the mortality rate going up to 30%. Though the virus usually causes sporadic infection, epidemics have been reported in developing and resource-starved countries. No specific antiviral exists against HEV. A combination of interferon and ribavirin therapy has been used to control the disease with some success. Zinc is an essential micronutrient that plays crucial roles in multiple cellular processes. Zinc salts are known to be effective in reducing infections caused by few viruses. Here, we investigated the effect of zinc salts on HEV replication. In a human hepatoma cell (Huh7) culture model, zinc salts inhibited the replication of genotype 1 (g-1) and g-3 HEV replicons and g-1 HEV infectious genomic RNA in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis of a replication-defective mutant of g-1 HEV genomic RNA under similar conditions ruled out the possibility of zinc salts acting on replication-independent processes. An ORF4-Huh7 cell line-based infection model of g-1 HEV further confirmed the above observations. Zinc salts did not show any effect on the entry of g-1 HEV into the host cell. Furthermore, our data reveal that zinc salts directly inhibit the activity of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), leading to inhibition of viral replication. Taken together, these studies unravel the ability of zinc salts in inhibiting HEV replication, suggesting their possible therapeutic value in controlling HEV infection. IMPORTANCE Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a public health concern in resource-starved countries due to frequent outbreaks. It is also emerging as a health concern in developed countries owing to its ability to cause acute and chronic infection in organ transplant and immunocompromised individuals. Although antivirals such as ribavirin have been used to treat HEV cases, there are known side effects and limitations of such therapy. Our discovery of the ability of zinc salts to block HEV replication by virtue of their ability to inhibit the activity of viral RdRp is important because these findings pave the way to test the efficacy of zinc supplementation therapy in HEV-infected patients. Since zinc supplementation therapy is known to be safe in healthy individuals and since high-dose zinc is used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, it may be possible to control HEV-associated health problems following a similar treatment regimen.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.071948703,-0.037925605,-0.04648415,-0.01127471,-0.0836012,0.026624974,0.052797925999999995,0.009991996999999999,0.021821972999999998,0.028067582999999997,0.024396915,0.015216479,-0.009210425,0.00573888,0.007948545999999999,-0.00291443,-0.018955918999999998,0.048760658,0.030631854,0.013576735,0.014864435,0.006684746,-0.02917597,-0.024698832,0.007748199,0.027605023,0.00080396,-0.018914215,0.019096566000000002,-0.013585419
1306,IL-35 may maintain homeostasis of the immune microenvironment in periodontitis,"T lymphocyte cells, including regulatory T (Treg) and T helper 17 cells, have important roles in the human periodontium. However, the basis for Treg cytokine expression in various compartments of the periodontium remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of interleukin (IL)-35 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and periodontal tissues of patients with chronic periodontitis (CP), with a view to understanding its role in this disease, and ultimately providing improved treatments. Peripheral blood, periodontal tissues and gingival crevicular fluids (GCFs) were collected from patients with CP or impacted teeth, the latter serving as healthy controls. The expression levels of IL-35 subunit mRNAs in PBMCs and periodontal tissues were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while the IL-35 protein expression in GCFs and sera was quantified by ELISA. The relative expression of IL-35 subunit mRNAs in the affected tissues of patients with CP was significantly higher compared with that in samples from healthy controls (P<0.05). The mean concentration of IL-35 protein in the GCFs and sera of patients with periodontitis was also significantly higher compared with that in samples from healthy controls (P<0.001). IL-35 protein and periodontal clinical indicators were negatively correlated. It was hypothesized that the increased level of IL-35 plays a protective role in periodontal disease by maintaining immune system homeostasis and dampening the inflammatory response, and highlights IL-35 as a potential new therapy for the treatment of periodontitis.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.005619928000000001,-0.033346381,-0.019458871000000003,-0.19102213399999998,-0.10333675199999999,0.006667016,-0.0026339,-0.029108726,-0.0035170640000000003,-0.063891997,-0.0463755,-0.05714749400000001,-0.013738155,0.13676366,-0.07250528,-0.0019492270000000002,0.010503835,-0.069632877,-0.020676897,-0.065649127,0.026054632999999997,-0.076563536,0.049130223,0.006917675,-0.056610807,-0.035925995,0.064941263,0.024058429,0.042413945,-0.00109991

Median age was 9.4 years. Clinical signs included ataxia, proprioceptive deficits, seizures, and spinal hyperesthesia. The CSF nucleated cell count was increased (median 70.7 cells/μL), with predominantly mixed pleocytosis and CSF protein concentration was increased in 15/16 cats. Magnetic resonance imaging showed intraparenchymal infiltrative ill-defined lesions in 13 cases. All cats received a corticosteroid-based treatment protocol; additional therapies included lomustine, cytarabine, and anticonvulsant medications. Mild neurological signs were recorded in 5/12 cats but 7/12 cats were neurologically normal at re-examination. This represents the first study of feline MUO, highlighting FMUO as an important differential diagnosis in cats with variable neurological presentation. Prognosis appears to be good with immunomodulatory therapy.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.01371392,-0.019404528,0.033468503999999996,-0.18520204199999998,-0.037665933,0.036707551,0.029904186,0.00849076,-0.031926609,-0.1009607,0.29702733600000003,-0.106785622,0.160548467,-0.042869049000000006,-0.083225994,-0.016879144,0.018888977,0.021935244,0.000591335,0.054560975,-0.010943005,-0.008521917,0.025491469,-0.030738185,-0.0071641859999999995,0.035127908,0.0008186539999999999,0.03498972,0.008824076,-0.005552056
1311,Coexistence of multiple genotypes of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus with novel mutant S genes in the Hubei Province of China in 2016,"The emergence of highly virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) variants in China caused huge economic losses in 2010. Since then, large-scale sporadic outbreaks of PED caused by PEDV variants have occasionally occurred in China. However, the molecular diversity and epidemiology of PEDV in different provinces has not been completely understood. To determine the molecular diversity of PEDV in the Hubei Province of China, we collected 172 PED samples from 34 farms across the province in 2016 and performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) by targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene. Seventy-four samples were found to be PEDV-positive. We further characterized the complete spike (S) glycoprotein genes from the positive samples and found 21 different S genes with amino acid mutations. The PEDV isolates here presented most of the genotypes which were found previously in field isolates in East and South-East Asia, North America, and Europe. Besides the typical Genotypes I and II, the INDEX groups were also found. Importantly, 58 new amino acids mutant sites in the S genes, including 44 sites in S1 and 14 sites in S2, were first described. Our results revealed that the S genes of PEDV showed variation and that diverse genotypes of PEDV coexisted and were responsible for the PED outbreaks in Hubei in 2016. This work highlighted the complexity of the epidemiology of PEDV and emphasized the need for reassessing the efficacy of classic PEDV vaccines against emerging variant strains and developing new vaccines to facilitate the prevention and control of PEDV in fields.

1314,Overexpressed eNOS upregulates SIRT1 expression and protects mouse pancreatic β cells from apoptosis,"Loss of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) activity may be associated with metabolic diseases, including diabetes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential effects of overexpressed endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) on cell proliferation and apoptosis with SIRT1 activation in the Min6 mouse pancreatic β cell line. A pcDNA3.0-eNOS plasmid was constructed and transfected into Min6 cells for 24 h prior to harvesting. eNOS expression was validated and SIRT1 expression was detected following plasmid transfection using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, which demonstrated that the expression levels of eNOS and SIRT1 were significantly upregulated. Furthermore, the cell proliferation and cell apoptosis of the Min6 cells were evaluated, using a cell counting kit-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The results suggested that overexpressed eNOS promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis in Min6 cells. The interaction between eNOS and SIRT1 was explored through co-immunoprecipitation, and it found that there was a strong interaction between eNOS and SIRT1. In conclusion, overexpressed eNOS may induce SIRT1 activation, which is implied to play a protective role in Min6 cells, and eNOS may be a new therapeutic target for diseases such as type 2 diabetes.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.06882611400000001,-0.026871705,0.017418391999999998,-0.10519766800000001,-0.083751323,0.04901931,0.027931106,-0.047089973,0.055506737,-0.035377244,-0.050140165,-0.03058911,-0.012757531,0.089103739,0.009142884,0.028196797000000003,-0.009671821,-0.034326564,0.013695539,-0.038257765,0.037381385,-0.008259586,0.047114385,-0.008104186,0.006405969,0.011335411,-0.012221973999999998,0.036686692,-0.013602147,-0.047703910999999995
1316,Persistent bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) infection in cattle herds,"Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a significant pathogen associated with gastrointestinal, respiratory, and reproductive diseases of cattle worldwide. It causes continuous economic losses to the cattle industry primarily due to decreased reproductive performance. The ability of virus to cross the placenta during early pregnancy can result in the birth of persistently infected (PI) calves. Persistently infected animals are generally much more efficient transmitters of BVDV than transiently or acutely infected animals because they are capable of shedding large quantities of virus throughout their lives and are considered the primary reservoirs for BVDV. Due to the nature of viral infections, there is no treatment to fully cure an animal of a viral infection. All control programs which are in use in many countries of the world, mainly depend upon the detection of PI animals, eliminating them and preventing their return into the herds. Detection of PI animals at early stage, particularly soon after birth is of significant benefit to implement BVDV control programs. Available diagnostic tests such as virus isolation (VI), immunohistochemistry (IHC), Antigen-Capture ELISA (ACE), and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are used for detection of PI cattle. Each method to detect BVDV has advantages, disadvantages, and applicability for different diagnostic situations. The reliability of diagnostic tests is optimized by choosing the appropriate sampling strategy on the basis of animal age.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.015783781,0.008331376,0.098087906,-0.035385334,-0.029543225,0.019003255,0.052535805,-0.016864146,0.010229237,0.02951453,0.012669918999999998,-0.020226921000000002,0.019823723,-0.016387898999999997,0.078857513,-0.018721359,-0.026982435,0.0016207110000000002,-0.020762001000000002,0.006756682,-0.018566093999999998,-0.018945629,-0.026421952000000002,-0.022447204,0.0507715,-0.011534724,0.0011170639999999999,-0.090405221,-0.005379642,-0.0034931529999999997
1317,"The Use of Xenosurveillance to Detect Human Bacteria, Parasites, and Viruses in Mosquito Bloodmeals","Infectious disease surveillance is hindered by several factors, including limited infrastructure and geographic isolation of many resource-poor regions. In addition, the complexities of sample acquisition, processing, and analysis, even in developed regions, can be rate limiting. Therefore, new strategies to survey human populations for emerging pathogens are necessary. Xenosurveillance is a method that utilizes mosquitoes as sampling devices to search for genetic signatures of pathogens in vertebrates. Previously we demonstrated that xenosurveillance can detect viral RNA in both laboratory and field settings. However, its ability to detect bacteria and parasites remains to be assessed. Accordingly, we fed Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes blood that contained Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Bacillus anthracis. In addition, we determined whether two additional emerging viruses, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and Zika virus could be detected by this method. Pathogen-specific real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate the sensitivity of xenosurveillance across multiple pathogen taxa and over time. We detected RNA from all pathogens at clinically relevant concentrations from mosquitoes processed up to 1 day postbloodfeeding. These results demonstrate that xenosurveillance may be used as a tool to expand surveillance for viral, parasitic, and bacterial pathogens in resource-limited areas.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.018907919,0.012655563,0.056045232,0.053852477,-0.006863453,-0.018087534,0.05426529,0.029892015,-0.01225387,0.09025278199999999,-0.003579132,-0.047371300000000005,0.069459731,-0.043931354000000006,0.034922344,-0.019146023,-0.055602423,-0.045922141,-0.008279113000000001,0.016741557,-0.023109467,0.018672887,0.017781627,-0.004828932,0.02130134,-0.00875586,-0.00718153,0.037842309,0.003921829,-0.03321422
1318,Prolonged Shedding of Human Coronavirus in Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients: Risk Factors and Viral Genome Evolution,"BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that human coronavirus (HCoV) pneumonia is associated with significant mortality in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Investigation of risk factors for prolonged shedding and intrahost genome evolution may provide critical information for development of novel therapeutics. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed HCT recipients with HCoV detected in nasal samples by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HCoV strains were identified using strain-specific PCR. Shedding duration was defined as time between first positive and first negative sample. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate factors for prolonged shedding (≥21 days). Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) was conducted when ≥4 samples with cycle threshold values of <28 were available. RESULTS: Seventeen of 44 patients had prolonged shedding. Among 31 available samples, 35% were OC43, 32% were NL63, 19% were HKU1, and 13% were 229E; median shedding duration was similar between strains (P = .79). Bivariable logistic regression analyses suggested that high viral load, receipt of high-dose steroids, and myeloablative conditioning were associated with prolonged shedding. mNGS among 5 subjects showed single-nucleotide polymorphisms from OC43 and NL63 starting 1 month following onset of shedding. CONCLUSIONS: High viral load, high-dose steroids, and myeloablative conditioning were associated with prolonged shedding of HCoV in HCT recipients.

1322,Efficacy of an accelerated hydrogen peroxide disinfectant to inactivate porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in swine feces on metal surfaces,"In May of 2013, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was detected in swine for the first time in North America. It spread rapidly, in part due to contaminated livestock trailers. The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of an accelerated hydrogen peroxide disinfectant for inactivating PEDV in the presence of feces on metal surfaces, such as those found in livestock trailers. Three-week-old barrows were inoculated intragastrically with 5 mL of PEDV-negative feces for the negative control, 5 mL of untreated PEDV-positive feces for the positive control, and 5 mL or 10 mL of PEDV-positive feces that was subjected to treatment with a 1:16 or 1:32 concentrations of accelerated hydrogen peroxide disinfectant for a contact time of 30 min at 20°C. These pigs served as a bioassay to determine the infectivity of virus following treatment. Rectal swabs collected from the inoculated pigs on days 3 and 7 post-inoculation were tested by using PEDV-specific real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and the proportion of pigs in each group that became infected with PEDV was assessed. None of the pigs used for the bioassay in the 4 treatment groups and the negative control group became infected with PEDV, which was significantly different from the positive control group (P < 0.05) in which all pigs were infected. The results suggest that the application of the accelerated hydrogen peroxide under these conditions was sufficient to inactivate the virus in feces found on metal surfaces.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.012088492,0.007661691,0.08661298,-0.13108398400000001,0.035103237,0.050252317000000005,-0.018778277,0.002260722,-0.022420005,-0.064590868,0.07463418599999999,0.078393738,-0.217106518,0.082961152,0.333143537,-0.21302311100000001,-0.067749168,0.051294220999999994,-0.026191047000000002,0.191678512,-0.251349592,-0.11244491599999999,0.09768029800000001,-0.09820203400000001,-0.10030352099999999,-0.026894192999999997,-0.040156909,0.016461375,0.05879747,-0.010065206
1327,Ebola Preparedness: Diagnosis Improvement Using Rapid Approaches for Proficiency Testing,"The unprecedented 2015 Ebolavirus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa was declared a public health emergency, making diagnosis and quality of testing a global issue. The accuracy of laboratory diagnostic capacity for EBOV was assessed in 2014 to 2016 using a proficiency testing (PT) strategy developed by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia Quality Assurance Programs (RCPAQAP) in Biosecurity. Following a literature search, EBOV-specific gene targets were ranked according to the frequency of their use in published methods. The most commonly used gene regions (nucleoprotein [NP], glycoprotein [GP], and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [L]) were selected for the design of in vitro RNA transcripts to be included in the simulated EBOV specimens used for EBOV detection with PCR-based assays. Specimens were tested for stability and found to be stable on long-term storage (1 year) at −80°C and on shorter-term storage in lyophilized form (1 week at ambient temperature and a subsequent week at −80°C). These specimens were used in three EBOV PTs offered from April 2014 to March 2016. In the first and third PTs, all laboratories (3/3 and 9/9, respectively) correctly identified specimens containing EBOV RNA transcripts, while in the second PT, all but one laboratory (5/6) correctly confirmed the presence of EBOV. The EBOV PT panel was useful for ensuring the competency of laboratories in detecting EBOV in the absence of readily available clinical samples. The simulated EBOV specimen was safe, stable, and reliable and can be used in lyophilized form for future EBOV PT programs, allowing simplicity of transport.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.031727207,0.008055554,0.045694992999999996,-0.010381788000000001,-0.032728692000000004,0.00033905400000000004,1.58e-05,0.024067849,-0.007335415,-0.0011612010000000002,-0.004536684,0.011709211,-0.0046504829999999995,-0.040134825,0.010199306,0.017725609,-0.026576122999999997,0.014106716000000002,-0.0290286,-0.06823617,-0.012298623,-0.025999611000000002,-0.016383822,-0.035553593,0.01155974,-0.00661396,0.008477727,0.001861856,0.005360796,0.00934077
1331,The Many Faces of the Flavivirus NS5 Protein in Antagonism of Type I Interferon Signaling,"The vector-borne flaviviruses cause severe disease in humans on every inhabited continent on earth. Their transmission by arthropods, particularly mosquitoes, facilitates large emergence events such as witnessed with Zika virus (ZIKV) or West Nile virus in the Americas. Every vector-borne flavivirus examined thus far that causes disease in humans, from dengue virus to ZIKV, antagonizes the host type I interferon (IFN-I) response by preventing JAK-STAT signaling, suggesting that suppression of this pathway is an important determinant of infection. The most direct and potent viral inhibitor of this pathway is the nonstructural protein NS5. However, the mechanisms utilized by NS5 from different flaviviruses are often quite different, sometimes despite close evolutionary relationships between viruses. The varied mechanisms of NS5 as an IFN-I antagonist are also surprising given that the evolution of NS5 is restrained by the requirement to maintain function of two enzymatic activities critical for virus replication, the methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This review discusses the different strategies used by flavivirus NS5 to evade the antiviral effects of IFN-I and how this information can be used to better model disease and develop antiviral countermeasures.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.110032301,-0.043894801,-0.038009214,0.011006974,-0.072686376,0.071310641,0.10385187,0.0030801279999999997,0.031199212999999996,0.052336960999999994,0.01122463,-0.005408701,-0.011298736,0.012974683,-0.004042497,6.709999999999999e-05,-0.011686891999999999,0.008971004,-0.015225967,0.047715010999999995,0.006486504000000001,0.0009301919999999999,-0.04068295,0.011523924,0.032018752000000004,0.048817520999999996,0.052255569,-0.029141235,-0.029713875,0.03059429
1334,Differences in innate immune response gene regulation in the middle ear of children who are otitis prone and in those not otitis prone,"OBJECTIVE: Acute otitis media (AOM) causes an inflammatory response in the middle ear. We assessed differences in innate immune responses involved in bacterial defense at onset of AOM in children who were stringently defined as otitis prone (sOP) and children not otitis prone (NOP). STUDY DESIGN: Innate immune genes analysis from middle ear fluid (MEF) samples of children. METHODS: Genes of toll-like receptors (TLR), nod-like and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptors, downstream effectors important for inflammation and apoptosis, including cytokines and chemokines, were studied from MEF samples by using a real-time polymerase chain reaction array. Protein levels of differentially regulated genes were measured by Luminex. RESULTS: Gene expression in MEF among children who were sOP was significantly different in upregulation of interleukin 8, secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3, and in downregulation of interferon regulatory factor 7 and its related signaling molecules interferon alpha, Toll-like receptor adaptor molecule 2, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5, and mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 compared with children who were NOP. Differences in innate gene regulation were similar when AOM was caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae.

1337,Intragraft Antiviral-specific Gene Expression as a Distinctive Transcriptional Signature for Studies in Polyomavirus Associated Nephropathy,"BACKGROUND: Polyomavirus nephropathy (PVAN) is a common cause of kidney allograft dysfunction and loss. To identify PVAN-specific gene expression and underlying molecular mechanisms we analyzed kidney biopsies with and without PVAN. METHODS: The study included 168 posttransplant renal allograft biopsies (T cell mediated rejection=26, PVAN=10, normal functioning graft (STA) =73, and interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA) =59) from 168 unique kidney allograft recipients. We performed gene expression assays and bioinformatics analysis to identify a set of PVAN-specific genes. Validity and relevance of a subset of these genes are validated by QPCR and IHC. RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of all the biopsies revealed high similarity between PVAN and TCMR gene expression. Increased statistical stringency identified 158 and 252 unique PVAN and TCMR injury-specific gene transcripts respectively. While TCMR-specific genes were overwhelmingly involved in immune response costimulation and TCR signaling, PVAN-specific genes were mainly related to DNA replication process, RNA polymerase assembly and pathogen recognition receptors. A principal component analysis using these genes further confirmed the most optimal separation between the 3 different clinical phenotypes. Validation of 4 PVAN-specific genes (RPS15, CFD, LTF, and NOSIP) by QPCR and confirmation by immunohistochemistry of 2 PVAN-specific proteins with anti-viral function (LTF and IFITM1) was done. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, even though PVAN and TCMR kidney allografts share great similarities on gene perturbation, PVAN-specific genes were identified with well-known anti-viral properties that provide tools for discerning PVAN and AR as well as attractive targets for rational drug design.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.065880307,-0.017993051,0.02495141,-0.082441821,-0.017585052,0.034576835,0.011094301,-0.012269325,0.032893692999999995,-0.014570993,-0.059206395999999994,-0.015241032,-0.0030912340000000004,0.009305865,-0.012913355,-0.009762271,-0.005808006,-0.026494617,-0.032839631,-0.037277737000000005,0.022505417000000003,-3.43e-05,0.000187724,0.019715003000000002,-0.044537635,-0.029879872999999998,0.01489697,0.018150213000000002,0.024522400000000003,-0.016104759
1338,In Vivo Conditions Enable IFNAR-Independent Type I Interferon Production by Peritoneal CD11b(+) Cells upon Thogoto Virus Infection,"Type I interferons (IFNs) crucially contribute to host survival upon viral infections. Robust expression of type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) and induction of an antiviral state critically depend on amplification of the IFN signal via the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR). A small amount of type I IFN produced early upon virus infection binds the IFNAR and activates a self-enhancing positive feedback loop, resulting in induction of large, protective amounts of IFN-α. Unexpectedly, we found robust, systemic IFN-α expression upon infection of IFNAR knockout mice with the orthomyxovirus Thogoto virus (THOV). The IFNAR-independent IFN-α production required in vivo conditions and was not achieved during in vitro infection. Using replication-incompetent THOV-derived virus-like particles, we demonstrate that IFNAR-independent type I IFN induction depends on viral polymerase activity but is largely independent of viral replication. To discover the cell type responsible for this effect, we used type I IFN reporter mice and identified CD11b(+) F4/80(+) myeloid cells within the peritoneal cavity of infected animals as the main source of IFNAR-independent type I IFN, corresponding to the particular tropism of THOV for this cell type. IMPORTANCE Type I IFNs are crucial for the survival of a host upon most viral infections, and, moreover, they shape subsequent adaptive immune responses. Production of protective amounts of type I IFN critically depends on the positive feedback amplification via the IFNAR. Unexpectedly, we observed robust IFNAR-independent type I IFN expression upon THOV infection and unraveled molecular mechanisms and determined the tissue and cell type involved. Our data indicate that the host can effectively use alternative pathways to induce type I IFN responses if the classical feedback amplification is not available. Understanding how type I IFN can be produced in large amounts independently of IFNAR-dependent enhancement will identify mechanisms which might contribute to novel therapeutic strategies to fight viral pathogens.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.070668813,-0.043912272,-0.000991988,-0.072335585,-0.09230191900000001,0.061641246,0.05761642,-0.017564942,0.049367136,-0.007455733000000001,-0.015121946,-0.037295327,-0.004154871,0.055502823,-0.00049675,0.014432806999999999,-0.025644537999999998,-0.03089706,-0.012360936999999999,0.025242595,0.046958600999999996,-0.002278235,-0.005581192,0.033508577000000005,0.014350636000000002,-0.032304452000000004,0.014012407,0.013135745,-0.04286964,-0.02883356
1342,Analysis of Ebola virus polymerase domains to find strain-specific differences and to gain insight on their pathogenicity,"Ebola virus, a member of the family Filoviridae has caused immense morbidity and mortality in recent times, especially in West Africa. The infection characterized by chills, fever, diarrhea, and myalgia can progress to hemorrhage and death. Hence, it is a high priority area to better understand its biology in order to expedite vaccine development pipelines. In this regard, this study analyzes the domains in RNA polymerase of fifteen publicly-available Ebola isolates belonging to three strains (Zaire, Sudan and Reston). The protein FASTA sequences of the isolates belonging Zaire, Sudan and Reston strains were extracted from UniProt database and submitted to the interactive web tool SMART for the polymerase domain profiles.

1343,Anti-hepatitis C virus potency of a new autophagy inhibitor using human liver slices model,"AIM: To evaluate the antiviral potency of a new anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antiviral agent targeting the cellular autophagy machinery. METHODS: Non-infected liver slices, obtained from human liver resection and cut in 350 μm-thick slices (2.7 × 10(6) cells per slice) were infected with cell culture-grown HCV Con1b/C3 supernatant (multiplicity of infection = 0.1) cultivated for up to ten days. HCV infected slices were treated at day 4 post-infection with GNS-396 for 6 d at different concentrations. HCV replication was evaluated by strand-specific real-time quantitative reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction. The infectivity titers of supernatants were evaluated by foci formation upon inoculation into naive Huh-7.5.1 cells. The cytotoxic effect of the drugs was evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase leakage assays. RESULTS: The antiviral efficacy of a new antiviral drug, GNS-396, an autophagy inhibitor, on HCV infection of adult human liver slices was evidenced in a dose-dependent manner. At day 6 post-treatment, GNS-396 EC50 was 158 nmol/L without cytotoxic effect (compared to hydroxychloroquine EC50 = 1.17 μmol/L). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that our ex vivo model is efficient for evaluation the potency of autophagy inhibitors, in particular a new quinoline derivative GNS-396 as antiviral could inhibit HCV infection in a dose-dependent manner without cytotoxic effect.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.077880495,-0.02844929,-0.016315326,-0.042174844,-0.15926970099999999,0.07759088900000001,0.079249567,-0.014495801,0.078243166,0.013215303000000001,-0.000733872,0.056893136,0.018886176,0.11722768300000001,-0.0016609510000000001,-0.036826247,0.0007324489999999999,0.291465508,0.317011975,-0.09539511,-0.050275852,0.0063251240000000005,0.086858741,0.068240253,-0.039966171,-0.041163204,-0.038374438,0.042323415999999996,-0.03776076,-0.033821348
1345,"Regulatory effect of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant, epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide 78 and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate on pulmonary neutrophil aggregation mediated by nuclear factor-κB in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome mice","In the present study, the regulatory effect of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC) and epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide 78 (ENA-78) on pulmonary neutrophil (PMN) accumulation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) mice, and the therapeutic effect of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), was investigated. BALB/c mice were divided into control, LPS and PDTC + LPS groups using a random number table. The phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) was detected using a western blot, and the mRNA expression levels of CINC were evaluated using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expression of NF-κB, CINC and ENA-78 was detected using immunohistochemistry. The production of interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-10 in serum and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The total number of leukocytes and proportion of PMNs in BALF was also determined. Following injection with LPS (20 mg/kg), the expression levels of p-NF-κB, CINC and ENA-78 were increased in lung tissue, and the expression levels of IL-8, IL-10 and the number of PMNs increased in serum and BALF. However, in comparison with the LPS group, the degree of lung injury was reduced in ARDS mice that were treated with PDTC. In addition, the expression level of p-NF-κB and the production of chemokines in lung tissue decreased in ARDS mice that were treated with PDTC, and the number of PMNs in BALF also decreased. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that the LPS-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB may result in the synthesis and release of CINC and ENA-78, which induce the accumulation of PMNs in the lung. Therefore, PDTC may be used to reduce the production of chemokines and cytokines, thereby decreasing the activation of PMNs in lung tissue and reducing the damage of lung tissue in ARDS.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.03266234,-0.023884165,0.007486034,-0.169348,-0.09156238300000001,0.039276129,0.017830089,-0.051739744000000004,0.046068234000000007,-0.065576408,-0.055944833,-0.037920533,-0.041500498999999996,0.132974986,-0.032990835,0.021665464,-0.0065084209999999995,-0.083009018,-0.02731312,-0.069409557,0.058352867999999995,-0.078060155,0.051816741,-0.008258116,-0.046767863,-0.040611151,0.000332101,0.042356859000000004,0.053892418,-0.083651707
1347,Antiviral Targets of Human Noroviruses,"Human noroviruses are major causative agents of sporadic and epidemic gastroenteritis both in children and adults. Currently there are no licensed therapeutic intervention measures either in terms of vaccines or drugs available for these highly contagious human pathogens. Genetic and antigenic diversity of these viruses, rapid emergence of new strains, and their ability to infect a broad population by using polymorphic histo-blood group antigens for cell attachment, pose significant challenges for the development of effective antiviral agents. Despite these impediments, there is progress in the design and development of therapeutic agents. These include capsid-based candidate vaccines, and potential antivirals either in the form of glycomimetics or designer antibodies that block HBGA binding, as well as those that target essential non-structural proteins such as the viral protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In addition to these classical approaches, recent studies suggest the possibility of interferons and targeting host cell factors as viable approaches to counter norovirus infection.

1350,Dynamic Nucleolar Targeting of Dengue Virus Polymerase NS5 in Response to Extracellular pH,"The nucleolar subcompartment of the nucleus is increasingly recognized as an important target of RNA viruses. Here we document for the first time the ability of dengue virus (DENV) polymerase, nonstructural protein 5 (NS5), to accumulate within the nucleolus of infected cells and to target green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the nucleolus of live transfected cells. Intriguingly, NS5 exchange between the nucleus and nucleolus is dynamically modulated by extracellular pH, responding rapidly and reversibly to pH change, in contrast to GFP alone or other nucleolar and non-nucleolar targeted protein controls. The minimal pH-sensitive nucleolar targeting region (pHNTR), sufficient to target GFP to the nucleolus in a pH-sensitive fashion, was mapped to NS5 residues 1 to 244, with mutation of key hydrophobic residues, Leu-165, Leu-167, and Val-168, abolishing pHNTR function in NS5-transfected cells, and severely attenuating DENV growth in infected cells. This is the first report of a viral protein whose nucleolar targeting ability is rapidly modulated by extracellular stimuli, suggesting that DENV has the ability to detect and respond dynamically to the extracellular environment. IMPORTANCE Infections by dengue virus (DENV) threaten 40% of the world's population yet there is no approved vaccine or antiviral therapeutic to treat infections. Understanding the molecular details that govern effective viral replication is key for the development of novel antiviral strategies. Here, we describe for the first time dynamic trafficking of DENV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) to the subnuclear compartment, the nucleolus. We demonstrate that NS5's targeting to the nucleolus occurs in response to acidic pH, identify the key amino acid residues within NS5 that are responsible, and demonstrate that their mutation severely impairs production of infectious DENV. Overall, this study identifies a unique subcellular trafficking event and suggests that DENV is able to detect and respond dynamically to environmental changes.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.10575665,-0.038043237,0.0033260620000000003,-0.012190125,-0.08378378,0.028641341,0.046327723,-0.016575635,0.028458832000000003,0.002053764,-0.019753036,0.01474451,-0.022071944,0.004988886,-0.022152959,0.001967641,0.019810387,-0.021266329,-0.010337335999999999,0.029069361000000002,-0.007573106,0.010498868,-0.015691428,-0.02545,0.059196057999999996,0.092834982,0.022640184,-0.026040208,-0.003858693,0.028909532999999998
1355,Current Tools for Norovirus Drug Discovery,"INTRODUCTION: Rapid transmission of norovirus often occurs due to its low infectious dosage, high genetic diversity and its short incubation time. The viruses cause acute gastroenteritis and may lead to death. Presently, no effective vaccine or selective drugs accepted by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are available for the treatment of norovirus. Advances in the development of norovirus replicon cell lines, GII.4-Sydney HuNoV strain human B cells, and murine and gnotobiotic pig norovirus models have facilitated the discovery of effective small molecule inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. AREAS COVERED: This review gives a brief discussion of the biology and replication of norovirus before highlighting the discovery of anti-norovirus molecules. The article coverage includes: an overview of the current state of norovirus drug discovery, the targeting of the norovirus life cycle, the inhibition of structural and nonstructural proteins of norovirus such as proteases and polymerase, and the blockage of virus entry into host cells. Finally, anti-norovirus drugs in the clinical development stage are described. EXPERT OPINION: The current approach for the counteraction of norovirus focuses on the inhibition of viral RNA polymerase, norovirus 3C-like protease and the structural proteins VP1 as well as the blockade of norovirus entry. Broad-spectrum anti-norovirus molecules, based on the inhibition of 3C-like protease, have been developed. Other host factors and ways to overcome the development of resistance through mutation are also being examined. A dual approach in targeting viral and host factors may lead to an effective counteraction of norovirus infection. Current successes in developing norovirus replicon harboring cells and norovirus infected human cells, as well as murine norovirus models and other animal models such as piglets have facilitated the discovery of effective drugs and helped our understanding of its mechanism of action.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.090464112,-0.028499563999999998,-0.002011114,-0.014187857,-0.080627777,0.07963250200000001,0.100549771,-0.00691196,0.035924966,0.028865707999999997,0.006947147,0.048399443,0.007984052,-0.024786323,0.021683506,-0.019909391999999998,-0.042339094,0.078815833,0.045192094,0.054243032000000004,0.03323626,0.04975099400000001,-0.081096226,0.043109102999999996,0.024453948,-0.016919801,0.038727597,-0.04515987900000001,0.066240306,-0.0012796189999999999
1357,Acute Otitis Media and Other Complications of Viral Respiratory Infection,"BACKGROUND: Viral upper and lower respiratory tract infections (URI, LRI) are common in infants. We determined the prevalence of viral URI and its complications, including acute otitis media (AOM) and LRI, and assessed the effect of bacterial-viral interactions, and genetic and environmental risks on AOM development. METHODS: Healthy infants were enrolled from near birth and followed to the first episode of AOM up to 12 months of age. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected at monthly intervals (months 1–6, 9) and during viral URI episodes for bacterial culture and viral polymerase chain reaction studies. Subjects were followed closely for AOM development. RESULTS: A total of 367 infants were followed for 286 child-years; 887 URI (305 infants) and 180 AOM episodes (143 infants) were documented. Prevalence of URI, LRI, and AOM in the first year was 3.2, 0.25, and 0.67 per child-year, respectively. Cumulative AOM incidence by ages 3, 6, and 12 months was 6%, 23%, and 46%. Infants with and without AOM had 4.7 and 2.3 URI episodes per child-year, respectively (P < .002). Pathogenic bacterial colonization rates by month were significantly higher in infants with AOM (P < .005). Breastfeeding reduced both URI and AOM risks (P < .05). Significant bacterial-viral interactions occurred with Moraxella catarrhalis and a variety of respiratory viruses and altered URI and AOM risks. CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of infants experienced AOM by age 1. Important AOM risk factors included frequent viral URI, pathogenic bacterial colonization, and lack of breastfeeding. Bacterial-viral interactions may play a significant role in AOM pathogenesis and deserve further investigation.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.053072201,-0.07391284,-0.037428517,-0.058388450999999994,-0.019706087,-0.037624107999999996,0.077761667,-0.026678557999999998,0.025484581,0.018821313,0.004418219,-0.024602102,-0.019637704,-0.067436219,0.035762044,0.030380498,-0.000134904,-0.066233214,0.02320652,-0.035908947000000004,-0.054893412999999995,-0.013126428,-0.030399608999999998,0.02768944,0.050786923,-0.016779639,0.027920079,-0.002007404,0.049547144,-0.035399394
1361,Identification of a resveratrol tetramer as a potent inhibitor of hepatitis C virus helicase,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is responsible for various chronic inflammatory liver diseases. Here, we have identified a naturally occurring compound with anti‐HCV activity and have elucidated its mode of antiviral action. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Luciferase reporter and real‐time RT‐PCR assays were used to measure HCV replication. Western blot, fluorescence‐labelled HCV replicons and infectious clones were employed to quantitate expression levels of viral proteins. Resistant HCV mutant mapping, in vitro NS3 protease, helicase, NS5B polymerase and drug affinity responsive target stability assays were also used to study the antiviral mechanism. KEY RESULTS: A resveratrol tetramer, vitisin B from grapevine root extract showed high potency against HCV replication (EC(50) = 6 nM) with relatively low cytotoxicity (EC(50) >10 μM). Combined treatment of vitisin B with an NS5B polymerase inhibitor (sofosbuvir) exhibited a synergistic or at least additive antiviral activity. Analysis of a number of vitisin B‐resistant HCV variants suggested an NS3 helicase as its potential target. We confirmed a direct binding between vitisin B and a purified NS3 helicase in vitro. Vitisin B was a potent inhibitor of a HCV NS3 helicase (IC(50) = 3 nM). In vivo, Finally, we observed a preferred tissue distribution of vitisin B in the liver after i.p. injection in rats, at clinically attainable concentrations. Conclusion and Implications Vitisin B is one of the most potent HCV helicase inhibitors identified so far. Vitisin B is thus a prime candidate to be developed as the first HCV drug derived from natural products.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.116636151,-0.028203026000000003,-0.00357112,-0.016790514,-0.153426271,0.057977462,0.078052098,-0.015328718,0.069348896,0.010100994,-0.014870538999999999,0.107391995,0.025107078999999997,0.07158226,-0.058730588,-0.064922409,0.042017635,0.354252911,0.405012217,-0.16412697199999998,-0.077537334,0.001819539,0.12406636900000001,0.087192235,-0.046349654000000004,-0.036018329,-0.05070258,0.051870648,-0.054267622,-0.068754471
1363,The Non-structural Protein of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Disrupts the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and Induces Apoptosis,"Viruses have developed distinct strategies to overcome the host defense system. Regulation of apoptosis in response to viral infection is important for virus survival and dissemination. Like other viruses, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is known to regulate apoptosis. This study, for the first time, suggests that the non-structural protein NSs of CCHFV, a member of the genus Nairovirus, induces apoptosis. In this report, we demonstrated the expression of CCHFV NSs, which contains 150 amino acid residues, in CCHFV-infected cells. CCHFV NSs undergoes active degradation during infection. We further demonstrated that ectopic expression of CCHFV NSs induces apoptosis, as reflected by caspase-3/7 activity and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, in different cell lines that support CCHFV replication. Using specific inhibitors, we showed that CCHFV NSs induces apoptosis via both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. The minimal active region of the CCHFV NSs protein was determined to be 93–140 amino acid residues. Using alanine scanning, we demonstrated that Leu-127 and Leu-135 are the key residues for NSs-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, CCHFV NSs co-localizes in mitochondria and also disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential. We also demonstrated that Leu-127 and Leu-135 are important residues for disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential by NSs. Therefore, these results indicate that the C terminus of CCHFV NSs triggers mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, leading to activation of caspases, which, ultimately, leads to apoptosis. Given that multiple factors contribute to apoptosis during CCHFV infection, further studies are needed to define the involvement of CCHFV NSs in regulating apoptosis in infected cells.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.076785058,-0.035171019,-0.007780533,-0.079168855,-0.05687658599999999,0.045798816,0.034636613999999996,-0.024401476000000002,0.044690835,-0.018012593,-0.032735801,0.000427476,-0.015079261000000002,0.020036581,-0.0075623619999999996,0.008360107,0.015249499,-0.022390164,-0.00029129599999999997,0.004326079,0.015598872,0.000582108,-0.006681213,-0.018962186000000002,0.0381306,0.024978569,-0.029591662999999997,0.020631487,-0.005979468000000001,-0.039325054
1364,Viral quantity and pathological changes in broilers experimentally infected by IRFIBV32 isolate of infectious bronchitis virus,"An Iranian isolate of avian infectious bronchitis virus IRFIBV32 was quantified in experimentally infected broilers using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and histopathological changes was investigated. Thirty-six 3-week-old commercial broilers were inoculated by 10(5) ELD50/0.1 ml of the virus. On the various days post inoculation (dpi) different tissues were collected. The virus strongly started the replication in trachea at 1 dpi and reached to the maximum titer at 3 dpi. The highest IBV RNA level was shown in this organ. In lung, the virus was replicated with the titer lower than that of the trachea, but it rose up more at 5 dpi. The kidneys were the tissues with the least viral genome copy number, although the duration of the virus presence was considerable. The virus replicated in testes sooner than ovaries also disappeared sooner but the maximum viral yield in the ovaries was more. The virus titer in the studied tissues had an interesting fluctuation especially in caecal tonsils. Testes and ovaries were the organs that the virus could reactivate without using any chemical. The most severe lesions were observed in tracheae but they appeared in the lungs later. Lymphocyte infiltration in the kidneys was noted from 5 dpi even sooner than the lungs. There were no lesions in the caecal tonsils, testes and ovaries in spite of the virus replication in a high titer.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.042446122999999995,-0.033188908999999996,0.02116384,-0.042669335,0.013269241999999999,0.048045739000000004,-0.033935413,-0.042482215999999996,0.032337434,0.09002387699999999,0.07080263,-0.044123199,-0.031922249,0.057588667,0.031344602,0.043229906,-0.012151311000000001,-0.015196017,0.00662608,0.04359630900000001,-0.030211627,-0.013863948999999999,-0.004815827,-0.022164048,-0.027119294,0.030187885,0.003268997,0.0007998189999999999,-0.041936636,-0.006961593

Methods: We gathered 113 ONFH patients and 116 controls in the study. The polymorphisms of ABCB1 were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technology. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were adopted to analyze the correlation between ABCB1 polymorphisms and ONFH. Results: In the study, we found that the frequency of C3435T TT genotype was much lower in case group, compared with that of controls (17.7% vs. 23.3%). Moreover, OR and 95% CI values indicated that C3435T TT genotype served as a protective factor for ONFH (OR=0.34, 95% CI=0.15-0.75). Meanwhile, the risk for the T allele carriers was much lower than C allele (OR=0.60, 95% CI=0.42-0.87). However, C1236T polymorphism showed no significant effects on the pathogenesis of ONFH. In the haplotype analysis, T-T haplotype appeared to be an inhibitor for ONFH (OR=0.45, 95% CI=0.23-0.87).

Methods: MBL2 rs1800450 polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). MBL serum level was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Associations between rs1800450 and sepsis susceptibility was detected by Chi-square test and represented by odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Correlation of rs1800450 genotypes and MBL serum level was assessed using t test. Result: Variant A allele frequency was significantly observed in cases than that in controls, indicating a significant association with the susceptibility of sepsis (OR = 1.979, 95% CI = 1.200-3.262). GA genotype also relate to the onset of sepsis (OR = 2.090, 95% CI = 1.163-3.753). MBL serum concentrations were significantly different between case and control groups (P<0.001). Meanwhile, variant allele carriers had lower serum level compared with wild homozygous (P<0.001).

1375,Molecular Mechanisms and Timing of Cortical Immune Activation in Schizophrenia,"OBJECTIVE: Immune-related abnormalities are commonly reported in schizophrenia, including higher mRNA levels for the viral restriction factor interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) in the prefrontal cortex. The authors sought to clarify whether higher IFITM mRNA levels and other immune-related disturbances in the prefrontal cortex are the consequence of an ongoing molecular cascade contributing to immune activation or the reflection of a long-lasting maladaptive response to an in utero immune-related insult. METHOD: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was employed to measure mRNA levels for immune-related cytokines and transcriptional regulators, including those reported to regulate IFITM expression, in the prefrontal cortex from 62 schizophrenia and 62 healthy subjects and from adult mice exposed prenatally to maternal immune activation or in adulthood to the immune stimulant poly(I:C). RESULTS: Schizophrenia subjects had markedly higher mRNA levels for interleukin 6 (IL-6) (+379%) and interferon-β (+29%), which induce IFITM expression; lower mRNA levels for Schnurri-2 (−10%), a transcriptional inhibitor that lowers IFITM expression; and higher mRNA levels for nuclear factor-κB (+86%), a critical transcription factor that mediates cytokine regulation of immune-related gene expression. In adult mice that received daily poly(I:C) injections, but not in offspring with prenatal exposure to maternal immune activation, frontal cortex mRNA levels were also markedly elevated for IFITM (+304%), multiple cytokines including IL-6 (+493%), and nuclear factor-κB (+151%). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that higher prefrontal cortex IFITM mRNA levels in schizophrenia may be attributable to adult, but not prenatal, activation of multiple immune markers and encourage further investigation into the potential role of these and other immune markers as therapeutic targets in schizophrenia.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.06386399799999999,-0.03981076,-0.010069721,-0.165499704,-0.103408536,0.046923901,0.033466061,-0.037455341,0.062638518,-0.076626974,-0.084478115,-0.078979692,-0.0058552759999999995,0.11112728699999999,-0.063732354,0.019083941,-0.006227986,-0.10452699800000001,-0.072749494,-0.07323645200000001,0.031640958999999996,-0.032393984,0.015571173999999998,0.018403695,-0.062175612000000005,-0.10905234,0.024470354,0.027096292999999997,0.142197708,-0.039348602
1376,Differential Expression of miR-499 and Validation of Predicted Target Genes in the Testicular Tissue of Swine at Different Developmental Stages,"microRNAs (miRNAs) represent a newly identified class of nonprotein-coding ∼22 nt small RNA that plays important roles in multiple biological processes by degrading targeted mRNA or repressing mRNA translation. This study observed the morphology of swine testicular tissue at different developmental stages (including 1-day old, 1–7 month old) by Hematoxylin-eosin staining. We also examined the expression of miR-499 and its target genes (CYLC1, DMRT1, QKI, XRN2, ZNF313) in samples of tissue slices using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, which showed that miR-499 had a significant negative correlation with QKI gene. Then, the proteins of QKI gene expression were determined by western blot, which were consistent with results of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) detection. Therefore, the luciferase reporter gene system was used to verify correlation between miR-499 and QKI gene. Activity of luciferase was significantly lower in miR-499 co-transfected with pmiR-RB-REPORT-QKI-WT group than the miR-499 co-transfected with pmiR-RB-REPORT-QKI-mut/si groups, indicating that target sequence of miR-499 existed in 3′UTR of QKI gene. Furthermore, the expressions of miR-499 and QKI were detected in testicular cells that were transfected with miR-499, miR-499 negative control and untreated. The results showed that the diameter of convoluted seminiferous tubule growth increased with age. Significantly different expressions of miR-499 and its target genes were found in swine testicular tissue at different developmental stages (p<0.05), overexpressing miR-499 analysis, suggesting that miR-499 was negatively correlated to the expression of QKI (p<0.05).

1379,Cross-Protection of Influenza A Virus Infection by a DNA Aptamer Targeting the PA Endonuclease Domain,"Amino acid residues in the N-terminal of the PA subunit (PA(N)) of the influenza A virus polymerase play critical roles in endonuclease activity, protein stability, and viral RNA (vRNA) promoter binding. In addition, PA(N) is highly conserved among different subtypes of influenza virus, which suggests PA(N) to be a desired target in the development of anti-influenza agents. We selected DNA aptamers targeting the intact PA protein or the PA(N) domain of an H5N1 virus strain using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). The binding affinities of selected aptamers were measured, followed by an evaluation of in vitro endonuclease inhibitory activity. Next, the antiviral effects of enriched aptamers against influenza A virus infections were examined. A total of three aptamers targeting PA and six aptamers targeting PA(N) were selected. Our data demonstrated that all three PA-selected aptamers neither inhibited endonuclease activity nor exhibited antiviral efficacy, whereas four of the six PA(N)-selected aptamers inhibited both endonuclease activity and H5N1 virus infection. Among the four effective aptamers, one exhibited cross-protection against infections of H1N1, H5N1, H7N7, and H7N9 influenza viruses, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of around 10 nM. Notably, this aptamer was identified at the 5th round but disappeared after the 10th round of selection, suggesting that the identification and evaluation of aptamers at early rounds of selection may be highly helpful for screening effective aptamers. Overall, our study provides novel insights for screening and developing effective aptamers for use as anti-influenza drugs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.044995960999999994,-0.064054645,-0.011582414,0.036874725,-0.065906276,0.17495961,-0.013072907,-0.012196325,0.018947865,-0.045149305,-0.011907005,0.023132673,-0.009491445,0.000949804,-0.010046577,-0.0038286170000000003,0.015144866000000002,0.003876749,0.019919837,-0.006214132,0.018130553,0.0067061080000000006,0.011444703999999998,0.021011767,0.011260798,0.032356411,-0.008466072,0.005853436,0.034525301,0.040733256
1382,"Protective Efficacy of the Conserved NP, PB1, and M1 Proteins as Immunogens in DNA- and Vaccinia Virus-Based Universal Influenza A Virus Vaccines in Mice","The conventional hemagglutinin (HA)- and neuraminidase (NA)-based influenza vaccines need to be updated most years and are ineffective if the glycoprotein HA of the vaccine strains is a mismatch with that of the epidemic strain. Universal vaccines targeting conserved viral components might provide cross-protection and thus complement and improve conventional vaccines. In this study, we generated DNA plasmids and recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the conserved proteins nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase basic 1 (PB1), and matrix 1 (M1) from influenza virus strain A/Beijing/30/95 (H3N2). BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly with a single vaccine based on NP, PB1, or M1 alone or a combination vaccine based on all three antigens and were then challenged with lethal doses of the heterologous influenza virus strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). Vaccines based on NP, PB1, and M1 provided complete or partial protection against challenge with 1.7 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) of PR8 in mice. Of the three antigens, NP-based vaccines induced protection against 5 LD(50) and 10 LD(50) and thus exhibited the greatest protective effect. Universal influenza vaccines based on the combination of NP, PB1, and M1 induced a strong immune response and thus might be an alternative approach to addressing future influenza virus pandemics.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.0069042209999999994,-0.066813475,0.022833702999999997,0.051146610999999995,-0.023191639,0.23956591,-0.073935698,-0.031946147,0.016785265,-0.031773969,-0.00995301,0.040251073,-0.021464981,-0.044287753,-0.0037164109999999998,-0.001027753,-0.028161441000000002,-0.011906173,-0.014276565,0.0020140139999999997,0.021657296,0.00015125,0.047245012999999995,0.040671915,0.011236882,-0.0007987669999999999,-0.015447411000000001,-0.011595369,-0.027242843,0.055840455
1385,Influenza A Virus Protein PA-X Contributes to Viral Growth and Suppression of the Host Antiviral and Immune Responses,"Influenza virus infection causes global inhibition of host protein synthesis in infected cells. This host shutoff is thought to allow viruses to escape from the host antiviral response, which restricts virus replication and spread. Although the mechanism of host shutoff is unclear, a novel viral protein expressed by ribosomal frameshifting, PA-X, was found to play a major role in influenza virus-induced host shutoff. However, little is known about the impact of PA-X expression on currently circulating influenza A virus pathogenicity and the host antiviral response. In this study, we rescued a recombinant influenza A virus, A/California/04/09 (H1N1, Cal), containing mutations at the frameshift motif in the polymerase PA gene (Cal PA-XFS). Cal PA-XFS expressed significantly less PA-X than Cal wild type (WT). Cal WT, but not Cal PA-XFS, induced degradation of host β-actin mRNA and suppressed host protein synthesis, supporting the idea that PA-X induces host shutoff via mRNA decay. Moreover, Cal WT inhibited beta interferon (IFN-β) expression and replicated more rapidly than Cal PA-XFS in human respiratory cells. Mice infected with Cal PA-XFS had significantly lower levels of viral growth and greater expression of IFN-β mRNA in their lungs than mice infected with Cal WT. Importantly, more antihemagglutinin and neutralizing antibodies were produced in Cal PA-XFS-infected mice than in Cal WT-infected mice, despite the lower level of virus replication in the lungs. Our data indicate that PA-X of the pandemic H1N1 virus has a strong impact on viral growth and the host innate and acquired immune responses to influenza virus. IMPORTANCE Virus-induced host protein shutoff is considered to be a major factor allowing viruses to evade innate and acquired immune recognition. We provide evidence that the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus protein PA-X plays a role in virus replication and inhibition of host antiviral response by means of its host protein synthesis shutoff activity both in vitro and in vivo. We also demonstrated that, while the growth of Cal PA-XFS was attenuated in the lungs of infected animals, this mutant induced a stronger humoral response than Cal WT. Our findings clearly highlight the importance of PA-X in counteracting the host innate and acquired immune responses to influenza virus, an important global pathogen. This work demonstrates that inhibition of PA-X expression in influenza virus vaccine strains may provide a novel way of safely attenuating viral growth while inducing a more robust immune response.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.077725932,-0.09058649,-0.042119592000000004,0.017688126999999998,-0.089836881,0.198118908,-0.000551469,-0.032652501,0.05236205,-0.03623981,-0.050783410999999994,-0.062894567,0.00015307,0.11108507699999999,-0.012061573999999999,0.00327153,0.014243078000000001,-0.071609805,-0.039916126,0.030523306,0.042911367,0.032258207000000004,0.000538719,0.02156053,-0.022753295,0.005159558,0.023170734,-0.009853315999999999,0.007176999,0.026081627000000003

In the current study, two positive monoclonal cell lines (5D7 and 3H4) specific for PEDV were established, and the immunoreactivity of the monoclonal antibodies was confirmed by immunofluorescence and dot-immunobinding assays. A method, termed antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (AC-ELISA), which used the monoclonal antibody 5D7 as the detecting antibody and rabbit antiserum of PEDV protein S as the capture antibody, was developed.

1389,Antiviral Activity of Chloroquine Against Dengue Virus Type 2 Replication in Aotus Monkeys,"Dengue virus (DENV) of the Flaviviridae family is a single positive-stranded RNA virus that is transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of chloroquine (CLQ) as an antiviral drug against dengue virus in monkeys. To analyze the action of the drug in vivo, nonhuman primates groups (Aotus azarai infulatus) were inoculated with a subcutaneous injection of a virulent strain of DENV-2, treated and untreated CLQ. Blood hematological, viremia, and serum biochemical values were obtained from 16 DENV-2-inoculated, treated and untreated; four received only CLQ and one mock-infected Aotus monkeys. Monkey serum samples (day 0–10 post-inoculation) were assayed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Cytometric Bead Array for determination of viremia and inflammatory cytokines, respectively. Additionally, body temperature and activity levels were determined. In the present work, CLQ was effective on replication of DENV-2 in Aotus monkeys; a time viremia reduction was observed compared with the controls. The concentration of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma in the serum of the animals had a statistically significant reduction in the groups treated with CLQ after infection compared with the controls. A significant decrease in systemic levels of the liver enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was also observed in the animals treated with CLQ after infection compared with the controls. These results suggest that CLQ interferes in DENV-2 replication in Aotus monkeys.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.03808278,-0.026553603,0.006507811999999999,-0.082776035,-0.063881443,0.029943438,0.037324752,-0.002037161,-0.006660178,-0.027969516,0.028559194,0.01234451,-0.056971464000000006,0.054418493,-0.012601767,0.015271816,-0.016083348,0.003663714,0.042603342999999995,0.004587104,-0.010299106,-0.025300451,-0.008993342,0.00705172,-0.001369061,0.037227977,-0.000457531,-0.031169579,-0.000639377,0.002707132
1390,"Isolation and molecular characterization of nephropathic infectious bronchitis virus isolates of Gujarat state, India","Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a common, highly contagious, acute, and economically important viral disease of chickens caused by Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, sp. Avian coronavirus). Five pooled tissue suspensions of 50 layer birds and one reference Massachusetts vaccine strain were inoculated into specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken egg for isolation of IBV. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out using post inoculated allontoic fluid to amplify the spike (S) glycoprotein of S1 subunit of IBV. All the eggs inoculated with five pooled tissue samples and vaccine sample showed dwarfing and curling of SPF embryos indicative of IBV. All the five samples and the vaccine sample produced the expected amplicons of 466 bp by RT-PCR. The sequencing of five isolates revealed that all the five sequences were 99.09–100 % similar among themselves and showed 99.10–100 % nucleotide identity with the vaccine strain. On multiple sequence alignment it was found that our isolates were more similar at S1 subunit nucleotide level with the reference Ma5 and H120 vaccine strains than the reference Mass41 strain. The sequences of Anand isolates revealed further genetic changes in the circulating IBV in comparison to previous isolate of Gujarat as well as higher differences with the strains isolated in other states showing substantial changes at genetic level in Indian IBV isolates, which may partially explain the increasing incidences of IB in the country in spite of the vaccination.

1391,Functional and molecular evidence for expression of the renin angiotensin system and ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding in COS7 cells,"The renin angiotensin system (RAS) plays a vital role in the regulation of the cardiovascular and renal functions. COS7 is a robust and easily transfectable cell line derived from the kidney of the African green monkey, Cercopithecus aethiops. The aims of this study were to 1) demonstrate the presence of an endogenous and functional RAS in COS7, and 2) investigate the role of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM17) in the ectodomain shedding of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Reverse transcription coupled to gene-specific polymerase chain reaction demonstrated expression of ACE, ACE2, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R), and renin at the transcript levels in total RNA cell extracts. Western blot and immunohistochemistry identified ACE (60 kDa), ACE2 (75 kDa), AT(1)R (43 kDa), renin (41 kDa), and ADAM17 (130 kDa) in COS7. At the functional level, a sensitive and selective mass spectrometric approach detected endogenous renin, ACE, and ACE2 activities. ANG-(1–7) formation (m/z 899) from the natural substrate ANG II (m/z 1,046) was detected in lysates and media. COS7 cells stably expressing shRNA constructs directed against endogenous ADAM17 showed reduced ACE2 shedding into the media. This is the first study demonstrating endogenous expression of the RAS and ADAM17 in the widely used COS7 cell line and its utility to study ectodomain shedding of ACE2 mediated by ADAM17 in vitro. The transfectable nature of this cell line makes it an attractive cell model for studying the molecular, functional, and pharmacological properties of the renal RAS.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.082167447,-0.024380986,0.009618661,-0.102277627,-0.051217911,0.026007224,0.007534374,-0.038527681,0.029561464,-0.04716786,-0.034121472,-0.017470583,-0.006184688000000001,0.045050913,-0.010121864,0.006850223000000001,0.014295718999999998,-0.042602432999999995,-0.010410813,-0.045770225,0.014843285,-0.013677469,0.017956652,-0.018061239,0.00551965,0.02098591,0.003625362,0.020951061,-0.0019067620000000002,-0.064409601
1394,Enterovirus 71 mediates cell cycle arrest in S phase through non-structural protein 3D,"Many viruses disrupt the host cell cycle to facilitate their own growth. We assessed the mechanism and function of enterovirus 71 (EV71), a primary causative agent for recent hand, foot, and mouth disease outbreaks, in manipulating cell cycle progression. Our results suggest that EV71 infection induces S-phase arrest in diverse cell types by preventing the cell cycle transition from the S phase into the G2/M phase. Similar results were observed for an alternate picornavirus, Coxsackievirus A16. Synchronization in S phase, but not G0/G1 phase or G2/M phase, promotes viral replication. Consistent with its ability to arrest cells in S phase, the expression of cyclin A2, CDK 2, cyclin E1, and cyclin B1 was regulated by EV71 through increasing transcription of cyclin E1, promoting proteasome-mediated degradation of cyclin A2 and regulating the phosphorylation of CDK 2. Finally, a non-structural protein of EV71, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D, was demonstrated to mediate S-phase cell cycle arrest. These findings suggest that EV71 induces S-phase cell cycle arrest in infected cells via non-structural protein 3D, which may provide favorable conditions for virus production.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.097934544,-0.035535733,-0.016178278,-0.059961571,-0.088315103,0.035336133,0.04174147,-0.031971671,0.032104499,0.000174899,-0.023251163999999998,-0.010982088000000001,-0.022630692,0.057700372,0.0009113560000000001,0.020627107,0.005499372,-0.026343584,-0.016317113,0.005662451,0.010539271999999999,-0.007757534,-0.011933696,-0.012270921,0.01563991,0.034133147,-0.017508000000000003,0.041216442,-0.030249053999999997,-0.04506806
1396,Multiple Circulating Infections Can Mimic the Early Stages of Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers and Possible Human Exposure to Filoviruses in Sierra Leone Prior to the 2014 Outbreak,"Lassa fever (LF) is a severe viral hemorrhagic fever caused by Lassa virus (LASV). The LF program at the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) in Eastern Sierra Leone currently provides diagnostic services and clinical care for more than 500 suspected LF cases per year. Nearly two-thirds of suspected LF patients presenting to the LF Ward test negative for either LASV antigen or anti-LASV immunoglobulin M (IgM), and therefore are considered to have a non-Lassa febrile illness (NLFI). The NLFI patients in this study were generally severely ill, which accounts for their high case fatality rate of 36%. The current studies were aimed at determining possible causes of severe febrile illnesses in non-LF cases presenting to the KGH, including possible involvement of filoviruses. A seroprevalence survey employing commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests revealed significant IgM and IgG reactivity against dengue virus, chikungunya virus, West Nile virus (WNV), Leptospira, and typhus. A polymerase chain reaction–based survey using sera from subjects with acute LF, evidence of prior LASV exposure, or NLFI revealed widespread infection with Plasmodium falciparum malaria in febrile patients. WNV RNA was detected in a subset of patients, and a 419 nt amplicon specific to filoviral L segment RNA was detected at low levels in a single patient. However, 22% of the patients presenting at the KGH between 2011 and 2014 who were included in this survey registered anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) IgG or IgM, suggesting prior exposure to this agent. The 2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is already the deadliest and most widely dispersed outbreak of its kind on record. Serological evidence reported here for possible human exposure to filoviruses in Sierra Leone prior to the current EVD outbreak supports genetic analysis that EBOV may have been present in West Africa for some time prior to the 2014 outbreak.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.048095671,0.004714089,-0.026334521,-0.054989722000000005,-0.055843976,0.011923573,-0.014032194,0.05380626,-0.055091419,0.031872927999999995,0.0027976579999999997,0.013458976999999999,0.007354185,-0.007694954,0.002514933,0.001209458,-0.016146455,0.039105426,-0.028072668999999998,0.01091849,0.032703197,-0.026849743,-0.05952330000000001,-0.012618603,-0.017876732,0.038569351,0.020725898,0.026748112,-0.049266879000000006,0.001766118
1397,Correlation between Diarrhea Severity and Oocyst Count via Quantitative PCR or Fluorescence Microscopy in Experimental Cryptosporidiosis in Calves,"Cryptosporidium is an important diarrhea-associated pathogen, however the correlation between parasite burden and diarrhea severity remains unclear. We studied this relationship in 10 experimentally infected calves using immunofluorescence microscopy and real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (N = 124 fecal samples). The qPCR data were corrected for extraction/amplification efficiency and gene copy number to generate parasite counts. The qPCR and microscopic oocyst quantities exhibited significant correlation (R(2) = 0.33, P < 0.05), however qPCR had increased sensitivity. Upon comparison with diarrhea severity scores (from 0 to 3), a PCR-based count of ≥ 2.6 × 10(5) parasites or an immunofluorescence microscopy count of ≥ 4.5 × 10(4) oocysts were discriminatory predictors of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (versus no-to-mild diarrhea), with accuracies and predictive values of 72–82%. In summary, a quantitative approach for Cryptosporidium can refine predictive power for diarrhea and appears useful for distinguishing clinical cryptosporidiosis versus subclinical infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.01476645,0.015175497,0.089138001,-0.09668279,-0.021797119,-0.001320542,0.021327383,-0.019823643999999998,-0.014067135,-0.040098813999999997,0.004000575,0.021578146,-0.063420371,-0.008939836,0.083456527,-0.044663391,-0.024464609,-0.009280053,-0.004965491,-0.026792056,-0.037842092,-0.000802454,-0.005098023,-0.01551994,-0.013226141,-0.038615979,-0.006067108000000001,-0.061066775999999996,0.001485945,0.004502225
1401,Hepatitis B Virus Polymerase Disrupts K63-Linked Ubiquitination of STING To Block Innate Cytosolic DNA-Sensing Pathways,"The cellular innate immune system recognizing pathogen infection is essential for host defense against viruses. In parallel, viruses have developed a variety of strategies to evade the innate immunity. The hepatitis B virus (HBV), a DNA virus that causes chronic hepatitis, has been shown to inhibit RNA helicase RIG-I-mediated interferon (IFN) induction. However, it is still unknown whether HBV could affect the host DNA-sensing pathways. Here we report that in transiently HBV-transfected Huh7 cells, the stably HBV-producing cell line HepAD38, and HBV-infected HepaRG cells and primary human hepatocytes, HBV markedly interfered with IFN-β induction and antiviral immunity mediated by the stimulator of interferon genes (STING), which has been identified as a central factor in foreign DNA recognition and antiviral innate immunity. Screening analysis demonstrated that the viral polymerase (Pol), but not other HBV-encoded proteins, was able to inhibit STING-stimulated interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation and IFN-β induction. Moreover, the reverse transcriptase (RT) and the RNase H (RH) domains of Pol were identified to be responsible for the inhibitory effects. Furthermore, Pol was shown to physically associate with STING and dramatically decrease the K63-linked polyubiquitination of STING via its RT domain without altering the expression level of STING. Taken together, these observations suggest that besides its inherent catalytic function, Pol has a role in suppression of IFN-β production by direct interaction with STING and subsequent disruption of its K63-linked ubiquitination, providing a new mechanism for HBV to counteract the innate DNA-sensing pathways. IMPORTANCE Although whether and how HBV infection induces the innate immune responses are still controversial, it has become increasingly clear that HBV has developed strategies to counteract the pattern recognition receptor-mediated signaling pathways. Previous studies have shown that type I IFN induction activated by the host RNA sensors could be inhibited by HBV. However, it remains unknown whether HBV as a DNA virus utilizes evasion mechanisms against foreign DNA-elicited antiviral signaling. In recent years, the cytosolic DNA sensor and key adaptor STING has been demonstrated to be essential in multiple foreign DNA-elicited innate immune signalings. Here, for the first time, we report STING as a new target of HBV to antagonize IFN induction and identify the viral polymerase responsible for the inhibitory effect, thus providing an additional molecular mechanism by which HBV evades the innate immunity; this implies that in addition to its inherent catalytic function, HBV polymerase is a multifunctional immunomodulatory protein.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.108402061,-0.038302578,0.009202189,-0.058092133,-0.128054046,0.068026248,0.084164189,-0.033792699,0.065601137,-0.009663811,-0.048392094000000004,-0.026870411,-0.001161182,0.080949896,-0.031123177999999998,0.019813908,-0.006362537,-0.004971992,-0.00592957,0.000955942,0.015548335,0.026935208,-0.011381137,0.052629684,-0.002326481,-0.02715477,0.009261011,0.015412724,0.015757478000000002,-0.052997305
1406,Faecal virome of cats in an animal shelter,"We describe the metagenomics-derived feline enteric virome in the faeces of 25 cats from a single shelter in California. More than 90 % of the recognizable viral reads were related to mammalian viruses and the rest to bacterial viruses. Eight viral families were detected: Astroviridae, Coronaviridae, Parvoviridae, Circoviridae, Herpesviridae, Anelloviridae, Caliciviridae and Picobirnaviridae. Six previously known viruses were also identified: feline coronavirus type 1, felid herpes 1, feline calicivirus, feline norovirus, feline panleukopenia virus and picobirnavirus. Novel species of astroviruses and bocaviruses, and the first genome of a cyclovirus in a feline were characterized. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region from four highly divergent partial viral genomes in the order Picornavirales were sequenced. The detection of such a diverse collection of viruses shed within a single shelter suggested that such animals experience robust viral exposures. This study increases our understanding of the viral diversity in cats, facilitating future evaluation of their pathogenic and zoonotic potentials.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.07508327299999999,-0.038416083,0.017790128,-0.024274261000000002,0.083570167,0.010145988,0.112930288,0.026794001,-0.084869871,-0.035391105,0.27716131899999996,-0.130344041,0.190162406,-0.041405207,-0.051029832000000004,-0.073020129,0.018203937,-0.034352783,0.009085242,0.10385261,-0.005945522,0.043390642,-0.040212653,0.08947047300000001,-0.059373113,-0.026810022000000003,0.040623882,0.008885371,-0.008142421,-0.014695753
1407,Methyltransferase-Defective Avian Metapneumovirus Vaccines Provide Complete Protection against Challenge with the Homologous Colorado Strain and the Heterologous Minnesota Strain,"Avian metapneumovirus (aMPV), also known as avian pneumovirus or turkey rhinotracheitis virus, is the causative agent of turkey rhinotracheitis and is associated with swollen head syndrome in chickens. Since its discovery in the 1970s, aMPV has been recognized as an economically important pathogen in the poultry industry worldwide. The conserved region VI (CR VI) of the large (L) polymerase proteins of paramyxoviruses catalyzes methyltransferase (MTase) activities that typically methylate viral mRNAs at guanine N-7 (G-N-7) and ribose 2′-O positions. In this study, we generated a panel of recombinant aMPV (raMPV) Colorado strains carrying mutations in the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) binding site in the CR VI of L protein. These recombinant viruses were specifically defective in ribose 2′-O, but not G-N-7 methylation and were genetically stable and highly attenuated in cell culture and viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) young turkeys. Importantly, turkeys vaccinated with these MTase-defective raMPVs triggered a high level of neutralizing antibody and were completely protected from challenge with homologous aMPV Colorado strain and heterologous aMPV Minnesota strain. Collectively, our results indicate (i) that aMPV lacking 2′-O methylation is highly attenuated in vitro and in vivo and (ii) that inhibition of mRNA cap MTase can serve as a novel target to rationally design live attenuated vaccines for aMPV and perhaps other paramyxoviruses. IMPORTANCE Paramyxoviruses include many economically and agriculturally important viruses such as avian metapneumovirus (aMPV), and Newcastle disease virus (NDV), human pathogens such as human respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, human parainfluenza virus type 3, and measles virus, and highly lethal emerging pathogens such as Nipah virus and Hendra virus. For many of them, there is no effective vaccine or antiviral drug. These viruses share common strategies for viral gene expression and replication. During transcription, paramyxoviruses produce capped, methylated, and polyadenylated mRNAs. Using aMPV as a model, we found that viral ribose 2′-O methyltransferase (MTase) is a novel approach to rationally attenuate the virus for vaccine purpose. Recombinant aMPV (raMPV) lacking 2′-O MTase were not only highly attenuated in turkeys but also provided complete protection against the challenge of homologous and heterologous aMPV strains. This novel approach can be applicable to other animal and human paramyxoviruses for rationally designing live attenuated vaccines.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.052040757,-0.055043713,-0.01298109,-0.002463482,0.003303623,0.057678632,0.026709808999999998,-0.033026187,0.046827028,0.061053569,-0.020464831,-0.0046982429999999995,0.0012369689999999999,-0.004502639,-0.005808351999999999,-0.027939488999999998,-0.0074922090000000005,-0.008760604,-0.039205162,0.058000404000000005,0.063350223,0.013286233,0.033804732000000004,0.060016123,0.051459150999999995,0.020389789,-0.021202098,-0.015704871000000002,0.027311706,-0.033581849
1410,"An Observational, Laboratory-Based Study of Outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in Jeddah and Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 2014","Background. In spring 2014, a sudden rise in the number of notified Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections occurred across Saudi Arabia with a focus in Jeddah. Hypotheses to explain the outbreak pattern include increased surveillance, increased zoonotic transmission, nosocomial transmission, and changes in viral transmissibility, as well as diagnostic laboratory artifacts. Methods. Diagnostic results from Jeddah Regional Laboratory were analyzed. Viruses from the Jeddah outbreak and viruses occurring during the same time in Riyadh, Al-Kharj, and Madinah were fully or partially sequenced. A set of 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms distinctive to the Jeddah outbreak were determined from additional viruses. Viruses from Riyadh and Jeddah were isolated and studied in cell culture. Results. Up to 481 samples were received per day for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. A laboratory proficiency assessment suggested positive and negative results to be reliable. Forty-nine percent of 168 positive-testing samples during the Jeddah outbreak stemmed from King Fahd Hospital. All viruses from Jeddah were monophyletic and similar, whereas viruses from Riyadh were paraphyletic and diverse. A hospital-associated transmission cluster, to which cases in Indiana (United States) and the Netherlands belonged, was discovered in Riyadh. One Jeddah-type virus was found in Riyadh, with matching travel history to Jeddah. Virus isolates representing outbreaks in Jeddah and Riyadh were not different from MERS-CoV EMC/2012 in replication, escape of interferon response, or serum neutralization. Conclusions. Virus shedding and virus functions did not change significantly during the outbreak in Jeddah. These results suggest the outbreaks to have been caused by biologically unchanged viruses in connection with nosocomial transmission.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.030011227,0.06336080599999999,-0.021177055,-0.014066239,0.011858278,0.039899328,0.003797289,0.11262742699999999,0.067259019,0.010059754,0.025705537999999997,-0.005006885,-0.01162367,-0.011142319,0.045152199999999997,-0.011171305,-0.006653079,-0.030809088999999998,-0.022175222999999997,-0.016348038,0.018697613000000002,0.01873449,-0.031317292999999996,0.026162776000000002,-0.033724214,0.019057742,-0.001786096,0.015510317,-0.044060022000000004,-0.039228957
1411,Rational Design of Human Metapneumovirus Live Attenuated Vaccine Candidates by Inhibiting Viral mRNA Cap Methyltransferase,"The paramyxoviruses human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hPIV3) are responsible for the majority of pediatric respiratory diseases and inflict significant economic loss, health care costs, and emotional burdens. Despite major efforts, there are no vaccines available for these viruses. The conserved region VI (CR VI) of the large (L) polymerase proteins of paramyxoviruses catalyzes methyltransferase (MTase) activities that typically methylate viral mRNAs at positions guanine N-7 (G-N-7) and ribose 2′-O. In this study, we generated a panel of recombinant hMPVs carrying mutations in the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site in CR VI of L protein. These recombinant viruses were specifically defective in ribose 2′-O methylation but not G-N-7 methylation and were genetically stable and highly attenuated in cell culture and viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of cotton rats. Importantly, vaccination of cotton rats with these recombinant hMPVs (rhMPVs) with defective MTases triggered a high level of neutralizing antibody, and the rats were completely protected from challenge with wild-type rhMPV. Collectively, our results indicate that (i) amino acid residues in the SAM binding site in the hMPV L protein are essential for 2′-O methylation and (ii) inhibition of mRNA cap MTase can serve as a novel target to rationally design live attenuated vaccines for hMPV and perhaps other paramyxoviruses, such as hRSV and hPIV3. IMPORTANCE Human paramyxoviruses, including hRSV, hMPV, and hPIV3, cause the majority of acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in humans, particularly in infants, children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Currently, there is no licensed vaccine available. A formalin-inactivated vaccine is not suitable for these viruses because it causes enhanced lung damage upon reinfection with the same virus. A live attenuated vaccine is the most promising vaccine strategy for human paramyxoviruses. However, it remains a challenge to identify an attenuated virus strain that has an optimal balance between attenuation and immunogenicity. Using reverse genetics, we generated a panel of recombinant hMPVs that were specifically defective in ribose 2′-O methyltransferase (MTase) but not G-N-7 MTase. These MTase-defective hMPVs were genetically stable and sufficiently attenuated but retained high immunogenicity. This work highlights a critical role of 2′-O MTase in paramyxovirus replication and pathogenesis and a new avenue for the development of safe and efficacious live attenuated vaccines for hMPV and other human paramyxoviruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.009732217,-0.08032919,-0.04973189,0.032906411,-0.001105642,0.0016658060000000001,0.060258951,-0.07648618,0.11664549099999999,0.018376796,-0.028857442,-0.009464985,-0.038340048,-0.016160826,-0.050978224,-0.06357307400000001,-0.01745017,0.072578308,-0.11315230800000001,0.085508518,0.14252658,0.0060404840000000005,0.056506600000000004,0.0061622330000000005,0.035044687000000005,0.056673553,-0.12019014,-0.084077648,0.035139576,-0.068373591
1412,Sterile and Microbial-associated Intra-amniotic Inflammation in Preterm Prelabor Rupture of Membranes,"OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to: 1) determine the amniotic fluid (AF) microbiology of patients with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM); and 2) examine the relationship between intra-amniotic inflammation with and without microorganisms (sterile inflammation) and adverse pregnancy outcomes in patients with preterm PROM. METHODS: AF samples obtained from 59 women with preterm PROM were analyzed using cultivation techniques (for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria as well as genital mycoplasmas) and with broad-range polymerase chain reaction coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). AF concentration of interleukin-6 (IL-6) was determined using ELISA. Results of both tests were correlated with AF IL-6 concentrations, and the occurrence of adverse obstetrical/perinatal outcomes. RESULTS: 1) PCR/ESI-MS, AF culture, and the combination of these two tests, each identified microorganisms in 36% (21/59), 24% (14/59) and 41% (24/59) of women with preterm PROM, respectively; 2) the most frequent microorganisms found in the amniotic cavity were Sneathia species and Ureaplasma urealyticum; 3) the frequency of microbial-associated and sterile intra-amniotic inflammation was overall similar [ 29% (17/59)]: - however, the prevalence of each differed according to the gestational age when PROM occurred ; 4) the earlier the gestational age at preterm PROM, the higher the frequency of both microbial-associated and sterile intra-amniotic inflammation; 5) the intensity of the intra-amniotic inflammatory response against microorganisms is stronger when preterm PROM occurs early in pregnancy; and 6) the frequency of acute placental inflammation (histologic chorioamnionitis and/or funisitis) was significantly higher in patients with microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation than in those without intra-amniotic inflammation [93.3% (14/15) vs. 38% (6/16); p=0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: 1) The frequency of microorganisms in preterm PROM is 40% using both cultivation and PCR/ESI-MS; 2) PCR/ESI-MS identified microorganisms in the AF of 50% more women with preterm PROM than did AF culture; and 3) sterile intra-amniotic inflammation was present in 29% of these patients, and it was as or more common than microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation among those presenting after, but not before, 24 weeks of gestation.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.036385729,-0.0229533,0.004015402,-0.116284161,-0.034345747,-0.006038264000000001,0.009243972,0.011144646000000001,-0.050716190999999994,-0.009038185,-0.005470481,0.010347613,-0.026812135,-0.006117312,-0.003737908,0.033640442,0.015930916,-0.004907994000000001,-0.0029963140000000004,-0.079862851,0.008300233,-0.038331224,0.018756988,-0.024748582999999998,-0.00230534,-0.023668935,0.02297472,-0.015960601,0.00924823,-0.017191757
1413,Sterile Intra-amniotic Inflammation in Asymptomatic Patients with a Sonographic Short Cervix: Prevalence and Clinical Significance,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and clinical significance of sterile- and microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation in asymptomatic patients with a sonographic short cervix. METHODS: Amniotic fluid (AF) samples obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis from 231 asymptomatic women with a sonographic short cervix [cervical length (CL) ≤25 mm] were analyzed using cultivation techniques (for aerobic and anaerobic as well as genital mycoplasmas) and broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). The frequency and magnitude of intra-amniotic inflammation [defined as an AF interleukin (IL)-6 concentration ≥2.6 ng/mL], acute histologic placental inflammation, spontaneous preterm delivery, and the amniocentesis-to-delivery interval were examined according to the results of AF cultures, PCR/ESI-MS and AF IL-6 concentrations. RESULTS: Ten percent (24/231) of patients with a sonographic short cervix had sterile intra-amniotic inflammation (an elevated AF IL-6 concentration without evidence of microorganisms using cultivation and molecular methods). Sterile intra-amniotic inflammation was significantly more frequent than microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation [10.4% (24/231) vs. 2.2% (5/231); p<0.001]. Patients with sterile intra-amniotic inflammation had a significantly higher rate of spontaneous preterm delivery <34 weeks of gestation [70.8% (17/24) vs. 31.6% (55/174); p<0.001] and a significantly shorter amniocentesis-to-delivery interval than patients without intra-amniotic inflammation [median 35, (IQR: 10 – 70) vs. median 71, (IQR: 47 – 98) days, (p<0.0001)]. CONCLUSION: Sterile intra-amniotic inflammation is more common than microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation in asymptomatic women with a sonographic short cervix, and is associated with increased risk of spontaneous preterm delivery (<34 weeks). Further investigation is required to determine the causes of sterile intra-amniotic inflammation and the mechanisms whereby this condition is associated with a short cervix and spontaneous preterm delivery.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.02764667,-0.023857247,-0.001562999,-0.12356931,-0.043543634000000005,-0.006476195,0.008646975,0.011194438000000001,-0.043739562999999995,-0.017613968,-0.0031821320000000003,0.014664968,-0.034140077000000005,-0.00042177,-0.008050917,0.038366355,0.0019290210000000002,-0.010850041000000001,-0.001216621,-0.075014223,0.0039224540000000006,-0.047894014000000006,0.005535465,-0.021952117,-0.016444207,-0.026456466,0.023666819,-0.014827287,0.0026417309999999996,-0.019778342
1425,"Preclinical Characterization of BMS-791325, an Allosteric Inhibitor of Hepatitis C Virus NS5B Polymerase","BMS-791325 is an allosteric inhibitor that binds to thumb site 1 of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. BMS-791325 inhibits recombinant NS5B proteins from HCV genotypes 1, 3, 4, and 5 at 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) below 28 nM. In cell culture, BMS-791325 inhibited replication of HCV subgenomic replicons representing genotypes 1a and 1b at 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) of 3 nM and 6 nM, respectively, with similar (3 to 18 nM) values for genotypes 3a, 4a, and 5a. Potency against genotype 6a showed more variability (9 to 125 nM), and activity was weaker against genotype 2 (EC(50), 87 to 925 nM). Specificity was demonstrated by the absence of activity (EC(50)s of >4 μM) against a panel of mammalian viruses, and cytotoxic concentrations (50%) were >3,000-fold above the HCV EC(50). Resistance substitutions selected by BMS-791325 in genotype 1 replicons mostly mapped to a single site, NS5B amino acid 495 (P495A/S/L/T). Additive or synergistic activity was observed in combination studies using BMS-791325 with alfa interferon plus ribavirin, inhibitors of NS3 protease or NS5A, and other classes of NS5B inhibitor (palm site 2-binding or nucleoside analogs). Plasma and liver exposures in vivo in several animal species indicated that BMS-791325 has a hepatotropic disposition (liver-to-plasma ratios ranging from 1.6- to 60-fold across species). Twenty-four hours postdose, liver exposures across all species tested were ≥10-fold above the inhibitor EC(50)s observed with HCV genotype 1 replicons. These findings support the evaluation of BMS-791325 in combination regimens for the treatment of HCV.

1435,A Novel Molecular Microbiologic Technique for the Rapid Diagnosis of Microbial Invasion of the Amniotic Cavity and Intra-Amniotic Infection in Preterm Labor with Intact Membranes,"OBJECTIVE: The major challenges in using amniotic fluid (AF) cultivation techniques to diagnose microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC) are: 1) several days are typically required to obtain results, and 2) many organisms implicated in the pathogenesis of human disease are difficult to culture. Here, we compare the performance of AF culture with a novel technique for the diagnosis of MIAC that can provide results within eight hours by combining broad-range real-time polymerase chain reaction with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) to identify and quantify genomic material from bacteria and viruses in AF. METHODS: AF samples obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis from 142 women with preterm labor (PTL) and intact membranes were analyzed using cultivation techniques (aerobic, anaerobic and genital mycoplasmas) as well as PCR/ESI-MS. The prevalence and relative magnitude of intra-amniotic inflammation [AF Interleukin 6 (IL-6) concentration ≥ 2.6 ng/mL], acute histologic chorioamnionitis, spontaneous preterm delivery, and perinatal mortality were examined according to the results of these two tests. RESULTS: 1) The prevalence of MIAC in patients with preterm labor and intact membranes was 7% using standard cultivation techniques and 12% using PCR/ESI-MS; 2) seven of ten patients with positive AF culture also had positive PCR/ESI-MS [≥17 genome equivalents per PCR reaction well (GE/well)] 3) patients with positive PCR/ESI-MS (≥17 GE/well) and negative AF cultures had significantly higher rates of intra-amniotic inflammation and histologic acute chorioamnionitis, shorter intervals to delivery [median (interquartile range-IQR)], and offspring at higher risk of perinatal mortality, than women with both tests negative [90% (9/10) vs. 32% (39/122); (p<0.001); 70% (7/10) vs. 35% (39/112); (p=0.04); 1 (IQR: <1 – 2) days vs. 25 (IQR: 5 – 51) days; (p=0.002); OR: 5.6; 95% CI: 1.4 – 22, respectively]; 5) there were no significant differences in these factors between patients with positive PCR/ESI-MS (≥17 GE/well) who had negative AF cultures compared to those with positive AF cultures; and 6) PCR/ESI-MS detected genomic material from viruses in two patients (1.4%). CONCLUSION: 1) Rapid diagnosis of intra-amniotic infection is possible using PCR/ESI-MS, which can provide results within 8 hours; 2) the combined use of biomarkers of inflammation and PCR/ESI-MS allows for the rapid identification of specific bacteria and viruses in women with preterm labor and intra-amniotic infection; and 3) this approach may allow for administration of timely and specific interventions to reduce morbidity attributed to infection-induced preterm birth.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.071944656,-0.0009702469999999999,0.050477062999999996,-0.075045545,-0.033960459,-0.02037902,-0.005352029,0.032673787,-0.075925457,0.018972387,0.0042621740000000005,0.001143077,0.00015693,0.029847071,0.000327788,0.01783052,0.019668226,-0.0058502319999999995,0.004255622,-0.101207793,-0.005609028,-0.015089778,0.033383591000000004,-0.052790303,-0.034549948,-0.027053115,0.021879887,-0.057333999000000004,-0.018956413999999998,-0.017518168
1437,Molecular detection and genetic characterization of kobuviruses and astroviruses in asymptomatic local pigs in East Africa,"In this study, swine fecal specimens (n = 251) collected from nursing and weaned piglets raised under smallholder production systems were screened for the presence of kobuviruses by RT-PCR. Porcine kobuviruses were detected in 13.1 % (33/251) of the samples. We demonstrated that porcine kobuvirus infections exist in indigenous pigs in Kenya and Uganda and that the prevalence was higher in young piglets than older pigs: nursing piglets (15 %), post-weaning (3-month-old) pigs (17 %), 4-month-old pigs (10 %). Genetic analysis of the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region (690 nt) revealed that kobuviruses circulating in East Africa are diverse, sharing nucleotide sequence identities ranging from 89.7 to 99.1 % and 88 to 92.3 % among them and with known porcine kobuviruses, respectively. The nucleotide sequence identities between our kobuvirus strains and those of human, bovine and canine kobuviruses were 69.4-70.7 %, 73.1-74.4 % and 67-70.7 %, respectively. Additionally, upon sequencing selected samples that showed consistent 720-bp RT-PCR bands while using the same primer set, we detected porcine astroviruses in our samples belonging to type 2 and type 3 mamastroviruses. To our knowledge, this study reports the first detection and molecular analysis of both porcine kobuviruses and astroviruses in an African region. Further studies are required to determine the role of these viruses in gastrointestinal infections of pigs in this region and to determine the genetic diversity of the circulating strains to develop accurate diagnostic tools and implement appropriate control strategies.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.025526623,0.002198538,0.109812312,-0.032354459,0.15383179800000002,-0.009913733000000001,-0.002099511,-0.000330395,-0.032137032999999995,-0.009480738,0.064714005,0.08146881,-0.094506405,0.009947275,0.140750652,-0.144339102,-0.006295566999999999,-0.001128777,-0.008974399000000001,0.010825298999999998,-0.000584359,0.013557042,0.017731208999999998,0.027722994,0.022145027999999997,-0.043674045999999994,-0.00693059,-0.018556418,0.032887806,0.007774075
1444,Viral Pathogens and Acute Lung Injury: Investigations Inspired by the SARS Epidemic and the 2009 H1N1 Influenza Pandemic,"Acute viral pneumonia is an important cause of acute lung injury (ALI), although not enough is known about the exact incidence of viral infection in ALI. Polymerase chain reaction-based assays, direct fluorescent antigen (DFA) assays, and viral cultures can detect viruses in samples from the human respiratory tract, but the presence of the virus does not prove it to be a pathogen, nor does it give information regarding the interaction of viruses with the host immune response and bacterial flora of the respiratory tract. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic provided a better understanding of how viral pathogens mediate lung injury. Although the viruses initially infect the respiratory epithelium, the relative role of epithelial damage and endothelial dysfunction has not been well defined. The inflammatory host immune response to H1N1 infection is a major contributor to lung injury. The SARS coronavirus causes lung injury and inflammation in part through actions on the nonclassical renin angiotensin pathway. The lessons learned from the pandemic outbreaks of SARS coronavirus and H1N1 capture key principles of virally mediated ALI. There are pathogen-specific pathways underlying virally mediated ALI that converge onto a common end pathway resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. In terms of therapy, lung protective ventilation is the cornerstone of supportive care. There is little evidence that corticosteroids are beneficial, and they might be harmful. Future therapeutic strategies may be targeted to specific pathogens, the pathogenetic pathways in the host immune response, or enhancing repair and regeneration of tissue damage.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.058929339000000004,0.055113557,-0.086198538,0.015346038999999999,-0.073413359,0.08936705,0.01924179,-0.103497866,-0.012376703999999999,0.03543291,-0.04251926,-0.047091692000000004,0.062308732,0.03459707,0.036235712999999996,-0.017488456,-0.018339268,-0.044260657,-0.04976424,0.022578665,0.027604155,-0.016441815,-0.044940548,-0.00116788,-0.02254985,-0.027034577999999997,-0.051026195,0.026898127999999997,0.037527537,-0.070848303
1446,Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Gene Expression in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"Although most cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occur in smokers, only a fraction of smokers develop the disease. We hypothesized distinct molecular signatures for COPD and emphysema in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of current and former smokers. To test this hypothesis, we identified and validated PBMC gene expression profiles in smokers with and without COPD. We generated expression data on 136 subjects from the COPDGene study, using Affymetrix U133 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Multiple linear regression with adjustment for covariates (gender, age, body mass index, family history, smoking status, and pack-years) was used to identify candidate genes, and ingenuity pathway analysis was used to identify candidate pathways. Candidate genes were validated in 149 subjects according to multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, which included 75 subjects not previously profiled. Pathways that were differentially expressed in subjects with COPD and emphysema included those that play a role in the immune system, inflammatory responses, and sphingolipid (ceramide) metabolism. Twenty-six of the 46 candidate genes (e.g., FOXP1, TCF7, and ASAH1) were validated in the independent cohort. Plasma metabolomics was used to identify a novel glycoceramide (galabiosylceramide) as a biomarker of emphysema, supporting the genomic association between acid ceramidase (ASAH1) and emphysema. COPD is a systemic disease whose gene expression signatures in PBMCs could serve as novel diagnostic or therapeutic targets.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.015335173999999998,-0.019324646,0.018342359,-0.125331526,-0.051949947,0.033881193,0.014664847,-0.020612943999999998,0.027105712999999997,-0.017565292,-0.081356312,-0.047577010999999995,0.027602223,0.013963325,-0.03512571,-0.013134328999999998,-0.019586981,-0.04021224,-0.037080504,-0.068600665,0.04458677900000001,-0.048485552,0.004749571,0.016229487,-0.056562086,-0.025604185,0.044958314000000006,0.021144202999999997,0.046494587999999996,0.028392359
1451,Prevention of influenza at Hajj: applications for mass gatherings,"Outbreaks of infectious diseases that spread via respiratory route, e.g. influenza, are common amongst Hajj congregation in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Arabian authority successfully organized the Hajj 2009 amidst fear of pandemic influenza. While severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was rare, the true burden of pandemic influenza at Hajj that year remains speculative. In this article we review the latest evidence on influenza control and discuss our experience of influenza and its prevention at Hajj and possible application to other mass gatherings. Depending on study design the attack rate of seasonal influenza at Hajj has ranged from 6% in polymerase chain reaction or culture confirmed studies to 38% in serological surveillance. No significant effect of influenza vaccine or the use of personal protective measures against influenza has been established from observational studies, although the uptake of the vaccine and adherence to face masks and hand hygiene has been low. In all, there is a relatively poor evidence base for control of influenza. Until better evidence is obtained, vaccination coupled with rapid antiviral treatment of symptomatic individuals remains the mainstay of prevention at Hajj and other mass gatherings. Hajj pilgrimage provides a unique opportunity to test the effectiveness of various preventive measures that require a large sample size, such as testing the efficacy of plain surgical masks against laboratory-confirmed influenza. After successful completion of a pilot trial conducted among Australian pilgrims at the 2011 Hajj, a large multinational cluster randomized controlled trial is being planned.

1454,"1918 Influenza Virus Hemagglutinin (HA) and the Viral RNA Polymerase Complex Enhance Viral Pathogenicity, but Only HA Induces Aberrant Host Responses in Mice","The 1918 pandemic influenza virus was the most devastating infectious agent in human history, causing fatal pneumonia and an estimated 20 to 50 million deaths worldwide. Previous studies indicated a prominent role of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene in efficient replication and high virulence of the 1918 virus in mice. It is, however, still unclear whether the high replication ability or the 1918 influenza virus HA gene is required for 1918 virus to exhibit high virulence in mice. Here, we examined the biological properties of reassortant viruses between the 1918 virus and a contemporary human H1N1 virus (A/Kawasaki/173/2001 [K173]) in a mouse model. In addition to the 1918 influenza virus HA, we demonstrated the role of the viral RNA replication complex in efficient replication of viruses in mouse lungs, whereas only the HA gene is responsible for lethality in mice. Global gene expression profiling of infected mouse lungs revealed that the 1918 influenza virus HA was sufficient to induce transcriptional changes similar to those induced by the 1918 virus, despite difference in lymphocyte gene expression. Increased expression of genes associated with the acute-phase response and the protein ubiquitination pathway were enriched during infections with the 1918 and 1918HA/K173 viruses, whereas reassortant viruses bearing the 1918 viral RNA polymerase complex induced transcriptional changes similar to those seen with the K173 virus. Taken together, these data suggest that HA and the viral RNA polymerase complex are critical determinants of Spanish influenza pathogenesis, but only HA, and not the viral RNA polymerase complex and NP, is responsible for extreme host responses observed in mice infected with the 1918 influenza virus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.061546442,-0.09381994,-0.038504228,0.084121116,-0.03438701,0.157150281,-0.05119555,-0.025117496,0.010432747,-0.022857227999999997,-0.017027399,-0.044879912,0.0021426089999999997,0.063177948,0.010352849,0.016536563,0.00257523,-0.05839253900000001,-0.033656204,0.033072708,0.037554472,0.0072751180000000006,0.010833721000000001,0.046732292,-0.037190627000000004,0.002968127,0.0037445029999999997,-0.009171277,-0.02672951,-0.012083123000000001
1455,The PA-Gene-Mediated Lethal Dissemination and Excessive Innate Immune Response Contribute to the High Virulence of H5N1 Avian Influenza Virus in Mice,"Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus remains a substantial threat to public health. To understand the molecular basis and host mechanism for the high virulence of H5N1 viruses in mammals, we compared two H5N1 isolates which have similar genetic backgrounds but greatly differ in their virulence in mice. A/Chicken/Jiangsu/k0402/2010 (CK10) is highly pathogenic, whereas A/Goose/Jiangsu/k0403/2010 (GS10) is nonpathogenic. We first showed that CK10 elicited a more potent innate immune response than did GS10 in mouse lungs by increasing the number and expression levels of activated genes. We then generated a series of reassortants between the two viruses and evaluated their virulence in mice. Inclusion of the CK10 PA gene in the GS10 background resulted in a dramatic increase in virulence. Conversely, expression of the GS10 PA gene in the CK10 background significantly attenuated the virulence. These results demonstrated that the PA gene mainly determines the pathogenicity discrepancy between CK10 and GS10 in mice. We further determined that arginine (R) at position 353 of the PA gene contributes to the high virulence of CK10 in mice. The reciprocal substitution at position 353 in PA or the exchange of the entire PA gene largely caused the transfer of viral phenotypes, including virus replication, polymerase activity, and manipulation of the innate response, between CK10 and GS10. We therefore defined a novel molecular marker associated with the high virulence of H5N1 influenza viruses, providing further insights into the pathogenesis of H5N1 viruses in mammals.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.05950379099999999,-0.060917327,-0.002292324,-0.012600181,-0.014056085,0.166154928,-0.005304419,-0.025474532999999997,0.04181961,-0.005791434,-0.047176000999999995,-0.033585013,-0.008857236999999999,0.040573363,-0.013427743999999998,-0.009529227,-0.021189991000000002,-0.057839809000000006,-0.049220473,-0.00423617,0.072587279,-0.0038319870000000002,0.023610104,0.08650913800000001,-0.065748842,0.00013825,0.05120331400000001,-0.008128761,-0.00145766,-0.039310278
1457,An investigation into the association between cpb2-encoding Clostridium perfringens type A and diarrhea in neonatal piglets,"To investigate the possible role of cpb2-positive type A Clostridium perfringens in neonatal diarrheal illness in pigs, the jejunum and colon of matched normal and diarrheic piglets from 10 farms with a history of neonatal diarrhea were examined grossly and by histopathology, and tested for C. perfringens, for C. perfringens beta2 (CPB2) toxin, as well as for Clostridium difficile toxins, Salmonella, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, rotavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus, and coccidia. Clostridium perfringens isolates were tested using a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine the presence of cpa, consensus and atypical cpb2, and other virulence-associated genes. The numbers of C. perfringens in the intestinal contents were lower in diarrheic piglets (log(10) 5.4 CFU/g) compared with normal piglets (log(10) 6.5 CFU/g) (P < 0.05). The consensus cpb2 was present in 93% of isolates in each group, but atypical cpb2 was less common (56% healthy, 32% diarrheic piglets isolates, respectively, P < 0.05). The presence of CPB2 toxin in the intestinal contents of normal and diarrheic piglets did not differ significantly. Clostridium difficile toxins and rotavirus were each detected in 7 of the 21 (33%) diarrheic piglets. Rotavirus, C. difficile toxins, Salmonella, or enterotoxigenic E. coli were concurrently recovered in different combinations in 4 diarrheic piglets. The cause of diarrhea in 8 of the 21 (38%) piglets on 6 farms remained unknown. The etiological diagnosis of diarrhea could not be determined in any of the piglets on 2 of the farms. This study demonstrated that the number of cpb2-positive type A C. perfringens in the intestinal contents was not a useful approach for making a diagnosis of type A C. perfringens enteritis in piglets. Further work is required to confirm whether cpb2-carrying type A C. perfringens have a pathogenic role in enteric infection in neonatal swine.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.005806062,-0.015832747,0.056285113,-0.119038436,0.020296559,0.025494855,0.007761603000000001,-0.016963103,-0.01289827,-0.017503225,0.025476067999999998,0.048678932,-0.077721535,-0.010290740999999999,0.10365872400000001,-0.055761064000000006,-0.016943293,-0.005819035,-0.000730937,-0.007914771,0.00047843800000000003,0.007178832,-0.006304308000000001,-0.003149984,0.024652922999999997,-0.048798842,-0.036287955,-0.023603132000000002,0.0069588359999999995,-0.023798927

Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 7(Suppl. 1), 76–80. Antiviral drugs continue to be an important option for the treatment of influenza disease and will likely be the only option during the early phases of pandemic. However, the limited number of drug classes licensed for treatment of influenza raises several issues, particularly in the face of drug resistance. Two classes of drugs are presently licensed for treatment of influenza, M2 and neuraminidase inhibitors. M2 inhibitors are currently not recommended for treatment of influenza because of widespread resistance and resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has been observed during the past influenza seasonal outbreaks. Additional antiviral drugs with novel mechanisms of action are clearly needed for the treatment of influenza. Fortunately, the landscape of drugs in early and advanced development has dramatically increased over the last 5 years. Drugs targeting viral functions such as attachment, entry/fusion, transcription, and polymerase and drugs targeting host factors affecting viral replication are currently in clinical trials. Examples of these novel antiviral drugs and the challenges for influenza antiviral drug development are discussed in this article.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.02716617,-0.088167257,-0.06143958,0.17700288600000003,-0.153526889,0.385872327,-0.011773301000000002,0.005228834,0.030807416,-0.023674826,0.015270322,0.046161587999999996,0.06524969,-0.031033473,-0.002442924,-0.0029817479999999998,-0.039661319,0.17092853100000002,0.048682622,0.045624909000000005,-0.012744581000000001,0.044270730999999994,-0.076540568,0.076372845,0.037922153,-0.0016146,0.045261857,-0.084362702,0.178211581,0.05775074400000001
1460,Targeting virulence mechanisms for the prevention and therapy of arenaviral hemorrhagic fever,"A number of arenaviruses are pathogenic for humans, but they differ significantly in virulence. Lassa virus, found in West Afri ca, causes severe hemorrhagic fever (HF), while the other principal Old World arenavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, causes mild illness in persons with normal immune function, and poses a threat only to immunocompromised individuals. The New World agents, including Junin, Machupo and Sabia virus, are highly pathogenic for humans. Arenaviral HF is characterized by high viremia and general immune suppression, the mechanism of which is unknown. Studies using viral reverse genetics, cell-based assays, animal models and human genome-wide association analysis have revealed potential mechanisms by which arenaviruses cause severe disease in humans. Each of the four viral gene products (GPC, L polymerase, NP, and Z matrix protein) and several host-cell factors (e.g., α-dystroglycan) are responsible for mediating viral entry, genome replication, and the inhibition of apoptosis, translation and interferon-beta (IFNβ) production. This review summarizes current knowledge of the role of each viral protein and host factor in the pathogenesis of arenaviral HF.

1466,The potential anticancer activity of extracts derived from the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis on human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells,"Various herb products derived from plants have potent biological effects including anticancer activity. In the present study, the antitumor activity of a herbal product derived from the Scutellaria baicalensis (S. baicalensis) was examined, using in vitro assays in a human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell line. Results showed that S. baicalensis root extract at the concentration of 100 μg/ml inhibited monolayer- and anchorage-independent growth in human OSCC cell lines, while not affecting the adhering abilities of cells. This suggested that it did not alter the expression of any of the adhesion receptors that mediate cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. The S. baicalensis root extract demonstrated potent cytostatic and apoptotic effects due to the downregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 expression and its partner cyclin D1, resulting in G1 arrest and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Additionally, the S. baicalensis root extract was found to have blocked vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced migration and tube formation in human endothelial cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that as a herbal product, the S. baicalensis root extract is a potential inhibitor of tumori- and angiogenesis and may be valuable in the development of pharmaceutical medications for the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.098173397,-0.033117189,-0.0037107459999999996,-0.091722279,-0.10411949699999999,0.06630048200000001,0.049817703,-0.052707309,0.078819314,-0.032964906,-0.06615189099999999,-0.016595405,-0.003741859,0.09479909800000001,-0.012582427,0.005879949000000001,0.008009196,-0.014356658999999999,0.028141862000000004,-0.041850946,0.031899346,-0.007013288,0.048134974000000004,-0.0013739770000000002,0.001975195,0.041708999999999996,-0.029690645,0.057642555,-0.001444409,-0.059815732999999996
1468,S1 gene sequence analysis of new variant isolates of avian infectious bronchitis virus in Tunisia,"PURPOSE: Tissue samples were collected from suspected broiler flocks showing respiratory signs to identify infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), characterize emerging field strains, and study their relationships with the Massachusetts H120 strain, the only IB vaccine used in Tunisia. SAMPLES AND METHODS: Several IBV isolates were identified from field samples collected from flocks located in different regions in the northeast of Tunisia. The IBV isolates were characterized and compared to commonly used vaccine strains (including 793B, D274, and H120 types), other reference IBV strains from Europe, and the recently characterized Tunisian field variants TN20/00, TN200/01, and TN335/01. Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing analyses of the hypervariable regions of the S1 gene were carried out. RESULTS: Four new IBV variants were isolated during the period 2007–10 and were designated TN295/07, TN296/07, TN556/07, and TN557/07. The amino acid sequence data showed 100% similarity between TN295/07 and TN296/07, suggesting that these two isolates are identical and belong to the same genotype. Similar results were demonstrated for TN556/07 and TN557/07. Sequence identity values indicated that TN296/07 and TN556/07 share 55% amino acid homologies between each other, but are very different from the reference IBV serotypes, in particular the H120 strain. It was also shown that they have 50%–77% similarities with the Tunisian virus isolated between 2000 and 2001. Phylogenetic clustering allowed classification of these Tunisian isolates as new genotypes that are closer to TN200/01, TN335/01 Tunisian field variants, and Italy02 variant than MassH120 vaccine strain. CONCLUSION: S1 sequence analyses confirmed the cocirculation of H120 vaccine strain with novel IBV variants isolated from Tunisian field.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.052141922,-0.020066208999999998,0.091556444,-0.137739732,0.19968606600000002,0.092243516,-0.145611275,-0.081313837,0.07918805599999999,0.25475204100000004,0.055027515,0.083629877,-0.09411040300000001,-0.03785577,-0.091758046,0.064575445,-0.033449123,0.014799516,0.022072511,0.033933705,0.010063052,-0.008402748,0.013839323,0.017975809,0.014932458999999999,-0.012131913999999999,-0.002091752,0.018572421999999998,0.005534395,0.030656824
1469,Cyclophilin Involvement in the Replication of Hepatitis C Virus and Other Viruses,"In recent months there has been a wealth of promising clinical data suggesting that a more effective treatment regimen, and potentially a cure, for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is close at hand. Leading this push are direct acting antivirals (DAAs), currently comprised of inhibitors that target the HCV protease NS3, viral polymerase NS5B and the nonstructural protein NS5A. In combination with one another, along with the traditional standard of care ribavirin and PEGylated-IFNα, these compounds have proven to afford tremendous efficacy to treatment-naïve patients, as well as to prior non-responders. Nevertheless, by targeting viral components the possibility of selecting for breakthrough and treatment-resistant virus strains remains a concern. Host-targeting antivirals (HTAs) are a distinct class of anti-HCV compounds that is emerging as a complementary set of tools to combat the disease. Cyclophilin (Cyp) inhibitors are one such group in this category. In contrast to DAAs, Cyp inhibitors target a host protein, CypA, and have also demonstrated remarkable antiviral efficiency in clinical trials, without the generation of viral escape mutants. This review serves to summarize the current literature on cyclophilins and their relationship to the HCV viral life cycle, as well as other viruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.074113734,-0.04846721,-0.050723316,0.0070362409999999995,-0.15859943,0.092234532,0.109364956,0.014407943000000001,0.045567772,0.082568362,-0.01693452,0.054044031,0.069573042,0.027645983,-0.032111401,-0.079104841,0.00883798,0.31578836600000004,0.274068467,-0.015911207,-0.068566232,0.019327072,-0.0037634709999999996,0.11030399699999999,-0.004700330999999999,-0.054068118,0.035724193,-0.036144702,-0.01441443,0.007047149
1472,"Isolation and Characterization of a Novel Betacoronavirus Subgroup A Coronavirus, Rabbit Coronavirus HKU14, from Domestic Rabbits","We describe the isolation and characterization of a novel Betacoronavirus subgroup A coronavirus, rabbit coronavirus HKU14 (RbCoV HKU14), from domestic rabbits. The virus was detected in 11 (8.1%) of 136 rabbit fecal samples by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), with a viral load of up to 10(8) copies/ml. RbCoV HKU14 was able to replicate in HRT-18G and RK13 cells with cytopathic effects. Northern blotting confirmed the production of subgenomic mRNAs coding for the HE, S, NS5a, E, M, and N proteins. Subgenomic mRNA analysis revealed a transcription regulatory sequence, 5′-UCUAAAC-3′. Phylogenetic analysis showed that RbCoV HKU14 formed a distinct branch among Betacoronavirus subgroup A coronaviruses, being most closely related to but separate from the species Betacoronavirus 1. A comparison of the conserved replicase domains showed that RbCoV HKU14 possessed <90% amino acid identities to most members of Betacoronavirus 1 in ADP-ribose 1″-phosphatase (ADRP) and nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU), indicating that RbCoV HKU14 should represent a separate species. RbCoV HKU14 also possessed genomic features distinct from those of other Betacoronavirus subgroup A coronaviruses, including a unique NS2a region with a variable number of small open reading frames (ORFs). Recombination analysis revealed possible recombination events during the evolution of RbCoV HKU14 and members of Betacoronavirus 1, which may have occurred during cross-species transmission. Molecular clock analysis using RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes dated the most recent common ancestor of RbCoV HKU14 to around 2002, suggesting that this virus has emerged relatively recently. Antibody against RbCoV was detected in 20 (67%) of 30 rabbit sera tested by an N-protein-based Western blot assay, whereas neutralizing antibody was detected in 1 of these 20 rabbits.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.088037244,0.003987508,0.017168472,-0.028936021,0.096759775,-0.0010468160000000001,0.02246032,0.009587888000000001,-0.019089427,-0.038203656,-0.025777183,-0.000776074,-0.00354176,-0.004050817,-0.014990119,-0.022649619,0.023979692,0.005070393,-0.006253349,-0.010157408,0.006642861,-0.002670775,-0.006288942,-0.009396028,0.00012953299999999998,0.01505445,0.023531113,0.010963023999999998,-0.009136670999999999,0.009630610999999999
1477,Presence of Viral Nucleic Acids in the Middle Ear: Acute Otitis Media Pathogen or Bystander?,"Viruses play an important role in acute otitis media (AOM) pathogenesis and live viruses may cause AOM in absence of pathogenic bacteria. Detection of AOM pathogens generally relies on bacterial culture of middle ear fluid. When viral culture is used and live viruses are detected in the middle ear fluid of children with AOM, the viruses are generally accepted as AOM pathogens. Because viral culture is not sensitive and does not detect the comprehensive spectrum of respiratory viruses, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are commonly used to detect viral nucleic acids in the middle ear fluid. While PCR assays have greatly increased the viral detection rate, new questions arise on the significance of viral nucleic acids detected in the middle ear because nucleic acids of multiple viruses are detected simultaneously, and nucleic acids of specific viruses are detected repeatedly and in a high proportion of asymptomatic children. This article first reviews the role of live viruses in AOM and presents the point-counter point arguments on whether viral nucleic acids in the middle ear represent an AOM pathogen or a bystander status.

1478,Detection of Infectious Influenza Virus in Cough Aerosols Generated in a Simulated Patient Examination Room,"BACKGROUND: The potential for aerosol transmission of infectious influenza virus (ie, in healthcare facilities) is controversial. We constructed a simulated patient examination room that contained coughing and breathing manikins to determine whether coughed influenza was infectious and assessed the effectiveness of an N95 respirator and surgical mask in blocking transmission. METHODS: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health aerosol samplers collected size-fractionated aerosols for 60 minutes at the mouth of the breathing manikin, beside the mouth, and at 3 other locations in the room. Total recovered virus was quantitated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and infectivity was determined by the viral plaque assay and an enhanced infectivity assay. RESULTS: Infectious influenza was recovered in all aerosol fractions (5.0% in >4 µm aerodynamic diameter, 75.5% in 1–4 µm, and 19.5% in <1 µm; n = 5). Tightly sealing a mask to the face blocked entry of 94.5% of total virus and 94.8% of infectious virus (n = 3). A tightly sealed respirator blocked 99.8% of total virus and 99.6% of infectious virus (n = 3). A poorly fitted respirator blocked 64.5% of total virus and 66.5% of infectious virus (n = 3). A mask documented to be loosely fitting by a PortaCount fit tester, to simulate how masks are worn by healthcare workers, blocked entry of 68.5% of total virus and 56.6% of infectious virus (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: These results support a role for aerosol transmission and represent the first reported laboratory study of the efficacy of masks and respirators in blocking inhalation of influenza in aerosols. The results indicate that a poorly fitted respirator performs no better than a loosely fitting mask.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.025587053,-0.038090522,0.021451257999999997,0.025467126,-0.018672427,0.151612473,-0.05376796,0.008455525,0.012443992,-0.0027544590000000003,0.02850627,-0.028912133,-0.008850049,-0.010365883000000001,0.040275104,0.035497588,-0.011071707,-0.015595521000000001,0.012177848,0.010190869,-0.020087591999999998,-0.013824898,0.010774104,-0.025501497,-0.006595219,0.04765898,0.008325200999999999,0.010961295,-0.049537447000000005,0.006160997
1483,Arterivirus and Nairovirus Ovarian Tumor Domain-Containing Deubiquitinases Target Activated RIG-I To Control Innate Immune Signaling,"The innate immune response constitutes the first line of defense against viral infection and is extensively regulated through ubiquitination. The removal of ubiquitin from innate immunity signaling factors by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) therefore provides a potential opportunity for viruses to evade this host defense system. It was previously found that specific proteases encoded by the unrelated arteri- and nairoviruses resemble the ovarian tumor domain-containing (OTU) family of DUBs. In arteriviruses, this domain has been characterized before as a papain-like protease (PLP2) that is also involved in replicase polyprotein processing. In nairoviruses, the DUB resides in the polymerase protein but is not essential for RNA replication. Using both in vitro and cell-based assays, we now show that PLP2 DUB activity is conserved in all members of the arterivirus family and that both arteri- and nairovirus DUBs inhibit RIG-I-mediated innate immune signaling when overexpressed. The potential relevance of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling for the innate immune response against arterivirus infection is supported by our finding that in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the production of beta interferon primarily depends on the recognition of arterivirus RNA by the pattern-recognition receptor MDA5. Interestingly, we also found that both arteri- and nairovirus DUBs inhibit RIG-I ubiquitination upon overexpression, suggesting that both MDA5 and RIG-I have a role in countering infection by arteriviruses. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that arteri- and nairoviruses employ their deubiquitinating potential to inactivate cellular proteins involved in RLR-mediated innate immune signaling, as exemplified by the deubiquitination of RIG-I.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.119756109,-0.037051901,-0.033185671,-0.035029171,-0.076626122,0.033804693999999996,0.05205252900000001,-0.018424522,0.047672654,-0.011143742,-0.037595842000000004,-0.011401917,0.001699995,0.045555437000000004,-0.02836172,-0.014401821,0.039378692,-0.048366184000000007,-0.025304708999999998,0.0075874919999999995,-0.0035966690000000003,0.021529278,-0.024831614,-0.036604667,0.025082478999999998,0.016641236,-0.006094673,0.0036386340000000004,0.00142521,-0.045146387
1485,VP-1 Quasispecies in Human Infection with Polyomavirus BK,"Polyomavirus BK is a recognized cause of nephropathy and hemorrhagic cystitis in kidney or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. This study explored a role of genetic variations in capsid protein VP-1 gene as a factor in viral pathogenesis. VP-1 was amplified from 7 healthy subjects with viruria, 7 transplant patients with viruria, and 11 patients with viremia or nephropathy. PCR products were cloned and a total of 558 clonal sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analysis using standard methods. VP-1 quasispecies were found in 25/25 and coinfection with different genotypes in 12/ 25 subjects. Genotype II was found as an unexpected minority species in 5/25 individuals. Recombinant strains of uncertain biologic significance, which frequently contained genotype II and IV sequences were identified in 9/25 subjects. Viremia/nephropathy group was characterized by (a) greater sequence complexity in whole VP-1 versus BC loop and BC loop compared to the HI loop, (b) greater intra-strain genetic diversity in the BC loop compared to whole VP-1 protein and HI loop, (c) more non-synonymous substitutions (dN) in the BC loop compared to whole VP-1 and HI loop, (e) fewer synonymous substitutions (dS) compared to healthy-viruria group, and (f) selection pressure (dN/dS >1.0) exerted on VP-1. In conclusion, this study documents frequent occurrence of quasispecies in a host DNA polymerase dependent virus which is theoretically expected to show high replication fidelity. Quasispecies occur even in healthy subjects with viruria, but evolutionary selection pressure directed at the viral capsid protein VP-1 is seen only in patients with viremia.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.039866191,-0.039006038,-0.002683074,-0.08977950300000001,0.021238565,-0.010806026000000002,0.000346069,0.016878848000000002,-0.046533458,-0.0061225130000000004,-0.031475642000000005,0.02874625,-0.012312553,0.010118064,-0.047287438,-0.0056934080000000005,0.010106376,-0.000317461,-0.042220874000000005,-0.001226588,0.018753591,-0.05395364,-0.027618597999999998,0.08539138800000001,-0.02305638,-0.031284188,-0.003186998,-0.012977094,-0.044891364,0.024889841
1487,Mechanism of Glycyrrhizic Acid Inhibition of Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus: Disruption of CTCF-Cohesin-Mediated RNA Polymerase II Pausing and Sister Chromatid Cohesion,"Glycyrrhizic acid (GA), a derivative of licorice, selectively inhibits the growth of lymphocytes latently infected with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. The mechanism involves the deregulation of the multicistronic latency transcript, including the failure to generate the mature forms of viral mRNA encoding LANA. We show here that GA disrupts an RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complex that accumulates at the CTCF-cohesin binding site within the first intron of the latency transcript. GA altered the enrichment of the RNAPII pausing complex, along with pausing factors SPT5 and NELF-A, at the intragenic CTCF-cohesin binding sites. GA blocked the interaction of cohesin subunit SMC3 with another cohesin subunit, RAD21, and reduced SPT5 interaction with RNAPII. Covalent coupling of GA to a solid support revealed that GA interacts with several cellular proteins, including SMC3 and SPT5, but not their respective interaction partners RAD21 and RNAPII. GA treatment also inhibited the transcription of some cellular genes, like c-myc, which contain a similar CTCF-cohesin binding site within the first intron. We also found that GA leads to a more general loss of sister chromatid cohesion for cellular chromosomes.

We conducted a molecular epidemiology study to investigate different genotypes and potential recombination in HCoV-OC43. Twenty-nine HCoV-OC43 strains from nasopharyngeal aspirates, collected from 2004 to 2011, were subjected to RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike, and nucleocapsid gene analysis. Phylogenetic analysis showed at least three distinct clusters of HCoV-OC43, although 10 unusual strains displayed incongruent phylogenetic positions between RdRp and spike genes. This suggested the presence of four HCoV-OC43 genotypes (A to D), with genotype D most likely arising from recombination. The complete genome sequencing of two genotype C and D strains and bootscan analysis showed recombination events between genotypes B and C in the generation of genotype D. Of the 29 strains, none belonged to the more ancient genotype A, 5 from 2004 belonged to genotype B, 15 from 2004 to 2006 belonged to genotype C, and 1 from 2004 and all 8 from 2008 to 2011 belonged to the recombinant genotype D. Molecular clock analysis using spike and nucleocapsid genes dated the most recent common ancestor of all genotypes to the 1950s, genotype B and C to the 1980s, genotype B to the 1990s, and genotype C to the late 1990s to early 2000s, while the recombinant genotype D strains were detected as early as 2004. This represents the first study to describe natural recombination in HCoV-OC43 and the evolution of different genotypes over time, leading to the emergence of novel genotype D, which is associated with pneumonia in our elderly population.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.038043793,-0.022055843,-0.023352842000000002,-0.06844067200000001,0.19122727899999997,-0.01059466,0.054137175,-0.042418940999999995,0.061601721,-0.024188836000000002,-0.010167705,0.33970781299999997,0.16914543699999998,0.084741203,0.000533076,0.03464043,-0.083840871,0.009493143,-0.044544050999999994,-0.008872801,0.054025065,-0.006584399,0.061013445,0.038287838,-0.02090523,-0.050295582,0.092388725,0.003876095,-0.021893202,0.079275996
1489,Detection of Adeno-Associated Virus Viremia in Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is widely considered to be nonpathogenic, but the clinical epidemiology of this virus is limited. By use of polymerase chain reaction assays, we investigated the incidence and clinical significance of AAV viremia in a population of consecutive recipients of a hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Four (2.8%) of 145 patients developed AAV viremia after HCT. Viremia was low level and transient in all patients. Two patients were admitted to the hospital and died in proximity to AAV viremia (<7 weeks between diagnosis and death); however, AAV was not detected in tissue specimens obtained at autopsy.

1490,Coronavirus Infection Induces DNA Replication Stress Partly through Interaction of Its Nonstructural Protein 13 with the p125 Subunit of DNA Polymerase δ,"Perturbation of cell cycle regulation is a characteristic feature of infection by many DNA and RNA viruses, including Coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). IBV infection was shown to induce cell cycle arrest at both S and G(2)/M phases for the enhancement of viral replication and progeny production. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well explored. In this study we show that activation of cellular DNA damage response is one of the mechanisms exploited by Coronavirus to induce cell cycle arrest. An ATR-dependent cellular DNA damage response was shown to be activated by IBV infection. Suppression of the ATR kinase activity by chemical inhibitors and siRNA-mediated knockdown of ATR reduced the IBV-induced ATR signaling and inhibited the replication of IBV. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid screens and subsequent biochemical and functional studies demonstrated that interaction between Coronavirus nsp13 and DNA polymerase δ induced DNA replication stress in IBV-infected cells. These findings indicate that the ATR signaling activated by IBV replication contributes to the IBV-induced S-phase arrest and is required for efficient IBV replication and progeny production.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.141223787,-0.040986233999999996,0.023874975,-0.090861166,0.015028628,0.08376375700000001,-0.098487689,-0.115691186,0.160007452,0.336693139,0.075404634,-0.025295762000000003,-0.069243893,0.146280608,-0.160119643,0.212215094,0.004099244,-0.032050832,0.041231517999999995,0.066474601,-0.074438382,0.007853288,-0.006393244,-0.091919057,0.017995654,0.004257841,-0.077563806,0.07723843700000001,0.024607406000000002,-0.041674099
1491,Function of nonstructural 5A protein of genotype 2a in replication and infection of HCV with gene substitution,"AIM: To explore the function of Nonstructural 5A (NS5A) protein of genotype 2a (JFH1) in the replication and infection of hepatitis C virus (HCV). METHODS: Intergenotypic chimera FL-J6JFH/J4NS5A was constructed by inserting NS5A gene from 1b stain HC-J4 by the overlapping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and the restriction enzyme reaction. In vitro RNA transcripts of chimera, prototype J6JFH and negative control J6JFH1 (GND) were prepared and transfected into Huh-7.5 cells with liposomes. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA), fluorescence quantitative PCR and infection assay were performed to determine the protein expression and gene replication in Huh-7.5 cells. RESULTS: The HCV RNA levels in FL-J6JFH/J4NS5A chimera RNA transfected cells were significantly lower than the wild type at any indicated time point (2.58 ± 5.97 × 10(6) vs 4.27 ± 1.72 × 10(4), P = 0.032). The maximal level of HCV RNA in chimera was 5.6 ± 1.8 × 10(4) GE/μg RNA at day 34 after transfection, while the wild type reached a peak level at day 13 which was 126 folds higher (70.65 ± 14.11 × 10(5) vs 0.56 ± 0.90 × 10(5), P = 0.028). HCV proteins could also be detected by IFA in chimera-transfected cells with an obviously low level. Infection assay showed that FL-J6JFH/J4NS5A chimera could produce infectious virus particles, ranging from 10 ± 5 ffu/mL to 78.3 ± 23.6 ffu/mL, while that of FL-J6JFH1 ranged from 5.8 ± 1.5 × 10(2) ffu/mL to 2.5 ± 1.4 × 10(4) ffu/mL. CONCLUSION: JFH1 NS5A might play an important role in the robust replication of J6JFH1.

1492,"Transocular Entry of Seasonal Influenza–Attenuated Virus Aerosols and the Efficacy of N95 Respirators, Surgical Masks, and Eye Protection in Humans","Background. The efficacy of barrier precautions to prevent influenza transmission is unknown. Methods. Twenty-eight participants were exposed to monodispersed live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) particles (4.9 μm) in 6 groups: group 1, no precautions; group 2, ocular exposure only; group 3, surgical mask without eye protection; group 4, surgical mask with eye protection; group 5, fit-tested N95 respirator without eye protection; and group 6, fit-tested N95 respirator with eye protection. Influenza was detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and culture in nasal washes. Exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results. Influenza was detected in 4 of 4 participants in group 1 (95% CI, 0–.60), 3 of 4 in group 2 (95% CI, .006–.806]), 5 of 5 in group 3 (95% CI, 0–.522), 5 of 5 in group 4, (95% CI, 0–.522), 3 of 5 in group 5 (95% CI, .053–.853), and 1 of 5 in group 6 (95% CI, .05–.72).

1494,Molecular characterization of a new species in the genus Alphacoronavirus associated with mink epizootic catarrhal gastroenteritis,"A coronavirus (CoV) previously shown to be associated with catarrhal gastroenteritis in mink (Mustela vison) was identified by electron microscopy in mink faeces from two fur farms in Wisconsin and Minnesota in 1998. A pan-coronavirus and a genus-specific RT-PCR assay were used initially to demonstrate that the newly discovered mink CoVs (MCoVs) were members of the genus Alphacoronavirus. Subsequently, using a random RT-PCR approach, full-genomic sequences were generated that further confirmed that, phylogenetically, the MCoVs belonged to the genus Alphacoronavirus, with closest relatedness to the recently identified but only partially sequenced (fragments of the polymerase, and full-length spike, 3c, envelope, nucleoprotein, membrane, 3x and 7b genes) ferret enteric coronavirus (FRECV) and ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV). The molecular data presented in this study provide the first genetic evidence for a new coronavirus associated with epizootic catarrhal gastroenteritis outbreaks in mink and demonstrate that MCoVs possess high genomic variability and relatively low overall nucleotide sequence identities (91.7 %) between contemporary strains. Additionally, the new MCoVs appeared to be phylogenetically distant from human (229E and NL63) and other alphacoronaviruses and did not belong to the species Alphacoronavirus 1. It is proposed that, together with the partially sequenced FRECV and FRSCV, they comprise a new species within the genus Alphacoronavirus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.058668791,0.07757139099999999,0.034574751,-0.03441515,0.149945487,0.02374553,0.034982014,0.009775666,0.000498368,-0.038150481,-0.030845382999999997,0.023689498,0.040571328,-0.0074147480000000005,-0.005774874,-0.015133801,0.017337758,0.035804534,-0.023954322000000004,-0.0057820680000000005,0.025455877999999998,0.018370541,-0.01902537,0.033474369,0.024461063999999998,-0.002014043,0.026373828999999998,-0.026171551,0.004172121,0.018696462
1495,Human Mitochondrial RNA Polymerase: Evaluation of the Single-Nucleotide-Addition Cycle on Synthetic RNA/DNA Scaffolds,"The human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (h-mtRNAP) serves as both the transcriptase for expression and the primase for replication of mitochondrial DNA. As such, the enzyme is of fundamental importance to cellular energy metabolism, and defects in its function may be related to human disease states. Here we describe in vitro analysis of the h-mtRNAP kinetic mechanism for single, correct nucleotide incorporation. This was made possible by the development of efficient methods for expression and purification of h-mtRNAP using a bacterial system and by utilization of assays that rely on simple, synthetic RNA/DNA scaffolds without the need for mitochondrial transcription accessory proteins. We find that h-mtRNAP accomplishes single-nucleotide incorporation by using the same core steps, including conformational change steps before and after chemistry, that are prototypical for most types of nucleic acid polymerases. The polymerase binds to scaffolds via a two-step mechanism consisting of a fast initial-encounter step followed by a much slower isomerization that leads to catalytic competence. A substantial solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effect was observed for the forward reaction, but none was detectable for the reverse reaction, suggesting that chemistry is at least partially rate-limiting in the forward direction but not in the reverse. h-mtRNAP appears to exercise much more stringent surveillance over base than over sugar in determining the correctness of a nucleotide. The utility of developing the robust in vitro assays described here and of establishing a baseline of kinetic performance for the wild-type enzyme is that biological questions concerning h-mtRNAP may now begin to be addressed.

1501,Rotavirus Replication Requires a Functional Proteasome for Effective Assembly of Viroplasms,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system has been shown to play an important role in the replication cycle of different viruses. In this study, we describe a strong impairment of rotavirus replication upon inhibition of proteasomal activity. The effect was evidenced at the level of accumulation of viral proteins, viral RNA, and yield of infective particles. Kinetic studies revealed that the early steps of the replicative cycle following attachment, entry, and uncoating were clearly more sensitive to proteasome inhibition. We ruled out a direct inhibition of the viral polymerase activities and stability of viral proteins and found that the crucial step that was impaired by blocking proteasome activity was the assembly of new viroplasms. This was demonstrated by using chemical inhibitors of proteasome and by gene silencing using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific for different proteasomal subunits and for the ubiquitin precursor RPS27A. In addition, we show that the effect of proteasome inhibition on virus infection is not due to increased levels of beta interferon (IFN-β).",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.120829035,-0.054761579000000005,-0.029104015,0.005069465,-0.10228905199999999,0.032597719,0.063476465,-0.019291523999999997,0.037604563,0.026472474,0.001737807,-0.025013333999999998,-0.01551409,0.08487162300000001,0.015627396,0.0061683169999999996,-0.0035067979999999998,-0.012121648999999998,0.018122415,0.025943756000000002,-0.025274462,0.044107152000000004,-0.019113268,-0.001823467,0.033869027999999995,0.009110587,0.009517445,-0.037903908,-0.005484686,0.029371697999999998
1508,MTA1 Coregulator Regulates LPS Response via MyD88-dependent Signaling,"Although metastasis tumor antigen 1 (MTA1) contributes to the responsiveness of macrophages to LPS, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we investigated the role of MTA1 in the regulation of expression and function of MyD88, a proximal component of NF-κB signaling. We discovered that MTA1 targets MyD88 and that MyD88 is a NF-κB-responsive gene in LPS-stimulated macrophages. We found that MTA1 is required for MyD88-dependent stimulation of NF-κB signaling and expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, MIP2, and TNF-α as MTA1 depletion leads to a substantial reduction in the expression of NF-κB target genes. In addition, LPS-mediated stimulation of MyD88 transcription was accompanied by an enhanced recruitment of MTA1, RNA polymerase II, and p65RelA complex to the NF-κB consensus sites in the MyD88 promoter. Interestingly, the recruitment of both MTA1 and MyD88 expression is effectively blocked by NF-κB inhibitor parthenolide. Selective knockdown of MyD88 by a dominant negative mutant of MyD88 or selective siRNA also impairs the ability of LPS to stimulate the NF-κB target genes. These findings reveal an inherent coregulatory role of MTA1 upon the expression of MyD88 and suggest that MTA1 regulation of MyD88 may constitute at least one of the mechanisms by which MTA1 stimulates LPS-induced NF-κB signaling in stimulated macrophages.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.070688399,-0.029555882999999998,0.002354821,-0.10607593800000001,-0.055641725,0.038835651,0.024435849,-0.022104337,0.036894965,-0.053842072000000005,-0.040018232,0.003764601,-0.023026117999999998,0.044064134000000005,-0.010512968999999999,0.031219687000000003,-0.0009183780000000001,-0.041555132,-0.036154694,-0.048356104000000004,0.030850303,-0.030351542999999998,0.014648875,-0.008857674,-0.017364577,-0.024425206,-0.008776927,0.033141332,0.055307422,-0.055383166
1510,"Rift Valley Fever Virus Epidemic in Kenya, 2006/2007: The Entomologic Investigations","In December 2006, Rift Valley fever (RVF) was diagnosed in humans in Garissa Hospital, Kenya and an outbreak reported affecting 11 districts. Entomologic surveillance was performed in four districts to determine the epidemic/epizootic vectors of RVF virus (RVFV). Approximately 297,000 mosquitoes were collected, 164,626 identified to species, 72,058 sorted into 3,003 pools and tested for RVFV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Seventy-seven pools representing 10 species tested positive for RVFV, including Aedes mcintoshi/circumluteolus (26 pools), Aedes ochraceus (23 pools), Mansonia uniformis (15 pools); Culex poicilipes, Culex bitaeniorhynchus (3 pools each); Anopheles squamosus, Mansonia africana (2 pools each); Culex quinquefasciatus, Culex univittatus, Aedes pembaensis (1 pool each). Positive Ae. pembaensis, Cx. univittatus, and Cx. bitaeniorhynchus was a first time observation.

1514,Evaluation of reference genes for quantitative reverse‐transcription polymerase chain reaction normalization in infected tomato plants,"The quantification of messenger RNA expression levels by real‐time reverse‐transcription polymerase chain reaction requires the availability of reference genes that are stably expressed regardless of the experimental conditions under study. We examined the expression variations of a set of eight candidate reference genes in tomato leaf and root tissues subjected to the infection of five taxonomically and molecularly different plant viruses and a viroid, inducing diverse pathogenic effects on inoculated plants. Parallel analyses by three commonly used dedicated algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper, showed that different viral infections and tissues of origin influenced, to some extent, the expression levels of these genes. However, all algorithms showed high levels of stability for glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate dehydrogenase and ubiquitin, indicated as the most suitable endogenous transcripts for normalization in both tissue types. Actin and uridylate kinase were also stably expressed throughout the infected tissues, whereas cyclophilin showed tissue‐specific expression stability only in root samples. By contrast, two widely employed reference genes, 18S ribosomal RNA and elongation factor 1α, demonstrated highly variable expression levels that should discourage their use for normalization. In addition, expression level analysis of ascorbate peroxidase and superoxide dismutase showed the modulation of the two genes in virus‐infected tomato leaves and roots. The relative quantification of the two genes varied according to the reference genes selected, thus highlighting the importance of the choice of the correct normalization method in such experiments.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.090863239,-0.021770988999999998,0.048005347000000004,-0.095714261,-0.022045642999999997,0.031075975,0.0068984680000000005,-0.045466688,0.046004030999999994,-0.029539212000000002,-0.076323055,-0.058985142000000004,0.00176618,0.10572128199999999,-0.007065473,-0.032620317,-0.015702911,-0.078617677,-0.046848188,-0.077506695,0.041709424,-0.017480923,0.022319704,0.03701912,-0.138237735,-0.069184266,0.03334705,0.063436173,0.058336085999999995,-0.038385322
1515,Construction and characterization of calreticulin-HBsAg fusion gene recombinant adenovirus expression vector,"AIM: To generate recombinant adenoviral vector containing calreticulin (CRT)-hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) fusion gene for developing a safe, effective and HBsAg-specific therapeutic vaccine. METHODS: CRT and HBsAg gene were fused using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), endonuclease digestion and ligation methods. The fusion gene was cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO transfer vector after the base pairs of DNA (CACC) sequence was added to the 5′ end. Adenoviral expression vector containing CRT-HBsAg fusion gene was constructed by homologous recombinantion. The human embryo kidney (HEK) 293A cells were transfected with linearized DNA plasmid of the recombinant adenoviral vector to package and amplify recombinant adenovirus. The recombinant adenovirus titer was characterized using the end-dilution assay. The expression of the CRT/HBsAg fusion protein in Ad-CRT/HBsAg infected 293A cells was detected by Western blotting. RESULTS: The CRT-HBsAg fusion gene was characterized by PCR and sequencing and its length and sequence were confirmed to be accurate. The CRT-HBsAg fusion gene recombinant pENTR/D-TOPO transfer vector was constructed. The recombinant adenoviral vector, Ad-CRT/HBsAg, was generated successfully. The titer of Ad-CRT/HBsAg was characterized as 3.9 × 10(11) pfu/mL. The CRT-HBsAg fusion protein was expressed by HEK 293A cells correctly. CONCLUSION: CRT/HBsAg fusion gene recombinant replication-defective adenovirus expression vector is constructed successfully and this study has provided an experimental basis for further studies of Hepatitis B virus gene therapy.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.075988475,-0.027324112,0.032364864,-0.081955867,-0.006507998,0.01139213,-0.034920146,-0.028295797,0.040157612,-0.039637405,-0.060210727,-0.024231002999999997,-0.004197065,0.002921095,-0.0017376829999999998,-0.0036746,-0.008639665,-0.01168605,0.009109274,-0.038710978,0.030182056000000002,0.009947908,0.051651962,0.010782556,-0.016003706,0.037121582,0.00633259,0.008706901,-0.018658903,0.018125603
1516,Lifestyles of plant viruses,"The vast majority of well-characterized eukaryotic viruses are those that cause acute or chronic infections in humans and domestic plants and animals. However, asymptomatic persistent viruses have been described in animals, and are thought to be sources for emerging acute viruses. Although not previously described in these terms, there are also many viruses of plants that maintain a persistent lifestyle. They have been largely ignored because they do not generally cause disease. The persistent viruses in plants belong to the family Partitiviridae or the genus Endornavirus. These groups also have members that infect fungi. Phylogenetic analysis of the partitivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes suggests that these viruses have been transmitted between plants and fungi. Additional families of viruses traditionally thought to be fungal viruses are also found frequently in plants, and may represent a similar scenario of persistent lifestyles, and some acute or chronic viruses of crop plants may maintain a persistent lifestyle in wild plants. Persistent, chronic and acute lifestyles of plant viruses are contrasted from both a functional and evolutionary perspective, and the potential role of these lifestyles in host evolution is discussed.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.038849463,-0.04891183599999999,-0.030405527,0.031506786,0.057688616,0.022464283999999998,0.094757131,0.019595038000000002,-0.04230017,0.047486475,0.002987842,-0.017694654,0.027028188999999998,-0.007621656,0.043723277000000005,-0.018894625,-0.015128777,-0.031020855,-0.010082615,0.010078683,0.033737221,-0.020689304,-0.083713883,0.082434822,-0.065293625,-0.025646302000000003,-0.007536291999999999,-0.016384775,0.014218433,-0.077980224

1520,Different profiles of cytokine expression during mild and severe acute pancreatitis,"AIM: To study secretion patterns of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and activation of various cellular subsets of leukocytes in peripheral blood. METHODS: We have conducted a prospective observational study. One hundred and eight patients with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and onset of the disease within last 72 h were included in this study. The mRNA expression of 25 different types of cytokines in white blood cells was determined by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. Levels of 8 different cytokines in blood serum were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Clinical data and cytokine expression results were subjected to statistical analysis. RESULTS: Severe and necrotizing acute pancreatitis (AP) is characterized by the significant depletion of circulating lymphocytes. Severe acute pancreatitis is associated with a typical systemic inflammatory response syndrome and over-expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)]. Serum IL-6 and MIF concentrations are the best discriminators of severe and necrotizing AP as well as possible fatal outcome during the early course of the disease. CONCLUSION: Deregulation of cellular immune system is a key event leading to severe and necrotizing AP.

1524,"Distributions of HLA-A and -B alleles and haplotypes in the Yi ethnic minority of Yunnan, China: relationship to other populations","Objective: To investigate the distributions of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A and -B alleles and HLA-A-B haplotypes in the Yi ethnic minority of the Yunnan Province, situated in southwestern China. Methods: DNA typing for HLA-A and -B loci was performed using the polymerase chain reaction-sequence-based typing (PCR-SBT) method on 114 randomly selected healthy individuals of the Yi population. The allelic frequencies of HLA-A and -B loci were calculated by direct counting and HLA-A-B haplotypes were estimated using the expectation maximization algorithm. Results: A total of 17 HLA-A and 38 HLA-B alleles were found in the Yi population. The most frequent alleles were A*2402 (32.46%), A*1101 (26.32%), and A*0203 (10.09%) at the HLA-A locus and B*4601 (12.28%), B*1525 (10.09%), B*4001 (8.77%), and B*3802 (7.89%) at the HLA-B locus. The predominant HLA-A-B haplotypes were A*2402-B*1525 (7.86%) and A*0203-B*3802 (5.64%), followed by A*1101-B*4001 (4.69%). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the Yi population in the Honghe, Yunnan Province of China basically belongs to groups of southeastern Asian origin, but shares some characteristics with northeastern Asian groups.

We previously developed a strategy to recover prototype reovirus strain T3D from cloned cDNAs transfected into murine L929 fibroblast cells. Here, we report the development of a second-generation reovirus reverse genetics system featuring several major improvements: (1) the capacity to rescue prototype reovirus strain T1L, (2) reduction of required plasmids from ten to four, and (3) isolation of recombinant viruses following transfection of baby hamster kidney cells engineered to express bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. The efficiency of virus rescue using the 4-plasmid strategy was substantially increased in comparison to the original 10-plasmid system. We observed full compatibility of T1L and T3D rescue vectors when intermixed to produce a panel of T1L × T3D monoreassortant viruses.

1530,Human parainfluenza virus type 2 V protein inhibits interferon production and signaling and is required for replication in non-human primates,"In wild-type human parainfluenza virus type 2 (WT HPIV2), one gene (the P/V gene) encodes both the polymerase-associated phosphoprotein (P) and the accessory V protein. We generated a HPIV2 virus (rHPIV2-V(ko)) in which the P/V gene encodes only the P protein to examine the role of V in replication in vivo and as a potential live attenuated virus vaccine. Preventing expression of V protein severely impaired virus recovery from cDNA and growth in vitro, particularly in IFN-competent cells. rHPIV2-V(ko), unlike WT HPIV2, strongly induced IFN-β and permitted IFN signaling, leading to establishment of a robust antiviral state. rHPIV2-V(ko) infection induced extensive syncytia and cytopathicity that was due to both apoptosis and necrosis. Replication of rHPIV2-V(ko) was highly restricted in the respiratory tract of African green monkeys and in differentiated primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, suggesting that V protein is essential for efficient replication of HPIV2 in organized epithelial cells and that rHPIV2-V(ko) is over-attenuated for use as a live attenuated vaccine.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.11803306599999999,-0.07611657299999999,-0.038822247000000004,-0.049450045,-0.071191948,0.060777012000000005,-0.00019533599999999997,-0.071655627,0.11402858699999999,-0.000702915,-0.06139242,-0.051227293,-0.012483238,0.08968886699999999,-0.024033797000000003,-0.033137867,0.014054013,-0.067324715,-6.759999999999999e-05,0.053813207,0.095929512,-0.017892382,0.067729243,0.051415287000000004,0.043107937,0.070350705,0.015199378999999999,-0.020364692,-0.070071647,-0.049316603
1531,"Anatomical distribution of avian bornavirus in parrots, its occurrence in clinically healthy birds and ABV-antibody detection","Proventricular dilatation disease (PDD) is a fatal infectious disease of birds that primarily affects psittacine birds. Although a causative agent has not been formally demonstrated, the leading candidate is a novel avian bornavirus (ABV) detected in post-mortem tissue samples of psittacids with PDD from the USA, Israel and, recently, Germany. Here we describe the presence of ABV in a parrot with PDD as well as in clinically normal birds exposed to birds with PDD. In two ABV-positive post-mortem cases, the tissue distribution of ABV was investigated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Viraemia was observed in a PDD-affected bird whereas a restriction of ABV to nerve tissue was found in the non- PDD-affected bird. Healthy birds from the same aviary as the affected birds were also found to harbour the virus; 19/59 (32.2%) birds tested positive for ABV RNA in cloacal swabs, providing the first evidence of ABV in clinically healthy birds. In contrast, 39 birds from the same geographic area, but from two different aviaries without PDD cases in recent years, had negative cloacal swabs. ABV RNA-positive, clinically healthy birds demonstrated the same serological response as the animal with confirmed PDD. These results indicate that ABV infection may occur without clinical evidence of PDD and suggest that cloacal swabs can enable the non-invasive detection of ABV infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.010724011,-0.009908238,0.021809236,-0.071231182,0.003995976,0.028642476,0.010558737,0.009407347,-0.011728185,-0.002593264,0.040346976,0.006482538,-0.017631134,-0.005419515,0.017823314,0.027549335,-0.015059707,-0.006753062,-0.00260256,-0.02216107,-0.009396475,0.012561808,-0.040819104,-0.023159807,-0.002328756,0.00236974,-0.023261224,0.018625817,0.005670558000000001,-0.037950666
1532,Broadly reactive pan-paramyxovirus reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis for the detection of Canine distemper virus in a case of canine meningoencephalitis of unknown etiology,"Despite the immunologic protection associated with routine vaccination protocols, Canine distemper virus (CDV) remains an important pathogen of dogs. Antemortem diagnosis of systemic CDV infection may be made by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or immunohistochemical testing for CDV antigen; central nervous system infection often requires postmortem confirmation via histopathology and immunohistochemistry. An 8-month-old intact male French Bulldog previously vaccinated for CDV presented with multifocal neurologic signs. Based on clinical and postmortem findings, the dog’s disease was categorized as a meningoencephalitis of unknown etiology. Broadly reactive, pan-paramyxovirus RT-PCR using consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primers, combined with sequence analysis, identified CDV amplicons in the dog’s brain. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of CDV antigens, and a specific CDV RT-PCR based on the phosphoprotein gene identified a wild-type versus vaccinal virus strain.

1533,Serum IP-10 as a Biomarker of Human Rhinovirus Infection at Exacerbation of COPD,"BACKGROUND: Human rhinovirus (HRV) is the most frequent virus associated with COPD exacerbations. Viral infections increase exacerbation severity and likelihood of hospitalization. As ease of sampling blood makes serum a more practical marker than sputum, we investigated whether changes in serum interferon-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) from baseline to exacerbation were higher in airway HRV-positive exacerbations and whether IP-10 levels related to HRV load. METHODS: One hundred thirty-six patients with COPD and 70 controls were included over 2 years and 72 exacerbations sampled. HRV positivity and load were determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in nasopharyngeal swabs and/or sputum at baseline and exacerbation. IP-10 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum and compared with HRV load. RESULTS: At baseline, serum IP-10 was higher in patients with COPD than controls; medians were 149.4 pg/mL (103-215) and 111.7 pg/mL (82-178), P = .02. The presence of HRV at baseline did not increase IP-10: patients with COPD, 166.9 pg/mL (110-240) and 149.4 pg/mL (103-215), P = .30; controls, 136.4 pg/mL (77-204) and 111.7 pg/mL (82-178), P = .53. IP-10 increased significantly from baseline to exacerbation in HRV-positive exacerbations: 154.9 pg/mL (114.0-195.1) to 207.5 pg/mL (142.1-333.5), P = .009. There was no change in IP-10 between baseline and exacerbation in HRV-negative exacerbations: 168.3 pg/mL (94.3-249.8) and 175.6 pg/mL (107.2-290.4), P = .49. At exacerbation, IP-10 correlated with sputum viral load: rho = 0.48; P = .02. In receiver operating characteristics analysis, the combination of IP-10 and coryzal symptoms gave an area under the curve of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.74-0.90). CONCLUSIONS: IP-10 increases from baseline to exacerbation in HRV-positive exacerbations and correlates with sputum HRV load. Serum IP-10 may be useful as a novel marker for these events.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.047806479000000006,-0.04648323,-0.013540958,-0.121480085,-0.041253913999999996,-0.046109150999999994,0.031382467000000004,-0.001158237,-0.042440544000000004,-0.021156552999999998,-0.015937701999999998,-0.01264833,-0.07105521599999999,0.025488279,-0.0034837859999999996,0.011914908,-0.001527797,-0.039967037000000004,0.060927082,-0.05629142,-0.028488617999999997,-0.118975496,-0.034846238,0.095802384,-0.122068323,0.10505784800000001,-0.062308120999999994,-0.022966933,0.062855032,0.250054934
1536,Genetic Heterogeneity and Recombination in Canine Noroviruses,"Alphatronlike (genogroup IV [GIV]) noroviruses (NoVs) have been recently identified in carnivores. By screening a collection of 183 fecal samples collected during 2007 from dogs with enteric signs, the overall NoV prevalence was found to be 2.2% (4/183). A unique strain, Bari/91/07/ITA, resembled GIV.2 NoVs in its ORF1 (polymerase complex), while it was genetically unrelated in its full-length ORF2 (capsid gene) to GIV animal and human NoVs (54.0 to 54.4% amino acid identity) and to any other NoV genogroup (<54.7% amino acid identity). It displayed the highest identity (58.1% amino acid identity) to unclassified human strain Chiba/040502/04/Jp. Interestingly, the very 5′ end of ORF2 of the canine virus matched short noroviral sequences (88.9% nucleotide identity and 98.9% amino acid identity) identified from oysters in Japan, indicating that similar viruses may be common environmental contaminants.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.055770380999999994,-0.031762924,0.035245535,-0.08797970599999999,0.09843646699999999,0.032027442,-0.012678413000000001,-0.006150575,-0.00862398,-0.016464193999999998,-0.000809733,0.073472752,-0.012635896,-0.121651897,0.015022619,-0.08025578,-0.00159294,-0.0017551729999999998,0.023123625,-0.007476745,0.096302037,0.027036407000000002,-0.050564595999999996,0.029385359,0.071745192,-0.031301083,-0.031838175,-0.023258147000000003,-0.055698449000000004,0.043326625
1538,Nosocomial Contamination of Laryngoscope Handles: Challenging Current Guidelines,"BACKGROUND: Laryngoscope blades are often cleaned between cases according to well-defined protocols. However, despite evidence that laryngoscope handles could be a source of nosocomial infection, neither our institution nor the American Society of Anesthesiologists has any specific guidelines for handle disinfection. We hypothesized that laryngoscope handles may be sufficiently contaminated with bacteria and viruses to justify the implementation of new handle-cleaning protocols. METHODS: Sixty laryngoscope handles from the adult operating rooms were sampled with premoistened sterile swabs. Collection was performed between cases, in operating rooms hosting a broad variety of subspecialty procedures, after the room and equipment had been thoroughly cleaned for the subsequent case. Samples from 40 handles were sent for aerobic bacterial culture, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for significant isolates. Samples from 20 handles were examined for viral contamination using a polymerase chain reaction assay that detects 17 respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Of the 40 samples sent for culture, 30 (75%) were positive for bacterial contamination. Of these positive cultures, 25 (62.5%) yielded coagulase-negative staphylococci, seven (17.5%) Bacillus spp. not anthracis, three (7.5%) α-hemolytic Streptococcus spp., and one each (2.5%) of Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Corynebacterium spp. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, or Gram-negative rods were detected. All viral tests were negative. CONCLUSION: We found a high incidence of bacterial contamination of laryngoscope handles despite low-level disinfection. However, no vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Gram-negative rods, or respiratory viruses were detected. Our results support adoption of guidelines that include, at a minimum, mandatory low-level disinfection of laryngoscope handles after each patient use.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.072346693,-0.017014984,0.024363964,-0.058311605999999995,-0.018334904,0.003587685,0.026066001000000002,0.050285089000000005,-0.061005945,0.03754401,0.007685651999999999,0.005918341999999999,-0.014283488,-0.030586925,0.045560874,-0.018305316000000002,-0.02733193,-0.029850725,0.019410402,-0.025692051,-0.010041165999999999,0.04645809,0.021612397999999998,-0.02494796,0.007957345,0.009792435,-0.007181002,0.002385962,0.002248169,-0.047277225
1539,Multiple diagnostic tests to identify cattle with Bovine viral diarrhea virus and duration of positive test results in persistently infected cattle,"Several tests for Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) were applied to samples collected monthly from December 20, 2005, through November 27, 2006 (day 0 to day 342) from 12 persistently infected (PI) cattle with BVDV subtypes found in US cattle: BVDV-1a, BVDV-1b, and BVDV-2a. The samples included clotted blood for serum, nasal swabs, and fresh and formalin-fixed ear notches. The tests were as follows: titration of infectious virus in serum and nasal swabs; antigen-capture (AC) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or ACE, on serum, nasal swabs, and fresh ear notches; gel-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of serum, nasal swabs, and fresh ear notches; immunohistochemical (IHC) testing of formalin-fixed ear notches; and serologic testing for BVDV antibodies in serum. Of the 12 animals starting the study, 3 died with mucosal disease. The ACE and IHC tests on ear notches had positive results throughout the study, as did the ACE and PCR tests on serum. There was detectable virus in nasal swabs from all the cattle throughout the study except for a few samples that were toxic to cell cultures. The serum had a virus titer ≥ log(10) 1.60 in all samples from all the cattle except for 3 collections from 1 animal. Although there were several equivocal results, the PCR test most often had positive results. The BVDV antibodies were due to vaccination or exposure to heterologous strains and did not appear to interfere with any BVDV test. These findings illustrate that PI cattle may be identified by several tests, but differentiation of PI cattle from cattle with acute BVDV infection requires additional testing, especially of blood samples and nasal swabs positive on initial testing. Also, calves PI with BVDV are continual shedders of infectious virus, as shown by the infectivity of nasal swabs over the 11-mo study.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.034909011000000004,0.003238683,0.066019998,-0.09316339400000001,-0.003234034,0.011035931,0.00124846,-0.003836328,-0.013775727,-0.01691864,0.048606504,0.004190841,-0.026788145,0.001494061,0.063930088,-0.014745518999999999,0.001722042,-0.034202506,0.036077807999999996,-0.083316614,-0.013517737,-0.0134079,-0.009918455999999999,-0.064291436,0.052009810999999996,0.020132167,0.005389397,-0.059414209,-0.000560398,-0.036478132
1540,The Role of the Charged Residues of the GP2 Helical Regions in Ebola Entry(),"The glycoprotein (GP) of Ebola is the sole structural protein that forms the spikes on the viral envelope. The GP contains two subunits, GP1 and GP2, linked by a disulfide bond, which are responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively. In this study, the full length of GP gene of Ebola Zaire species, 2028 base pairs in length, was synthesized using 38 overlapping oligonucleotides by multiple rounds of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The synthesized GP gene was shown to be efficiently expressed in mammalian cells. Furthermore, an efficient HIV-based pseudotyping system was developed using the synthetic GP gene, providing a safe approach to dissecting the entry mechanism of Ebola viruses. Using this pseudotyping system and mutational analysis, the role of the charged residues in the GP2 helical regions was examined. It was found that substitutions of the most charged residues in the regions did not adversely affect GP expression, processing, or viral incorporation, however, most of the mutations greatly impaired the ability of GP to mediate efficient viral infection. These results demonstrate that these charged residues of GP2 play an important role in GP-mediated Ebola entry into its host cells. We propose that these charged residues are involved in forming the intermediate conformation(s) of GP in membrane fusion and Ebola entry.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.093430189,-0.030559488,0.005819254,-0.048184635,-0.028102216,0.021467633,0.011872323999999998,-0.01371935,0.022098637999999997,-0.018146677,-0.043575893,-0.004903335,-0.003719585,-0.005407724,-0.020523485,-0.010793978000000001,0.014292363,-0.031876626,-0.034522788,-0.023536331,0.006936315,0.00203135,-0.006442949,0.008441383,0.012014981000000001,0.009756363,0.009078883000000001,-0.016995019,0.003454246,0.009706751
1542,Infectious bronchitis virus in Jordanian chickens: Seroprevalence and detection,"Infectious bronchitis (IB) is one of the most important viral diseases of poultry; it causes major economic losses to the poultry industry. This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in commercial chicken flocks in Jordan. Serum samples from 70 commercial chicken flocks (40 broilers, 18 layers, and 12 broiler breeders) free from respiratory disease were collected and screened for the presence of Massachusetts-41 (M-41), D274, and 4/91 strain antigens of IBV by using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. In addition, 51 commercial chicken flocks (25 broilers, 15 layers, and 11 broiler breeders) suffering from respiratory disease were tested for the presence of IBV, using the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Overall, 92.9% of the flocks free from respiratory disease were seropositive for antibodies to the M-41 strain, whereas 90% and 61.4% of the flocks were seropositive for antibodies to the 4/91 and D274 strains, respectively. Infectious bronchitis virus nucleic acid was detected in 16 broiler (64%), 8 layer (53%), and 6 broiler breeder (54.54%) flocks affected with respiratory disease. This study clearly demonstrates that several strains of IBV are present in poultry flocks in Jordan. Future work should include the isolation and serotyping of IBV in the region, so that a suitable vaccination program, using the common field serotypes as vaccines, can be adopted to protect against IBV-caused disease. Furthermore, farmers need to be educated about the clinical signs of IB and the importance of IBV.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.015945078,-0.028592595,0.091416991,-0.119854004,0.175119932,0.091488996,-0.157338752,-0.10340842,0.138002882,0.39540077700000004,0.116328834,0.027317637999999998,-0.076323198,0.020438183999999998,-0.14065144300000001,0.169107958,0.000858021,-0.003298082,0.055920924000000004,0.047687516,-0.073100127,-0.028016479,-0.02157024,-0.08621100400000001,0.057596549000000004,0.018829557,-0.053894405,0.013429967,0.046302490999999994,-0.028540537

1547,"Overexpression of NANOG in Gestational Trophoblastic Diseases : Effect on Apoptosis, Cell Invasion, and Clinical Outcome","Gestational trophoblastic disease includes choriocarcinoma, a frankly malignant tumor, and hydatidiform mole (HM), which often leads to the development of persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia and requires chemotherapy. NANOG is an important transcription factor that is crucial for maintaining embryonic stem cell self-renewal and pluripotency. We postulated that NANOG is involved in the pathogenesis of gestational trophoblastic disease. In this study, significantly higher NANOG mRNA and protein expression levels, by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting, respectively, were demonstrated in HMs, particularly those that developed persistent disease, when compared with normal placentas. In addition, significantly increased nuclear NANOG immunoreactivity was found by immunohistochemistry in HMs (P < 0.001) and choriocarcinoma (P = 0.002). Higher NANOG expression levels were demonstrated in HMs that developed persistent disease, as compared with those that regressed (P = 0.025). Nuclear localization of NANOG was confirmed by confocal microscopy and immunoblotting in choriocarcinoma cell lines. There was a significant inverse correlation between NANOG immunoreactivity and apoptotic index assessed by M30 CytoDeath antibody (P = 0.012). After stable knockdown of NANOG in the choriocarcinoma cell line JEG-3 by an shRNA approach, increased apoptosis was observed in relation to with enhanced caspases and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activities. NANOG knockdown was also associated with decreased mobility and invasion of JEG-3 and down-regulation of matrix metalloproteases 2 and 9. These findings suggest that NANOG is involved in the pathogenesis and clinical progress of gestational trophoblastic disease, likely through its effect on apoptosis, cell migration, and invasion.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.044462203,-0.024361900000000002,0.008653731,-0.11013610000000001,-0.07136351,0.035220945,0.025137495,-0.027971087999999998,0.032584705,-0.032854341,-0.03470658,-0.011532155,-0.017122258,0.025380537,-0.00593303,0.020925623,0.003647826,-0.029133397999999998,-0.028410009,-0.033849776,0.017198925,-0.02513541,-0.007316486999999999,-0.014233966,0.005210385,0.0008779939999999999,-0.017114802,0.003531435,0.03195395,-0.04172996
1548,Molecular targets for flavivirus drug discovery,"Flaviviruses are a major cause of infectious disease in humans. Dengue virus causes an estimated 50 million cases of febrile illness each year, including an increasing number of cases of hemorrhagic fever. West Nile virus, which recently spread from the Mediterranean basin to the Western Hemisphere, now causes thousands of sporadic cases of encephalitis annually. Despite the existence of licensed vaccines, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and tick-borne encephalitis also claim many thousands of victims each year across their vast endemic areas. Antiviral therapy could potentially reduce morbidity and mortality from flavivirus infections, but no effective drugs are currently available. This article introduces a collection of papers in Antiviral Research on molecular targets for flavivirus antiviral drug design and murine models of dengue virus disease that aims to encourage drug development efforts. After reviewing the flavivirus replication cycle, we discuss the envelope glycoprotein, NS3 protease, NS3 helicase, NS5 methyltransferase and NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase as potential drug targets, with special attention being given to the viral protease.

1550,DNA Polymerases as Therapeutic Targets,"Numerous pathological states including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and viral/bacterial infections are often attributed to uncontrollable DNA replication. Inhibiting this essential biological process provides an obvious therapeutic target against these diseases. A logical target is the DNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the addition of mononucleotides into a growing polymer using a DNA or RNA template as a guide for directing each incorporation event. This review provides a summary of therapeutic agents that target polymerase activity. A discussion of the biological function and mechanism of polymerases is first provided to illustrate the strategy for therapeutic intervention as well as the rational design of various nucleoside analogs that inhibit various polymerases associated with viral infections and cancer. The development of nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors as anti-viral agents is discussed with particular emphasis on their mechanism of action, structure-activity relationships, toxicity, and mechanism of resistance. In addition, commonly used anti-cancer agents are described to illustrate the similarities and differences associated with various nucleoside analogs as therapeutic agents. Finally, new therapeutic approaches are discussed that include the inhibition of selective polymerases involved in DNA repair and/or translesion DNA synthesis as anti-cancer agents.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.10245225699999999,-0.043426562,-0.016439115,0.014900216,-0.143024017,0.052188202,0.13376975,-0.011769722,0.02432296,0.07040373700000001,-0.002636528,0.029134202,0.045403144000000006,-0.05582792,-0.000889342,0.0060979580000000005,-0.045974449,0.063301002,0.022077425,-0.018403928,-0.018836076,0.011492563999999999,-0.027385955,0.044118124,0.022582334,-0.051066041,-0.037144263999999996,-0.006576205999999999,0.08869333300000001,-0.002782112
1552,Emodin is a novel alkaline nuclease inhibitor that suppresses herpes simplex virus type 1 yields in cell cultures,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Most antiviral therapies directed against herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are limited to a small group of nucleoside analogues that target the viral polymerase. Extensive clinical use of these drugs has led to the emergence of resistant viral strains, mainly in immunocompromised patients. This highlights the need for the development of new anti-herpesviral drugs with novel targets. Herein the effects of a plant anthraquinone, emodin, on the HSV-1 alkaline nuclease activity and virus yields were investigated. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: HSV-1 alkaline nuclease activity was examined by nuclease activity assay. Inhibition of virus yields was measured by plaque reduction assay and immunohistochemical staining. Interaction between emodin and alkaline nuclease was analysed by docking technology. KEY RESULTS: Emodin specifically inhibited the nuclease activity of HSV-1 UL12 alkaline nuclease in a biochemical assay. Plaque reduction assay revealed that emodin reduced the plaque formation with an EC(50) of 21.5±4.4 μM. Immunohistochemical staining using the anti-nucleocapsid protein antibody demonstrated that emodin induced the accumulation of viral nucleocapsids in the nucleus in a dose-dependent manner. Docking analysis further suggested that the inhibitory effect of emodin on the UL12 activity may result from the interaction between emodin and critical catalytic amino acid residues of UL12. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings suggest that emodin is a potent anti-HSV agent that inhibits the yields of HSV-1 via the suppression of a novel target, UL12.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.064232227,-0.019926448,0.004879046,-0.037052112000000005,-0.09671842900000001,0.060123355999999996,0.062479007999999996,-0.019322016,0.022917922,0.001446002,-0.01349041,0.040462846000000004,-0.0157817,0.015719518999999998,-0.019759439,-0.020075914,0.009982528000000001,0.059112023,0.052583319,0.011677805,0.01908098,-0.005922354,0.005035596,0.022941549,0.027001629,0.034973804,0.021127755,-0.011800123000000001,0.026431877000000003,0.017173206
1553,Functional Characterization of the Cleavage Specificity of the Sapovirus Chymotrypsin-Like Protease,"Sapovirus is a positive-stranded RNA virus with a translational strategy based on processing of a polyprotein precursor by a chymotrypsin-like protease. So far, the molecular mechanisms regulating cleavage specificity of the viral protease are poorly understood. In this study, the catalytic activities and substrate specificities of the predicted forms of the viral protease, the 3C-like protease (NS6) and the 3CD-like protease-polymerase (NS6-7), were examined in vitro. The purified NS6 and NS6-7 were able to cleave synthetic peptides (15 to 17 residues) displaying the cleavage sites of the sapovirus polyprotein, both NS6 and NS6-7 proteins being active forms of the viral protease. High-performance liquid chromatography and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis of digested products showed a specific trans cleavage of peptides bearing Gln-Gly, Gln-Ala, Glu-Gly, Glu-Pro, or Glu-Lys at the scissile bond. In contrast, peptides bearing Glu-Ala or Gln-Asp at the scissile bond (NS4-NS5 and NS5-NS6, or NS6-NS7 junctions, respectively) were resistant to trans cleavage by NS6 or NS6-7 proteins, whereas cis cleavage of the Glu-Ala scissile bond of the NS5-NS6 junction was evidenced. Interestingly, the presence of a Phe at position P4 overruled the resistance to trans cleavage of the Glu-Ala junction (NS5-NS6), whereas substitutions at the P1 and P2′ positions altered the cleavage efficiency. The differential cleavage observed is supported by a model of the substrate-binding site of the sapovirus protease, indicating that the P4, P1, and P2′ positions in the substrate modulate the cleavage specificity and efficiency of the sapovirus chymotrypsin-like protease.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.08735910599999999,-0.035474964,-0.0053731809999999994,-0.048360068,-0.029259975,0.016850821999999998,0.00175745,-0.007004878000000001,0.01538537,-0.031457463,-0.028157102000000003,0.039186855,-0.009136327,-0.058222527,-0.0276216,-0.021828964,0.044358848,0.0015244170000000001,0.012578878,-0.013848683,-0.015198413000000001,-0.001323629,-0.01869587,-0.031962056,0.059958022,0.060260269000000005,-0.019998977,-0.011142616000000001,-0.003241703,-0.029565757
1556,Effect of dexamethasone administration on bulls with a localized testicular infection with bovine viral diarrhea virus,"The objective of this research was to evaluate reactivation of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) following dexamethasone treatment in 4 bulls that had previously been inoculated with BVDV, 3 of which had been demonstrated to have a localized testicular infection. Bulls were housed in an isolated pasture with in-contact steers. Beginning on day 0 of this study, all bulls received a daily dose of 0.1 mg/kg body weight (BW) of dexamethasone intravenously for 5 consecutive days. Blood was collected from the in-contact steers and semen, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid were collected from the bulls during and following dexamethasone treatment. Samples were assayed for BVDV using virus isolation and reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR). Serum was assayed for antibody using standard virus isolation. Virus was not isolated from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or semen from any of the 4 bulls during the study period. One of the bulls was positive for BVDV in semen by RT-nPCR throughout the study period. The BVDV was not recovered from any in-contact control steers during the 28-day study period, nor did any of the in-contact control steers seroconvert to BVDV. Raw semen from 1 bull that was RT-nPCR positive was intravenously inoculated into 7 seronegative steers based upon the Cornell Semen Test. The BVDV could not be recovered from the steers and none of them seroconverted to BVDV. The results indicated that reactivation of BVDV in bulls with a localized testicular infection is unlikely; however, further research is necessary to determine the full potential for BVDV transmission from bulls with a localized testicular infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.000564658,0.000812476,0.049475263,-0.077465943,-0.018191008,0.024193512,0.00172668,0.003056207,0.001609974,-0.020525545,0.036427206000000004,0.009453089,-0.034817202,0.017614278,0.049149893,0.007663963,0.008760901,0.00998083,-0.00550023,-0.025549514,-0.018963194,-0.007662052,-0.033716348,-0.008033268,0.035856212,0.022697395,0.008531495,-0.032756754,0.009067608000000001,-0.012454593
1558,Amiloride Derivatives Inhibit Coxsackievirus B3 RNA Replication,"Amiloride derivatives are known blockers of the cellular Na(+)/H(+) exchanger and the epithelial Na(+) channel. More recent studies demonstrate that they also inhibit ion channels formed by a number of viral proteins. We previously reported that 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA) modestly inhibits intracellular replication and, to a larger extent, release of human rhinovirus 2 (HRV2) (E. V. Gazina, D. N. Harrison, M. Jefferies, H. Tan, D. Williams, D. A. Anderson and S. Petrou, Antiviral Res. 67:98-106, 2005). Here, we demonstrate that amiloride and EIPA strongly inhibit coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) RNA replication and do not inhibit CVB3 release, in contrast to our previous findings on HRV2. Passaging of plasmid-derived CVB3 in the presence of amiloride generated mutant viruses with amino acid substitutions in position 299 or 372 of the CVB3 polymerase. Introduction of either of these mutations into the CVB3 plasmid produced resistance to amiloride and EIPA, suggesting that they act as inhibitors of CVB3 polymerase, a novel mechanism of antiviral activity for these compounds.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.091242769,-0.04483276,-0.021908547,-0.016179321,-0.066907172,0.05129974599999999,0.055060522,-0.004873767,0.023654527,0.004804742,0.0022185539999999998,0.028604347000000002,-0.007267815,-0.008121861,0.00962089,0.005894824,-0.008064386,0.031233292000000003,0.013331009,-0.004940386,0.012639746,0.00627381,-0.000530675,0.028668467000000003,0.031146175,0.040874959,0.008305742,-0.018076346,0.008483738000000001,-0.011484992
1562,Role of Law Enforcement Response and Microbial Forensics in Investigation of Bioterrorism,"The risk and threat of bioterrorism and biocrime have become a large concern and challenge for governments and society to enhance biosecurity. Law enforcement plays an important role in assessing and investigating activities involved in an event of bioterrorism or biocrime. Key to a successful biosecurity program is increased awareness and early detection of threats facilitated by an integrated network of responsibilities and capabilities from government, academic, private, and public assets. To support an investigation, microbial forensic sciences are employed to analyze and characterize forensic evidence with the goal of attribution or crime scene reconstruction. Two different molecular biology-based assays – real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and repetitive element PCR – are described and demonstrate how molecular biology tools may be utilized to aid in the investigative process. Technologies relied on by microbial forensic scientists need to be properly validated so that the methods used are understood and so that interpretation of results is carried out within the limitations of the assays. The three types of validation are preliminary, developmental, and internal. The first is necessary for rapid response when a threat is imminent or an attack has recently occurred.

1565,Adaptation of Borna Disease Virus to New Host Species Attributed to Altered Regulation of Viral Polymerase Activity,"Borna disease virus (BDV) can persistently infect the central nervous system of a broad range of mammalian species. Mice are resistant to infections with primary BDV isolates, but certain laboratory strains can be adapted to replicate in mice. We determined the molecular basis of adaptation by studying mutations acquired by a cDNA-derived BDV strain during one brain passage in rats and three passages in mice. The adapted virus propagated efficiently in mouse brains and induced neurological disease. Its genome contained seven point mutations, three of which caused amino acid changes in the L polymerase (L1116R and N1398D) and in the polymerase cofactor P (R66K). Recombinant BDV carrying these mutations either alone or in combination all showed enhanced multiplication speed in Vero cells, indicating improved intrinsic viral polymerase activity rather than adaptation to a mouse-specific factor. Mutations R66K and L1116R, but not N1398D, conferred replication competence of recombinant BDV in mice if introduced individually. Virus propagation in mouse brains was substantially enhanced if both L mutations were present simultaneously, but infection remained mostly nonsymptomatic. Only if all three amino acid substitutions were combined did BDV replicate vigorously and induce early disease in mice. Interestingly, the virulence-enhancing effect of the R66K mutation in P could be attributed to reduced negative regulation of polymerase activity by the viral X protein. Our data demonstrate that BDV replication competence in mice is mediated by the polymerase complex rather than the viral envelope and suggest that altered regulation of viral gene expression can favor adaptation to new host species.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.124440811,-0.048339452000000005,-0.014708833999999999,-0.037786753,-0.034721597,0.07855583599999999,0.023040223,-0.032301842000000004,0.037393838,0.036652897000000004,-0.030756158999999998,-0.039944736,0.008478454,0.025620781000000002,0.012285478999999998,-0.008915255,-0.042014859,-0.012856586000000001,-0.048636477000000004,0.039133927,0.063576753,-0.026700071000000002,0.036309907999999995,0.065712395,0.003241602,0.0502263,0.042043073,-0.024611512000000002,-0.081380601,0.010125333
1567,Strong and Selective Inhibitors of Hepatitis B Virus Replication among Novel N(4)-Hydroxy- and 5-Methyl-β-l-Deoxycytidine Analogues,"Novel N(4)-hydroxy- and 5-methyl-modified β-l-deoxycytidine analogues were synthesized and evaluated as anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) agents. Their in vitro efficiencies were investigated in HepG2.2.15 cells stably transfected with HBV. β-l-2′,3′-Didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxy-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (β-l-Hyd4C) was most effective in reducing secreted HBV DNA (50% effective concentration [EC(50)], 0.03 μM), followed by β-l-2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thia-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (EC(50), 0.51 μM), β-l-2′,3′-dideoxy-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (EC(50), 0.55 μM), and β-l-5-methyl-2′-deoxycytidine (EC(50), 0.9 μM). The inhibition of the presumed target, the HBV DNA polymerase, by the triphosphates of some of the β-l-cytidine derivatives was also assessed. In accordance with the cell culture data, β-l-Hyd4C triphosphate was the most active inhibitor, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.21 μM. The cytotoxicities of some of the 4-NHOH-modified β-l-nucleosides were dramatically lower than those of the corresponding cytidine analogues with the unmodified 4-NH(2) group. The 50% cytotoxic concentrations for β-l-Hyd4C in HepG2 and HL-60 cells were 2,500 μM and 3,500 μM, respectively. In summary, our results demonstrate that at least β-l-Hyd4C can be recommended as a highly efficient and extremely selective inhibitor of HBV replication for further investigations.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.062364407000000004,-0.029781927000000003,0.00574914,-0.079763992,-0.09972179699999999,0.063313644,0.047229905999999995,-0.021858559,0.034099207,-0.020282357,-0.011215723,0.031188285,-0.036535918,0.026216677999999997,-0.000648777,0.033459982,-0.018685102,0.09401757599999999,0.114023512,-0.056508768,-0.013989169,-0.010974386000000001,0.044859566,0.048914353,0.0070153459999999996,0.007792604,-0.015740647,0.009395671,-0.002937535,-0.016917138
1571,The Glycoprotein Cytoplasmic Tail of Uukuniemi Virus (Bunyaviridae) Interacts with Ribonucleoproteins and Is Critical for Genome Packaging,"We have analyzed the importance of specific amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail of the glycoprotein G(N) for packaging of ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) into virus-like particles (VLPs) of Uukuniemi virus (UUK virus), a member of the Bunyaviridae family. In order to study packaging, we added the G(N)/G(C) glycoprotein precursor (p110) to a polymerase I-driven minigenome rescue system to generate VLPs that are released into the supernatant. These particles can infect new cells, and reporter gene expression can be detected. To determine the role of UUK virus glycoproteins in RNP packaging, we performed an alanine scan of the glycoprotein G(N) cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 1 to 81). First, we discovered three regions in the tail (amino acids 21 to 25, 46 to 50, and 71 to 81) which are important for minigenome transfer by VLPs. Further mutational analysis identified four amino acids that were important for RNP packaging. These amino acids are essential for the binding of nucleoproteins and RNPs to the glycoprotein without affecting the morphology of the particles. No segment-specific interactions between the RNA and the cytoplasmic tail could be observed. We propose that VLP systems are useful tools for analyzing protein-protein interactions important for packaging of viral genome segments, assembly, and budding of other members of the Bunyaviridae family.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.10815674900000001,-0.052362907,-0.00400303,-0.043687309,0.007769425999999999,0.012023662,-0.031080466,-0.013197245,0.027834825,-0.01043362,-0.060254975,-0.016519361,0.007579481999999999,-0.04224831,0.013795861999999999,-0.047686461,0.02895016,-0.020452381000000002,-0.010664261000000001,0.015904351,-0.003885973,-0.00042136,0.00558928,-0.005265203,0.024845156,0.055275347,0.025462552000000003,-0.025814043999999998,-0.048981527000000004,0.023827453999999998
1577,Generation and Analysis of Infectious Virus-Like Particles of Uukuniemi Virus (Bunyaviridae): a Useful System for Studying Bunyaviral Packaging and Budding,"In the present report we describe an infectious virus-like particle (VLP) system for the Uukuniemi (UUK) virus, a member of the Bunyaviridae family. It utilizes our recently developed reverse genetic system based on the RNA polymerase I minigenome system for UUK virus used to study replication, encapsidation, and transcription by monitoring reporter gene expression. Here, we have added the glycoprotein precursor expression plasmid together with the minigenome, nucleoprotein, and polymerase to generate VLPs, which incorporate the minigenome and are released into the supernatant. The particles are able to infect new cells, and reporter gene expression can be monitored if the trans-acting viral proteins (RNA polymerase and nucleoprotein) are also expressed in these cells. No minigenome transfer occurred in the absence of glycoproteins, demonstrating that the glycoproteins are absolutely required for the generation of infectious particles. Moreover, expression of glycoproteins alone was sufficient to produce and release VLPs. We show that the ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) are incorporated into VLPs but are not required for the generation of particles. Morphological analysis of the particles by electron microscopy revealed that VLPs, either with or without minigenomes, display a surface morphology indistinguishable from that of the authentic UUK virus and that they bud into Golgi vesicles in the same way as UUK virus does. This infectious VLP system will be very useful for studying the bunyaviral structural components required for budding and packaging of RNPs and receptor binding and may also be useful for the development of new vaccines for the human pathogens from this family.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.120529866,-0.041858991,0.006434668,-0.022435516000000003,-0.030146529,0.033170742,-0.010900466000000001,-0.024344222999999998,0.037779562,0.010552665,-0.041645607,-0.057578813,0.019021175,0.039509548,0.036633824,0.004551077,-0.011608696000000002,-0.018038824,-0.018628948,0.001512539,0.015382291000000001,0.006590616,0.014128748,-0.015273763999999999,-0.004262811,0.021922075,0.024504336,0.013358865,-0.045568932,0.001434841
1587,Chronic liver injury in rats and humans upregulates the novel enzyme angiotensin converting enzyme 2,"Background: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a recently identified homologue of ACE that may counterregulate the actions of angiotensin (Ang) II by facilitating its breakdown to Ang 1–7. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cirrhosis but the role of ACE2 in liver disease is not known. Aims: This study examined the effects of liver injury on ACE2 expression and activity in experimental hepatic fibrosis and human cirrhosis, and the effects of Ang 1–7 on vascular tone in cirrhotic rat aorta. Methods: In sham operated and bile duct ligated (BDL) rats, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to assess hepatic ACE2 mRNA, and western blotting and immunohistochemistry to quantify and localise ACE2 protein. ACE2 activity was quantified by quenched fluorescent substrate assay. Similar studies were performed in normal human liver and in hepatitis C cirrhosis. Results: ACE2 mRNA was detectable at low levels in rat liver and increased following BDL (363-fold; p<0.01). ACE2 protein increased after BDL (23.5-fold; p<0.05) as did ACE2 activity (fourfold; p<0.05). In human cirrhotic liver, gene (>30-fold), protein expression (97-fold), and activity of ACE2 (2.4 fold) were increased compared with controls (all p<0.01). In healthy livers, ACE2 was confined to endothelial cells, occasional bile ducts, and perivenular hepatocytes but in both BDL and human cirrhosis there was widespread parenchymal expression of ACE2 protein. Exposure of cultured human hepatocytes to hypoxia led to increased ACE2 expression. In preconstricted rat aorta, Ang 1–7 alone did not affect vascular tone but it significantly enhanced acetylcholine mediated vasodilatation in cirrhotic vessels. Conclusions: ACE2 expression is significantly increased in liver injury in both humans and rat, possibly in response to increasing hepatocellular hypoxia, and may modulate RAS activity in cirrhosis.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.058750450999999995,-0.021784671000000002,-0.005224525,-0.10682985699999999,-0.069425684,0.031027747,0.019301205,-0.036521615,0.030725209,-0.056289800999999993,-0.048969807000000004,0.008112395,-0.017711988999999997,0.041935787,-0.033957276,-0.002585005,0.011342258999999999,-0.009836586,-0.002022627,-0.052624959000000006,0.029201106,-0.014001139,0.026532262999999997,0.012774869,-0.004078962,0.028565612,-0.002363029,0.01201552,0.022284066,-0.05878631
1593,RNA Interference-Mediated Virus Clearance from Cells both Acutely and Chronically Infected with the Prototypic Arenavirus Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus,"Several arenaviruses, including Lassa fever virus, cause severe, often lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans. No licensed vaccines are available in the United States, and currently there is no efficacious therapy to treat this viral infection. Therefore the importance of developing effective antiviral approaches to combat pathogenic arenaviruses is clear. Moreover, the prototypic arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is an important model for the study of viral persistence and associated diseases, as well as for exploring therapies to treat viral chronic infections. The use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to downregulate gene expression via RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a powerful genetic tool for the study of gene function. In addition, the successful use of siRNAs to target a variety of animal viruses has led us to consider RNAi as a potential novel antiviral strategy. We have investigated the use of RNAi therapy against LCMV. Here, we show that siRNAs targeting sequences within the viral L polymerase and Z mRNAs inhibit LCMV multiplication in cultured cells. Unexpectedly, the antiviral efficacy of RNAi-based therapy against LCMV was highly dependent on the method used to deliver effector siRNA molecules. Thus, transfection of chemically synthesized siRNA pools to L and Z was ineffective in preventing virus multiplication. In contrast, targeting of the same viral L and Z gene products with siRNAs produced inside cells using a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus expression system inhibited LCMV multiplication very efficiently. Notably, transduction with the replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus expression system to Z and L effectively cured persistently LCMV-infected cells, suggesting the feasibility of using RNAi therapy to combat viral chronic infections by riboviruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.094683319,-0.048322592000000004,-0.022141763999999998,0.0018492620000000002,-0.097246488,0.052378420999999994,0.057476646,-0.02863455,0.056502820999999995,0.057889614000000006,-0.02953792,-0.077559529,0.044898165,0.067480466,0.035455001,-0.01252687,-0.065772843,0.048002979,0.017032323000000002,0.04147255,0.013247683,0.051444013,-0.022780577000000003,0.052760145,-0.02434442,-0.00889165,0.070548036,-0.030384803999999998,0.019294211000000002,0.051815663
1599,Detection of CK20mRNA in peripheral blood of pancreatic cancer and its clinical significance,"AIM: To detect the expression of CK20mRNA in peripheral blood of pancreatic cancer and evaluate its clinical significance. METHODS: Expression of CK20mRNA in peripheral blood was detected by fluorogenic qualitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 40 cases of pancreatic cancer at the night before operation, in 5 cases of benign pancreatic diseases, in 5 cases of healthy individuals. The relationships were investigated between CK20mRNA expression and the clinicopathological variables, and clinical follow-up outcome in those patients with pancreatic cancer having undergone radical resection. RESULTS: Of the 40 patients with pancreatic cancer, 23 (57.5%) cases were positive for CK20mRNA expression. CK20mRNA expression was significantly correlated with lymphatic metastasis (P = 0.008), histopathological grading (P = 0.009), and pathological stage (P = 0.021); there was no significant correlation between CK20mRNA expression and age, gender, tumor diameter, and depth of invasion. The cumulative metastasis rates of patients with CK20mRNA expression were higher than those of patients with no CK20mRNA expression within 6 mo (34.7% vs 5.9%, P = 0.043) or 12 mo (73.9% vs 35.3%, P = 0.02) after operation. CK20mRNA expression in peripheral blood of pancreatic cancer indicated poorer prognosis. The survival rate of patients with CK20mRNA expression was lower than that of patients with negative CK20mRNA expression (Log-Rank = 13.31, P = 0.0003). CONCLUSION: CK20mRNA is a sensitive and specific molecular marker for the detection of micrometastasis in peripheral blood of patients with pancreatic cancer. The CK20mRNA expression in peripheral blood is correlated with biological characteristic of pancreatic cancer. It can help to predict the prognosis of pancreatic cancer after operation, and to determine which patient will benefit from aggressive adjuvant therapies.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.016098209,-0.013397633999999999,-0.000664943,-0.125117479,-0.066931634,0.0041148999999999995,-0.012508041000000001,0.017242814,-0.034431274,-0.032377235,-0.030466946,0.001032833,-0.007397104,0.051148558,-0.030719246000000002,0.015892059,0.01430557,-0.012732684,-0.023850168999999997,-0.043962604,0.03248996,-0.026555337999999998,-0.003430528,-0.002958125,-0.030601929,-0.0046733009999999995,0.009762236,0.027328122000000003,0.01030513,-0.036611801
1604,High-yield expression of recombinant SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid protein in methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris,"AIM: Nucleocapsid (N) protein plays an important role in reproduction and pathological reaction of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SCoV), the antigenicity of the protein is better than spike (S) protein. This study was to find a highly specific and antigenic recombinant SCoV nucleocapsid (rSCoVN) protein, and to provide a basis for further researches on early diagnosis of SARS. METHODS: Full length cDNA of SCoV nucleocapsid (SCoVN) protein was amplified through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into yeast expression vector pPIC3.5K to construct plasmid of pPIC3.5K-SCoVN. The plasmid was linearized and then transformed into Pichia pastoris (P.pastoris) GS115 (His(-)Mut(+)) by electroporation. His(+)Mut(+) recombinant strains were identified by PCR and cultivated on MM/MD plates. The influence of different factors on biomass and rSCoVN protein production during induction phase, such as various induction media, dissolved oxygen (DO) and different final concentrations of methanol, was subsequently studied. The expression level and activation were detected by SDS-PAGE and Western-blot respectively. RESULTS: All of the recombinants were His(+)Mut(+) after transformation of P.pastoris with linearized plasmids. The BMMY medium was optimal for recombinant ScoVN (rSCoVN) protein expression and growth of the recombinant strains. The final optimal concentration of methanol was 20 mL/L, the DO had a significant effect on rSCoVN protein expression and growth of recombinant strains. The rSCoVN protein expressed in recombinant strains was about 8% of the total cell protein, 520 mg/L of rSCoVN protein was achieved, and a maximum cell A at 600 nm of 62 was achieved in shake flask culture. The rSCoVN protein had a high specificity against mouse-anti-SARS-CoVN-mAb and SARS positive sera, but had no cross-reaction with normal human serum. The biological activity of rSCoVN expressed in P.pastoris was about 4-fold higher than that expressed in E.coli when the same rSCoVN protein quantity was used. CONCLUSION: Active recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus nucleocapsid (rSCoVN) protein can be successfully expressed in recombinant methylotrophic yeast P.pastoris GS115. The rSCoVN protein has a high specificity against SARS-CoVN-mAb and SARS positive sera, but has no cross-reaction with normal human serum.

1605,Novel Nonnucleoside Inhibitor of Hepatitis C Virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase,"A novel nonnucleoside inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), [(1R)-5-cyano-8-methyl-1-propyl-1,3,4,9-tetrahydropyano[3,4-b]indol-1-yl] acetic acid (HCV-371), was discovered through high-throughput screening followed by chemical optimization. HCV-371 displayed broad inhibitory activities against the NS5B RdRp enzyme, with 50% inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 1.8 μM for 90% of the isolates derived from HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, and 3a. HCV-371 showed no inhibitory activity against a panel of human polymerases, including mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, and other unrelated viral polymerases, demonstrating its specificity for the HCV polymerase. A single administration of HCV-371 to cells containing the HCV subgenomic replicon for 3 days resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of the steady-state levels of viral RNA and protein. Multiple treatments with HCV-371 for 16 days led to a >3-log(10) reduction in the HCV RNA level. In comparison, multiple treatments with a similar inhibitory dose of alpha interferon resulted in a 2-log(10) reduction of the viral RNA level. In addition, treatment of cells with a combination of HCV-371 and pegylated alpha interferon resulted in an additive antiviral activity. Within the effective antiviral concentrations of HCV-371, there was no effect on cell viability and metabolism. The intracellular antiviral specificity of HCV-371 was demonstrated by its lack of activity in cells infected with several DNA or RNA viruses. Fluorescence binding studies show that HCV-371 binds the NS5B with an apparent dissociation constant of 150 nM, leading to high selectivity and lack of cytotoxicity in the antiviral assays.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.141798791,-0.045583834000000004,-0.029117612999999997,0.014883872,-0.117515886,0.009778387,0.077537986,0.007626411,0.034506302,0.017554677,0.013874381000000002,0.107997155,-0.001524126,0.066559805,-0.049670741,-0.040522559,0.023978942000000003,0.291878821,0.365908267,-0.153981055,-0.08015412200000001,-0.004595945,0.13224897300000002,0.069115335,-0.076668889,-0.073423771,-0.070553548,0.082483138,-0.080027957,-0.048434594000000004
1612,Pathogenesis of Malaria and Clinically Similar Conditions,"There is now wide acceptance of the concept that the similarity between many acute infectious diseases, be they viral, bacterial, or parasitic in origin, is caused by the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines initiated when the organism interacts with the innate immune system. This is also true of certain noninfectious states, such as the tissue injury syndromes. This review discusses the historical origins of these ideas, which began with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and spread from their origins in malaria research to other fields. As well the more established proinflammatory mediators, such as TNF, interleukin-1, and lymphotoxin, the roles of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, which are chiefly inhibitory, are discussed. The established and potential roles of two more recently recognized contributors, overactivity of the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and the escape of high-mobility-group box 1 (HMGB1) protein from its normal location into the circulation, are also put in context. The pathogenesis of the disease caused by falciparum malaria is then considered in the light of what has been learned about the roles of these mediators in these other diseases, as well as in malaria itself.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.048392647999999996,-0.023858886,-0.0029204290000000004,-0.09745572599999999,-0.060226674,0.053612651,0.062324809,-0.025815095,0.018725244,0.01297307,-0.034235462,-0.012542474,0.017288579,-0.018544052,-0.014064739,-0.003197158,-0.0023499000000000003,-0.012799178000000001,-0.050632715999999994,-0.0072988359999999995,-0.010575852,-0.006640054,-0.029731082000000002,-0.02719585,0.013393028000000001,-0.002202819,-0.018162971,-0.010204751,0.045988724,-0.039176399
1623,Reverse Transcription-PCR Assays for Detection of Bovine Enteric Caliciviruses (BEC) and Analysis of the Genetic Relationships among BEC and Human Caliciviruses,"Two genetically distinct bovine enteric caliciviruses (BECs) have been identified: the norovirus (NLV) Jena and Newbury Agent-2 (NA-2) BECs, which are genetically related to human noroviruses, and the Nebraska (NB) BECs, which is related to sapoviruses and lagoviruses but may also represent a new calicivirus genus. The prevalence of these two BEC genotypes in cattle is unknown. Although reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) primers for human NLV recognize NLV-BECs, the genetic relationships between NLV from humans and the NLV-BECs commonly circulating in cattle is undefined. In the present study, veal calf fecal samples were assayed for enteric caliciviruses by using six RT-PCR primer sets designed for the detection of human NLVs or BECs. Caliciviruses genetically related to the NLV-BEC Jena and NA-2 strains or to the recently characterized NB BEC strain were identified in three of four and four of four sampled veal herds, respectively. Extended 3′-terminal genome sequences of two NLV-BECs, designated CV95-OH and CV186-OH, encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; open reading frame 1 [ORF-1]), VP1 (ORF-2), and VP2 (ORF-3) genes were determined. Phylogenetic and sequence identity analyses of each genome region demonstrated these viruses to be most closely related to the NLV-BEC Jena and NA-2 strains. In initial testing, the human P289-P290 (P289/290) primer set was found to be the most sensitive for calicivirus detection. However, its failure to identify all positive fecal pools (as determined by other assays) led us to design two new primer sets, CBECU-F/R and NBU-F/R, for the sensitive and specific detection of NLV-BEC (NLV-BEC Jena and NA-2) and BEC-NB-like viruses, respectively. The RT-PCR assays with the new primers were compared against other primer sets, including P289/290. Composite results of the tests completed by using the new assays identified 72% (54 of 75) of veal calf fecal samples as positive, with 21 of 21 sequenced reaction products specific for the target RdRp gene. The same design strategy used for the new BEC assays may also be applicable to the design of similar assays for the detection of human caliciviruses (HuCVs). Our data support the genetic relationship between NLV-BECs and NLV-HuCVs but with the NLV-BECs comprising two clusters within a third NLV genogroup.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.048379832000000005,0.019692723,0.094138827,0.0018319329999999998,0.08095350700000001,-0.006650363,-0.000105249,4.4e-05,-0.017833795,-0.012831995,-0.012649841,0.049014765,-0.003239084,-0.02415905,0.008699586,-0.061881944,0.026275469,0.009380649,-0.003232402,-0.059010886,0.040382292,0.019129578,-0.022907043999999998,0.041871661,-0.006276611,-0.021394985,0.015483423999999999,-0.037474588999999996,0.01725951,0.001520053

1630,"Comparison of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization for the detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in pigs","Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization were compared for the detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Fifteen piglets experimentally infected with PEDV were used in the study. In addition, 94 diarrheic piglets submitted to the Department of Veterinary Pathology in Seoul National University for diagnosis of PEDV infection were used to compare the 3 methods. Antigen and nucleic acid of PEDV were detected in 15/15, 13/15, and 14/15 of the intestinal and fecal samples from the PEDV-inoculated pigs by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization, respectively. The virus was isolated from 15/15 of the jejunal samples from the PEDV-inoculated pigs. Neither PEDV antigen nor PEDV nucleic acid was detected in the intestinal and fecal samples from mock-infected control pigs. Of the 94 samples, 63 were positive for PEDV by all 3 techniques. Six samples were positive for PEDV by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Three samples were positive for PEDV by in situ hybridization and RT-PCR. Seven samples were positive for PEDV by RT-PCR. Although RT-PCR identified the presence of PEDV more frequently than the other methods, when only formalin-fixed tissues are submitted, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization would be useful methods for the detection of PEDV antigen and nucleic acid.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.026046431000000002,0.040405118999999996,0.190495451,-0.10043495300000001,0.061442406,0.015010896999999999,-0.030849407000000002,-0.030984285,-0.02395627,-0.047864742,0.082272514,0.103103687,-0.209672095,0.084910715,0.365330295,-0.267830895,-0.025385926,0.056022286,-0.094486721,0.184156796,-0.260203366,-0.090734315,0.129543829,-0.08616431599999999,-0.043264987000000005,-0.040961318999999996,-0.039209647,0.016557435,0.070648502,-0.008245893
1634,"Molecular Determinants of Virulence, Cell Tropism, and Pathogenic Phenotype of Infectious Bursal Disease Virus","Infectious bursal disease viruses (IBDVs), belonging to the family Birnaviridae, exhibit a wide range of immunosuppressive potential, pathogenicity, and virulence for chickens. The genomic segment A encodes all the structural (VP2, VP4, and VP3) and nonstructural proteins, whereas segment B encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (VP1). To identify the molecular determinants for the virulence, pathogenic phenotype, and cell tropism of IBDV, we prepared full-length cDNA clones of a virulent strain, Irwin Moulthrop (IM), and constructed several chimeric cDNA clones of segments A and B between the attenuated vaccine strain (D78) and the virulent IM or GLS variant strain. Using the cRNA-based reverse-genetics system developed for IBDV, we generated five chimeric viruses after transfection by electroporation procedures in Vero or chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells, one of which was recovered after propagation in embryonated eggs. To evaluate the characteristics of the recovered viruses in vivo, we inoculated 3-week-old chickens with D78, IM, GLS, or chimeric viruses and analyzed their bursae for pathological lesions 3 days postinfection. Viruses in which VP4, VP4-VP3, and VP1 coding sequences of the virulent strain IM were substituted for the corresponding region in the vaccine strain failed to induce hemorrhagic lesions in the bursa. In contrast, viruses in which the VP2 coding region of the vaccine strain was replaced with the variant GLS or virulent IM strain caused rapid bursal atrophy or hemorrhagic lesions in the bursa, as seen with the variant or classical virulent strain, respectively. These results show that the virulence and pathogenic-phenotype markers of IBDV reside in VP2. Moreover, one of the chimeric viruses containing VP2 sequences of the virulent strain could not be recovered in Vero or CEF cells but was recovered in embryonated eggs, suggesting that VP2 contains the determinants for cell tropism. Similarly, one of the chimeric viruses containing the VP1 segment of the virulent strain could not be recovered in Vero cells but was recovered in CEF cells, suggesting that VP1 contains the determinants for cell-specific replication in Vero cells. By comparing the deduced amino acid sequences of the D78 and IM strains and their reactivities with monoclonal antibody 21, which binds specifically to virulent IBDV, the putative amino acids involved in virulence and cell tropism were identified. Our results indicate that residues Gln at position 253 (Gln253), Asp279, and Ala284 of VP2 are involved in the virulence, cell tropism, and pathogenic phenotype of virulent IBDV.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.10559548,-0.048148385,0.012369408,-0.058878757000000004,0.048913778,0.053166943,-0.047747145,-0.036874212999999996,0.029331032000000003,0.048241247,-4.8200000000000006e-05,0.005869467,-0.010307371999999999,-0.012925931000000002,0.025149786,-0.044266640999999995,-0.018719357,-0.023574729,0.004999665,0.024407402,0.0686719,-0.012789528,0.011676127,0.060229627,0.003230196,0.027099667999999997,0.01231761,-0.013055801,-0.090957392,0.026158132999999997
1638,Induction of Caspase-Dependent Apoptosis in Cultured Cells by the Avian Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus,"Avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the causative agent of chicken infectious bronchitis, an acute, highly contagious viral respiratory disease. Replication of IBV in Vero cells causes extensive cytopathic effects (CPE), leading to destruction of the entire monolayer and the death of infected cells. In this study, we investigated the cell death processes during acute IBV infection and the underlying mechanisms. The results show that both necrosis and apoptosis may contribute to the death of infected cells in lytic IBV infection. Caspase-dependent apoptosis, as characterized by chromosomal condensation, DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase degradation, was detected in IBV-infected Vero cells. Addition of the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK to the culture media showed inhibition of the hallmarks of apoptosis and increase of the release of virus to the culture media at 16 h postinfection. However, neither the necrotic process nor the productive replication of IBV in Vero cells was severely affected by the inhibition of apoptosis. Screening of 11 IBV-encoded proteins suggested that a 58-kDa mature cleavage product could induce apoptotic changes in cells transiently expressing the protein. This study adds one more example to the growing list of animal viruses that induce apoptosis during their replication cycles.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.10180275,-0.05016430400000001,0.009894116,-0.118334718,0.022714511,0.096094875,-0.10387077800000001,-0.137443766,0.164885387,0.286379883,0.035927321,-0.056800290999999996,-0.056599347,0.171112268,-0.105807395,0.15638442,0.0238646,-0.03665948,0.061313035,0.077790625,-0.032321766,0.018808645,0.021242114,-0.085943485,0.049460650999999994,0.07273247299999999,-0.070181359,0.07943596900000001,-0.027641797000000003,-0.075477219
1667,MHC-genotype of progeny influenced by parental infection.,"In a previous series of in vitro fertilization experiments with mice we found non-random combination of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotypes in the very early embryos. Our results suggested that two selection mechanisms were operating: (i) the eggs selected specific sperm; and (ii) the second meiotic division in the eggs was influenced by the type of sperm that entered the egg. Furthermore, the proportion of MHC-heterozygous embryos varied over time, suggesting that non-random fertilization was dependent on an external factor that changed over time. As a higher frequency of heterozygous individuals correlated with an uncontrolled epidemic by MHV (mouse hepatitis virus), we suggested that MHV-infection might have influenced the outcome of fertilization. Here, we present an experiment that tests this hypothesis. We infected randomly chosen mice with MHV and sham-infected control mice five days before pairing. We recovered the two-cell embryos from the oviduct, cultured them until the blastocyst stage, and determined the genotype of each resulting blastocyst by polymerase chain reaction. We found the pattern that we expected from our previous experiments: virus-infected mice produced more MHC-heterozygous embryos than sham-infected ones. This suggests that parents are able to promote specific combinations of MHC-haplotypes during fertilization according to the presence or absence of a viral infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.065062056,-0.032283661,0.011664127,-0.072012957,-0.029998228,0.018768587,-0.032862516,-0.012101023,0.030075451,-0.010887421000000001,-0.004922017,-0.033107968,-0.0028072229999999997,0.043217572999999995,0.047193123,0.053294044000000006,-0.049936497999999996,0.003744855,-0.014927718999999999,-0.010087337,0.02976229,-0.029996562999999997,0.033678491,0.025224426,0.039614274,0.049658625,0.004073027,-0.018510465,-0.046556528,-0.002023569
1670,Functional Characterization of Naturally Occurring Variants of Human Hepatitis B Virus Containing the Core Internal Deletion Mutation,"Naturally occurring variants of human hepatitis B virus (HBV) containing the core internal deletion (CID) mutation have been found frequently in HBV carriers worldwide. Despite numerous sequence analysis reports of CID variants in patients, in the past decade, CID variants have not been characterized functionally, and thus their biological significance to HBV infection remains unclear. We report here two different CID variants identified from two patients that are replication defective, most likely due to the absence of detectable core protein. In addition, we were unable to detect the presence of the precore protein and e antigen from CID variants. However, the production of polymerase appeared to be normal. The replication defect of the CID variants can be rescued in trans by complementation with wild-type core protein. The rescued CID variant particles, which utilize the wild-type core protein, presumably are enveloped properly since they can be secreted into the medium and band at a position similar to that of mature wild-type Dane particles, as determined by gradient centrifugation analysis. Our results also provide an explanation for the association of CID variants with helper or wild-type HBV in nature. The significance of CID variants in HBV infection and pathogenesis is discussed.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.067026164,-0.038391777,-0.009571996,-0.077837332,-0.03015513,0.026692016000000002,0.008449919,0.00117705,0.000336081,-0.003480366,-0.014528231,0.025035166,-0.0229367,-0.003475331,0.008809796,0.001416786,-0.010989051000000001,0.011722096000000001,-0.009649521,0.010155541,0.057467950999999996,-0.015772681,0.01080382,0.028820152,0.019391721,0.028287432999999997,-0.00244062,-0.01622745,-0.036179592999999996,-0.013599123000000001
1678,Serological and molecular evidence of enterovirus infection in patients with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy.,"OBJECTIVE: To study the relative diagnostic value of enterovirus-specific molecular biological and serological assays in patients with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy, and to investigate the possible role of other cardiotropic viruses in dilated cardiomyopathy. DESIGN: Analysis of recipient myocardial tissue and serum from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and controls undergoing cardiac transplantation for end-stage cardiac disease. SETTING: University virology department and transplantation unit. METHODS: Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequence analysis of myocardial RNA and DNA; enterovirus-specific in situ hybridization; enterovirus-specific immunoglobulin M detection. RESULTS: Enterovirus RNA was detected in myocardial tissue from only a small proportion of (five of 75) hearts. However, although enterovirus-specific immunoglobulin M responses were detected in 22 (28%) of 39 controls patients, a significantly higher prevalence was observed among patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (22 (56%) of 39 patients; P < 0.005). All enteroviruses detected in myocardium showed greatest nucleotide sequence homology with coxsackievirus type B3. Detection of enterovirus RNA in myocardium by the polymerase chain reaction and by in situ hybridisation gave comparable results. Other potentially cardiotropic virus genomes, including human cytomegalovirus, influenzaviruses, and coronaviruses were not detected in myocardium. CONCLUSION: This study found that enterovirus-specific immunoglobulin M responses provided the strongest evidence of enterovirus involvement in patients with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the high background prevalence of these responses limits their diagnostic value. The finding that enteroviruses detected in myocardium were coxsackievirus type B3 accords with recent findings in patients with acute myocarditis, and indicates that this serotype is the major cardiotropic human enterovirus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.041590852000000005,-0.021817949,-0.011351925,-0.05493826,-0.0023314810000000003,-0.051849942,-0.028559336,0.046478932,-0.103232492,0.040425159,-0.022230145,0.011346682,0.028404707,0.028117239,-0.014851495,-0.019202393999999998,-0.008441822,0.009844762,-0.004777419000000001,-0.01078019,0.042847168,-0.058904344000000004,0.007037215,0.020178008,-0.026567222999999997,-0.01591825,-0.031382112999999996,0.029072962999999997,-0.039742704,0.003461115
1698,"ADA3: a gene, identified by resistance to GAL4-VP16, with properties similar to and different from those of ADA2.","We describe the isolation of a yeast gene, ADA3, mutations in which prevent the toxicity of GAL4-VP16 in vivo. Toxicity was previously proposed to be due to the trapping of general transcription factors required at RNA polymerase II promoters (S. L. Berger, B. Piña, N. Silverman, G. A. Marcus, J. Agapite, J. L. Regier, S. J. Triezenberg, and L. Guarente, Cell 70:251-265, 1992). trans activation by VP16 as well as the acidic activation domain of GCN4 is reduced in the mutant. Other activation domains, such as those of GAL4 and HAP4, are only slightly affected in the mutant. This spectrum is similar to that observed for mutants with lesions in ADA2, a gene proposed to encode a transcriptional adaptor. The ADA3 gene is not absolutely essential for cell growth, but gene disruption mutants grow slowly and are temperature sensitive. Strains doubly disrupted for ada2 and ada3 grow no more slowly than single mutants, providing further evidence that these genes function in the same pathway. Selection of initiation sites by the general transcriptional machinery in vitro is altered in the ada3 mutant, providing a clue that ADA3 could be a novel general transcription factor involved in the response to acidic activators.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.133731409,-0.038259155,-0.004648414,-0.06023735400000001,-0.020555962,0.023748923999999998,-0.020728956,-0.020135195,0.033442373,-0.016706053999999998,-0.040741684,-0.006633948000000001,-0.019490277,0.025706167999999998,-0.017352806999999998,0.011656167,0.000438362,-0.043872508,-0.050252062,-0.015483745,0.04840006,-0.023934765,-0.002145017,0.028877226000000002,-0.015225272,-0.027835073,0.00198833,0.016654446,0.010744438,-0.059028105
1700,Definition of a subset of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells that are permissive to human cytomegalovirus infection.,"The identity of cells responsible for transmission of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in blood products or bone marrow transplants is unknown. We have tested the capacity of HCMV to in vitro infect human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors and found that certain PBMC are permissive to HCMV infection. In vitro-infected viable cells were double stained for surface expression of different HMCV proteins and for cell-type-specific antigens to allow the identification of sensitive cells. All analysis were performed on viable cells, using HCMV-specific monoclonal antibodies and automated flow cytofluorimetry. PBMC were infected either with the laboratory-adapted HCMV strain AD169 or with a virus isolate obtained from a viremic patient. Up to 25% of all PBMC could express the major immediate-early antigen as well as the pp65 antigen, known at the lower matrix protein. Infected cells were mainly CD14+ monocytes, but also a small population of large CD8+ cells were susceptible to HCMV infection. CD19+ B lymphocytes were resistant to HCMV infection. Different populations of infected cells were enriched by using Dynabeads coated with cell-type-specific antibodies, and the presence of infectious virus was demonstrated by incubating the selected and sonicated cell material on human fibroblasts. Only material from infected monocytes and from CD3+ CD8+ cells gave rise to HCMV-specific plaques. The presence of HCMV mRNA as a sign of active viral transcription of the major immediate-early and late pp150 genes in infected cells was demonstrated by using nested reversed polymerase chain reaction. A common denominator was found for all cells that could be infected with HCMV. The CD13 antigen, a 130- to 150-kDa integral membrane protein identical to the enzyme aminopeptidase N, was expressed on all HCMV-permissive cells.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.083745497,-0.033033667,0.00996037,-0.087706844,-0.066355892,0.044446147000000005,0.012646563999999999,-0.045282293,0.06858751,-0.023713367000000003,-0.037367898999999996,-0.063136459,0.02651032,0.106438121,0.032380982,0.009114678000000001,-0.013199748,-0.025805345,0.000755017,0.02364488,0.034812926,0.019098799,0.024886059,-0.006322808,0.025150872999999997,0.031580225,-0.021929835,0.029861587000000002,-0.076351473,0.011959343999999998
1702,Several members of the mouse carcinoembryonic antigen-related glycoprotein family are functional receptors for the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus-A59.,"Mouse hepatitis virus-A59 (MHV-A59), a murine coronavirus, can utilize as a cellular receptor MHVR, a murine glycoprotein in the biliary glycoprotein (BGP) subfamily of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family in the immunoglobulin superfamily (G.S. Dveksler, M. N. Pensiero, C. B. Cardellichio, R. K. Williams, G.-S. Jiang, K. V. Holmes, and C. W. Dieffenbach, J. Virol. 65:6881-6891, 1991). Several different BGP isoforms are expressed in tissues of different mouse strains, and we have explored which of these glycoproteins can serve as functional receptors for MHV-A59. cDNA cloning, RNA-mediated polymerase chain reaction analysis, and Western immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody, CC1, specific for the N-terminal domain of MHVR showed that the inbred mouse strains BALB/c, C3H, and C57BL/6 expressed transcripts and proteins of the MHVR isoform and/or its splice variants but not the mmCGM2 isoform. In contrast, adult SJL/J mice, which are resistant to infection with MHV-A59, express transcripts and proteins only of the mmCGM2-related isoforms, not MHVR. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that the MHVR and mmCGM2 glycoproteins may be encoded by different alleles of the same gene. We studied binding of anti-MHVR antibodies or MHV-A59 virions to proteins encoded by transcripts of MHVR and mmCGM2 and two splice variants of MHVR, one containing two immunoglobulin-like domains [MHVR(2d)] and the other with four domains as in MHVR but with a longer cytoplasmic domain [MHVR(4d)L]. We found that the three isoforms tested could serve as functional receptors for MHV-A59, although only isoforms that include the N-terminal domain of MHVR were recognized by monoclonal antibody CC1 in immunoblots or by MHV-A59 virions in virus overlay protein blot assays. Thus, in addition to MHVR, both the two-domain isoforms, mmCGM2 and MHVR(2d), and the MHVR(4d)L isoform served as functional virus receptors for MHV-A59.

K. Williams, G. S. Jiang, and K. V. Holmes, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:5533-5536, 1991). However, the receptor protein was not detected in some of the susceptible mouse tissues. We therefore examined whether other types of MHV receptor might exist. By polymerase chain reaction with the conserved sequences of murine CEA gene family members (mmCGM) as primers, we detected two CEA-encoding RNAs in the mouse liver. One of them (1.3 kb) encodes mmCGM1, which has previously been identified as the receptor for MHV, and the other one (0.8 kb) was shown to encode another member of mouse CGM, mmCGM2. The sequence analysis showed that mmCGM2 lacks 564 nucleotides in the middle of the gene compared with mmCGM1. These two CEA transcripts are probably derived from the same gene by an alternative splicing mechanism. Expression of either of these cDNA clones in COS-7 cells rendered these cells susceptible to MHV infection, suggesting that not only mmCGM1 but also mmCGM2 serves as a receptor for MHV. The mmCGM2 was the major CEA species in the mouse brain, which is a main target organ for the neurotropic strains of MHV. Very little mmCGM1 was detected in the mouse brain or in cells of the susceptible mouse astrocytoma cell line DBT. This result indicates that MHV may utilize different CEA molecules as the major receptor in the mouse brain and in the liver. This is a first identification of multiple receptors for a single virus. The presence of different receptors in different tissues may explain the target cell specificity of certain MHVs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.114145952,-0.034124295,0.008425572,-0.06965599900000001,0.034182865,-0.01295942,-0.073356541,-0.007044848,0.037509253,-0.057162242,-0.068638226,-0.071161835,0.035494998,0.016159296,0.059313912999999996,0.046470104000000005,-0.061946380999999995,0.035119465,-0.005936246,-0.010978746000000001,0.066024553,-0.023809464,0.0594183,0.069604702,0.10357938,0.115066241,0.013110001999999999,-0.021117481,-0.035175507,-0.017829473000000002
1711,Rapid detection and identification of avian infectious bronchitis virus.,"A rapid and sensitive method for the detection and unambiguous typing of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is described. RNA was isolated from IBV-infected allantoic fluid and was transcribed into cDNA. This cDNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction products were subsequently analyzed on an agarose gel. The presence of IBV-specific RNA in the allantoic fluid then allowed the amplification of a 438-bp DNA fragment from the nucleocapsid (N) gene. For the typing of IBV isolates, we used amplified double-stranded DNA as a template in a sequencing reaction. We report 360 bases of the N gene of 18 IBV isolates. The sequence of the N gene was different between serologically indistinguishable IBV strains and may be a valuable tool in epidemiologic studies.

PCR detected all of 11 different strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) as well as rat sialodacryoadenitis virus but not bovine coronavirus or human coronavirus strains OC43 and 229E. The M gene sequences of bovine coronavirus and human coronavirus OC43 are homologous to that of MHV, but minor differences exist in the primer regions, preventing annealing of the primers.

1723,Hemagglutinin mutations related to attenuation and altered cell tropism of a virulent avian influenza A virus.,"The H5 hemagglutinin (HA) of a highly virulent avian influenza virus, A/Turkey Ontario/7732/66 (H5N9), was previously shown to have five neutralizing epitopes, and escape mutants within one epitope (group 1) were markedly attenuated (M. Philpott, B. C. Easterday, and V. S. Hinshaw, J. Virol. 63:3453-3458, 1989). To define the genetic changes related to these antigenic and biologic properties, the HA genes of mutants within each of the epitope groups were sequenced by using the polymerase chain reaction. The mutations in the attenuated group 1 mutants were located near the distal tip of the HA molecule in close proximity to the receptor-binding site, on the basis of alignment with the three-dimensional structure of the H3 HA. All group 1 mutations involved charged amino acids. The group 1 mutants, similar to the wild-type virus, spread systemically and were recovered from the spleens of infected chickens but, unlike the wild-type virus, failed to produce severe necrosis in the spleens. Viral replication in the spleens was investigated by in situ hybridization of spleen sections from chickens infected with the wild-type or attenuated mutants. Wild-type virus replication was demonstrated in large, mononuclear, macrophagelike cells; however, group 1 mutant virus was detected attached only to erythrocytes within the red pulp. These results suggest that the attenuated mutants differ in their cell tropism within the spleen.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.083003738,-0.058967702999999996,-0.014344889,-0.031871436,0.010056173,0.095629465,-0.018982996000000002,-0.029429971,-0.005764317,-0.009147578,0.015507867,-0.002012704,-0.061279390999999996,0.019536031000000002,0.014744377,0.0017151929999999998,-0.016072773999999998,-0.032937166000000004,-0.045722228,0.044872687,0.091401755,-0.061321814,0.023587732,0.07697477900000001,-0.001176273,0.009805888,-0.007889451,-0.029848938999999998,-0.10815918599999999,-0.05671888
1729,Detection of infectious bursal disease viruses by using cloned cDNA probes.,"A molecular clone representing 445 base pairs at the 3' end of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) genome segment B was used in a dot blot hybridization assay to detect viral RNA from cell culture and from chicken bursa and spleen tissue specimens. The cloned nucleotide sequence represents approximately 14% of the virus-encoded polymerase (VP-1) gene. The lower detection limit of radiolabeled probes prepared from this clone was 0.1 ng of IBDV double-stranded RNA. The probe had broad specificity and was used to detect four serotype 1 IBDV strains and one serotype 2 IBDV strain. This probe, however, did not cross-react with nucleic acid extracted from nine unrelated poultry viruses.

1744,The impact of PARPs and ADP-ribosylation on inflammation and host–pathogen interactions,"Poly-adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerases (PARPs) promote ADP-ribosylation, a highly conserved, fundamental posttranslational modification (PTM). PARP catalytic domains transfer the ADP-ribose moiety from NAD(+) to amino acid residues of target proteins, leading to mono- or poly-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation or PARylation). This PTM regulates various key biological and pathological processes. In this review, we focus on the roles of the PARP family members in inflammation and host–pathogen interactions. Here we give an overview the current understanding of the mechanisms by which PARPs promote or suppress proinflammatory activation of macrophages, and various roles PARPs play in virus infections. We also demonstrate how innovative technologies, such as proteomics and systems biology, help to advance this research field and describe unanswered questions.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.089934946,-0.036939774,-0.00491254,-0.055283592,-0.068433884,0.051777004,0.074592036,-0.021452006000000003,0.043872071,0.012992597,-0.04686308,0.025261323999999998,0.012898178,-0.057685855999999994,-0.017791022,-0.016064049,0.037488543,-0.032324013,-0.054164471,0.018990429,-0.020253048,-0.001799778,-0.035409222000000004,-0.061923041,0.056259221,0.029203765,-0.039925323,0.020481014,0.039999743,-0.068880391
1745,"Divergent coronaviruses detected in wild birds in Brazil, including a central park in São Paulo","Coronaviruses are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses associated with important avian diseases. Their relatively high rates of mutation and recombination frequencies allow them to adapt to new hosts and ecological niches. Although Brazil has 18% of global avian species diversity, studies regarding the presence of avian viral diseases in wild birds in South America are scarce. In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis of the presence of CoVs in 746 wild birds. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were obtained and placed together in vials containing VTM transport medium collected in different regions of Brazil between 2006 and 2013. Screening for viral nucleic acid was performed using conventional RT-PCR and pancoronavirus nested PCR. Positive samples were characterized by partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, and ensuing phylogenetic analysis was performed to investigate the association between virus epidemiology and bird migration routes. Coronavirus RNA were detected and sequenced from six samples, in which three were related to gammacoronaviruses group and the other three to deltacoronavirus group. Our study documents the presence of CoVs related to avian gamma- and deltacoronaviruses circulating in both urban- and poultry-farm regions of Brazil, implicating wild birds as potential carriers of CoVs which may represent a risk to poultry farms and public health in Brazil.

1746,Isolation of stem/progenitor cells from normal lung tissue of adult humans,"Objectives: This study aimed to isolate and characterize stem/progenitor cells, starting from normal airway epithelia, obtained from human adults. Materials and methods: Cultures of multicellular spheroids were obtained from human lung tissue specimens after mechanical and enzymatic digestion. Tissue‐specific markers were detected on their cells by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent techniques. Ultrastructural morphology of the spheroids (termed as bronchospheres) was evaluated by electron microscopy, gene expression analysis was performed by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, and gene down‐regulation was analysed by an RNA interference technique. Results: Bronchospheres were found to be composed of cells with high expression of stem cell regulatory genes, which was not or was only weakly detectable in original tissues. Morphological analysis showed that bronchospheres were composed of mixed phenotype cells with type II alveolar and Clara cell features, highlighting their airway resident cell origin. In addition to displaying specific pulmonary and epithelial commitment, bronchospheres showed mesenchymal features. Silencing of the Slug gene, known to play a pivotal role in epithelial–mesenchymal transition processes and which was highly expressed in bronchospheres but not in original tissue, led bronchospheres to gain a differentiated bronchial/alveolar phenotype and to lose the stemness gene expression pattern. Conclusions: Ours is the first study to describe ex vivo expansion of stem/progenitor cells resident in human lung epithelia, and our results suggest that the epithelial–mesenchymal transition process, still active in a subset of airway cells, may regulate transit of stem/progenitor cells towards epithelial differentiation.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.088562763,-0.032066143,0.011357973,-0.108957233,-0.044254197,0.023666815,-0.017189907,-0.058389693,0.060663594,-0.036793533999999996,-0.08746214199999999,-0.05882384400000001,0.000985622,0.13061334,-0.00020182599999999997,-0.008723332,-0.011438242,-0.053903312,-0.029812367000000003,-0.049409090999999995,0.073216158,-0.014044932,0.049847235,0.022840907999999997,-0.052680092000000005,-0.011012083,-0.020635133,0.078952633,-0.020586431999999998,-0.068339882
1749,MYCOPLASMA FAUCIUM AND BREAST CANCER,"Viruses and bacteria are the cause of a large number of different human diseases. It is believed that some of them may even contribute to the development of cancer. The present work is dedicated to the identification of mycoplasmas in patients with breast cancer. Mycoplasmas may participate in the development of several human diseases including chronic fatigue syndrome, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, atypical pneumonia, etc. Moreover, there is a reason to believe that mycoplasma can participate in the development of cancer, leukemia and lymphoma.\n\nDNA samples from blood, saliva and tumor tissues of the Oncology Institute of Moldova patients diagnosed with breast cancer were analyzed. Mycoplasma testing was performed using nested PCR method. For Mycoplasma spp. detection, we used primers from the region of the 16S-23S RNA genes. The identification of Mycoplasma faucium, Mycoplasma salivarium and Mycoplasma orale was performed by nested PCR with primers for RNA polymerase beta subunit gene corresponding to mycoplasma.\n\nM.faucium and M.salivarius was found in saliva at about 100%, and M.orale at a frequency of about 50%. Only M.faucium was found with the frequency of about 60% in the tissue of the patients. Moreover, a fairly high rate of detection of mycoplasma is observed both in the cases when primers for RNA polymerase gene and primers for 16S-23S RNA were used.\n\nWe found M.faucium in tumor tissues of patients diagnosed with breast cancer. It is known that mycoplasmas are able to stimulate the synthesis of certain cytokines, which act as mitogenes on the cell. We assume that M.faucium can stimulate the mitogenes synthesis in breast tissues (e.g., cytokines) which, in turn, stimulate cell division and thus participate in the initiation of breast cancer.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.010104726999999999,-0.008700498000000001,0.021108465,-0.047118195,-0.031613643,-0.024677287000000003,-0.011214699,0.044789019000000006,-0.072557551,0.033144094,-0.012761515,-0.007371595,0.018759278,0.030478752999999997,-0.009706011,-0.002245566,0.009089276,0.012392392,-0.017414008999999998,-0.029836951,0.021420547,0.018996972,0.053758130999999994,-1.56e-05,0.0086987,-0.019970517,-0.027161072,0.032235992000000005,0.023447162999999997,-0.031472729
1752,Viral fitness predicts the magnitude and direction of perturbations in the infected host transcriptome,"Determining the fitness of viral genotypes has become a standard practice in virology as it is essential to evaluate their evolutionary potential. Darwinian fitness, defined as the advantage of a given genotype with respect to a reference one, is a mesoscopic property that captures into a single figure differences in performance at every stage of viral infection. But to which extent viral fitness results from particular molecular interactions with host factors and regulatory networks during infection? Can we identify host genes, and then functional classes, whose expression depends on viral fitness? Here, we compared the transcriptomes of tobacco plants infected with seven genotypes of tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) that differ in fitness. We found that the larger the fitness differences among genotypes, the more dissimilar the transcriptomic profiles are. Consistently, two different mutations, one in the viral RNA polymerase and another in the viral suppressor of RNA silencing, that led to close fitness values, also resulted in significantly similar gene expression profiles. Moreover, we identified host genes whose expression showed a significant correlation, positive or negative, with TEV fitness. Over-expression of genes with positive correlation activates hormone-and RNA silencing-mediated pathways of plant defense. By contrast, under-expression of genes negatively correlated reduces metabolism, growth, and development. Overall, these results reveal the high information content of viral fitness, and suggest its potential use to predict differences in genomic profiles of infected hosts.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.096591224,-0.042872411,-0.017973776,-0.042510429,-0.040308539,0.018824399,0.05556283099999999,-0.01095673,0.013171068999999999,0.009764554,-0.032103707999999995,-0.026896017999999997,-0.007613685,0.074570645,-0.014324216,-0.0052595590000000005,-0.028035356,-0.046816288,-0.061486779000000005,-0.031489428,0.023383618,0.0028461579999999997,-0.024945698,0.058277481,-0.10938204300000001,-0.064577809,0.08047578700000001,-0.036080833,0.011387378,-0.011668682

The products of mgtA and entA are involved in transport and homeostasis of Mg2+ and Fe3+ ion and thereby required for bacterial survival in the presence of reactive nitrogen/oxygen species produced by the host macrophages, whereas, malK and malE genes are involved in transport of maltose sugar, that is one of the major carbon source in the gastrointestinal tract of human. The formation of stable intramolecular G-quadruplex structures by SE-PGQs was confirmed by employing CD, EMSA and NMR spectroscopy. Cellular studies revealed the inhibitory effect of 9-amino acridine on Salmonella enterica growth. Next, CD melting analysis demonstrated the stabilizing effect of 9-amino acridine on SE-PGQs. Further, polymerase inhibition and RT-qPCR assays emphasize the biological relevance of predicted G-quadruplex in the expression of PGQ possessing genes and demonstrate the G-quadruplexes as a potential drug target for the devolping novel therapeutics for combating Salmonella enterica infection.\n\nAuthor SummarySince last several decades scientific community has witnessed a rapid increase in number of such human pathogenic bacterial species that acquired resistant to multiple antibacterial agents. Currently, emergence of multidrug-resistant strains remain a major public health concern for clinical investigators that rings a global alarm to search for novel and highly conserved drug targets. Recently, G-quadruplex structure forming nucleic acid sequences were endorsed as highly conserved Drug target for preventing infection of several human pathogens including viral and protozoan species. Therefore, here we explored the presence G-quadruplex forming motif in genome of Salmonella enterica bacteria that causes food poisoning, and enteric fever in human. The formation of intra molecular G-quadruplex structure in four genes (mgtA, entA, malE and malK) was confirmed by NMR, CD and EMSA. The 9-amino acridine, a known G-quadruplex binder has been shown to stabilize the predicted G-quadruplex motif and decreases the expressioin of G-quadruplex hourbouring genes using RT-PCR and cellular toxicity assay. This study concludes the presence of G-quadruplex motifs in essential genes of Salmonella enterica genome as a novel and conserved drug target and 9-amino acridine as candidate small molecule for preventing the infection of Salmonella enterica using a G4 mediated inhibition mechanism.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.076180925,-0.010745831,0.028465251,-0.050156515,-0.001309926,0.043500507,0.048856465999999994,0.0007787369999999999,0.025089253,0.004647685,-0.07734635200000001,0.025143548999999998,0.029304482000000003,-0.061480890999999996,-0.002951322,-0.021226218999999998,0.04496026400000001,0.038686085,-0.033168272,0.0020587360000000002,0.021849046,0.037172334,-0.03079071,0.052053876,-0.024021029,-0.029767372,0.041304613999999996,0.016896013999999997,0.07576419,-0.020053371
1758,Biological Evaluation of Molecules of the azaBINOL Class as Antiviral Agents: Specific Inhibition of HIV-1 RNase H Activity by 7-Isopropoxy-8-(naphth-1-yl)quinoline,"Inspired by bioactive biaryl-containing natural products found in plants and the marine environment, a series of synthetic compounds belonging to the azaBINOL chiral ligand family was evaluated for antiviral activity against HIV-1. Testing of 39 unique azaBINOLs in a singleround infectivity assay resulted in the identification of three promising antiviral compounds, including 7-isopropoxy-8-(naphth-1-yl)quinoline (azaBINOL B#24), which exhibited low-micromolar activity. The active compounds and several close structural analogues were further tested against three different HIV-1 envelope pseudotyped viruses as well as in a full-virus replication system (EASY-HIT). Mode-of-action studies using a time-of-addition assay indicated that azaBINOL B#24 acts after viral entry but before viral assembly and budding. HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) assays that individually test for polymerase and RNase H activity were used to demonstrate that B#24 inhibits RNase H activity, most likely allosterically. Further binding analysis using bio-layer interferometry (BLI) showed that B#24 interacts with HIV-1 RT in a highly specific manner. These results indicate that azaBINOL B#24 is a potentially viable, novel lead for the development of new HIV-1 RNase H inhibitors. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the survey of libraries of synthetic compounds, designed purely with the goal of facilitating chemical synthesis in mind, may yield unexpected and selective drug leads for the development of new antiviral agents.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.073828216,0.001167487,0.030783098,0.038703971000000004,-0.112520195,0.062851721,0.086137554,-0.013388376,0.02891246,0.018390034,0.010453849,0.055415322999999996,-0.014733206,0.018513706,-0.013396307,-0.010829823999999998,0.0023707529999999997,0.10141698099999999,0.05873184,-0.002391689,-0.01706857,0.029187509,-0.020215078,0.07482788,0.04787486,0.04400314599999999,0.059040127000000005,-0.054669141,0.070118629,0.023374521000000002
1759,A specific sequence in the genome of respiratory syncytial virus regulates the generation of copy-back defective viral genomes,"Defective viral genomes of the copy-back type (cbDVGs) are the primary initiators of the antiviral immune response during infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) both in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism governing cbDVG generation remains unknown, thereby limiting our ability to manipulate cbDVG content in order to modulate the host response to infection. Here we report a specific genomic signal that mediates the generation of RSV cbDVGs. Using a customized bioinformatics tool, we identified regions in the RSV genome frequently used to generate cbDVGs during infection. We then created a minigenome system to validate the function of one of these sequences and to determine if specific nucleotides were essential for cbDVG generation at that position. Further, we created a recombinant virus that selectively produced a specific cbDVG based on variations introduced in this sequence. The identified sequence was also found as a common site for cbDVG generation during natural RSV infections, and common cbDVGs generated at this sequence were found among samples from various infected patients. These data demonstrate that sequences encoded in the viral genome are critical determinants of the location of cbDVG generation and, therefore, this is not a stochastic process. Most importantly, these findings open the possibility of genetically manipulating cbDVG formation to modulate infection outcome. Author summaryCopy-back defective viral genomes (cbDVGs) regulate infection and pathogenesis of Mononegavirales. cbDVG are believed to arise from random errors that occur during virus replication and the predominant hypothesis is that the viral polymerase is the main driver of cbDVG generation. Here we describe a specific genomic sequence in the RSV genome that is necessary for the generation of a large proportion of the cbDVG population present during infection. We identified specific nucleotides that when modified altered cbDVG generation at this position, and we created a recombinant virus that selectively produced cbDVGs based on mutations in this sequence. These data demonstrate that the generation of RSV cbDVGs is regulated by specific viral sequences and that these sequences can be manipulated to alter the content and quality of cbDVG generated during infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.042154363,-0.063604452,-0.021084796,-0.010891655,0.00795985,-0.013977627,0.001632536,-0.023299445,0.053756725,-0.008118145,-0.015514985,-0.062831144,-0.009375875,-0.043703835999999996,-0.008624386999999999,-0.009467309,-0.030011277000000003,0.038467349,-0.043358222,0.011180068999999999,0.033888145,-0.05446001599999999,-0.012993822,0.00040103199999999995,0.028190991000000002,-0.07852838200000001,0.108427928,0.032860627,-0.039335533,0.052242019
1761,Stress-Induced Transcriptional Memory Accelerates Promoter-Proximal Pause-Release and Decelerates Termination over Mitotic Divisions,"Heat shock triggers an instant reprogramming of gene and enhancer transcription, but whether cells encode a memory to stress, at the level of nascent transcription, has remained unknown. Here, we measured transcriptional response to acute heat stress in unconditioned cells and in daughters of cells that had been exposed to a single or multiple heat shocks. Tracking RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) genome-wide at nucleotide-resolution revealed that cells precisely remember their transcriptional identity throughout stress, restoring Pol II distribution at gene bodies and enhancers upon recovery. However, single heat shock primed faster gene-induction in the daughter cells by increasing promoter-proximal Pol II pausing, and accelerating the pause-release. In repeatedly stressed cells, both basal and inducible transcription was refined, and pre-mRNA processing decelerated, which retained transcripts on chromatin and reduced recycling of the transcription machinery. These results mechanistically uncovered how the steps of pause-release and termination maintain transcriptional memory over mitosis.\n\nHighlights-Cell type-specific transcription precisely recovers after heat-induced reprogramming\n-Single heat shock primes genes for accelerated induction over mitotic divisions via increased promoter-proximal Pol II pausing and faster pause-release\n-Multiple heat shocks refine basal and inducible transcription over mitotic divisions to support survival of the daughter cells\n-Decelerated termination at active genes reduces recycling of Pol II to heat-activated promoters and enhancers\n-HSF1 increases the rate of promoter-proximal pause-release via distal and proximal regulatory elements",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.120506807,-0.04234283,-0.000621062,-0.0829877,-0.055191618,0.015101986999999999,-0.007098879000000001,-0.027658629,0.052579372,-0.056852757000000004,-0.056026861,-0.046987747,-0.013865831,0.091805926,-0.003378448,0.042333546,-0.010218214,-0.07988126200000001,-0.07186587700000001,-0.037564667999999996,0.044027025,0.010314766999999999,-0.016110744,0.029394726,-0.013351392,-0.069668219,-0.012563533,0.050818972000000004,0.036675686,-0.075555848
1762,Comparative analysis of gene expression in virulent and attenuated strains of infectious bronchitis virus at sub-codon resolution,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a member of the genus Gammacoronavirus and the causative agent of avian infectious bronchitis. IBV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome ~27 kb in length and, like all coronaviruses, produces a set of sub-genomic messenger RNAs (sgmRNAs) synthesised via the viral polymerase. Here, we used RNA sequencing (RNASeq) and ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) to delineate gene expression in the IBV M41-CK and Beau-CK strains at sub-codon resolution. Quantification of reads flanking the programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) signal at the genomic RNA ORF1a/ORF1b junction revealed that PRF in IBV is highly efficient (33-40%), consistent with in vitro measurements. Triplet phasing of the profiling data allowed precise determination of reading frames and revealed the translation of two intergenic genes (4b and 4c on sgmRNA4), which are widely conserved across IBV isolates. RNASeq revealed two novel transcription junction sites in the attenuated Beau-CK strain, one of which would generate a sgmRNA encoding a ribosomally occupied ORF in the viral 3 untranslated region (dORF). Within IBV transcripts, the nucleocapsid (N) protein was unexpectedly found to be inefficiently translated, despite being an abundant structural component of mature IBV virions. Finally, we demonstrate that the host cell response to IBV occurs primarily at the level of transcription, with a global up-regulation of immune-related mRNA transcripts following infection, and comparatively modest changes in the translation efficiencies of host genes.\n\nIMPORTANCEIBV is a major avian pathogen and presents a substantial economic burden to the poultry industry. Improved vaccination strategies are urgently needed to curb the global spread of this pathogen, and the development of suitable vaccine candidates will be aided by an improved understanding of IBV molecular biology. Our high-resolution data have enabled a precise study of transcription and translation in both pathogenic and attenuated forms of IBV, and expand our understanding of gammacoronaviral gene expression. We demonstrate that gene expression shows considerable intra-species variation, with single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with altered production of sgmRNA transcripts, and our RiboSeq data sets enabled us to uncover novel ribosomally occupied ORFs in both strains. We also identify numerous cellular genes and gene networks that are differentially expressed during virus infection, giving insights into the host cell reponse to IBV infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.166528984,-0.046766704000000006,0.043392744000000004,-0.082925313,0.183652005,0.070937948,-0.202182597,-0.088498569,0.146418081,0.324291663,-0.0059619040000000005,-0.06259764799999999,-0.033488098,0.055141507,-0.17973740300000002,0.117459566,0.011093971000000001,-0.021192405,-0.014202106,0.052705790999999995,-0.056263618,0.004704417,-0.039266866,-0.033753253999999996,-0.06770839599999999,-0.061703843,0.029066607999999997,0.030829036,0.093443822,-0.034613185
1764,Mutation of Ebola virus VP35 Ser129 uncouples interferon antagonist and replication functions,"Ebolaviruses are non-segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses (NNSVs) within the order Mononegavirales that possess the multifunctional virion protein 35 (VP35), a major determinant of virulence and pathogenesis that is indispensable for viral replication and host innate immune evasion. VP35 is functionally equivalent to the phosphoprotein (P) of other mononegaviruses such as rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses. Phosphorylation of the P protein is universally regarded as functionally important however, a regulatory role(s) of phosphorylation on VP35 function remains unexplored. Here, we identified a highly conserved Ser129 residue near the homo-oligomerization coiled coil motif, which is essential for VP35 functions. Affinity-purification MS followed by post-translational modification (PTM) analysis predicted phosphorylation of Ser129. Co-immunoprecipitation, cross-linking, and biochemical characterization studies revealed a moderately decreased capacity of VP35-S129A to oligomerize. Functional analysis showed that Ser-to-Ala substitution of Ebola virus (EBOV) VP35 did not affect IFN inhibitory activity but nearly abolished EBOV minigenome activity. Further coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated a lost interaction between VP35-S129A and the amino terminus of the viral polymerase but not between viral nucleoprotein (NP) or VP35-WT. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that phosphorylation modulates VP35 function, supporting VP35 as a NNSV P protein and providing a potentially valuable therapeutic target.\n\nImportanceEbola virus (EBOV) can cause severe disease in humans. The 2013-2016 West African epidemic and the two recent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo underscore the urgent need for effective countermeasures, which remain lacking. A better understanding of EBOV biology and the modulation of multifunctional viral proteins is desperately needed to develop improved therapeutics. We provide evidence here that function of virion protein 35 (VP35) is modulated by phosphorylation of Ser129, a conserved residue among other ebolavirus species. These findings shed light on EBOV biology and present a potential target for broad acting anti-ebolavirus therapeutics.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.09579282900000001,-0.03728671,-0.022546151,-0.031621124,-0.053818804000000005,0.043294405,0.054721854,-0.009275974000000001,0.016788142,0.0052542859999999995,-0.023245897999999997,0.008177011999999999,-0.006747238000000001,-0.014165986,-0.021106776,-0.02924387,0.022887282999999998,-0.008387427,-0.031931462,0.012294481000000001,-0.013818658999999999,0.010179617,-0.032727564,0.00015792899999999998,0.027482938999999998,0.025756055,0.025456684,-0.015168498999999998,0.00713072,0.005703113
1771,First isolation and characterisation of Alongshan virus in Russia,"In recent decades, many new flavi-like viruses have been discovered predominantly in different invertebrates and, as was recently shown, some of them may cause disease in humans. The Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) group holds a special place among flavi-like viruses because, in contrast to the ""classic"" flaviviruses and other flavi-like viruses, they have a segmented ssRNA(+) genome. Two segments of the JMTV genome have homology with regions of the flavivirus genome encoding polymerase and helicase-protease proteins. JMTVs have several open reading frames (ORF) in segments encoding glycoprotein(s) and capsid protein and these ORF are specific only to them. JMTVs greatly differ in virion size. We isolated three strains of Alongshan virus (ALSV), which is a representative of the JMTV group, from adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks collected in two geographically-separated Russian regions in the tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Most virions purified from tick cells were spherical with a diameter of approximately 40.5 nm. In addition, we found smaller particles of approximately 13.1 nm in diameter. We obtained full genome sequences of all four segments of two of the isolated ALSV strains, and partial sequences of one segment from the third strain. Phylogenetic analysis on genome segment 2 of the JMTV group clustered our novel strains with other ALSV strains. We found evidence for the existence of a novel upstream ORF in the glycoprotein-coding segment of ALSV and other members of the JMTV group. Significance StatementWe isolated three strains of Alongshan virus (ALSV) from adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks from two geographically separate areas of Russia in the Ixodes ricinus tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Our study confirmed the value of tick cell lines in virus isolation and maintenance of persistent infection. The majority of virions of the ALSV strain Miass527 were enveloped spherical particles with a diameter of 40.5{+/-}3.7 nm.

1782,"Single-cell RNA expression profiling of ACE2, the putative receptor of Wuhan 2019-nCoV, in the nasal tissue","A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spreads to the other Provinces of China. WHO decides to determine a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) of 2019-nCoV. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the tissues at different locations of the respiratory tract. The result indicates that the ACE2 expression appears in nasal epithelial cells. We found that the size of this population of ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells is comparable with the size of the population of ACE2-expression type II alveolar cells (AT2) in the Asian sample reported by Yu Zhao et al. We further detected 2019-nCoV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the nasal-swab and throat-swab of seven suspected cases. We found that 2019-nCoV tends to have a higher concentration in the nasal-swab comparing to the throat-swab, which could attribute to the ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells. We hope this study could be informative for virus-prevention strategy development, especially the treatment of nasal mucus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.018206039,0.058839749000000004,-0.038327354,-0.079244572,-0.052933793,0.023384862000000003,-0.00507756,-0.00864707,0.012265858999999999,-0.028550477999999997,-0.009734138,-0.0031063790000000003,-0.010432249000000001,0.026606016,0.051465997,0.032277942999999996,-0.045026678,0.019467396,-0.008896718,-0.09570153199999999,-0.013610141999999999,0.031712468,-0.120820521,-0.089033401,0.045151892,0.120660524,0.14138134900000002,0.07005966200000001,0.043813462000000004,-0.135753201
1798,Epidemiology of respiratory viral infections in people with acute respiratory tract infections in Africa: the VARIAFRICA systematic review and meta-analysis protocol,"INTRODUCTION: Better characterisation of the epidemiological data on respiratory viral infections among people with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) can help to implement efficient strategies to curb the burden of ARTI in Africa. We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence and factors associated with respiratory viral infection in people of all ages with ARTI residing in Africa. METHODS: This work will include cross-sectional studies published between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2017, without any language restriction, on populations residing in African countries. We will consider studies that reported the prevalence of respiratory viruses in people with ARTI confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction technique. We will be searching PubMed, Embase, African Journals Online, Web of Science, and Global Index Medicus. The selection of relevant studies, extraction of data, and evaluation of the quality of the articles will be carried out independently by two review authors, and the discrepancies will be resolved by consensus or intervention of a third author. The heterogeneity of the studies will be assessed using the χ(2) test on Cochrane’s Q statistic. Publication bias will be assessed by the Egger test. Studies will be pooled using a random-effect meta-analysis model. Results will be presented by age group and sub-region of Africa. Using meta-regression models, we will identify factors associated with viral infections in people with ARTI. DISCUSSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis is based on published data and therefore does not require ethical approval. This work will serve as a basis for the development of strategies for prevention and control ARTI in Africa and will also serve to identify data gaps and guide future investigations. The final report will be published in peer-reviewed journals as a scientific article and presented in workshops, conferences, and scientific conferences.

1799,The Human Cytomegalovirus DNA Polymerase Processivity Factor UL44 Is Modified by SUMO in a DNA-Dependent Manner,"During the replication of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome, the viral DNA polymerase subunit UL44 plays a key role, as by binding both DNA and the polymerase catalytic subunit it confers processivity to the holoenzyme. However, several lines of evidence suggest that UL44 might have additional roles during virus life cycle. To shed light on this, we searched for cellular partners of UL44 by yeast two-hybrid screenings. Intriguingly, we discovered the interaction of UL44 with Ubc9, an enzyme involved in the covalent conjugation of SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-related MOdifier) to cellular and viral proteins. We found that UL44 can be extensively sumoylated not only in a cell-free system and in transfected cells, but also in HCMV-infected cells, in which about 50% of the protein resulted to be modified at late times post-infection, when viral genome replication is accomplished. Mass spectrometry studies revealed that UL44 possesses multiple SUMO target sites, located throughout the protein. Remarkably, we observed that binding of UL44 to DNA greatly stimulates its sumoylation both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we showed that overexpression of SUMO alters the intranuclear distribution of UL44 in HCMV-infected cells, and enhances both virus production and DNA replication, arguing for an important role for sumoylation in HCMV life cycle and UL44 function(s). These data report for the first time the sumoylation of a viral processivity factor and show that there is a functional interplay between the HCMV UL44 protein and the cellular sumoylation system.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.10820461099999999,-0.046046860999999994,-0.017926173,-0.042998712,-0.081628582,0.026908075,0.040098745,-0.027650647,0.042272602,-0.002746823,-0.024239731,-0.020620256,0.002119411,0.043888282,-0.004705013,0.011075296,0.006516968000000001,-0.0353346,-0.010880811,0.030634376,-0.018201371,0.035477572,-0.017130077,-0.018903418999999998,0.018812145,0.010718591000000001,-0.028111088,0.010335691,-0.024848354,0.01783987
1801,Enhancement of safety and immunogenicity of the Chinese Hu191 measles virus vaccine by alteration of the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site in the large polymerase protein,"Abstract The live-attenuated measles virus (MV) vaccine based on the Hu191 strain has played a significant role in controlling measles in China. However, it has considerable adverse effects that may cause public health burden. We hypothesize that the safety and efficacy of MV vaccine can be improved by altering the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site in the conserved region VI of the large polymerase protein. To test this hypothesis, we established an efficient reverse genetics system for the rMV-Hu191 strain and generated two recombinant MV-Hu191 carrying mutations in the SAM binding site. These two mutants grew to high titer in Vero cells, were genetically stable, and were significantly more attenuated in vitro and in vivo compared to the parental rMV-Hu191 vaccine strain. Importantly, both MV-Hu191 mutants triggered a higher neutralizing antibody than rMV-Hu191 vaccine and provided complete protection against MV challenge. These results demonstrate its potential for an improved MV vaccine candidate.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.08379760900000001,-0.031030785,0.003626569,-0.0652944,-0.005895981,0.070957887,-0.033509737000000005,-0.036999526,0.042350379,0.005215823,-0.006467741,0.048311859000000006,-0.051855976,-0.059461545,-0.014586634,-0.018968933,-0.034987067999999996,-0.009424703000000001,-0.043169439000000004,0.010284899,0.07274337,-0.04071257,0.057255218,0.051281165,0.048252832,0.042832977,0.003742609,-0.018037776999999998,-0.028067678,-0.008342418
1804,"First Human Rabies Case in French Guiana, 2008: Epidemiological Investigation and Control","BACKGROUND: Until 2008, human rabies had never been reported in French Guiana. On 28 May 2008, the French National Reference Center for Rabies (Institut Pasteur, Paris) confirmed the rabies diagnosis, based on hemi-nested polymerase chain reaction on skin biopsy and saliva specimens from a Guianan, who had never travelled overseas and died in Cayenne after presenting clinically typical meningoencephalitis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Molecular typing of the virus identified a Lyssavirus (Rabies virus species), closely related to those circulating in hematophagous bats (mainly Desmodus rotundus) in Latin America. A multidisciplinary Crisis Unit was activated. Its objectives were to implement an epidemiological investigation and a veterinary survey, to provide control measures and establish a communications program. The origin of the contamination was not formally established, but was probably linked to a bat bite based on the virus type isolated. After confirming exposure of 90 persons, they were vaccinated against rabies: 42 from the case's entourage and 48 healthcare workers. To handle that emergence and the local population's increased demand to be vaccinated, a specific communications program was established using several media: television, newspaper, radio. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This episode, occurring in the context of a Department far from continental France, strongly affected the local population, healthcare workers and authorities, and the management team faced intense pressure. This observation confirms that the risk of contracting rabies in French Guiana is real, with consequences for population educational program, control measures, medical diagnosis and post-exposure prophylaxis.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.003839897,0.005957194,0.020126225,-0.068463182,0.04881997,0.076657466,0.05658745900000001,0.031296077,-0.017896742,-0.013719531,-0.023908019,-0.005489349,-0.014831773000000001,-0.024864491000000002,0.013122227,0.042102532000000005,-0.015023722,0.007792472,-0.02645985,-0.027736151,0.016550994,-0.016619889,-0.008200352,-0.033725324,0.011639903,0.011586925,-0.008929009,0.0077003359999999995,-0.018530345,-0.004988581
1805,"Feline bocavirus-1 associated with outbreaks of hemorrhagic enteritis in household cats: potential first evidence of a pathological role, viral tropism and natural genetic recombination","Feline bocavirus-1 (FBoV-1) was identified in cats from different households with hemorrhagic enteritis during outbreaks of an unusual clinical presentation of feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV) in Thailand. Use of polymerase chain reaction revealed the presence of the FBoV-1 DNA in several tissues, suggesting hematogenous viremia, with the viral nucleic acid, detected by in situ hybridization (ISH), was localized in intestinal cells and vascular endothelium of intestinal mucosa and serosa, and in necrosis areas primarily in various lymph nodes while FPLV-immunohistochemical analysis revealed viral localization only in cryptal cells, neurons, and limited to leukocytes in the mesenteric lymph node. Full-length coding genome analysis of the Thai FBoV-1 strains isolated from moribund cats revealed three distinct strains with a high between-strain genetic diversity, while genetic recombination in one of the three FBoV-1 strains within the NS1 gene. This is the first report identifying natural genetic recombination of the FBoV-1 and describing the pathology and viral tropism of FBoV-1 infection in cats. Although the role of FBoV-1 associated with systemic infection of these cats remained undetermined, a contributory role of enteric infection of FBoV-1 is possible. Synergistic effects of dual infection with FPLV and FBoV-1 are hypothesized, suggesting more likely severe clinical presentations.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.054837587,-0.026631801,0.039218109,-0.16431058199999998,0.058928050999999995,0.05164615,0.040135422000000004,-0.025789242,-0.015083216000000002,-0.045850478,0.269225406,-0.10057140099999999,0.17167680800000001,-0.033180048999999996,-0.040847429,-0.047465615,-0.035867202,0.0061764409999999995,-0.036710914,0.11273396,0.038594103,-0.011046408999999998,0.003880712,0.049396626,-0.013866615,-0.012302769,0.0019896479999999997,0.034529867,-0.078791892,0.058206521
1810,Curing a viral infection by targeting the host: The example of cyclophilin inhibitors,"Abstract Every step of the viral life cycle is dependent on the host, which potentially can be explored for antiviral targets. Historically, however, drug discovery has focused mainly on viral targets, because of their perceived specificity. Efforts to pursue host targets have been largely hampered by concern over potential on-target toxicity, the lack of predictive cell culture and animal models, and the complexity of host–virus interactions. On the other hand, there are distinct advantages of targeting the host, such as creating a high barrier to resistance, providing broad coverage of different genotypes/serotypes and possibly even multiple viruses, and expanding the list of potential targets, when druggable viral targets are limited. Taking hepatitis C virus (HCV) as the example, there are more than 20 inhibitors of the viral protease, polymerase and NS5A protein currently in advanced clinical testing. However, resistance has become a main challenge with these direct-acting antivirals, because HCV, an RNA virus, is notoriously prone to mutation, and a single mutation in the viral target may prevent the binding of an inhibitor, and rendering it ineffective. Host cyclophilin inhibitors have shown promising effects both in vitro and in patients to prevent the emergence of resistance and to cure HCV infection, either alone or in combination with other agents. They are also capable of blocking the replication of a number of other viral pathogens. While the road to developing host-targeting antivirals has been less traveled, and significant challenges remain, delivering the most effective antiviral regimen, which may comprise inhibitors of both host and viral targets, should be well worth the effort.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.10137070699999999,-0.049204189,-0.049068463,0.06917646,-0.158334477,0.11097266300000001,0.16057070699999998,-0.004025298,0.029552163,0.116340914,-0.026474703999999998,0.006166702,0.070627298,0.039354838999999996,-0.014558831999999999,-0.056646315999999995,-0.013275938999999999,0.20024916399999998,0.160702879,0.032280461,-0.058195896,0.064020913,-0.038966366,0.113847357,-0.025559187999999997,-0.049905230999999994,0.080875023,-0.071199082,0.015376349,0.00427507

1815,Viral Metagenomics on Cerebrospinal Fluid,"Identifying the causative pathogen in central nervous system (CNS) infections is crucial for patient management and prognosis. Many viruses can cause CNS infections, yet screening for each individually is costly and time-consuming. Most metagenomic assays can theoretically detect all pathogens, but often fail to detect viruses because of their small genome and low viral load. Viral metagenomics overcomes this by enrichment of the viral genomic content in a sample. VIDISCA-NGS is one of the available workflows for viral metagenomics, which requires only a small input volume and allows multiplexing of multiple samples per run. The performance of VIDISCA-NGS was tested on 45 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with suspected CNS infections in which a virus was identified and quantified by polymerase chain reaction. Eighteen were positive for an RNA virus, and 34 for a herpesvirus. VIDISCA-NGS detected all RNA viruses with a viral load >2 × 10(4) RNA copies/mL (n = 6) and 8 of 12 of the remaining low load samples. Only one herpesvirus was identified by VIDISCA-NGS, however, when withholding a DNase treatment, 11 of 18 samples with a herpesvirus load >10(4) DNA copies/mL were detected. Our results indicate that VIDISCA-NGS has the capacity to detect low load RNA viruses in CSF. Herpesvirus DNA in clinical samples is probably non-encapsidated and therefore difficult to detect by VIDISCA-NGS.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.013448416999999999,-0.027604012999999997,0.033213203999999996,0.02772181,-0.010096206,-0.055306793,0.060154587999999995,0.00932369,-0.050173287999999996,0.066022133,0.041172921,-0.048675555,0.023005785,0.010811267,0.04552391099999999,-0.02437553,-0.043506897,-0.024188281000000002,0.028882125,-0.006584915,-0.018844266000000002,0.047955897000000004,-0.04458046,0.01687599,-0.069592757,-0.055935767000000004,0.00042528900000000003,-0.027674165,-0.044652852,0.043186783
1820,Reprogramming cellular events by poly(ADP-ribose)-binding proteins,"Abstract Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is a posttranslational modification catalyzed by the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). These enzymes covalently modify glutamic, aspartic and lysine amino acid side chains of acceptor proteins by the sequential addition of ADP-ribose (ADPr) units. The poly(ADP-ribose) (pADPr) polymers formed alter the physico-chemical characteristics of the substrate with functional consequences on its biological activities. Recently, non-covalent binding to pADPr has emerged as a key mechanism to modulate and coordinate several intracellular pathways including the DNA damage response, protein stability and cell death. In this review, we describe the basis of non-covalent binding to pADPr that has led to the emerging concept of pADPr-responsive signaling pathways. This review emphasizes the structural elements and the modular strategies developed by pADPr-binding proteins to exert a fine-tuned control of a variety of pathways. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reactions are highly regulated processes, both spatially and temporally, for which at least four specialized pADPr-binding modules accommodate different pADPr structures and reprogram protein functions. In this review, we highlight the role of well-characterized and newly discovered pADPr-binding modules in a diverse set of physiological functions.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.126278371,-0.032458728,-0.016809988999999997,-0.062276785,-0.090821922,0.047789755999999996,0.058355685,-0.032148324,0.04872810599999999,-0.008687555999999999,-0.067366866,0.038328429,0.006225191999999999,-0.050955948,-0.051430382999999996,-0.021485469,0.056002777999999996,-0.04680307400000001,-0.05929919,0.01563451,-0.023350129,0.008997674,-0.026185222999999997,-0.066415566,0.063872231,0.027634858999999998,-0.066877949,0.031826943999999996,0.046840362,-0.06403038
1822,The First Detection of Equine Coronavirus in Adult Horses and Foals in Ireland,"The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of equine coronavirus (ECoV) in clinical samples submitted to a diagnostic laboratory in Ireland. A total of 424 clinical samples were examined from equids with enteric disease in 24 Irish counties between 2011 and 2015. A real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect ECoV RNA. Nucleocapsid, spike and the region from the p4.7 to p12.7 genes of positive samples were sequenced, and sequence and phylogenetic analyses were conducted. Five samples (1.2%) collected in 2011 and 2013 tested positive for ECoV. Positive samples were collected from adult horses, Thoroughbred foals and a donkey foal. Sequence and/or phylogenetic analysis showed that nucleocapsid, spike and p12.7 genes were highly conserved and were closely related to ECoVs identified in other countries. In contrast, the region from p4.7 and the non-coding region following the p4.7 gene had deletions or insertions. The differences in the p4.7 region between the Irish ECoVs and other ECoVs indicated that the Irish viruses were distinguishable from those circulating in other countries.

1825,Validation of assays to monitor immune responses in the Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus),"Abstract The Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) is a valuable but under-utilized animal model for studies of human viral pathogens such as bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, flaviviruses, henipaviruses, and SARS-coronavirus. A lack of suitable reagents and specific assays for monitoring host responses has limited the use of this animal model to clinical observations, pathology and humoral immune responses. The objective of this study was to establish and validate assays to monitor host immune responses in the hamster including important pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory and innate immune responses, as well as markers of apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell junction integrity and coagulation. Commercially available mouse and rat ELISA and luminex panels were screened for potential cross-reactivity, but were found to be of limited value for studying host responses in hamsters. Subsequently, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays for the detection of 51 immune-related and four internal reference genes were developed. To validate the immune-related assays, hamsters were infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Indiana species, or treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and host immune responses were monitored in selected organs. Ribosomal protein L18 was identified as the most stable internal reference gene. In conclusion, these new assays will greatly improve the use of the hamster as an important small animal model in infectious disease research.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.04937024,0.038809361,0.038236242999999996,-0.054503996,-0.067400402,0.073923116,0.068208604,-0.063832871,0.044050682,0.01471061,-0.070108671,-0.06188945,0.043749038,0.047068735,-0.004138482,-0.006763201999999999,-0.023824165,-0.029564284,-0.031920872,-0.032899664,0.027874151,-0.005785113000000001,0.004862867,-0.003636587,-0.044375592,-0.032063207,0.050134702,-0.027755231,0.036194091,-0.034069112
1827,Antiviral Drugs for Viruses Other Than Human Immunodeficiency Virus,"Abstract Most viral diseases, with the exception of those caused by human immunodeficiency virus, are self-limited illnesses that do not require specific antiviral therapy. The currently available antiviral drugs target 3 main groups of viruses: herpes, hepatitis, and influenza viruses. With the exception of the antisense molecule fomivirsen, all antiherpes drugs inhibit viral replication by serving as competitive substrates for viral DNA polymerase. Drugs for the treatment of influenza inhibit the ion channel M2 protein or the enzyme neuraminidase. Combination therapy with Interferon-α and ribavirin remains the backbone treatment for chronic hepatitis C; the addition of serine protease inhibitors improves the treatment outcome of patients infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 1. Chronic hepatitis B can be treated with interferon or a combination of nucleos(t)ide analogues. Notably, almost all the nucleos(t) ide analogues for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B possess anti-human immunodeficiency virus properties, and they inhibit replication of hepatitis B virus by serving as competitive substrates for its DNA polymerase. Some antiviral drugs possess multiple potential clinical applications, such as ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C and respiratory syncytial virus and cidofovir for the treatment of cytomegalovirus and other DNA viruses. Drug resistance is an emerging threat to the clinical utility of antiviral drugs. The major mechanisms for drug resistance are mutations in the viral DNA polymerase gene or in genes that encode for the viral kinases required for the activation of certain drugs such as acyclovir and ganciclovir. Widespread antiviral resistance has limited the clinical utility of M2 inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of influenza infections.

1829,"POLD1: Central mediator of DNA replication and repair, and implication in cancer and other pathologies","Abstract The evolutionarily conserved human polymerase delta (POLD1) gene encodes the large p125 subunit which provides the essential catalytic activities of polymerase δ (Polδ), mediated by 5′–3′ DNA polymerase and 3′–5′ exonuclease moieties. POLD1 associates with three smaller subunits (POLD2, POLD3, POLD4), which together with Replication Factor C and Proliferating Nuclear Cell Antigen constitute the polymerase holoenzyme. Polδ function is essential for replication, with a primary role as the replicase for the lagging strand. Polδ also has an important proofreading ability conferred by the exonuclease activity, which is critical for ensuring replicative fidelity, but also serves to repair DNA lesions arising as a result of exposure to mutagens. Polδ has been shown to be important for multiple forms of DNA repair, including nucleotide excision repair, double strand break repair, base excision repair, and mismatch repair. A growing number of studies in the past decade have linked germline and sporadic mutations in POLD1 and the other subunits of Polδ with human pathologies. Mutations in Polδ in mice and humans lead to genomic instability, mutator phenotype and tumorigenesis. The advent of genome sequencing techniques has identified damaging mutations in the proofreading domain of POLD1 as the underlying cause of some inherited cancers, and suggested that mutations in POLD1 may influence therapeutic management. In addition, mutations in POLD1 have been identified in the developmental disorders of mandibular hypoplasia, deafness, progeroid features and lipodystrophy and atypical Werner syndrome, while changes in expression or activity of POLD1 have been linked to senescence and aging. Intriguingly, some recent evidence suggests that POLD1 function may also be altered in diabetes.

1832,Evaluation of the Antiviral Potential of Halogenated Dihydrorugosaflavonoids and Molecular Modeling with nsP3 Protein of Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV),"[Image: see text] Antiviral therapy is crucial for the circumvention of viral epidemics. The unavailability of a specific antiviral drug against the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) disease has created an alarming situation to identify or develop potent chemical molecules for remedial management of CHIKV. In the present investigation, in silico studies of dihydrorugosaflavonoid derivatives (5a–f) with non-structural protein-3 (nsP3) were carried out. nsP3 replication protein has recently been considered as a possible antiviral target in which crucial inhibitors fit into the adenosine-binding pocket of the macrodomain. The 4′-halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids displayed intrinsic binding with the nsp3 macrodomain (PDB ID: 3GPO) of CHIKV. Compounds 5c and 5d showed docking scores of −7.54 and −6.86 kcal mol(–1), respectively. Various in vitro assays were performed to confirm their (5a–f) antiviral potential against CHIKV. The non-cytotoxic dose was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and was found to be <100 μM. The compounds 5c and 5d showed their inhibitory potential for CHIKV, which was determined through cytopathic effect assay and plaque reduction assay, which show inhibition up to 95 and 92% for 70 μM concentration of the compounds, respectively. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay result confirmed the ability of 5c and 5d to reduce the viral RNA level at 70 μM concentration of compounds to nearly 95 and 93% concentration, respectively, in cells with CHIKV infection. Further, the CHIKV-inhibitory capacity of these compounds was corroborated by execution of immunofluorescence assay. The executed work will be meaningful for the future research of studied dihydrorugosaflavonoids against prime antiviral entrants, leading to remedial management to preclude CHIKV infection.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.060714,0.00156685,0.029825652999999997,-0.013945488,-0.12168082,0.056778642000000004,0.063729582,-0.021381969,0.041272941,-0.018687666000000002,-0.0037825190000000002,0.04571577,-0.034276087000000004,0.008544398,-0.03096549,-0.008428665,-0.0063404690000000005,0.07042356400000001,0.10641489,0.014718773999999999,-0.001604365,0.029972864,0.018650041000000003,0.04254623,0.022371167999999997,0.053612965,0.056695378,-0.056744023,0.038448008,0.005546745
1837,Conserved presence of G-quadruplex forming sequences in the Long Terminal Repeat Promoter of Lentiviruses,"G-quadruplexes (G4s) are secondary structures of nucleic acids that epigenetically regulate cellular processes. In the human immunodeficiency lentivirus 1 (HIV-1), dynamic G4s are located in the unique viral LTR promoter. Folding of HIV-1 LTR G4s inhibits viral transcription; stabilization by G4 ligands intensifies this effect. Cellular proteins modulate viral transcription by inducing/unfolding LTR G4s. We here expanded our investigation on the presence of LTR G4s to all lentiviruses. G4s in the 5′-LTR U3 region were completely conserved in primate lentiviruses. A G4 was also present in a cattle-infecting lentivirus. All other non-primate lentiviruses displayed hints of less stable G4s. In primate lentiviruses, the possibility to fold into G4s was highly conserved among strains. LTR G4 sequences were very similar among phylogenetically related primate viruses, while they increasingly differed in viruses that diverged early from a common ancestor. A strong correlation between primate lentivirus LTR G4s and Sp1/NFκB binding sites was found. All LTR G4s folded: their complexity was assessed by polymerase stop assay. Our data support a role of the lentiviruses 5′-LTR G4 region as control centre of viral transcription, where folding/unfolding of G4s and multiple recruitment of factors based on both sequence and structure may take place.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.057497316,-0.030054347999999998,0.0072159419999999995,-0.049132762999999996,-0.012689821,0.019110841,0.025076721,-0.002824249,0.007020488,-0.012334846000000002,-0.0177074,0.017192958,-0.006487119,-0.032372355,-0.001007951,0.0038853790000000004,0.003978825,-0.007005521,-0.028045986000000002,-0.004838511,-0.003254439,0.00529477,-0.033334287000000004,0.012674855,0.007017412,-0.016178627,-0.010647849,-0.009278431,0.026001532,0.002156828
1840,Immunogenicity of adenovirus-vector vaccine targeting hepatitis B virus: non-clinical safety assessment in non-human primates,"BACKGROUND: A new promising therapeutic approach has emerged for patients chronically infected by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the development of a non-replicative adenovirus vector vaccine candidate (Ad-HBV). The vaccine encodes a fusion protein composed of a truncated HBV core protein, mutated polymerase protein, and two envelope domains. In this study, we assessed the immunogenicity of Ad-HBV administered to cynomolgus monkeys during a non-clinical safety assessment. METHODS: The virus was subcutaneously administered at 1.0 × 10(9) viral particles (VP)/animal (low-dose group), 1.0 × 10(10) VP/animal (mid-dose group), and 1.0 × 10(11) VP/animal (high-dose group); the control groups were administered an Ad5-null virus (1.0 × 10(11) VP/animal) and saline only. RESULTS: Except for inflammatory cell infiltration under the skin at the injection sites and transient elevation of body temperature and serum albumin, no Ad-HBV-related toxic effects were noted in any treatment group. Moreover, interferon (IFN)-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assays showed that Ad-HBV induced the targeting of T cells to a broad spectrum of HBV-specific epitopes spanning all three of the selected HBV immunogens (core, polymerase, and envelope domains) in a dose-dependent manner. Although anti-Ad antibody was produced in all groups (except for the saline control), the antibody titers were significantly lower in the high-dose Ad-HBV group than in the group that received the same dose of the Ad-null empty vector. In addition, the IFN-γ and IL-2 expression levels in the liver were significantly improved for the mid-dose, high-dose, and Ad-null control group (p < 0.05), but not for the low-dose group. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, this safety assessment indicates that the Ad-HBV candidate vaccine is a potent specific immunotherapeutic agent, supporting its further clinical development as an anti-HBV infection vaccine.

1842,Intense circulation of A/H5N1 and other avian influenza viruses in Cambodian live-bird markets with serological evidence of sub-clinical human infections,"Surveillance for avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in poultry and environmental samples was conducted in four live-bird markets in Cambodia from January through November 2013. Through real-time RT-PCR testing, AIVs were detected in 45% of 1048 samples collected throughout the year. Detection rates ranged from 32% and 18% in duck and chicken swabs, respectively, to 75% in carcass wash water samples. Influenza A/H5N1 virus was detected in 79% of samples positive for influenza A virus and 35% of all samples collected. Sequence analysis of full-length haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from A/H5N1 viruses, and full-genome analysis of six representative isolates, revealed that the clade 1.1.2 reassortant virus associated with Cambodian human cases during 2013 was the only A/H5N1 virus detected during the year. However, multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of HA and NA genes revealed co-circulation of at least nine low pathogenic AIVs from HA1, HA2, HA3, HA4, HA6, HA7, HA9, HA10 and HA11 subtypes. Four repeated serological surveys were conducted throughout the year in a cohort of 125 poultry workers. Serological testing found an overall prevalence of 4.5% and 1.8% for antibodies to A/H5N1 and A/H9N2, respectively. Seroconversion rates of 3.7 and 0.9 cases per 1000 person-months participation were detected for A/H5N1 and A/H9N2, respectively. Peak AIV circulation was associated with the Lunar New Year festival. Knowledge of periods of increased circulation of avian influenza in markets should inform intervention measures such as market cleaning and closures to reduce risk of human infections and emergence of novel AIVs.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.09960025,-0.042353154000000004,0.062275091,0.076923387,0.091926174,0.166383279,-0.06743700799999999,-0.018419381000000002,-0.00839412,-0.004432646,0.032634042,0.009064558,-0.006243606,0.020220953,0.030890638999999998,0.000454319,0.005151891,-0.050409626,0.009767172,-0.044189572,0.014725041000000001,0.02866608,-0.032165924,0.05326385,-0.027896512999999998,0.006487432,0.001430853,0.017747884,0.023196493999999998,-0.041599067999999996
1843,Identification of enteric viruses circulating in a dog population with low vaccine coverage,"Although the use of vaccines has controlled enteric diseases in dogs in many developed countries, vaccine coverage is still under optimal situation in Brazil. There is a large population of nonimmunized dogs and few studies about the identification of the viruses associated with diarrhea. To address this situation, stool samples from 325 dogs were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction for the detection of common enteric viruses such as Canine adenovirus (CAdV), Canine coronavirus (CCoV), Canine distemper virus (CDV), Canine rotavirus (CRV) and Carnivorous protoparvovirus 1 (canine parvovirus 2; CPV-2). At least one of these species was detected in 56.6% (184/325) of the samples. The viruses detected most frequently in either diarrheic or nondiarrheic dog feces were CPV-2 (54.3% of the positive samples), CDV (45.1%) and CCoV (30.4%), followed by CRV (8.2%) and CAdV (4.9%). Only one agent was detected in the majority of the positive samples (63%), but co-infections were present in 37% of the positive samples and mainly included CDV and CPV-2.

1844,"Characterization of G-Quadruplex Motifs in espB, espK, and cyp51 Genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as Potential Drug Targets","G-quadruplex structure forming motifs are among the most studied evolutionarily conserved drug targets that are present throughout the genome of different organisms and susceptible to influencing various biological processes. Here we report highly conserved potential G-quadruplex motifs (PGQs) in three essential genes (espK, espB, and cyp51) among 160 strains of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome. Products of these genes are involved in pathways that are responsible for virulence determination of bacteria inside the host cell and its survival by maintaining membrane fluidity. The espK and espB genes are essential players that prevent the formation of mature phagolysosome and antigen presentation by host macrophages. The cyp51 is another PGQ-possessing gene involved in sterol biosynthesis pathway and membrane formation. In the present study, we revealed the formation of stable intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex structures by Mycobacterium PGQs using a combination of techniques (NMR, circular dichroism [CD], and gel electrophoresis). Next, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and CD melting analysis demonstrated that a well-known G-quadruplex ligand, TMPyP4, binds to and stabilizes these PGQ motifs. Finally, polymerase inhibition and qRT-PCR assays highlight the biological relevance of PGQ-possessing genes in this pathogen and demonstrate that G-quadruplexes are potential drug targets for the development of effective anti-tuberculosis therapeutics.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.10533220199999999,-0.012252196000000002,0.024176286,-0.053570027,-0.039436842,0.05775109,0.049293277999999996,-0.013790345,0.02846428,0.013655042,-0.070768463,0.0033644,0.024881902,-0.025245463,-0.018372071,-0.03332745,0.0061831230000000004,0.004299326,-0.039669821,-0.02455078,0.005405322,0.031297812,-0.026675295,0.020718094,-0.021010245,-0.039933396,0.020583479,0.019076821,0.06411146200000001,-0.021211875
1847,Influenza A Virus Assembly Intermediates Fuse in the Cytoplasm,"Reassortment of influenza viral RNA (vRNA) segments in co-infected cells can lead to the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential. Replication of influenza vRNA occurs in the nucleus of infected cells, while progeny virions bud from the plasma membrane. However, the intracellular mechanics of vRNA assembly into progeny virions is not well understood. Here we used recent advances in microscopy to explore vRNA assembly and transport during a productive infection. We visualized four distinct vRNA segments within a single cell using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and observed that foci containing more than one vRNA segment were found at the external nuclear periphery, suggesting that vRNA segments are not exported to the cytoplasm individually. Although many cytoplasmic foci contain multiple vRNA segments, not all vRNA species are present in every focus, indicating that assembly of all eight vRNA segments does not occur prior to export from the nucleus. To extend the observations made in fixed cells, we used a virus that encodes GFP fused to the viral polymerase acidic (PA) protein (WSN PA-GFP) to explore the dynamics of vRNA assembly in live cells during a productive infection. Since WSN PA-GFP colocalizes with viral nucleoprotein and influenza vRNA segments, we used it as a surrogate for visualizing vRNA transport in 3D and at high speed by inverted selective-plane illumination microscopy. We observed cytoplasmic PA-GFP foci colocalizing and traveling together en route to the plasma membrane. Our data strongly support a model in which vRNA segments are exported from the nucleus as complexes that assemble en route to the plasma membrane through dynamic colocalization events in the cytoplasm.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.073857877,-0.058152780999999994,-0.018178453,-0.01531702,-0.05565821,0.07675511,0.005809824,-0.0065915240000000005,0.013570023999999998,-0.036075300000000005,-0.007404693,-0.013567228,-0.017236866,0.032015066,0.036066979,0.054114753,0.039153524,-0.035837394,-0.027209074,0.01125502,0.0033602759999999997,0.032435582000000004,-0.013631377,-0.029919717999999998,-0.000307735,-0.006145586,-0.023382517999999998,0.010151841,-0.031084235,0.038511396
1850,Development and characterization of a new cell line derived from European eel Anguilla anguilla kidney,"A new cell line derived from the kidney of European eel, Anguilla anguilla, has been established and characterized. This cell line, designated as EK (eel kidney), has been maintained in Leibovitz's L-15 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for over 24 months, and subcultured more than 60 times. This cell line consists predominantly of fibroblast-like cells, and can grow at 15–37°C under an optimum temperature of 26°C. The origin of this cell line was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and 18s recombinant (r)RNA sequencing. The chromosome analysis of EK cells at passage 58 revealed an ananeuploid karyotype. The EK cells were successfully transfected with the Pegfp-N1 plasmid, suggesting its potential in genetic studies. The susceptibility test showed a significant cytopathic effect (CPE) in EK cells for Rana grylio virus, and the viral replication was evidenced with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. After poly (I:C) stimulation, the expression of the immune-related molecules including interferon regulatory factor-3 (irf3), interferon regulatory factor-7 (irf7) and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) were significantly upregulated in EK cells, while the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF-β) was downregulated.

1852,Selective Bottlenecks Shape Evolutionary Pathways Taken during Mammalian Adaptation of a 1918-like Avian Influenza Virus,"Summary Avian influenza virus reassortants resembling the 1918 human pandemic virus can become transmissible among mammals by acquiring mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) and polymerase. Using the ferret model, we trace the evolutionary pathway by which an avian-like virus evolves the capacity for mammalian replication and airborne transmission. During initial infection, within-host HA diversity increased drastically. Then, airborne transmission fixed two polymerase mutations that do not confer a detectable replication advantage. In later transmissions, selection fixed advantageous HA1 variants. Transmission initially involved a “loose” bottleneck, which became strongly selective after additional HA mutations emerged. The stringency and evolutionary forces governing between-host bottlenecks may therefore change throughout host adaptation. Mutations occurred in multiple combinations in transmitted viruses, suggesting that mammalian transmissibility can evolve through multiple genetic pathways despite phenotypic constraints. Our data provide a glimpse into avian influenza virus adaptation in mammals, with broad implications for surveillance on potentially zoonotic viruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.048974268,-0.063097582,-0.032426299,0.073207112,0.018744293999999998,0.211631343,0.033392407,0.007155969,-0.0019649389999999997,0.015836703,0.019321278,-0.025774872999999997,0.0015185560000000001,0.031651288,0.03966194,0.028325349,-0.020010375,-0.044831252,-0.04794916900000001,0.042019275,0.047880516,-0.001053474,-0.03783801,0.074873251,-0.079272171,-0.011186082,0.016006921,-0.00882136,-0.058528406,-0.076855027
1860,Coronavirus disease-2019: is fever an adequate screening for the returning travelers?,"On Thursday, 30 January 2020, World Health Organization declared Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Since its identification in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People’s Republic of China, the number of cases imported into other countries is increasing, and the epidemiological map is changing rapidly. On the other hand, body temperature screening (fever) is the major test performed at points of entry, i.e., airports, in the returning travelers in most of the countries with limited resources. However, the recent report on asymptomatic contact transmission of COVID-19 and travelers who passed the symptoms-based screening and tested positive for COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) challenges this approach as body temperature screening may miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel. On this note, travel restrictions to and from high risk areas and/or 14 days quarantine of travelers coming from high risk areas are recommended to prevent possible importation of COVID-19. Currently, RT-PCR is a reliable test in detecting both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.054329915,0.075010852,0.041527566,-0.053230945,-0.035988907,0.024563752999999997,-0.008949133,0.06792052,-0.028991608999999998,-0.022614758999999998,0.033015971,0.04862532,-0.017781718999999998,-0.031563606,0.028997632000000002,0.042359379,-0.036388822,0.109704922,-0.05778979099999999,-0.073212,-0.06797028299999999,0.081230422,-0.23098896100000002,-0.100054139,0.042967167,0.165012409,0.178556811,0.040690941,0.052414050999999996,-0.075858677
1861,The NF-κB-dependent and -independent transcriptome and chromatin landscapes of human coronavirus 229E-infected cells,"Coronavirus replication takes place in the host cell cytoplasm and triggers inflammatory gene expression by poorly characterized mechanisms. To obtain more insight into the signals and molecular events that coordinate global host responses in the nucleus of coronavirus-infected cells, first, transcriptome dynamics was studied in human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E)-infected A549 and HuH7 cells, respectively, revealing a core signature of upregulated genes in these cells. Compared to treatment with the prototypical inflammatory cytokine interleukin(IL)-1, HCoV-229E replication was found to attenuate the inducible activity of the transcription factor (TF) NF-κB and to restrict the nuclear concentration of NF-κB subunits by (i) an unusual mechanism involving partial degradation of IKKβ, NEMO and IκBα and (ii) upregulation of TNFAIP3 (A20), although constitutive IKK activity and basal TNFAIP3 expression levels were shown to be required for efficient virus replication. Second, we characterized actively transcribed genomic regions and enhancers in HCoV-229E-infected cells and systematically correlated the genome-wide gene expression changes with the recruitment of Ser5-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II and prototypical histone modifications (H3K9ac, H3K36ac, H4K5ac, H3K27ac, H3K4me1). The data revealed that, in HCoV-infected (but not IL-1-treated) cells, an extensive set of genes was activated without inducible p65 NF-κB being recruited. Furthermore, both HCoV-229E replication and IL-1 were shown to upregulate a small set of genes encoding immunomodulatory factors that bind p65 at promoters and require IKKβ activity and p65 for expression. Also, HCoV-229E and IL-1 activated a common set of 440 p65-bound enhancers that differed from another 992 HCoV-229E-specific enhancer regions by distinct TF-binding motif combinations. Taken together, the study shows that cytoplasmic RNA viruses fine-tune NF-κB signaling at multiple levels and profoundly reprogram the host cellular chromatin landscape, thereby orchestrating the timely coordinated expression of genes involved in multiple signaling, immunoregulatory and metabolic processes.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.12674544699999998,-0.05609707,-0.05929612,-0.07940850299999999,0.004573476,0.000775608,0.053613799000000004,-0.074679415,0.146711401,-0.108353554,-0.093014191,0.18132569399999998,0.200938972,0.277499923,-0.025900542000000002,0.069097985,-0.032852665,-0.102057144,-0.059749515999999996,-0.017887581,0.012721751000000002,-0.02816994,0.065699708,-0.039110251,-0.041881744,-0.07504828599999999,0.07908173,0.07041674099999999,0.028216567999999997,-0.013738181
1862,Pelargonium sidoides radix extract EPs 7630 reduces rhinovirus infection through modulation of viral binding proteins on human bronchial epithelial cells,"Bronchial epithelial cells are the first target cell for rhinovirus infection. The course of viral infections in patients with acute bronchitis, asthma and COPD can be improved by oral application of Pelargonium sidoides radix extract; however, the mechanism is not well understood. This study investigated the in vitro effect of Pelargonium sidoides radix extract (EPs 7630) on the expression of virus binding cell membrane and host defence supporting proteins on primary human bronchial epithelial cells (hBEC). Cells were isolated from patients with severe asthma (n = 6), moderate COPD (n = 6) and non-diseased controls (n = 6). Protein expression was determined by Western-blot and immunofluorescence. Rhinovirus infection was determined by immunofluorescence as well as by polymerase chain reaction. Cell survival was determined by manual cell count after live/death immunofluorescence staining. All parameters were determined over a period of 3 days. The results show that EPs 7630 concentration-dependently and significantly increased hBEC survival after rhinovirus infection. This effect was paralleled by decreased expression of the inducible co-stimulator (ICOS), its ligand ICOSL and cell surface calreticulin (C1qR). In contrast, EPs 7630 up-regulated the expression of the host defence supporting proteins β-defensin-1 and SOCS-1, both in rhinovirus infected and un-infected hBEC. The expression of other virus interacting cell membrane proteins such as MyD88, TRL2/4 or ICAM-1 was not altered by EPs 7630. The results indicate that EPs 7630 may reduce rhinovirus infection of human primary BEC by down-regulating cell membrane docking proteins and up-regulating host defence proteins.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.049282690999999997,-0.06790602,-0.069971258,-0.119838325,-0.12506008400000002,0.032876382,0.029112432,-0.06788281,0.064986323,0.002463732,-0.097693635,-0.103998362,0.012465553,0.17192809899999997,-0.0018600560000000001,-0.021962192000000002,0.060895986,-0.09600699900000001,0.032731222000000004,0.016116448999999998,0.02802326,-0.058887724,0.000520053,0.017913786,0.008576285999999999,0.07065482,-0.009136186,0.038202405,-0.059008816,0.014764557
1863,Feline calicivirus and other respiratory pathogens in cats with Feline calicivirus-related symptoms and in clinically healthy cats in Switzerland,"BACKGROUND: Cats with feline calicivirus (FCV)-related symptoms are commonly presented to veterinary practitioners. Various clinical manifestations have been attributed to FCV, i.e. upper respiratory tract disease (URTD), oral ulcerations, gingivostomatitis, limping syndrome and virulent systemic disease. Additionally, healthy cats can shed FCV. The aims of this study were 1) to investigate the frequency of FCV in cats with FCV-related symptoms and in healthy cats in Switzerland, 2) to assess risk and protective factors for infection, such as signalment, housing conditions, vaccination, and co-infection with URTD-associated pathogens, and 3) to address the association between clinical symptoms and FCV infection. RESULTS: Oropharyngeal, nasal and conjunctival swabs were collected in 24 veterinary practices from 200 FCV-suspect and 100 healthy cats originating from 19 cantons of Switzerland. The samples were tested for FCV using virus isolation and reverse-transcription real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and for feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1), Mycoplasma felis, Chlamydophila felis, Bordetella bronchiseptica using real-time qPCR. Within the two populations (FCV-suspect/healthy), the observed PCR prevalences were: FCV 45 %/8 %, FHV-1 20 %/9 %, C. felis 8 %/1 %, B. bronchiseptica 4 %/2 %, M. felis 47 %/31 % and any co-infections thereof 40 %/14 %. Based on multivariable regression models amongst FCV-suspect cats (odds ratio [95 % confidence interval]), co-infection with M. felis (1.75 [0.97; 3.14]), group housing (2.11 [1.02; 4.34]) and intact reproductive status (1.80 [0.99; 3.28]) were found to be risk factors for FCV infection. In healthy cats, intact reproductive status (22.2 [1.85; 266.7]) and group housing (46.4 [5.70; 377.7]) were found to be associated with FCV infection. Based on an univariable approach, FCV-suspect cats were found to be significantly less often FCV-positive when vaccinated (0.48 [0.24; 0.94]). Oral ulcerations, salivation, gingivitis and stomatitis, but not classical signs of URTD were significantly associated with FCV infection (all p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: FCV was detected in less than half of the cats that were judged FCV-suspect by veterinary practitioners. For a clinical diagnosis, FCV-related symptoms should be revisited. FCV infection was present in some healthy cats, underlining the importance of asymptomatic carriers in FCV epidemiology. To reduce FCV-related problems in multi-cat environments, reduction of group size in addition to the generally recommended vaccination are advocated.

1865,Studying copy number variations using a nanofluidic platform,"Copy number variations (CNVs) in the human genome are conventionally detected using high-throughput scanning technologies, such as comparative genomic hybridization and high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays, or relatively low-throughput techniques, such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All these approaches are limited in resolution and can at best distinguish a twofold (or 50%) difference in copy number. We have developed a new technology to study copy numbers using a platform known as the digital array, a nanofluidic biochip capable of accurately quantitating genes of interest in DNA samples. We have evaluated the digital array's performance using a model system, to show that this technology is exquisitely sensitive, capable of differentiating as little as a 15% difference in gene copy number (or between 6 and 7 copies of a target gene). We have also analyzed commercial DNA samples for their CYP2D6 copy numbers and confirmed that our results were consistent with those obtained independently using conventional techniques. In a screening experiment with breast cancer and normal DNA samples, the ERBB2 gene was found to be amplified in about 35% of breast cancer samples. The use of the digital array enables accurate measurement of gene copy numbers and is of significant value in CNV studies.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.024293675,0.011413969,0.112214464,-0.038137886,0.005246845,0.001818055,0.017300801,-0.017179893999999998,0.0032300740000000003,0.012677222,-0.039327991,-0.009099678,0.018960838,-0.041676571,0.007629255,0.010707561,-0.041021972000000004,-0.026650052999999996,-0.008375357,-0.080536762,0.006317006,-0.006312934,0.033710992,0.00547818,-0.058820772,-0.04818536,-0.018964988999999998,-0.001799252,-0.020209883,0.010856534
1867,Phenotypic and Genetic Characterization of Avian Influenza H5N2 Viruses with Intra- and Inter-Duck Variations in Taiwan,"BACKGROUND: Human infections with avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have frequently raised global concerns of emerging, interspecies-transmissible viruses with pandemic potential. Waterfowl, the predominant reservoir of influenza viruses in nature, harbor precursors of different genetic lineages that have contributed to novel pandemic influenza viruses in the past. METHODS: Two duck influenza H5N2 viruses, DV518 and DV413, isolated through virological surveillance at a live-poultry market in Taiwan, showed phylogenetic relatedness but exhibited different replication capabilities in mammalian Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. This study characterizes the replication properties of the two duck H5N2 viruses and the determinants involved. RESULTS: The DV518 virus replicated more efficiently than DV413 in both MDCK and chicken DF1 cells. Interestingly, the infection of MDCK cells by DV518 formed heterogeneous plaques with great differences in size [large (L) and small (S)], and the two viral strains (p518-L and p518-S) obtained from plaque purification exhibited distinguishable replication kinetics in MDCK cells. Nonetheless, both plaque-purified DV518 strains still maintained their growth advantages over the plaque-purified p413 strain. Moreover, three amino acid substitutions in PA (P224S), PB2 (E72D), and M1 (A128T) were identified in intra-duck variations (p518-L vs p518-S), whereas other changes in HA (N170D), NA (I56T), and NP (Y289H) were present in inter-duck variations (DV518 vs DV413). Both p518-L and p518-S strains had the N170D substitution in HA, which might be related to their greater binding to MDCK cells. Additionally, polymerase activity assays on 293T cells demonstrated the role of vRNP in modulating the replication capability of the duck p518-L viruses in mammalian cells. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that intra-host phenotypic variation occurs even within an individual duck. In view of recent human infections by low pathogenic AIVs, this study suggests possible determinants involved in the stepwise selection of virus variants from the duck influenza virus population which may facilitate inter-species transmission.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.040335353,-0.08986372699999999,-0.020480622,0.075288714,0.01748947,0.203669794,-0.008334608,-0.026028035,0.007003289,0.01190047,-0.0007185480000000001,-0.015430861,0.007344188000000001,0.057286722000000005,0.030337517999999997,0.0035742309999999998,-0.023309575,-0.053721448,-0.0007522319999999999,0.028418487000000003,0.073307809,0.024468342999999997,0.003269689,0.064908338,-0.012638832,0.018888214,-0.007773541,0.011196986,-0.074914068,-0.002583145
1869,Analysis of the Potential for N(4)-Hydroxycytidine To Inhibit Mitochondrial Replication and Function,"N(4)-Hydroxycytidine (NHC) is an antiviral ribonucleoside analog that acts as a competitive alternative substrate for virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. It exhibits measurable levels of cytotoxicity, with 50% cytotoxic concentration values ranging from 7.5 μM in CEM cells and up to >100 μM in other cell lines. The mitochondrial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (POLRMT) has been shown to incorporate some nucleotide analogs into mitochondrial RNAs, resulting in substantial mitochondrial toxicity. NHC was tested in multiple assays intended to determine its potential to cause mitochondrial toxicity. NHC showed similar cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells incubated in a glucose-free and glucose-containing media, suggesting that NHC does not impair mitochondrial function in this cell line based on the Crabtree effect. We demonstrate that the 5′-triphosphate of NHC can be used by POLRMT for incorporation into nascent RNA chain but does not cause immediate chain termination. In PC-3 cells treated with NHC, the 50% inhibitory concentrations of mitochondrial protein expression inhibition were 2.7-fold lower than those for nuclear-encoded protein expression, but this effect did not result in selective mitochondrial toxicity. A 14-day incubation of HepG2 cells with NHC had no effect on mitochondrial DNA copy number or extracellular lactate levels. In CEM cells treated with NHC at 10 μM, a slight decrease (by ∼20%) in mitochondrial DNA copy number and a corresponding slight increase in extracellular lactate levels were detected, but these effects were not enhanced by an increase in NHC treatment concentration. In summary, the results indicate that mitochondrial impairment by NHC is not the main contributor to the compound’s observed cytotoxicity in these cell lines.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.102146277,-0.033591124,-0.007298999999999999,-0.053681722,-0.08540246300000001,0.030845205,0.031314547000000005,-0.021940937999999997,0.030961914,-0.02295371,-0.010237074,-0.002740438,-0.02341472,0.046752462,0.004318918,0.025511302000000003,-0.019006273,0.021207498999999998,0.04602413599999999,-0.041946687999999996,0.011396637,-0.010816733,0.038422105,-0.0008230469999999999,-0.005012164,0.006622275,-0.014641748000000001,0.027313357000000003,-0.00694311,-0.009571929
1871,Dispersion of the HIV-1 Epidemic in Men Who Have Sex with Men in the Netherlands: A Combined Mathematical Model and Phylogenetic Analysis,"BACKGROUND: The HIV-1 subtype B epidemic amongst men who have sex with men (MSM) is resurgent in many countries despite the widespread use of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). In this combined mathematical and phylogenetic study of observational data, we aimed to find out the extent to which the resurgent epidemic is the result of newly introduced strains or of growth of already circulating strains. METHODS AND FINDINGS: As of November 2011, the ATHENA observational HIV cohort of all patients in care in the Netherlands since 1996 included HIV-1 subtype B polymerase sequences from 5,852 patients. Patients who were diagnosed between 1981 and 1995 were included in the cohort if they were still alive in 1996. The ten most similar sequences to each ATHENA sequence were selected from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database, and a phylogenetic tree was created of a total of 8,320 sequences. Large transmission clusters that included ≥10 ATHENA sequences were selected, with a local support value ≥ 0.9 and median pairwise patristic distance below the fifth percentile of distances in the whole tree. Time-varying reproduction numbers of the large MSM-majority clusters were estimated through mathematical modeling. We identified 106 large transmission clusters, including 3,061 (52%) ATHENA and 652 Los Alamos sequences. Half of the HIV sequences from MSM registered in the cohort in the Netherlands (2,128 of 4,288) were included in 91 large MSM-majority clusters. Strikingly, at least 54 (59%) of these 91 MSM-majority clusters were already circulating before 1996, when cART was introduced, and have persisted to the present. Overall, 1,226 (35%) of the 3,460 diagnoses among MSM since 1996 were found in these 54 long-standing clusters. The reproduction numbers of all large MSM-majority clusters were around the epidemic threshold value of one over the whole study period. A tendency towards higher numbers was visible in recent years, especially in the more recently introduced clusters. The mean age of MSM at diagnosis increased by 0.45 years/year within clusters, but new clusters appeared with lower mean age. Major strengths of this study are the high proportion of HIV-positive MSM with a sequence in this study and the combined application of phylogenetic and modeling approaches. Main limitations are the assumption that the sampled population is representative of the overall HIV-positive population and the assumption that the diagnosis interval distribution is similar between clusters. CONCLUSIONS: The resurgent HIV epidemic amongst MSM in the Netherlands is driven by several large, persistent, self-sustaining, and, in many cases, growing sub-epidemics shifting towards new generations of MSM. Many of the sub-epidemics have been present since the early epidemic, to which new sub-epidemics are being added.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.006127499000000001,-0.020220533,-0.006879611,-0.085333454,0.028817657000000003,0.026490717,0.002011425,0.028867359,-0.016990164,-0.00506424,-0.011371289,0.048130117,-0.015137946999999999,-0.054741519,0.009297654,0.018979067,-0.007749538,0.040671017000000004,-0.017853651,0.005477275,0.013018789,-0.004157788,-0.035301999,0.014488318,-0.009809274,-0.024364984,0.017885309,-0.006947903,0.003165153,0.018572731000000002
1872,"Anti-HCV, nucleotide inhibitors, repurposing against COVID-19","Abstract Aims A newly emerged Human Coronavirus (HCoV) is reported two months ago in Wuhan, China (COVID-19). Until today >2700 deaths from the 80,000 confirmed cases reported mainly in China and 40 other countries. Human to human transmission is confirmed for COVID-19 by China a month ago. Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) reports, SARS HCoV is responsible for >8000 cases with confirmed 774 deaths. Additionally, MERS HCoV is responsible for 858 deaths out of about 2500 reported cases. The current study aims to test anti-HCV drugs against COVID-19 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Materials and methods In this study, sequence analysis, modeling, and docking are used to build a model for Wuhan COVID-19 RdRp. Additionally, the newly emerged Wuhan HCoV RdRp model is targeted by anti-polymerase drugs, including the approved drugs Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin. Key findings The results suggest the effectiveness of Sofosbuvir, IDX-184, Ribavirin, and Remidisvir as potent drugs against the newly emerged HCoV disease. Significance The present study presents a perfect model for COVID-19 RdRp enabling its testing in silico against anti-polymerase drugs.

1876,Human herpesvirus 6A induces apoptosis of HSB-2 cells via a mitochondrion-related caspase pathway(),"Apoptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of viral infections. In this study, we investigated the cell death processes during productive HHV-6A infection and the underlying mechanisms. Annexin V-PI staining and electron microscopy indicated that HHV-6A is a strong inducer of apoptosis. HHV-6A infection decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential and led to morphological changes of mitochondria. The cell death was associated with activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of DNA repair enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, which is known to be an important substrate for activated caspase-3. Caspase-9 was activated significantly in HHV-6A-infected cells, whereas caspase-8 was not activated obviously. Moreover, HHV-6A infection upregulated Bax and downregulated Bcl-2. This is the first demonstration of mitochondrion-mediated, caspase-dependent apoptosis in HHV-6A-infected cells.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.058343989000000006,-0.033057937999999995,-0.007779566999999999,-0.112876116,-0.075880775,0.047416892999999995,0.05008442900000001,-0.033705279,0.054645325999999994,-0.016648617,-0.028232167000000002,-0.011633821,-0.011181044,0.04966759900000001,0.0041265270000000005,0.040208202,0.001158636,-0.02229427,-0.009906716999999999,-0.00298891,0.020882301000000002,-0.00309474,-0.001688644,-0.020036145,0.046568360999999996,0.012176801000000001,-0.067387917,0.035228864,-0.008776339000000001,-0.049035880999999996
1879,Efficient Structure Resonance Energy Transfer from Microwaves to Confined Acoustic Vibrations in Viruses,"Virus is known to resonate in the confined-acoustic dipolar mode with microwave of the same frequency. However this effect was not considered in previous virus-microwave interaction studies and microwave-based virus epidemic prevention. Here we show that this structure-resonant energy transfer effect from microwaves to virus can be efficient enough so that airborne virus was inactivated with reasonable microwave power density safe for the open public. We demonstrate this effect by measuring the residual viral infectivity of influenza A virus after illuminating microwaves with different frequencies and powers. We also established a theoretical model to estimate the microwaves power threshold for virus inactivation and good agreement with experiments was obtained. Such structure-resonant energy transfer induced inactivation is mainly through physically fracturing the virus structure, which was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. These results provide a pathway toward establishing a new epidemic prevention strategy in open public for airborne virus.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.037129646,-0.039844317000000004,0.010883613,0.014547155,-0.025473992999999997,0.073618383,-0.007868305,-0.008679486,0.014772246999999999,-0.007639094,-0.015531743999999998,-0.019022101,-0.005680675,-0.028805584,0.041958725,0.002619148,0.002534197,-0.010703424,-0.015479275,0.006322681,-0.009017959,-0.024169088999999998,0.008073917,0.009910138,-0.011396072,0.01780447,0.023223611,0.014491111000000001,0.0032075190000000003,-0.024960111
1880,Intracellular Crosslinking of Filoviral Nucleoproteins with Xintrabodies Restricts Viral Packaging,"Viruses assemble large macromolecular repeat structures that become part of the infectious particles or virions. Ribonucleocapsids (RNCs) of negative strand RNA viruses are a prime example where repetition of nucleoprotein (NP) along the genome creates a core polymeric helical scaffold that accommodates other nucleocapsid proteins including viral polymerase. The RNCs are transported through the cytosol for packaging into virions through association with viral matrix proteins at cell membranes. We hypothesized that RNC would be ideal targets for crosslinkers engineered to promote aberrant protein–protein interactions, thereby blocking their orderly transport and packaging. Previously, we had generated single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) against Filoviruses that have all targeted highly conserved C-terminal regions of NP known to be repetitively exposed along the length of the RNCs of Marburgvirus (MARV) and Ebolavirus (EBOV). Our crosslinker design consisted of dimeric sdAb expressed intracellularly, which we call Xintrabodies (X- for crosslinking). Electron microscopy of purified NP polymers incubated with purified sdAb constructs showed NP aggregation occurred in a genus-specific manner with dimeric and not monomeric sdAb. A virus-like particle (VLP) assay was used for initial evaluation where we found that dimeric sdAb inhibited NP incorporation into VP40-based VLPs whereas monomeric sdAb did not. Inhibition of NP packaging was genus specific. Confocal microscopy revealed dimeric sdAb was diffuse when expressed alone but focused on pools of NP when the two were coexpressed, while monomeric sdAb showed ambivalent partition. Infection of stable Vero cell lines expressing dimeric sdAb specific for either MARV or EBOV NP resulted in smaller plaques and reduced progeny of cognate virus relative to wild-type Vero cells. Though the impact was marginal at later time-points, the collective data suggest that viral replication can be reduced by crosslinking intracellular NP using relatively small amounts of dimeric sdAb to restrict NP packaging. The stoichiometry and ease of application of the approach would likely benefit from transitioning away from intracellular expression of crosslinking sdAb to exogenous delivery of antibody. By retuning sdAb specificity, the approach of crosslinking highly conserved regions of assembly critical proteins may well be applicable to inhibiting replication processes of a broad spectrum of viruses.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.09390246199999999,-0.033236753,0.00023228099999999998,-0.019069759,-0.047288567999999996,0.029340296000000002,0.014785475,-0.015264777,0.023896478,-0.011411048,-0.026703603,-0.012148556000000001,-0.0032482179999999998,0.009897442,0.006820848000000001,-0.006083348000000001,0.007784622,-0.0232438,-0.011026659,0.0005686409999999999,-0.003576979,0.010766076000000001,-0.011019273999999999,-0.015777028000000002,0.029994173,0.035671053,0.00593207,-0.012333151,-0.046679618,0.007757617

It contains six conserved domains (CR-I to -VI; Fig. 1a). CR-III has been linked to polymerase and polyadenylation activity, CR-V to mRNA capping and CR-VI to cap methylation. However, how these activities are choreographed is poorly understood. Here we present the 2.2-Å X-ray structure and activities of CR-VI+, a portion of human Metapneumovirus L consisting of CR-VI and the poorly conserved region at its C terminus, the +domain. The CR-VI domain has a methyltransferase fold, which besides the typical S-adenosylmethionine-binding site ((SAM)P) also contains a novel pocket ((NS)P) that can accommodate a nucleoside. CR-VI lacks an obvious cap-binding site, and the (SAM)P-adjoining site holding the nucleotides undergoing methylation ((SUB)P) is unusually narrow because of the overhanging +domain.

In this study, BNoV was detected in 27.6% (8/29) of tested fecal materials, collected from sporadic cases of diarrheic calves, using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and primers that target RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene. Additionally, one primer pair was designed to flank the BNoV-VP2 (small capsid protein) gene for molecular analysis. Study VP2 sequences were phylogenetically-related to BNoV-GIII.2 (Newbury2-like) genotype, which is highly prevalent all over the world. However, they were separated within the cluster and one strain (41FR) grouped with recombinant GIII.P1/GIII.2 strains. Compared to reference VP2 sequences, 14 amino acid substitution mutations were found to be unique to our strains.

1886,"Probable person to person transmission of novel avian influenza A (H7N9) virus in Eastern China, 2013: epidemiological investigation","Objective To determine whether the novel avian influenza H7N9 virus can transmit from person to person and its efficiency. Design Epidemiological investigations conducted after a family cluster of two patients with avian H7N9 in March 2013. Setting Wuxi, Eastern China. Participants Two patients, their close contacts, and relevant environments. Samples from the patients and environments were collected and tested by real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), viral culture, and haemagglutination inhibition assay. Any contacts who became ill had samples tested for avian H7N9 by rRT-PCR. Paired serum samples were obtained from contacts for serological testing by haemagglutination inhibition assays. Main outcomes measures Clinical data, history of exposure before the onset of illnesses, and results of laboratory testing of pathogens and further analysis of sequences and phylogenetic tree to isolated strains. Results The index patient became ill five to six days after his last exposure to poultry. The second patient, his daughter aged 32, who provided unprotected bedside care in the hospital, had no known exposure to poultry. She developed symptoms six days after her last contact with her father. Two strains were isolated successfully from the two patients. Genome sequence and analyses of phylogenetic trees showed that both viruses were almost genetically identical. Forty three close contacts of both patients were identified. One had mild illness but had negative results for avian H7N9 by rRT-PCR. All 43 close contacts tested negative for haemagglutination inhibition antibodies specific for avian H7N9. Conclusions The infection of the daughter probably resulted from contact with her father (the index patient) during unprotected exposure, suggesting that in this cluster the virus was able to transmit from person to person.

We also determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the presence of 16 respiratory viruses. Samples were collected pre-HSCT, at day 0, +10, +20 and +30 after HSCT. Peripheral blood (PB) was also analyzed to determine T and NK cell numbers. A total of 27 pediatric HSCT recipients were enrolled and 16 of them had at least one viral detection (60%). Rhinovirus was the most frequent pathogen (84% of positive NPAs). NPAs of patients contained fewer T and NK cells compared to healthy controls (p = 0.0132 and p = 0.120, respectively). Viral PCR + patients showed higher NK cell number in their NPAs. The activating receptors repertoire expressed by NK cells was also higher in NPA samples, especially NKp44 and NKp46. Our study supports NK cells relevance for the immune defense against respiratory viruses in HSCT recipients.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.065347222,-0.047318434000000006,-0.015600371000000002,-0.069843349,-0.03696372,-0.030973572999999997,0.026824912000000003,-0.009918585,-0.0015659110000000001,0.017231629,-0.011971316999999999,-0.046241038,0.009424433000000001,0.08838747699999999,0.023606899,-0.011363779,0.014001746,-0.068688259,0.045285792000000005,-0.014862299999999998,0.018393872,-0.024345852999999997,-0.003995563,0.026372327,0.000536145,-0.010399371,-0.014838525,0.002431312,-0.031284062,-0.049841567
1893,Hsp70 Isoforms Are Essential for the Formation of Kaposi’s Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus Replication and Transcription Compartments,"Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic herpesvirus associated with various AIDS-related malignancies. Like other herpesviruses, multiple processes required for KSHV lytic replication, including viral transcription, viral DNA synthesis and capsid assembly occur in virus-induced intranuclear structures, termed replication and transcription compartments (RTCs). Here we utilised a novel methodology, combining subcellular fractionation and quantitative proteomics, to identify cellular proteins which are recruited to KSHV-induced RTCs and thus play a key role in KSHV lytic replication. We show that several isoforms of the HSP70 chaperone family, Hsc70 and iHsp70, are redistributed from the cytoplasm into the nucleus coinciding with the initial formation of KSHV-induced RTCs. We demonstrate that nuclear chaperone foci are dynamic, initially forming adjacent to newly formed KSHV RTCs, however during later time points the chaperones move within KSHV RTCs and completely co-localise with actively replicating viral DNA. The functional significance of Hsp70 isoforms recruitment into KSHV RTCs was also examined using the specific Hsp70 isoform small molecule inhibitor, VER-155008. Intriguingly, results highlight an essential role of Hsp70 isoforms in the KSHV replication cycle independent of protein stability and maturation. Notably, inhibition of Hsp70 isoforms precluded KSHV RTC formation and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) relocalisation to the viral genome leading to the abolishment of global KSHV transcription and subsequent viral protein synthesis and DNA replication. These new findings have revealed novel mechanisms that regulate KSHV lytic replication and highlight the potential of HSP70 inhibitors as novel antiviral agents.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.10746599400000001,-0.043306156,-0.021800755,-0.021122772,-0.08563191199999999,0.01839947,0.053592412,-0.009025586,0.025515693,0.004631708,-0.013658446999999999,-0.015571162,-0.001613915,0.039675748999999996,0.00120601,0.021417999,-0.003073261,-0.025430792999999997,-0.019914462,0.017884074,-0.025376287,0.048367832,-0.058070739,-0.019215105,0.02084438,-0.026257548999999998,-0.017415548,-0.0009668939999999999,0.010888911000000001,0.010497616000000001
1899,Discovery of Metal Ions Chelator Quercetin Derivatives with Potent Anti-HCV Activities,"Analogues or isosteres of α,γ-diketoacid (DKA) 1a show potent inhibition of hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B polymerase through chelation of the two magnesium ions at the active site. The anti-HCV activity of the flavonoid quercetin (2) could partly be attributed to it being a structural mimic of DKAs. In order to delineate the structural features required for the inhibitory effect and improve the anti-HCV potency, two novel types of quercetin analogues, 7-O-arylmethylquercetins and quercetin-3-O-benzoic acid esters, were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their anti-HCV properties in cell-based assays. Among the 38 newly synthesized compounds, 7-O-substituted derivative 3i and 3-O-substituted derivative 4f were found to be the most active in the corresponding series (EC(50) = 3.8 μM and 9.0 μΜ, respectively).

1900,BCX4430 – A broad-spectrum antiviral adenosine nucleoside analog under development for the treatment of Ebola virus disease,"Summary The adenosine nucleoside analog BCX4430 is a direct-acting antiviral drug under investigation for the treatment of serious and life-threatening infections from highly pathogenic viruses, such as the Ebola virus. Cellular kinases phosphorylate BCX4430 to a triphosphate that mimics ATP; viral RNA polymerases incorporate the drug's monophosphate nucleotide into the growing RNA chain, causing premature chain termination. BCX4430 is active in vitro against many RNA viral pathogens, including the filoviruses and emerging infectious agents such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In vivo, BCX4430 is active after intramuscular, intraperitoneal, and oral administration in a variety of experimental infections. In nonclinical studies involving lethal infections with Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Rift Valley fever virus, and Yellow Fever virus, BCX4430 has demonstrated pronounced efficacy. In experiments conducted in several models, both a reduction in the viral load and an improvement in survival were found to be related to the dose of BCX4430. A Phase 1 clinical trial of intramuscular administration of BCX4430 in healthy subjects is currently ongoing.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.054755776,0.085494275,-0.12393086699999999,0.078813613,-0.08570241199999999,0.027855905,0.07254645900000001,0.042147223,0.083553479,0.09652927800000001,0.063079469,-0.034979347,0.023145781,-0.020748831000000002,0.038722267000000005,-0.018735445,-0.030853749,0.050021323,0.035786627,0.039165411000000004,-0.035544292000000005,0.016687924,-0.02604205,0.075158419,0.006111189,-0.024180269,0.039493278,-0.036481852,0.040399857000000004,0.03148016

1905,Therapeutic Efficacy of the Small Molecule GS-5734 against Ebola Virus in Rhesus Monkeys,"The most recent Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa – unprecedented in the number of cases and fatalities, geographic distribution, and number of nations affected – highlights the need for safe, effective, and readily available antiviral agents for treatment and prevention of acute Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) or sequelae(1). No antiviral therapeutics have yet received regulatory approval or demonstrated clinical efficacy. Here we describe the discovery of a novel anti-EBOV small molecule antiviral, GS-5734, a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog. GS-5734 exhibits antiviral activity against multiple variants of EBOV in cell-based assays. The pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) is efficiently formed in multiple human cell types incubated with GS-5734 in vitro, and the NTP acts as an alternate substrate and RNA-chain terminator in primer-extension assays utilizing a surrogate respiratory syncytial virus RNA polymerase. Intravenous administration of GS-5734 to nonhuman primates resulted in persistent NTP levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (half-life = 14 h) and distribution to sanctuary sites for viral replication including testes, eye, and brain. In a rhesus monkey model of EVD, once daily intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg GS-5734 for 12 days resulted in profound suppression of EBOV replication and protected 100% of EBOV-infected animals against lethal disease, ameliorating clinical disease signs and pathophysiological markers, even when treatments were initiated three days after virus exposure when systemic viral RNA was detected in two of six treated animals. These results provide the first substantive, post-exposure protection by a small-molecule antiviral compound against EBOV in nonhuman primates. The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of GS-5734 in vitro against other pathogenic RNA viruses – including filoviruses, arenaviruses, and coronaviruses – suggests the potential for expanded indications. GS-5734 is amenable to large-scale manufacturing, and clinical studies investigating the drug safety and pharmacokinetics are ongoing.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.06623227,-0.022203509,-0.032192826,0.000436508,-0.092596795,0.060470277,0.081385859,0.007743985,0.02693961,0.027306021,0.04864703099999999,0.012891731000000002,0.011748999999999999,0.003979938,0.019632616999999998,0.0008270160000000001,-0.037838876,0.099891706,0.04497542,-0.0024468470000000003,-0.0020435970000000003,-0.012734009,-0.024498467000000003,0.03946107,0.032698269,0.006484075,0.017254771000000002,-0.0018395529999999998,0.02308067,-0.015262327
1910,Divergent Sapovirus Strains and Infection Prevalence in Wild Carnivores in the Serengeti Ecosystem: A Long-Term Study,"The genus Sapovirus, in the family Caliciviridae, includes enteric viruses of humans and domestic animals. Information on sapovirus infection of wildlife is limited and is currently lacking for any free-ranging wildlife species in Africa. By screening a large number of predominantly fecal samples (n = 631) obtained from five carnivore species in the Serengeti ecosystem, East Africa, sapovirus RNA was detected in the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta, family Hyaenidae), African lion (Panthera leo, family Felidae), and bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis, family Canidae), but not in golden or silver-backed jackals (Canis aureus and C. mesomelas, respectively, family Canidae). A phylogenetic analysis based on partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene sequences placed the sapovirus strains from African carnivores in a monophyletic group. Within this monophyletic group, sapovirus strains from spotted hyenas formed one independent sub-group, and those from bat-eared fox and African lion a second sub-group. The percentage nucleotide similarity between sapoviruses from African carnivores and those from other species was low (< 70.4%). Long-term monitoring of sapovirus in a population of individually known spotted hyenas from 2001 to 2012 revealed: i) a relatively high overall infection prevalence (34.8%); ii) the circulation of several genetically diverse variants; iii) large fluctuations in infection prevalence across years, indicative of outbreaks; iv) no significant difference in the likelihood of infection between animals in different age categories. The likelihood of sapovirus infection decreased with increasing hyena group size, suggesting an encounter reduction effect, but was independent of socially mediated ano-genital contact, or the extent of the area over which an individual roamed.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.060934598,-0.010753767,-0.016861171,-0.052006343,0.142899928,0.03824927,0.10096903800000001,0.05065165,-0.055940193,-0.020599361,0.003752725,0.005523381999999999,-0.043709775,-0.00810549,-0.004649882,-0.000587981,-0.017730513,0.012201825,0.002302715,0.00344818,0.017063089,-0.015453815,-0.045573987999999996,-0.004360939,-0.0016136770000000002,-0.032358336,-0.01021978,-0.0064219130000000004,-0.019974388,0.019112793
1913,"Viral deep sequencing needs an adaptive approach: IRMA, the iterative refinement meta-assembler","BACKGROUND: Deep sequencing makes it possible to observe low-frequency viral variants and sub-populations with greater accuracy and sensitivity than ever before. Existing platforms can be used to multiplex a large number of samples; however, analysis of the resulting data is complex and involves separating barcoded samples and various read manipulation processes ending in final assembly. Many assembly tools were designed with larger genomes and higher fidelity polymerases in mind and do not perform well with reads derived from highly variable viral genomes. Reference-based assemblers may leave gaps in viral assemblies while de novo assemblers may struggle to assemble unique genomes. RESULTS: The IRMA (iterative refinement meta-assembler) pipeline solves the problem of viral variation by the iterative optimization of read gathering and assembly. As with all reference-based assembly, reads are included in assembly when they match consensus template sets; however, IRMA provides for on-the-fly reference editing, correction, and optional elongation without the need for additional reference selection. This increases both read depth and breadth. IRMA also focuses on quality control, error correction, indel reporting, variant calling and variant phasing. In fact, IRMA’s ability to detect and phase minor variants is one of its most distinguishing features. We have built modules for influenza and ebolavirus. We demonstrate usage and provide calibration data from mixture experiments. Methods for variant calling, phasing, and error estimation/correction have been redesigned to meet the needs of viral genomic sequencing. CONCLUSION: IRMA provides a robust next-generation sequencing assembly solution that is adapted to the needs and characteristics of viral genomes. The software solves issues related to the genetic diversity of viruses while providing customized variant calling, phasing, and quality control. IRMA is freely available for non-commercial use on Linux and Mac OS X and has been parallelized for high-throughput computing.

1916,Anti-cytomegalovirus activity of the anthraquinone atanyl blue PRL,"Abstract Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) causes significant disease in immunocompromised patients and serious birth defects if acquired in utero. Available CMV antivirals target the viral DNA polymerase, have significant toxicities, and suffer from resistance. New drugs targeting different pathways would be beneficial. The anthraquinone emodin is proposed to inhibit herpes simplex virus by blocking the viral nuclease. Emodin and related anthraquinones are also reported to inhibit CMV. In the present study, emodin reduced CMV infectious yield with an EC50 of 4.9μM but was cytotoxic at concentrations only twofold higher. Related anthraquinones acid blue 40 and alizarin violet R inhibited CMV at only high concentrations (238–265μM) that were also cytotoxic. However, atanyl blue PRL inhibited infectious yield of CMV with an EC50 of 6.3μM, significantly below its 50% cytotoxic concentration of 216μM. Atanyl blue PRL reduced CMV infectivity and inhibited spread. When added up to 1h after infection, it dramatically reduced CMV immediate early protein expression and blocked viral DNA synthesis. However, it had no antiviral activity when added 24h after infection. Interestingly, atanyl blue PRL inhibited nuclease activities of purified CMV UL98 protein with IC50 of 4.5 and 9.3μM. These results indicate that atanyl blue PRL targets very early post-entry events in CMV replication and suggest it may act through inhibition of UL98, making it a novel CMV inhibitor. This compound may provide valuable insights into molecular events that occur at the earliest times post-infection and serve as a lead structure for antiviral development.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.05933573599999999,-0.029711941000000002,-0.00657164,-0.064057969,-0.098148496,0.054571685,0.06014648,-0.0047283970000000005,0.02282306,0.023698882,-0.018706706,0.00670563,0.005293739,0.013289293999999998,-0.007559094000000001,0.006506338,-0.015146363000000001,0.046232607,0.017196842,0.010868273000000001,-0.003670472,0.009269290999999999,-0.018592942,0.014973647,0.020748057,0.016617796,-0.002421043,-0.006744762,0.008718649,0.02579036
1917,Evaluation of Four Different Systems for Extraction of RNA from Stool Suspensions Using MS-2 Coliphage as an Exogenous Control for RT-PCR Inhibition,"Knowing when, and to what extent co-extracted inhibitors interfere with molecular RNA diagnostic assays is of utmost importance. The QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (A); MagNA Pure LC2.0 Automatic extractor (B); KingFisher (C); and NucliSENS EasyMag (D) RNA extraction systems were evaluated for extraction efficiency and co-purification of inhibitors from stool suspensions. Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) of MS-2 coliphage spiked into each system’s lysis buffer served as an external control for both. Cycle thresholds (Cts) of the MS2 were determined for RNA extracted from stool suspensions containing unknown (n = 93) or varying amounts of inhibitors (n = 92). Stool suspensions from the latter group were also used to determine whether MS-2 and enterovirus rRT-PCR inhibitions were correlated. Specifically 23 RNA extracts from stool suspensions were spiked with enterovirus RNA after extraction and 13 of these stool suspension were spiked with intact enterovirus before extraction. MS2 rRT-PCR inhibition varied for RNAs extracted by the different systems. Inhibition was noted in 12 (13.0%), 26 (28.3%), 7 (7.6%), and 7 (7.6%) of the first 93 RNA extracts, and 58 (63.0%), 55 (59.8%), 37 (40.2%) and 30 (32.6%) of the second 92 extracts for A, B, C, and D, respectively. Furthermore, enterovirus rRT-PCR inhibition correlated with MS2 rRT-PCR inhibition for added enterovirus RNA or virus particles. In conclusion, rRT-PCR for MS-2 RNA is a good predictor of inhibition of enterovirus RNA extracted from stool suspensions. EasyMag performed the best, however all four extraction methods were suitable provided that external controls identified problematic samples.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.060432204,0.011966714,0.044762012999999996,0.048756704000000005,-0.018876981,-0.05467708,-0.010888837,0.040464673,-0.034182715,0.017604447,0.070348998,0.00116734,-0.021519824,0.04939871,0.034845062999999996,0.011229655,0.005422511,0.016748897,0.04438033,-0.10832177400000001,-0.028849009,0.03643478,0.018594498,-0.04907148099999999,-0.033346601000000003,-0.032807991,0.013830948000000001,-0.031958482,0.021382903999999998,0.025184132

All isolates could not be identified for known viral pathogens by routine diagnostic assays. They were pooled into 8 groups of 5–6 isolates to reduce the sequencing cost. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was conducted for each group of mixed samples, and the proposed data analysis pipeline was used to identify viral pathogens in these mixed samples. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was individually conducted for each of these 42 isolates depending on the predicted viral types in each group. Two isolates remained unknown after these tests. Moreover, iteration mapping was implemented for each of these 2 isolates, and predicted human parechovirus (HPeV) in both. In summary, our NGS pipeline detected the following viruses among the 42 isolates: 29 human rhinoviruses (HRVs), 10 HPeVs, 1 human adenovirus (HAdV), 1 echovirus and 1 rotavirus. We then focused on the 10 identified Taiwanese HPeVs because of their reported clinical significance over HRVs. Their genomes were assembled and their genetic diversity was explored. One novel 6-bp deletion was found in one HPeV-1 virus. In terms of nucleotide heterogeneity, 64 genetic variants were detected from these HPeVs using the mapped NGS reads. Most importantly, a recombination event was found between our HPeV-3 and a known HPeV-4 strain in the database. Similar event was detected in the other HPeV-3 strains in the same clade of the phylogenetic tree. These findings demonstrated that the proposed NGS data analysis pipeline identified unknown viruses from the mixed clinical samples, revealed their genetic identity and variants, and characterized their genetic features in terms of viral evolution.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.008507187,-0.025511374,0.048274637,-0.048663600999999994,0.124091914,0.026722957000000002,0.03561407,-0.012229481,-0.028643615,0.090652096,0.012971864,0.016809768,-0.009514679,-0.017416097,0.033525634,-0.064537737,-0.059211136,0.004177865,-0.023666081000000002,-0.003772395,0.065953497,0.063729693,-0.0010230460000000001,0.078787708,-0.081407073,-0.011485361000000001,0.034089492,0.046548015,-0.074185974,0.012023555
1935,The role of lateral pterygoid muscle in the traumatic temporomandibular joint ankylosis: A gene chip based analysis,"Traumatic temporomandibular joint ankylosis (TMJA) is a common disease and disorder of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ); however, its pathogenesis has yet to be completely elucidated. In the authors' previous studies, the lateral pterygoid muscle (LPM) was confirmed to exert a function in distraction osteogenesis (DO) during the healing of a condylar fracture, which resulted in the formation of excess bone. The aim of the present study was to investigate alterations in the expression of any associated genes via an Affymetrix GeneChip method. The traumatic TMJA model was fabricated by a condylar fracture in the TMJ area of sheep with either a dissected LPM (LPD) or normal (LPN). The untreated sheep served as a control. At 4- and 12 weeks post-surgery, the condylar zone was isolated to perform the gene chip analysis, which was performed according to a standard Affymetrix protocol. The validated genes were further evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The gene chip analysis indicated that the LPN gene expression pattern was similar compared with the DO process, while LPD was similar to that of normal bone fracture healing. The validated genes were collagen type II α1 chain, C-type lectin domain family 3 member A, interleukin 1A, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, chondromodulin (LECT1), calcitonin receptor (CALCR), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, Fos proto-oncogene (FOS), bone γ-carboxyglutamate protein and bone morphogenic protein (BMP)7, among which, BMP7, LECT1, CALCR and FOS were confirmed by RT-qPCR. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that LPM exerts a DO effect during the pathogenesis of traumatic TMJA, which may provide a novel target for preventing TMJA.",0,1,0,0,0,0,-0.066183971,0.004539217,0.070640475,-0.09977924,-0.029163976,0.024547287,-0.021271161,-0.0370905,0.040986697999999995,-0.058753673,-0.097524288,-0.010207814,-0.030275378999999998,0.045322177000000005,-0.046214528,-0.043572422,0.028141243,-0.053382017999999996,-0.048929442999999996,-0.028215538999999998,0.026728698,0.006276308,-0.00223224,0.045632049,-0.027277787999999997,0.010171185,0.046087075,0.014334081,0.028315947,-0.034190086
