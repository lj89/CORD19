34,"Type-specific identification of influenza viruses A, B and C by the polymerase chain reaction","Abstract The aim of this study was to develop a polymerase chain reaction for specific detection of influenza A, B, and C RNA genomes. Three primer sets were selected from conserved regions of the genome coding for the non-structural proteins and were tested on 61 influenza A (22 H1N1, 9 H2N2, and 30 H3N2), 11 influenza B, and three influenza C isolates. Specific amplified products were obtained with all these strains after electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. The specificity of the reaction was increased by hybridization with oligonucleotide probes. When nucleic acids from a variety of micro-organisms from the respiratory tract were subjected to the PCR with these primers, no specific amplified products were generated. The sensitivity of the technique was found to be at the subpicogram level. The RNA-PCR was applied to 21 clinical specimens from patients with a culture/IF proven influenza infection. Six influenza A positive patients and 13 influenza B positive patients could be confirmed in the RNA-PCR. In two cases, influenza B positive IF specimens were found negative by the PCR. No virus could be isolated on eggs or tissue culture from these samples. RNA-PCR is a specific and sensitive technique for the detection of influenza virus genomes.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.129571914,-0.046816895,0.07479658,0.265312349,0.022438251,0.214423773,-0.272072608,0.044106840999999994,-0.138467392,-0.041966055999999995,0.046692252999999996,0.013103861999999999,0.043587830999999994,0.073959711,-0.013146215,-0.021851891000000002,0.058804305999999994,-0.001735236,-0.018341866999999998,-0.09047127599999999,-0.004497526,0.010231305,0.066543638,-0.070658102,-0.037026831,-0.019286694,-0.068301163,0.002444785,-0.046796635999999996,0.10989475
83,28 New and Emerging Infections of the Lung,"Abstract In this era of rapid globalization and frequent travel, emerging viral infections have gained an immense potential to spread at an unprecedented speed and scale compared with the past. This poses a significant challenge to coordinated international efforts in global surveillance and infection control. Significantly, respiratory viral infections, spread mostly via droplet transmission, are extremely contagious and have caused significant morbidity and mortality during outbreaks in the last decade. Molecular diagnostics via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been key in the rapid diagnosis of most of these viral infections. However, a high index of suspicion and early institution of appropriate isolation measures remain as the mainstay in the control and containment of the spread of these viral infections. Although treatment for most of the viral infections remains supportive, efficacious antiviral agents against influenza infections exist. The infections discussed in this chapter include those first described in the 2000s: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and metapneumovirus and rhinovirus C as well as those that have been described in the past but have reemerged in the last decade in outbreaks resulting in significant morbidity and mortality, including adenovirus, influenza virus, and enterovirus D68 (EV-D68).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.11379010099999999,0.028762238,-0.03048459,0.09978385199999999,-0.051313273,0.079952272,0.045584630999999994,0.080057871,0.127040276,0.07802322,0.019717838,-0.048446191,0.075759332,-0.028794182,0.059542877,-0.039231979,-0.004433151,0.01760543,-0.021514752999999998,0.032564562000000005,-0.021465856000000002,-0.03439515,-0.068765785,0.062173321,0.02710518,-0.012494392,0.005531724,-0.046905952,0.057766152,0.024338292
86,Identification of New Pathogens in the Intraocular Fluid of Patients With Uveitis,"Purpose To determine infectious causes in patients with uveitis of unknown origin by intraocular fluids analysis. Design Case-control study. Methods Ocular fluids from 139 patients suspected of infectious uveitis, but negative for herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, and Toxoplasma gondii by polymerase chain reaction and/or antibody analysis in intraocular fluids, were assessed for the presence of 18 viruses and 3 bacteria by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The ocular fluids from 48 patients with uveitis of known etiology or with cataract were included as controls. Results Positive PCR results were found for Epstein-Barr virus, for rubella virus, and for human herpesvirus 6 each in 1 patient and for human parechovirus in 4 patients. Of the human parechovirus–positive patients, 1 was immunocompromised and had panuveitis. The other 3 patients were immunocompetent and had anterior uveitis, all with corneal involvement.

87,2009 H1N1 Influenza: A Twenty-First Century Pandemic With Roots in the Early Twentieth Century,"Abstract A swine-origin H1N1 triple-reassortant influenza A virus found to be a distant relative of the 1918 “Spanish flu” virus emerged in April 2009 to give rise to the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century. Although disease was generally mild and similar to seasonal influenza, severe manifestations including respiratory failure were noted in some, particularly those with underlying conditions such as asthma, pregnancy and immunosuppression. Children and younger adults accounted for most cases, hospitalizations and deaths. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay was superior to antigen-based rapid tests for diagnosis. All 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza strains were susceptible to 1 or more neuraminidase inhibitors. Monovalent, unadjuvanted 2009 H1N1 vaccines were licensed in the United States in September 2009 and initially targeted to younger individuals, pregnant women, caretakers of infants and healthcare providers. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic highlights the need for modernization of influenza vaccines, improved diagnostics and more rigorous evaluation of mitigation strategies.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.119648415,-0.077578274,-0.006617999,0.134348079,-0.040377701,0.288035286,-0.12246711,0.005931675,0.0006841089999999999,-0.10216597599999999,0.014141226000000002,0.050370862,0.004987635,-0.067342184,0.023881361,0.034875075,-0.014446158,0.025796467000000003,-0.053584274,-0.044930535,0.006282866999999999,-0.031813432,-0.049023165,-0.036095725,-0.050266877,0.058425883,-0.058324679000000004,0.028096517,0.056862822,0.105608721
96,Multiplex Molecular Detection of Respiratory Pathogens in Children With Asthma Exacerbation,"Background Up to 80% of asthma exacerbations in white children are associated with viral upper respiratory infections. The relative importance of different respiratory pathogens and relevant microbiological data in Asian children are unclear. This study elucidated the epidemiology of respiratory infections in Hong Kong children with asthma exacerbation. Methods A total of 209 children aged 3-18 years with asthma exacerbations and 77 controls with stable asthma were recruited. The severity of asthma exacerbations was assessed according to Global Initiative for Asthma guideline, and subjects aged 6 years or older performed exhaled nitric oxide and spirometric measurements. Nested multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to detect 20 different respiratory pathogens. Results Respiratory pathogens were detected in 105 (51.0%) subjects. The presence of any respiratory pathogen was associated with asthma exacerbation (odds ratio [OR], 2.77; 95% CI, 1.51–5.11; P < .001). Specifically, human rhinovirus (HRV) infection was more common among children with asthma exacerbation (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.09–5.32; P = .018). All other pathogens or coinfections were not associated with asthmatic attacks. None of these respiratory infections was associated with the severity of asthma exacerbation (P > .15 for all). During peak HRV season in the winter of 2007 to 2008, this virus was detected in 46.4% of children with asthma exacerbations. Conclusions Respiratory viral infections are commonly found in children with asthma exacerbation, with HRV being the most important pathogen in our patients. Respiratory viral infection is a triggering factor for asthma exacerbation but does not correlate with its severity.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.19996577199999999,-0.128555088,-0.10197493,-0.050380247999999996,0.008442683000000001,-0.132211016,0.086884725,-0.06582762,0.032911754,0.026827242,-0.034683276,-0.044164499,-0.037306723,-0.045622120999999995,0.024621755,0.043524504000000006,0.006020915999999999,-0.135989391,0.075819863,-0.047519048,-0.072473328,-0.158692834,-0.055197105999999996,0.169608343,-0.047645810999999996,0.175175634,-0.146867771,-0.07500638700000001,0.170679369,0.246267017
97,The Natural Viral Load Profile of Patients With Pandemic 2009 Influenza A(H1N1) and the Effect of Oseltamivir Treatment,"Background The natural history of viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract of the new pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) and the effect of oseltamivir treatment were uncertain. Methods A retrospective cohort study involving 145 consecutive patients with specimens positive by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for the matrix and new H1 genes was conducted. Results The nontreated and oseltamivir-treated patients were comparable in their viral load at presentation, demography, and the presenting symptoms. No correlation was observed between viral load with age and number of symptoms. Viral load of nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was significantly lower in treated than in nontreated patients at day 5 after symptom onset. When oseltamivir was initiated ≤ 2 days after symptom onset, a greater rate of viral load reduction in NPA of treated patients than that of nontreated patients was observed (−0.638 [95% CI, −0.809 to −0.466] vs −0.409 [95% CI, −0.663 to −0.185] log10 copies/mL/d post-symptom onset), and the viral load was undetectable at day 6 after oseltamivir initiation, which was 1 day earlier than that of those whose treatment was initiated > 2 days of symptom onset. The viral load was inversely correlated with concomitant absolute lymphocyte count in nontreated patients (Pearson correlation coefficient [r] = −0.687, P = .001) and treated patients (Pearson r = −0.365, P < .001). Resolution of fever was 1.4 days later in nontreated than treated patients (P = .012) Conclusions The natural viral load profile was described. Oral oseltamivir suppresses viral load more effectively when given early in mild cases of pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) infections.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.150781807,-0.0498899,-0.099375083,-0.047279922,-0.10648442400000001,0.035659629,-0.062703991,0.060290254,-0.12292674199999999,-0.006657749,0.002771178,0.019202501,-0.022411356,0.068917163,-0.038144056,0.018251322,-0.028934667999999997,0.01481786,0.0057880119999999995,-0.000364719,-0.06706153299999999,-0.00943513,-0.107802125,0.013335037,-0.10441921,-0.012542257,0.027765899,-0.11802384099999999,-0.051117558,0.08624392800000001
98,"Clinical Course of Avian Influenza A(H5N1) in Patients at the Persahabatan Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia, 2005–2008","Background Limited understanding of the presentation and course of influenza A(H5N1) infection in humans hinders evidence-based management. Methods We reviewed the case records of patients admitted to the Persahabatan Hospital (RSP), Jakarta, Indonesia, with influenza A(H5N1) confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results Twenty-two previously well patients, aged 3 to 47 years (median 24.5 years), were identified. All attended a clinic or hospital after a median of 2 days of illness (range 0–7). Times to first dose of oseltamivir (three died before receiving oseltamivir) were 2 to 12 days (median 7 days), administered mostly (n = 15) at RSP. Nineteen patients required mechanical ventilation. Deaths numbered 18 (case fatality = 82%) occurring within hours to 6 days of RSP admission, corresponding to 6 to 16 days of illness. Admission hyperglycemia (≥ 140 mg/dL), unrelated to steroids or known underlying diabetes mellitus, and elevated D-dimer levels (0.81–5.2 mg/L, upper limit of normal < 0.5 mg/L) were present in 14/21 (67%) and 20/21 (95%) patients, respectively. Fibrinogen concentrations were mostly low/normal at 129.9 to 517.9 mg/dL (median 241.1, normal 200–400 mg/dL), whereas C-reactive protein (9/11) and ferritin (6/8) levels were increased. Risk factors for death (univariate analysis) included: (1) increased D-dimers, (2) hyperglycema, (3) increased urea, (4) more extensive chest radiograph shadowing, and (5) lower admission oxygen saturation. Conclusions Early diagnosis and effective treatment of human influenza A(H5N1) infection remains challenging. Most patients were referred late with advanced disease. Oseltamivir had limited clinical impact. Elevated D-dimer levels, consistent with fibrinolysis, and hyperglycemia warrant more research to determine their underlying mechanisms and optimal treatment.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.135777019,-0.037723664,-0.080116033,-0.082488916,-0.08741688800000001,0.081518155,-0.08725910199999999,0.085144322,-0.08491636,-0.030876336,-0.008435198,0.034480457,-0.034437381,0.040422629,-0.060944045,0.04229815,-0.007963568,0.043910280999999995,-0.010345038,0.012411853999999998,0.008369854,-0.043908073,-0.04583330099999999,-0.029926749,-0.038505725,-0.013834076,0.012364306,-0.049057104000000004,-0.020657117,0.0068240440000000005
99,Respiratory Viruses in Adults With Community-Acquired Pneumonia,"Background Use of nucleic acid amplification techniques has increased the identification of respiratory viruses (RVs) in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The objectives of the present study were to identify RV in patients with CAP using three different sampling methods and to compare CAP virus proportions and types with two comparison groups. Methods The study population included 183 adult patients with CAP, 450 control subjects, and 201 patients with nonpneumonic lower respiratory tract infection (NPLRTI). Each participant was sampled by oropharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, and nasopharyngeal washing, and the samples were tested for detection of 12 RVs by multiplex TaqMan Hydrolysis probe-based real-time polymerase chain reaction (Integrated DNA Technology; Coralville, IA). Results At least one RV was identified in 58 patients with CAP (31.7%) compared with 32 (7.1%) in control subjects and 104 (51.7%) in patients with NPLRTI (P < .01 and P < .01, respectively). Coronaviruses were identified in 24 (13.1%) patients with CAP, compared with 17 (3.8%) in control subjects, and 21 (10.4%) patients with NPLRTI. Respiratory syncytial virus was identified in 13 (7.1%), four (0.9%), and seven (3.5%); rhinovirus in nine (4.9%), nine (2.0%), and 15 (7.5%); and influenza virus in eight (4.4%), two (0.4%), and 63 (31.3%) patients with CAP, control subjects, and patients with NPLRTI, respectively. Conclusions The proportion of RV involvement in CAP is higher than previously reported. The proportion of RV identified in healthy subjects is significantly lower than in CAP, but it is not zero and should be weighed when interpreting corresponding proportions among patients.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.219107668,-0.054670559,-0.078630243,-0.074246475,-0.052045502,-0.078702096,-0.074538904,0.119195049,-0.24693393100000002,0.091445922,-0.115018358,0.009215214000000001,0.021790737999999997,0.057780492,-0.12221727800000001,-0.049104466,0.035250763,-0.009922178,-0.037965679,0.12013795099999999,0.030013266,-0.027014467,0.197911693,0.083076676,0.08740543199999999,-0.11199932800000001,-0.010896878,0.068854926,0.067115714,0.079241582
100,"Upper-Respiratory Viral Infection, Biomarkers, and COPD Exacerbations","Background Respiratory viruses frequently are recovered in the upper-respiratory tract during acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), but their role as contributing pathogens remains unclear. The usefulness of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein as indicators of the presence or absence of viral infection in this setting also needs to be evaluated. Methods The study was of a prospective cohort of patients with COPD admitted to the ED for AECOPD. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for 14 respiratory viruses was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs collected at admission and after recovery in stable condition. Results Eighty-six patients (mean age, 72 years; male, 64%) were included. During AECOPD, upper-respiratory viral infections were detected in 44 (51%) patients: picornavirus in 22, metapneumovirus in seven, coronavirus in eight, influenza A/B in two, parainfluenza in two, and respiratory syncytial virus in three. A dual infection was present in three patients. After recovery, viruses were detected in only eight (11%) of 71 patients (P < .001 compared with AECOPD phase). In five of these patients, no virus had been identified during the initial exacerbation, thus suggesting a new viral infection acquired during follow-up. During AECOPD, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels did not differ significantly between patients with or without a proven viral infection. Conclusions Prevalence of upper-respiratory viral infection, as detected from nasopharyngeal swab by RT-PCR, is high in AECOPD and low after clinical recovery, suggesting that AECOPD frequently are triggered by viral infections initiated in the upper-respiratory tract. In our study, serum procalcitonin and C-reactive protein did not discriminate virus-associated exacerbations from others.

102,A Prospective Study of Respiratory Viral Infection in Pregnant Women With and Without Asthma,"Background Respiratory viral infections are common in pregnancy, but their health impact, especially in asthma, is unknown. The objective of this study was to assess the frequency, severity, and consequences of respiratory viral infection during pregnancy in women with and without asthma. Methods In this prospective cohort study, common cold symptoms were assessed during pregnancy in 168 women with asthma and 117 women without asthma using the common cold questionnaire and by self-report. Nasal and throat swabs were collected for suspected infections and tested by polymerase chain reaction for respiratory viruses. Pregnancy and asthma outcomes were recorded. Results Pregnant women with asthma had more prospective self-reported and questionnaire-detected common colds than pregnant women without asthma (incidence rate ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.30-2.42; P < .0001). Retrospectively reported common colds in early pregnancy and post partum were increased in women with asthma compared with women without asthma. The severity of cold symptoms was also increased in women with asthma (total cold score median, 8; interquartile range [5, 10] in women with asthma vs 6 [5, 8] in control subjects; P = .031). Among women with asthma, having a laboratory-confirmed viral infection was associated with poorer maternal health, with 60% of infections associated with uncontrolled asthma and a higher likelihood of preeclampsia. Conclusions Pregnant women with asthma have more common colds during pregnancy than pregnant women without asthma. Colds during pregnancy were associated with adverse maternal and pregnancy outcomes.

105,Viral Etiology of Acute Exacerbations of COPD in Hong Kong,"Introduction Viral respiratory infections may precipitate acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). However, little is known about viral etiology related to AECOPD in Asia. We aimed to study the viral etiology of AECOPD in Hong Kong. Methods Patients admitted to an acute hospital in Hong Kong with AECOPD were recruited prospectively from May 1, 2004, to April 30, 2005. Nasopharyngeal aspirate was collected and assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and viral culture. Spirometry was performed in the stable phase at 2 to 3 months after hospital discharge. Results There were 262 episodes of AECOPD among 196 patients (mean age, 75.7 ± 7.7 years [± SD]; 160 men). Mean FEV1 was 39.6 ± 18.9% of predicted normal, and FEV1/FVC ratio was 58.0 ± 15.2%. Fifty-eight episodes (22.1%) yielded positive viral PCR results. The viruses identified were influenza A (7.3%), coronavirus OC43 (4.6%), rhinovirus (3.1%), influenza B (2.7%), and respiratory syncytial virus (2.3%). The diagnostic yield of viral identification by PCR was 2.7 times higher than that based on conventional viral culture. The rates of identifying a positive viral etiology by PCR were similar among the subjects with FEV1 ≥ 50%, ≥ 30 to 50%, and < 30% of predicted normal. Viral infection appeared to have no effect on subsequent readmissions or mortality rate over a study period of 1 year Conclusion Influenza A and two less-attended viruses, coronavirus OC43 and rhinovirus, were the common etiologic agents in patients hospitalized with AECOPD in Hong Kong. These should be considered in developing diagnostic and intervening strategies pertaining to AECOPD.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.159769788,-0.061995917000000005,-0.06057010400000001,0.019330141999999998,-0.023383495,-0.004724541,-0.029960924,0.014335941999999999,-0.078606101,0.044713561,-0.018219555,-0.022585146,0.037960138,0.050113237000000005,0.006524079,-0.027932231000000002,0.055084592,-0.023898482999999998,0.022865534,-0.016701529,-0.008457479,-0.047751678,-0.026624886,0.04260694,-0.008620308,0.017033016,0.020286493,-0.031166374,0.004201495,0.09031581400000001
106,The Role of Viral Infection in Pulmonary Exacerbations of Bronchiectasis in Adults A Prospective Study,"BACKGROUND Although viral infections are a major cause of exacerbations in patients with chronic airway diseases, their roles in triggering bronchiectasis exacerbations in adults remain unclear. Therefore, we prospectively investigated the incidence and clinical impacts of viral infection in adults with bronchiectasis exacerbations. METHODS The study cohort of 119 adults with bronchiectasis was followed up prospectively for 12 months. Nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples were assayed for 16 respiratory viruses, using polymerase chain reaction assays. Symptoms, spirometry, quality of life, bacterial cultures, and inflammatory markers were assessed during steady-state bronchiectasis and exacerbations. RESULTS A total of 100 exacerbations were captured from 58 patients during 1-year follow-up. Respiratory viruses were found more frequently in nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum during bronchiectasis exacerbations (49 of 100, 49.0') than during steady state (11 of 58, 18.9'; P < .001). The most common viruses found in patients experiencing exacerbations were coronavirus (19 of 65, 39.2'), rhinovirus (16 of 65, 24.6'), and influenza A/B viruses (16 of 65, 24.6'). Virus-positive exacerbations were associated with a greater increase in markers of systemic and airway inflammation (serum IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α; sputum IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α) compared with virus-negative exacerbations, but the differences in spirometric indexes, quality of life, and bacterial density were unremarkable. In receiver operating characteristics analysis, serum interferon-γ-induced protein 10 yielded an area under curve of 0.67 (95' CI, 0.53-0.77; P = .018). Furthermore, a greater proportion of patients with virus-positive exacerbations received IV antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS Prevalence of viral infections, detected by polymerase chain reaction assay, is higher in cases of bronchiectasis exacerbations than in steady-state bronchiectasis, suggesting that respiratory viruses play crucial roles in triggering bronchiectasis exacerbations. The potential mechanisms of virus-induced bronchiectasis exacerbations merit further investigations.

107,Effect of Interactions Between Lower Airway Bacterial and Rhinoviral Infection in Exacerbations of COPD,"Study objectives The inflammatory responses and associated clinical severity of COPD exacerbations are greatly variable, and the determinants of these factors are poorly understood. We examined the hypothesis that bacteria and viruses may modulate this heterogeneity and that interactions between bacterial and viral infection may affect changes in airway bacterial load and the clinical features and inflammatory responses of exacerbations in patients with COPD. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Outpatient Department, London Chest Hospital, London, UK. Patients Thirty-nine patients with COPD. Measurements We prospectively studied 56 COPD exacerbations, obtaining clinical data and paired sputum and serum samples at baseline and exacerbation. Qualitative and quantitative microbiology, polymerase chain reaction detection for rhinovirus, and estimation of cytokine levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed. Results A total of 69.6% of exacerbations were associated with a bacterial pathogen, most commonly Haemophilus influenzae. Rhinovirus was identified in 19.6% of exacerbations. The rise in bacterial load at exacerbation correlated with the rise in sputum interleukin (IL)-8 (r = 0.37, p = 0.022) and fall in FEV1 (r = 0.35, p = 0.048). Exacerbations with both rhinovirus and H influenzae had higher bacterial loads (108.56 cfu/mL vs 108.05cfu/mL, p = 0.018) and serum IL-6 (13.75 pg/mL vs 6.29 pg/mL, p = 0.028) than exacerbations without both pathogens. In exacerbations with both cold symptoms (a marker of putative viral infection) and a bacterial pathogen, the FEV1 fall was greater (20.3% vs 3.6%, p = 0.026) and symptom count was higher (p = 0.019) than those with a bacterial pathogen alone. Conclusions The clinical severity and inflammatory responses in COPD exacerbations are modulated by the nature of the infecting organism: bacterial and viral pathogens interact to cause additional rises in inflammatory markers and greater exacerbation severity.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.098509198,-0.063355621,-0.039879001000000004,-0.14405366,-0.086458044,-0.06553065799999999,0.046642485,0.025512076,-0.099171935,0.053916559,-0.049429229000000005,-0.055184878,-0.029155526,0.02040012,-0.021828391000000003,-0.01660482,0.011639848999999999,-0.069406547,0.009958075,-0.04041543,-0.015678325,-0.108322641,0.007999379000000001,0.076734123,-0.028739602000000003,0.049255425,0.010347143,-0.002408317,0.09186585,0.136866889
108,"Características de las infecciones respiratorias agudas causadas por los coronavirus OC43, NL63 y 229E","Resumen Antecedentes y objetivos Las infecciones respiratorias agudas son una entidad muy frecuente en la población general. La mayoría de ellas son debidas a infecciones víricas. Este estudio pretende precisar las características clínicas y epidemiológicas de los pacientes adultos con infección respiratoria por los coronavirus OC43, NL63 y 229E. Pacientes y métodos Entre enero del 2013 y febrero del 2014 se estudió prospectivamente a todos los pacientes con sospecha clínica de infección respiratoria mediante la toma de un frotis faríngeo y la realización de una reacción en cadena de la polimerasa en transcripción reversa en tiempo real en búsqueda de coronavirus. Resultados En 48 casos (7,0% de los 686 pacientes incluidos; 12,6% de los 381 en los que se detectó algún virus) se pudo demostrar la presencia de algún coronavirus. En 24 casos se trataba del OC43 (50%), en 14 del NL63 (29%) y en 10 del 229E (21%). La edad media fue de 54,5 años, con un ligero predominio de varones. Las presentaciones clínicas más frecuentes fueron el cuadro gripal inespecífico (43,7%), la neumonía (29,2%) y la agudización de enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva crónica (8,3%). El 52% de los pacientes precisaron ingreso hospitalario, en 2 ocasiones en cuidados intensivos. No se produjo ningún fallecimiento. Conclusión Las infecciones respiratorias agudas causadas por coronavirus inciden preferentemente en varones fumadores en la edad media de la vida, frecuentemente afectados de enfermedades previas. La sintomatología clínica mas frecuente ha sido el cuadro gripal inespecífico. Abstract Background and objectives Acute respiratory infection is a very common condition in the general population. The majority of these infections are due to viruses. This study attempted to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of adult patients with respiratory infection by the coronavirus OC43, NL63 and 229E. Patients and methods Between January 2013 and February 2014, we prospectively studied all patients with suspected clinical respiratory infection by taking throat swabs and performing a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in search of coronavirus. Results In 48 cases (7.0% of the 686 enrolled patients; 12.6% of the 381 in whom a virus was detected) the presence of a coronavirus demonstrated. In 24 cases, the virus was OC43 (50%); in 14 cases, the virus was NL63 (29%); and in 10 cases, the virus was 229E (21%). The mean age was 54.5 years, with a slight predominance of men. The most common clinical presentations were nonspecific influenza symptoms (43.7%), pneumonia (29.2%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (8.3%). Fifty-two percent of the patients required hospitalization, and 2 patients required intensive care. There were no deaths. Conclusion Acute respiratory infections caused by coronavirus mainly affect middle-aged male smokers, who are often affected by previous diseases.

111,Acute respiratory viral infections in pediatric cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy,"Abstract Objective to estimate the prevalence of infection by respiratory viruses in pediatric patients with cancer and acute respiratory infection (ARI) and/or fever. Methods cross-sectional study, from January 2011 to December 2012. The secretions of nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed in children younger than 21 years with acute respiratory infections. Patients were treated at the Grupo em Defesa da Criança Com Câncer (Grendacc) and University Hospital (HU), Jundiaí, SP. The rapid test was used for detection of influenza virus (Kit Biotrin, Inc. Ireland), and real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (FTD, Respiratory pathogens, multiplex Fast Trade Kit, Malta) for detection of influenza virus (H1N1, B), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parechovirus, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, and human coronavirus. The prevalence of viral infection was estimated and association tests were used (χ2 or Fisher's exact test). Results 104 samples of nasopharyngeal aspirate and blood were analyzed. The median age was 12 ± 5.2 years, 51% males, 68% whites, 32% had repeated ARIs, 32% prior antibiotic use, 19.8% cough, and 8% contact with ARIs. A total of 94.3% were in good general status. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (42.3%) was the most prevalent neoplasia. Respiratory viruses were detected in 50 samples: rhinoviruses (23.1%), respiratory syncytial virus AB (8.7%), and coronavirus (6.8%). Co-detection occurred in 19% of cases with 2 viruses and in 3% of those with 3 viruses, and was more frequent between rhinovirus and coronavirus 43. Fever in neutropenic patients was observed in 13%, of which four (30.7) were positive for viruses. There were no deaths. Conclusions the prevalence of respiratory viruses was relevant in the infectious episode, with no increase in morbidity and mortality. Viral co-detection was frequent in patients with cancer and ARIs.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.329732117,-0.086808278,-0.080130948,0.13726776400000001,0.039673075,-0.047192622000000004,-0.030474332000000003,0.012576084,-0.028936536000000002,0.075915213,-0.00123834,-0.051714872,0.090404704,0.038109965,0.07414797299999999,-0.049223641,0.052662138,-0.082964784,0.095496415,0.033481733,0.030310422000000004,-0.039921707,-0.037459342,0.018395436,0.025544692,0.057268321,-0.037397127,0.050040825,-0.069401517,-0.114876165
126,Respiratory Viruses in Laryngeal Croup of Young Children,"Objectives To determine the viral cause of laryngeal croup by use of highly sensitive methods, and including recently recognized viruses in the analysis. Study design One hundred forty-four consecutive children with hoarse voice and inspiratory stridor attending the emergency department were enrolled. Age- and season-matched children presenting with a wheezing illness served as control subjects (n = 76). Nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction for rhinovirus and enterovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), influenza A and B virus, human bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Results Virus infection was documented in 80% of patients with croup and 71% of control subjects. Children with croup had significantly more positive test results for PIV 1 and 2 (31% vs 4% and 6% vs 0%, respectively) and significantly fewer positive test results for RSV (15% vs 28%) than wheezing children. Rhinoviruses and enteroviruses were present equally in both groups (21% vs 25%). There was no significant difference in the frequency of influenza A virus or human bocavirus. Few subjects with adenovirus or M. pneumoniae were detected. Conclusion Acute laryngeal croup is most often associated with PIV, RSV, rhinovirus, and enterovirus. Rhinovirus and enterovirus appeared equally often in croup and in wheezing illness. During late fall, they were found in 39% and 40%, respectively, of the tested samples.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.23716904600000002,-0.14659792,-0.08812626,0.052595197999999996,0.043902875,-0.052422376,0.011237038999999999,-0.080542436,0.038802408999999996,-0.040930762,0.008546545,-0.06378974,-0.073297407,-0.042688335,-0.015567672,-0.003938917,-0.013373901,-0.032635405,0.026681245,-0.027806037999999998,-0.029526565,-0.0023571160000000002,0.057965098,0.032534094,0.015353516000000001,0.006237208,0.07932510799999999,0.086754637,-0.020822477,0.021564245
128,Respiratory Pathogens in Children with and without Respiratory Symptoms,"Objectives To investigate the occurrence of respiratory pathogens in samples from children with and without respiratory symptoms and to identify whether age and/ or coinfections modify the impact of respiratory pathogens on symptoms. Study design In a prospective longitudinal study, 18 children were sampled biweekly for respiratory pathogens, irrespective of respiratory symptoms. Polymerase chain reaction was performed for 13 respiratory pathogens. Episodes were defined “asymptomatic” if no symptoms of any respiratory tract illness were present between 1 week before and 1 week after sampling. Results A total of 230 samples were collected. In 56% of the symptomatic episodes, a pathogen was detected, compared with 40% of the asymptomatic episodes (P = .03). Rhinovirus and coronaviruses were most prevalent in both symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes. In the youngest children, 9% of the pathogen-positive episodes were asymptomatic, compared with 36% in the oldest children (P = .01). Multiple pathogens were found in 17% of the symptomatic episodes and in 3% of the asymptomatic episodes (P = .02). Conclusions Respiratory pathogens are frequently detected in samples from children with no respiratory symptoms.

129,Association of Human Metapneumovirus with Radiologically Diagnosed Community-Acquired Alveolar Pneumonia in Young Children,"Objectives To determine the involvement of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in childhood community-acquired alveolar pneumonia (CAAP) and compare the demographic, clinical, and laboratory features of HMPV-associated CAAP and CAAP associated with other respiratory viruses. Study design Nasopharyngeal wash specimens obtained prospectively over a 4-year period from children age < 5 years evaluated in the emergency department with radiologically diagnosed CAAP and from healthy controls were tested for HMPV by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, influenza and parainfluenza viruses by direct immunofluorescence and culture. Results HMPV was detected in 108 of 1296 patients (8.3%) versus RSV in 23.1%, adenovirus in 3.4%, influenza A virus in 2.9%, and parainfluenza viruse in 2.9%. During the period of peak activity (November to May), HMPV was detected in 95 of 1017 patients (9.3%) and in 3 of 136 controls (2.2%) (P = .005). The patients with HMPV were older than those with RSV (P < .001) with a more common history of acute otitis media requiring tympanocentesis (P = .032), wheezing (P = .001) and gastrointestinal symptoms (P < .001) and a lower hospitalization rate (P = .005). Conclusions The high detection rate suggests an important role for HMPV in childhood CAAP. Our findings identify demographic and clinical features of HMPV-positive CAAP and its age-related impact on hospital admissions.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.26565510800000003,-0.134674301,-0.104320405,0.08478831099999999,0.024496872000000003,-0.10867185300000001,0.01090736,-0.11076698199999999,0.110940044,-0.104252913,0.013384575,-0.06429908,-0.154151163,0.010533579,-0.17226111100000002,-0.062369844,-0.026961298999999998,0.253679149,-0.170609178,0.071532132,0.17103990300000002,0.035724094,0.047809902,-0.119212797,-0.072562023,-0.021816936000000002,-0.164798784,-0.109714986,-0.043854335,-0.048561112999999996
130,Viral Respiratory Tract Infections in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: The VIRIoN-I Study,"Objective To determine the frequency of respiratory viral infections among infants who were evaluated for late-onset sepsis in the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) of Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Texas; and Women & Infants Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island. Study design Prospective cohort study conducted from January 15, 2012 to January 31, 2013. Infants in the NICU were enrolled if they were inborn, had never been discharged home, and were evaluated for sepsis (at >72 hours of age) and antibiotic therapy was initiated. Infants had a nasopharyngeal specimen collected for detection of respiratory viruses by multiplex polymerase chain reaction within 72 hours of the initiation of antibiotic therapy. Their medical records were reviewed for demographic, clinical, radiographic, and laboratory data until NICU discharge. Results During the 13-month study, 8 of 100 infants, or 8 (6%) of the 135 sepsis evaluations, had a respiratory virus detected by polymerase chain reaction (2, enterovirus/rhinovirus; 2, rhinovirus; 2, coronaviruses; and 2, parainfluenza-3 virus). By bivariate analysis, the infants with viral detection were older (41 vs 11 days; P = .007), exposed to individuals with respiratory tract viral symptoms (37% vs 2%; P = .003), tested for respiratory viruses by provider (75% vs 11%; P < .001), and had lower total neutrophil counts (P = .02). In multivariate regression analysis, the best predictor of viral infection was the caregivers' clinical suspicion of viral infection (P = .006). Conclusions A total of 8% of infants, or 6% of all NICU sepsis evaluations, had a respiratory virus detected when evaluated for bacterial sepsis. These findings argue for more respiratory viral testing of infants with suspected sepsis using optimal molecular assays to establish accurate diagnoses, prevent transmission, and inform antibiotic stewardship efforts.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.16290217699999998,-0.072213873,-0.058674202,-0.003691854,-0.00571525,-0.064773519,0.045480744000000004,0.010291799999999999,0.02574516,0.037038026,0.00360833,-0.03621406,-0.009452985,-0.034939675,0.061157267,0.033802467,0.037752256,-0.046964253,0.07611284,0.0005603159999999999,-0.043828334000000004,-0.10551119099999999,-0.08408857,-0.009202561,0.08032881900000001,-0.029501269,0.02331116,-0.007767315,-0.004378036,-0.065487015
132,"Polymerase chain reaction–based detection of rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and coronavirus in otitis media with effusion","Abstract Objectives: To study the association of human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human coronavirus infections in children aged 6 months to 12 years with otitis media with effusion (OME). To determine how long HRV RNA can be detected after HRV infection. Methods: Middle ear effusion (MEE) samples collected at the time of tympanostomy tube placement from 100 children with OME were examined. Viral RNA was detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. For HRV the results were compared with virus isolation in cell culture. In vitro studies of the persistence of HRV infectivity and RNA were conducted by combining ~105 median cell culture infectious doses of HRV with pooled MEE at 37°C and assaying serial samples for 12 weeks. Results: Virus RNA was detected in 30 children. HRV was detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 19 children with OME and by virus isolation in 5 children. RSV RNA was found in 8 and HCV in 3 children with OME. No dual viral infection was found. Bacterial pathogens were isolated from 35 MEE samples and were associated with viral RNA in 11 cases, most often with HRV (9 cases). Under in vitro conditions, HRV culture positivity declined rapidly (<2 days), but RNA was detectable for up to 8 weeks. Conclusions: These results suggest that virus infection, particularly HRV infection, either alone or concurrent with bacteria, is present in a larger percentage of children with OME than previously suspected. It remains to be determined how often the presence of viral RNA in MEE represents persistent RNA, ongoing viral replication, or recurrent infection.

196,Effectiveness of hand hygiene and provision of information in preventing influenza cases requiring hospitalization,"Abstract Background The objective of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions in preventing cases of influenza requiring hospitalization. Methods We performed a multicenter case-control study in 36 hospitals, in 2010 in Spain. Hospitalized influenza cases confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and three matched controls (two hospital and one community control) per case were selected. The use of non-pharmacological measures seven days before the onset of symptoms (frequency of hand washing, use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers and handwashing after touching contaminated surfaces) was collected. Results We studied 813 cases hospitalized for influenza and 2274 controls. The frequency of hand washing 5-10 times (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=0.65) and >10 times (aOR=0.59) and handwashing after contact with contaminated surfaces (aOR=0.65) were protective factors and were dose-responsive (p<0.001). Alcohol-based hand sanitizers were associated with marginal benefits (aOR=0.82). Conclusions Frequent handwashing should be recommended to prevent influenza cases requiring hospitalization.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.103462253,-0.054561053,-0.03356353,-0.010659905,-0.038461719,0.127801036,-0.082016876,0.02461084,-0.033878671,-0.096189791,0.017065848,0.036439933,-0.06529476299999999,-0.06853036400000001,-0.004012765,0.059280853,-0.04325232,-0.010745886000000001,-0.007860106,-0.023736952999999998,-0.093605748,0.037581442,-0.014119312,-0.011663145,-0.018716567,0.024083601,-0.020736292,-0.0020773479999999997,-0.002714445,0.003025715
202,Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's swine influenza (H1N1) pneumonia diagnostic weighted point score system for hospitalized adults with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) and negative rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs),"Background In spring 2009, a novel strain of influenza A originating in Veracruz, Mexico, quickly spread to the United States and throughout the world. This influenza A virus was the product of gene reassortment of 4 different genetic elements: human influenza, swine influenza, avian influenza, and Eurasian swine influenza. In the United States, New York was the epicenter of the swine influenza (H1N1) pandemic. Hospital emergency departments (EDs) were inundated with patients with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) requesting screening for H1N1. Our ED screening, as well as many others, used a rapid screening test for influenza A (QuickVue A/B) because H1N1 was a variant of influenza A. The definitive laboratory test i.e., RT-PCR for H1N1 was developed by the Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, GA) and subsequently distributed to health departments. Because of the extraordinary volume of test requests, health authorities restricted reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Hence most EDs, including our own, were dependent on rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) for swine influenza. A positive rapid influenza A test was usually predictive of RT-PCR H1N1 positivity, but the rapid influenza A screening test (QuickVue A/B) was associated with 30% false negatives. The inability to rely on RIDTs for H1N1 diagnosis resulted in underdiagnosing H1N1. Confronted with adults admitted with ILIs, negative RIDTs, and restricted RT-PCR testing, there was a critical need to develop clinical criteria to diagnose probable swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia. Methods During the pandemic, the Infectious Disease Division at Winthrop-University Hospital developed clinical criteria for adult admitted patients with ILIs and negative RIDTs. Similar to the one developed for the clinical diagnosis of legionnaire's disease. The Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's diagnostic weighted point score system for swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia is based on key clinical and laboratory features. Results During the “herald” wave of the swine influenza H1N1 pandemic, the diagnostic weighted point score system accurately identified probable swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia and accurately differentiated swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia from ILIs and other viral and bacterial community-acquired pneumonias. Conclusion In hospitalized adults with ILIs and negative RIDTs, the diagnostic weighted diagnostic point score system, may be used to make a presumptive clinical diagnosis of swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.162502485,-0.053311721,0.054408815,0.19715345399999998,-0.06544333299999999,0.35707058700000005,-0.221264995,0.061698655,-0.118053589,-0.109291699,0.00020072400000000003,0.04685183,0.024186617,-0.018185542,-0.014601435,0.012294726,0.009832097,0.054430849,-0.107644546,-0.042897452999999995,-0.009721679,0.017402285,0.016972961,-0.095883741,-0.060403317000000005,0.037261956,-0.049131445,0.003326617,0.03939382,0.095502055
203,Rapid clinical diagnosis in fatal swine influenza (H1N1) pneumonia in an adult with negative rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs): Diagnostic swine influenza triad,"Background The “herald wave” of the H1N1 pandemic spread from Mexico to the United States in spring 2009. Initially, the epicenter of H1N1 in the United States was in the New York area. Our hospital, like others, was inundated with large numbers of patients who presented at the Emergency Department (ED) with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) for swine influenza testing and evaluation. Methods The Winthrop-University Hospital ED used rapid influenza (QuickVue A/B) tests to screen for H1N1 infection. Patients who were rapid influenza A test-positive were also reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive for H1N1. In our ED, 30% of patients with ILIs and possible H1N1 pneumonia had negative rapid influenza A screening tests. Because H1N1 RT-PCR testing was restricted, there was no laboratory test to confirm or rule out H1N1. Other rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs), e.g., the respiratory fluorescent antibody (FA) viral panel test, were used to identify H1N1 patients with negative RIDTs. Results Unfortunately, there was not a good correlation between RIDT results and RT-PCR results. There was a critical need to develop a clinical syndromic approach for diagnosing hospitalized adults with probable H1N1 pneumonia with negative RIDTs. Early in the pandemic, the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division developed a diagnostic weighted point score system to diagnose H1N1 pneumonia clinically in RIDT-negative adults. The point score system worked well, but was time-consuming. As the “herald wave” of the pandemic progressed, our ED staff needed a rapid, simplified method to diagnose probable H1N1 pneumonia in hospitalized adults with negative RIDTs. A rapid and simplified diagnosis was based on the diagnostic weighted point score system, which we simplified into a triad of key, nonspecific laboratory indicators. In adults hospitalized with an ILI, a fever >102°F with severe myalgias, and a chest x-ray without focal segmental/lobar infiltrates, the presence of three indicators, i.e., otherwise unexplained relative lymphopenia, elevated serum transaminases, and an elevated creatinine phosphokinase, constituted the diagnostic swine influenza triad. The Infectious Disease Division's diagnostic swine flu triad was used effectively as the pandemic progressed, and was not only useful in correctly diagnosing probable H1N1 pneumonia in hospitalized adults with negative RIDTs, but was also in ruling out mimics of swine influenza, e.g., exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, asthma, or congestive heart failure, as well as bacterial community-acquired pneumonias (CAPs), e.g., legionnaire's disease. Conclusion Clinicians can use the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's Diagnostic swine influenza triad to make a rapid clinical diagnosis of probable H1N1 pneumonia in hospitalized adult patients with negative RIDTs.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.16545046900000002,-0.019511096000000002,0.040981816000000004,0.09094522599999999,-0.09225528300000001,0.202457401,-0.16679029999999997,0.08394406199999999,-0.129377417,-0.047444283,-0.012573218999999998,0.044416335999999994,0.031372799,-0.009968171999999999,-0.024070067999999997,0.021690598999999998,0.006098141,0.069928223,-0.109356442,-0.040660456,-0.001552072,-0.008178856,-0.0029262259999999997,-0.114340241,-0.059117749000000004,0.049439085,-0.03921898,0.003034615,0.013379806999999999,0.11038088
204,Rapid clinical diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease during the “herald wave” of the swine influenza (H1N1) pandemic: The Legionnaires' disease triad,"Background In adults hospitalized with atypical community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), Legionnaires' disease is not uncommon. Legionnaire's disease can be differentiated from typical CAPs and from other atypical CAPs based on its characteristic pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement. The first clinically useful diagnostic weighted point score system for the clinical diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was developed by the Infectious Disease Division at Winthrop-University Hospital in the 1980s. It has proven to be diagnostically accurate and useful for more than two decades, but was time-consuming. Because Legionella spp. diagnostic tests are time-dependent and problematic, a need was perceived for a rapid, simple way to render a clinical, syndromic diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease pending Legionella test results. During the “herald wave” of the swine influenza (H1N1) pandemic in the New York area, our hospital, like others, was inundated with patients who presented to the Emergency Department with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) for H1N1 testing/evaluation. Most patients with ILIs did not have swine influenza. Hospitalized patients with ILIs who tested positive with rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) were placed on influenza precautions and treated with oseltamivir. Unfortunately, approximately 30% of adult patients admitted with an ILI had negative RIDTs. Because the definitive laboratory diagnosis of H1N1 pneumonia by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR), testing was restricted by health departments, resulted in clinical and infection control dilemmas in determining which RIDT-negative patients did, in fact, have H1N1 pneumonia. Objective Accordingly, a diagnostic weighted point score system was developed for H1N1 pneumonia patients, based on RT-PCR positivity by the Infectious Disease Division at Winthrop-University Hospital. This diagnostic point score system for hospitalized adults with negative RIDTs was time-consuming. As the pandemic progressed, a simplified diagnostic swine influenza (H1N1) triad was developed for the rapid clinical diagnosis of probable H1N1 pneumonia, which also differentiated it from its mimics as well as from bacterial pneumonia, eg, Legionnaires' disease. During the “herald wave” of the H1N1 pandemic, we noticed an unexplained increase in Legionnaires' disease CAPs. Because clinical resources were stressed to the maximum during the pandemic, it was critically important to rapidly identify patients rapidly with Legionnaire's disease who did not require influenza precautions or oseltamivir, but who did require anti-Legionella antimicrobial therapy. Methods Based on the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's diagnostic weighted point score system for Legionnaires' disease (modified), key indicators were identified and became the basis for the diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad. The diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad was used to make a clinical diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease until the results of Legionella diagnostic tests were reported. The diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad diagnosed Legionnaires' disease in hospitalized adults with CAPs with extrapulmonary findings (atypical CAP) and relative bradycardia, accompanied by any three (ie, a triad) of the following: otherwise unexplained relative lymphopenia, early/mildly elevated serum transaminases (SGOT/SGPT), highly increased ferritin levels (≥2 × n), or hypophosphatemia. The diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad provides clinicians with a rapid way to clinically diagnose Legionnaires' disease, pending Legionella test results. Results The accuracy of the diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad was confirmed in our 9 cases of Legionnaires' disease by subsequent Legionella diagnostic testing. Conclusions The diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad is particularly useful in situations where a rapid clinical syndromic diagnosis is needed, ie, during an H1N1 pandemic.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.108705835,-0.008376651,0.041758392000000005,0.006535121999999999,-0.089750516,0.11691282,-0.076515424,0.070410198,-0.092608195,0.006785183,-0.019163208,0.026553316,0.045216692999999995,-0.044547561,-0.027946552000000003,0.019491043,-0.015556456000000001,0.072228351,-0.09536615,-0.017082968,0.014944763,-0.008936406,0.016868038000000002,-0.09400066900000001,-0.0144164,0.009888102,-0.02788586,-0.000645766,0.018603233,0.059414394

The fragments of amplified genetic material were visualized with the use of agarose gel electrophoresis. Results: Adenovirus DNA was found in 78.4% of asthmatic children, rhinovirus RNA in 32.4% and coronavirus RNA in 2.7%.

213,Aetiology of febrile pharyngitis in children: Potential of myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) as a biomarker of viral infection,"Summary Objectives Besides group A streptococcus (GAS), microbial causes of pharyngitis in children are not well known. We aimed to document the viral and bacterial aetiology of pharyngitis and to assess the pathogenic role of viruses by determining the myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) in the blood as a marker of interferon response. Methods In this prospective observational study, throat swabs and blood samples were collected from children (age 1–16 years) presenting to the emergency department with febrile pharyngitis. Microbial cause was sought by bacterial culture, polymerase chain reaction, and serology. Blood MxA level was determined. Results A potential pathogen was detected in 88% of 83 patients: GAS alone in 10%, GAS and viruses in 13%, group C or G streptococci alone in 2% and together with viruses in 3%, and viruses alone in 59% of cases. Enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, and adenoviruses were the most frequently detected viruses. Blood MxA levels were higher in children with viral (880 [245–1250] μg/L; median [IQR]) or concomitant GAS-viral (340 [150–710] μg/L) than in those with sole GAS (105 [80–160] μg/L) infections. Conclusions Detection of respiratory viruses simultaneously with elevated blood MxA levels supports the causative role of viruses in the majority of children with pharyngitis.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.093665319,-0.07812668099999999,-0.036236935,-0.033241793,0.001709894,-0.038162427,0.066402535,-0.024123862000000003,-0.028324891,0.023185083,0.0073456419999999994,-0.042599578,-0.008006012,-0.021985657999999998,0.004814916,-0.020838047,-0.01334104,-0.058523412999999996,0.017926529,-0.019320317,-0.039122813,0.081218939,0.013148545,0.05227934099999999,-0.046432712,0.036361494,-0.004502137,-0.020982366000000002,0.006547705,-0.043939117
237,Detection of human metapneumovirus by direct antigen test and shell vial cultures using immunofluorescent antibody staining,"Abstract Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) has emerged as an important etiologic agent of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, especially in young children. Although rapid and simple diagnostic methods for hMPV are needed in clinical laboratories, routine diagnostic tests are not readily available. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a commercial anti-hMPV monoclonal antibody for a direct antigen test and a shell vial culture of hMPV. In the pilot study, 15 nasopharyngeal aspirates from 15 children with acute respiratory tract infections positive for hMPV by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were tested. Both direct antigen test and shell vial culture detected hMPV in 14 of 15 (93.3%) nasopharyngeal aspirates at initial diagnosis. In the larger group prospective study, nasopharyngeal aspirates from 92 children with acute respiratory tract infections were tested for hMPV with RT-PCR, direct antigen test, and shell vial culture. Both direct antigen test and shell vial culture showed positivity for 4 out of 5 specimens positive by RT-PCR. These findings indicate that direct antigen test and shell vial culture would be reliable and timely methods for the diagnosis of hMPV infection in clinical laboratories.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.16871007600000001,-0.030740535,0.046122948,0.044374629000000006,0.0059333319999999995,-0.11950068800000001,0.045950085999999994,-0.097552283,0.134325739,-0.045170909,0.027619777999999998,-0.046293484,-0.059028935,0.016052549,-0.065847785,-0.055760584,0.018009207,0.217842068,-0.15402497699999998,-0.00013454799999999999,0.120030623,0.055369934,0.03714776,-0.144436404,-0.061332923,0.059984834,-0.18815435100000003,-0.164736616,0.016129403,-0.056506407
241,A new generic real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay for vesiviruses; vesiviruses were not detected in human samples,"Abstract Different viruses belonging to the genus Vesivirus infect a broad range of animals, and cause gastroenteritis, vesicular skin lesions, hemorrhagic disease, respiratory diseases and other conditions. A recent report on Vesivirus viremia, as detected by PCR, in samples from patients with hepatitis of unknown etiology in the USA suggested a zoonotic potential for vesiviruses. These results have not been confirmed by another laboratory. In order to do so, a generic PCR assay on the RNA polymerase region was developed, and validated with RNA from 69 different Vesivirus species. Except SMSV serotype-8, all species tested were detected, including the ones that were suggested to be involved in zoonotic transmission in the USA (SMSV serotype-5). The generic Vesivirus assay was used on RNA extracted from serum samples from patients with hepatitis, stool samples from patients with gastroenteritis, throat-swab specimens of patients with rash illnesses, throat-swab and nose-swabs of patients with acute respiratory diseases, and cell cultures with cytopathologic effect from enterovirus surveillance in which no pathogen was found. None were found positive. In this study a generic Vesivirus assay was developed and it was concluded that vesiviruses are an unlikely cause of common illnesses in humans in the Netherlands.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.09217045900000001,0.029865269,0.01519929,0.00816786,0.052815355999999994,-0.058052759,0.0077584509999999995,0.086351489,-0.141586128,0.039900681,0.00044424,-0.000665021,0.000211455,0.107160474,0.018862261,-0.054996917,0.01854492,0.030332555,0.07057764700000001,-0.014841605,0.084987271,-0.024973391,-0.045772277,-0.024040403,-0.012977363,-0.001667139,-0.002271929,0.028973747999999997,-0.022739949,-0.033932254
285,Rhinovirus chemotherapy,"Abstract Human rhinoviruses (HRV), members of the Picornaviridae family, are comprised of over 100 different virus serotypes. HRV represent the single most important etiological agents of the common cold [Arruda, E., Pitkaranta, A., Witek Jr., T.J., Doyle, C.A., Hayden, F.G., 1997. Frequency and natural history of rhinovirus infections in adults during autumn. J. Clin. Microbiol. 35, 2864–2868; Couch, R.B., 1990. Rhinoviruses. In: Fields, B.N., Knipe, D.M. (Eds.), Virology. Raven Press, New York, pp. 607–629; Turner, R.B., 2001. The treatment of rhinovirus infections: progress and potential. Antivir. Res. 49 (1), 1–14]. Although HRV-induced upper respiratory illness is often mild and self-limiting, the socioeconomic impact caused by missed school or work is enormous and the degree of inappropriate antibiotic use is significant. It has been estimated that upper respiratory disease accounts for at least 25 million absences from work and 23 million absences of school annually in the United States [Anzueto, A., Niederman, M.S., 2003. Diagnosis and treatment of rhinovirus respiratory infections. Chest 123 (5), 1664–1672; Rotbart, H.A., 2002. Treatment of picornavirus infections. Antivir. Res. 53, 83–98]. Increasing evidences also describe the link between HRV infection and more serious medical complications. HRV-induced colds are the important predisposing factors to acute otitis media, sinusitis, and are the major factors in the induction of exacerbations of asthma in adults and children. HRV infections are also associated with lower respiratory tract syndromes in individuals with cystic fibrosis, bronchitis, and other underlying respiratory disorders [Anzueto, A., Niederman, M.S., 2003. Diagnosis and treatment of rhinovirus respiratory infections. Chest 123 (5), 1664–1672; Gern, J.E., Busse, W.W., 1999. Association of rhinovirus infections with asthma. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 12 (1), 9–18; Pitkaranta, A., Arruda, E., Malmberg, H., Hayden, F.G., 1997. Detection of rhinovirus in sinus brushings of patients with acute community-acquired sinusitis by reverse transcription-PCR. J. Clin. Microbiol. 35, 1791–1793; Pitkaranta, A., Virolainen, A., Jero, J., Arruda, E., Hayden, F.G., 1998.

Pediatrics 102, 291–295; Rotbart, H.A., 2002. Treatment of picornavirus infections. Antivir. Res. 53, 83–98]. To date, no effective antiviral therapies have been approved for either the prevention or treatment of diseases caused by HRV infection. Thus, there still exists a significant unmet medical need to find agents that can shorten the duration of HRV-induced illness, lessen the severity of symptoms, minimize secondary bacterial infections and exacerbations of underlying disease and reduce virus transmission. Although effective over-the-counter products have been described that alleviate symptoms associated with the common cold [Anzueto, A., Niederman, M.S., 2003.

300,"Prevention and treatment of respiratory viral infections: Presentations on antivirals, traditional therapies and host-directed interventions at the 5th ISIRV Antiviral Group conference","Abstract The International Society for Influenza and other Respiratory Virus Diseases held its 5th Antiviral Group (isirv-AVG) Conference in Shanghai, China, in conjunction with the Shanghai Public Health Center and Fudan University from 14-16 June 2017. The three-day programme encompassed presentations on some of the clinical features, management, immune responses and virology of respiratory infections, including influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H7N9) viruses, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, adenovirus Type 80, enterovirus D68, metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Updates were presented on several therapeutics currently in clinical trials, including influenza polymerase inhibitors pimodivir/JNJ6362387, S033188, favipiravir, monoclonal antibodies MHAA45449A and VIS410, and host directed strategies for influenza including nitazoxanide, and polymerase ALS-008112 and fusion inhibitors AK0529, GS-5806 for RSV. Updates were also given on the use of the currently licensed neuraminidase inhibitors. Given the location in China, there were also presentations on the use of Traditional Chinese Medicines. Following on from the previous conference, there were ongoing discussions on appropriate endpoints for severe influenza in clinical trials from regulators and clinicians, an issue which remains unresolved. The aim of this conference summary is to provide information for not only conference participants, but a detailed referenced review of the current status of clinical trials, and pre-clinical development of therapeutics and vaccines for influenza and other respiratory diseases for a broader audience.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.14268360900000002,0.023256081,-0.116272876,0.16769298800000002,-0.05626696900000001,0.250545452,-0.03752587,0.00017449799999999998,0.09273674400000001,-0.031016289,0.01136583,-0.022686306,0.034867831,-0.07414048200000001,-0.0028283440000000004,-0.035904368,-0.033063432000000004,0.08689515199999999,0.013597689,0.017841005,0.01735684,-0.047340728,-0.020272461000000002,0.002194339,0.042765471,-0.065114007,0.036634688,0.012658953999999998,0.053118208,0.021731432000000002
309,Harmonising the virological surveillance of influenza in Europe: results of an 18-country survey,"Abstract The European influenza surveillance scheme (EISS) is based on a surveillance model that combines clinical and virological data in the general population. Eighteen countries in Europe report weekly influenza activity to EISS (http://www.eiss.org). A questionnaire on the virological data collection was sent electronically to the EISS members. Questions on the specimen collection, representativity, laboratory diagnosis of influenza, reporting of variants, testing for other respiratory infections, serological testing, near-patient tests and preparedness for a pandemic were included. The results of the survey showed that for the typing of influenza, the methods polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) methods are used most frequently. For the subtyping of influenza, HAI and PCR are used most often. An east-west divide was seen for the use of PCR in typing and subtyping (more PCR use in the west). Differences in the virological surveillance systems in Europe can make direct comparisons difficult because detection rates may differ by test. For the reporting of other respiratory infections besides influenza, many networks (68%) collect information on RSV. This is important because RSV causes similar clinical symptoms as influenza and can have a similar impact in terms of burden of disease. With the collection of RSV data, EISS is moving to a broader spectrum of viral respiratory diseases. The findings of this survey will be used to better harmonise laboratory methods in EISS in order to obtain more reliable and comparable information on influenza activity in Europe.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.13091227800000002,-0.061543547000000004,0.02164197,0.142330638,-0.032324049,0.180232951,-0.066168632,-0.018747232,0.023233844,-0.057691663,0.014822053,-0.02304575,0.001049144,-0.058811063,-0.020826915,-0.010679206,0.001020001,0.007205396,-0.02203413,-0.082051877,0.020729934,-0.081425125,0.026835138999999997,-0.092882929,0.041371433,-0.058461602,0.058472665,0.025591833999999997,0.002696857,0.035876495
348,Respiratory-syncytial-virus- and rhinovirus-related bronchiolitis in children aged <2 years in an English district general hospital,"Summary Background Bronchiolitis is the most common reason for hospitalization in young children. In addition to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), other viruses have been increasingly implicated. Guidance on testing has also changed. Aims To compare clinicopathological outcomes in young children admitted with bronchiolitis due to RSV in comparison with rhinovirus (RV), and identify associated risk/epidemiological factors. Methods Children aged less than two years admitted to hospital with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis with positive results for either RSV or RV were included in this study. Polymerase-chain-reaction-negative cases using an extended respiratory virus panel served as a control group. Retrospective data were collected on sex, risk factors, respiratory support, intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Outcomes such as length of stay (LOS) and need for transfer to the high-dependency unit/paediatric intensive care unit were included. Findings Two hundred and twenty-seven out of 437 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were positive for either RSV (N = 162) or RV (N = 65). The median age of cases was three months and 75% had at least one risk factor. Risk factors were higher in the RV group (P = 0.004). RV accounted for the majority of cases outside the RSV season (P < 0.01). RV-associated bronchiolitis had a longer LOS (more than seven days) (P < 0.05) and increased need for chest X-rays and/or antibiotics (P < 0.05). Use of intravenous fluids and respiratory support were higher in the RV group, but the difference was not significant. Conclusions RV is the second most common pathogen associated with bronchiolitis and is isolated all year round. This may be important in those with risk factors resulting in prolonged LOS. Further research is necessary to establish the exact role of RV in this common condition, particularly outside the traditional RSV season.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.182012048,-0.09990220699999999,-0.085646612,-0.026069641,0.0057288930000000005,-0.091878405,0.037898871,-0.050479547,0.065617686,-0.06056088,0.018590283,-0.053204645999999994,-0.133012151,-0.082881911,-0.028600847999999998,0.060857862,0.025138886000000003,0.039971572999999996,-0.028767336,0.0072164130000000005,-0.029434187,-0.07433882900000001,-0.026813496000000003,-0.017672247,0.038839183,-0.120293427,0.16297355800000002,0.036724147,-0.08843767599999999,0.055036442000000005
349,Molecular epidemiology and environmental contamination during an outbreak of parainfluenza virus 3 in a haematology ward,"Summary Background Although fomites or contaminated surfaces have been considered as transmission routes, the role of environmental contamination by human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hPIV-3) in healthcare settings is not established. Aim To describe an hPIV-3 nosocomial outbreak and the results of environmental sampling to elucidate the source of nosocomial transmission and the role of environmental contamination. Methods During an hPIV-3 outbreak between May and June 2016, environmental surfaces in contact with clustered patients were swabbed and respiratory specimens used from infected patients and epidemiologically unlinked controls. The epidemiologic relatedness of hPIV-3 strains was investigated by sequencing of the haemagglutinin–neuraminidase and fusion protein genes. Findings Of 19 hPIV-3-infected patients, eight were haematopoietic stem cell recipients and one was a healthcare worker. In addition, four had upper and 12 had lower respiratory tract infections. Of the 19 patients, six (32%) were community-onset infections (symptom onset within <7 days of hospitalization) and 13 (68%) were hospital-onset infections (≥7 days of hospitalization). Phylogenetic analysis identified two major clusters: five patients, and three patients plus one healthcare worker. Therefore, seven (37%) were classified as nosocomial transmissions. hPIV-3 was detected in 21 (43%) of 49 environmental swabs up to 12 days after negative respiratory polymerase chain reaction conversion. Conclusion At least one-third of a peak season nosocomial hPIV-3 outbreak originated from nosocomial transmission, with multiple importations of hPIV-3 from the community, providing experimental evidence for extensive environmental hPIV-3 contamination. Direct contact with the contaminated surfaces and fomites or indirect transmission from infected healthcare workers could be responsible for nosocomial transmission.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.08550573300000001,-0.020459842,-0.05901668400000001,-0.090571654,-0.013743357,0.0022745,-0.016959896999999998,0.056367294000000005,-0.031368738,0.008003944,-0.024825787000000002,0.025730093,-0.01726847,0.021198935,0.024794039,0.001636579,-0.004819842,0.01580183,-0.009496475,0.020668507,0.021743327000000003,-0.027945917999999997,-0.058663817,-0.024541361,-0.022877267000000003,0.024939515,-0.029113259,0.029043981,-0.03841858,-0.021320012000000003
350,Molecular characterization of a nosocomial outbreak of influenza B virus in an acute care hospital setting,"Summary Aim To describe a hospital outbreak of influenza B virus (InfB) infection during season 2015/2016 by combining clinical and epidemiological data with molecular methods. Methods Twenty patients diagnosed with InfB from a hospital outbreak over a four-week-period were included. Nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) positive for InfB by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction were sent for lineage typing and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Medical records were reviewed retrospectively for data regarding patient characteristics, localization, exposure and outcome, and assembled into a timeline. In order to find possible connections to the hospital outbreak, all patients with a positive NPS for influenza from the region over an extended time period were also reviewed. Findings All 20 cases of InfB were of subtype B/Yamagata, and 17 of 20 patients could be linked to each other by either shared room or shared ward. WGS was successful or partially successful for 15 of the 17 viral isolates, and corroborated the epidemiological link supporting a close relationship. In the main affected ward, 19 of 75 inpatients were infected with InfB during the outbreak period, resulting in an attack rate of 25%. One probable case of influenza-related death was identified. Conclusion InfB may spread within an acute care hospital, and advanced molecular methods may facilitate assessment of the source and extent of the outbreak. A multi-faceted approach, including rapid diagnosis, early recognition of outbreak situations, simple rules for patient management and the use of regular infection control measures, may prevent nosocomial transmission of influenza virus.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.140186786,0.002208469,-0.034715027999999995,-0.002451867,-0.036494112999999995,0.113796786,-0.098332763,0.08930727599999999,-0.061719058,-0.004383046,-0.003527116,0.011049801000000001,0.007190367,-0.026008984,0.001508847,0.003635019,-0.011150395,0.028782811000000002,-0.030881225,0.006424609,0.031457202999999996,0.005291943,-0.070638178,-0.07038947400000001,-0.057801415,0.0055133840000000005,0.011522168000000001,0.072394862,-0.076410516,0.024293182000000003

355,Detection of respiratory coinfections in pediatric patients using a small volume polymerase chain reaction array respiratory panel: More evidence for combined droplet and contact isolation,"Background In fall 2009, Children’s Hospital of Michigan (CHM) instituted combined isolation precautions (contact and droplet isolation) for pediatric inpatients with upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms to prevent health care-associated infection. Methods Pediatric patients with symptoms of URI had nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples obtained prospectively between January and April and September and December 2010 for small volume polymerase chain reaction (SVPCR) array respiratory panel (RP) multiplex nucleic acid testing. NP swabs or nasal washes were obtained for viral culture and rapid antigen testing (RAT). Results Of 499 evaluable SVPCR array RP samples, 344 (69%) tested positive for at least 1 of the 21 tested organisms. The most commonly identified pathogen was rhinovirus/enterovirus (181/344 [53%]) for which no RAT exists at CHM. Of 344 positive specimens, 57 (17%) had at least 2 identified pathogens; 8 (2%) of these had 3. In 11% of patients, molecular testing detected pathogens or pathogen combinations requiring both contact and droplet precautions. Conclusion SVPCR array RP testing detected respiratory pathogens in pediatric patients with URI at rates higher than that of RAT and viral culture. Because of the pathogens and pathogen combinations detected, the study findings suggest that combined contact and droplet isolation precautions may be warranted to prevent health care-associated infection in pediatric inpatients with URI. Further studies will be needed to confirm these results.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.162728585,-0.032261537,-0.024444526,-0.041147771,-0.01938649,-0.044199794,0.008160145,0.044898060999999996,-0.038952005,0.056287778,-0.014983875,-0.0025132329999999997,0.021968539,-0.022788232000000002,0.041638855,-0.024066101,0.004228518,-0.033141792,0.025154542000000002,-0.04986928400000001,0.008967072,-0.027888588,-0.014078077,-0.074416594,0.029200976,0.040820858,-0.038488796,0.012908065,-0.001032287,-0.042264385999999994
356,"Seasonal variation of respiratory pathogen colonization in asymptomatic health care professionals: A single-center, cross-sectional, 2-season observational study","Background The purpose of this study was to determine the seasonal variance of potentially pathogenic bacterial and viral organisms in nasopharyngeal specimens obtained from asymptomatic health care professionals (HCPs) during the 2014 winter and summer months. Methods Nasopharyngeal specimens from 100 HCPs were collected from Huntsville Hospital (Huntsville, AL) during the winter and from 100 HCPs during the summer. All subjects were tested for 22 viruses and 19 bacteria using Target Enriched Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction. Both seasonal cohorts were composed of students, nurses, physicians, and residents. Results Of the 100 HCPs tested during the winter, 34 subjects were colonized with at least 1 bacterium, and 11 tested positive for at least 1 virus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Moraxella catarrhalis, and coronavirus were the most frequently detected potentially infectious agents. Of the 100 HCPs tested during the summer, 37 tested positive for at least 1 bacterium, and 4 tested positive for a viral agent. The most prevalent bacteria were MRSA and Klebsiella pneumonia. Conclusion Nasopharyngeal carriage among asymptomatic HCPs was common, but the frequency and presence of potential pathogens varied with each season. Understanding the colonization and infection potential of upper respiratory organisms is important, particularly for viruses. Although asymptomatic HCPs certainly harbor a number of different potentially infectious agents, future studies are needed to determine whether colonized pathogens are transmitted or initiate infection in at-risk patient populations.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.07755998,-0.040436973,-0.010009187,-0.030658544,0.004683755,-0.002238888,0.033155387,0.019007956,-0.014791491,0.030473722,0.009341883,0.00363955,0.0012485439999999999,-0.034402392000000004,0.021120992,0.007902293000000001,-0.01481967,-0.018954204,0.018399914,-0.015088192,-0.031307152000000005,0.029089596000000002,0.003553413,-0.007063012,0.04963021,0.012452228000000001,-0.00167374,0.017713425,0.024578267,-0.03152693

363,Nosocomial outbreak of influenza A H3N2 in an inpatient oncology unit related to health care workers presenting to work while ill,"Objective To describe an outbreak of influenza A in an oncology unit, highlighting infection control methods implemented, and examining reasons health care workers (HCWs) present to work with influenza-like illness (ILI). Methods Confirmed cases were defined by the presence of ILI and a positive nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction swab for influenza A H3. Probable cases were defined as exposed HCWs with ILI who were unavailable for polymerase chain reaction testing. Infection prevention measures included closing the ward for new admissions, oseltamivir prophylaxis for all exposed groups, and dismissal from work of HCWs with ILI until resolution of symptoms. An anonymous survey of the cases in our HCWs was conducted to better elucidate reasons behind presenteeism. Results Over the course of 8 days (November 16, 2017, to November 22, 2017), influenza was diagnosed in 7 of 10 inpatients on the oncology ward, 16 HCWs (14 confirmed, 2 probable), and 2 visitors. The suspected index case was an HCW. Of the surveyed HCWs, 64% presented to work despite feeling ill (ie, presenteeism). The most common reason was “sense of duty as a health care worker.” Conclusions This nosocomial outbreak of influenza highlights the challenges of protecting inpatients from viral respiratory tract infections. HCWs and patient visitors with ILI should avoid work or visiting until resolution of peak respiratory symptoms and adhere to strict respiratory etiquette.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.12166935599999999,-0.034527302999999995,-0.059739596,0.033101707,-0.023649199,0.150879872,-0.085063635,0.052120542,0.010480914000000001,-0.071061302,0.018812177,0.015225588,-0.020752928,-0.058587439000000005,0.018362306000000002,0.03000694,-0.017388145,-0.023347804,-0.001290973,-0.033087467999999995,-0.011750024,-0.037418652000000004,-0.06862201,-0.065578017,0.004771039,0.016347485,-0.035392885,0.07651786099999999,0.011956555,-0.024563605
364,Acquisition of respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogens among health care workers during the 2015 Hajj season,"Background Data on the risk of transmission of infection to health care workers (HCWs) serving ill pilgrims during the Hajj is scarce. Methods Two cohorts of HCWs, the first serving Hajj pilgrims in Mecca and the second serving patients in Al-Ahsa, were investigated for respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms and pathogen carriage using multiplex polymerase chain reaction before and after the 2015 Hajj. Results A total of 211 HCWs were enrolled of whom 92 were exposed to pilgrims (Mecca cohort), whereas 119 were not exposed (Al-Ahsa cohort). Symptoms were observed only in HCWs from the Mecca cohort, with 29.3% experiencing respiratory symptoms during the Hajj period or in the subsequent days and 3.3% having gastrointestinal symptoms. Acquisition rates of at least 1 respiratory virus were 14.7% in the Mecca cohort and 3.4% in the Al-Ahsa cohort (P = .003). Acquisition rates of at least 1 respiratory bacterium were 11.8% and 18.6% in the Mecca and Al-Ahsa cohorts, respectively (P = .09).

368,Parent-collected respiratory specimens—A novel method for respiratory virus and vaccine efficacy research,"Summary Population-based respiratory research and vaccine efficacy studies have previously required clinic or home visits when a subject had an acute respiratory illness. This method may mean parents are unwilling to enrol their child or report an illness of interest. We conducted a community-based cohort study into respiratory illnesses in 234 pre-school aged children using parent-collected specimens. Between January 2003 and January 2004 there were 563 specimens collected from 730 identified illnesses and these were tested using a panel of respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays; 409 (73%) were positive for any virus. Specimens were not more likely to be positive when collected by a healthcare worker parent, when they included a throat swab, or when a very good collection technique was reported. A delay from illness onset to specimen collection of up to 5 days did not appear to impact on sensitivity of virus identification, but a delay of six or more days with minor delays in testing saw positivity fall. Combined with daily symptom diary completion and PCR testing, parent-collected specimens are an efficient and acceptable method for the conduct of future vaccine efficacy studies and other community-based respiratory virus research.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.158955962,-0.005931566,0.005487528,0.039226801,0.018238376,-0.02719914,-0.014372697,-0.019139982,0.020558333,0.017363195,0.026970262000000002,0.002188652,0.007959048,-0.033653487,0.057389116,-0.0040523420000000004,-0.01504679,-0.051203975,0.029963407999999997,-0.090639038,-0.01503975,-0.05220021,-0.019266448999999998,-0.068682961,0.059647219,0.04227876,-0.036684932,-0.0068944290000000005,0.014187421,-0.072986752
369,"Effectiveness of the 2010–2011 seasonal influenza vaccine in preventing confirmed influenza hospitalizations in adults: A case–case comparison, case-control study","Abstract Introduction We estimated influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) to prevent laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in patients 18 years old or older during the 2010–2011 influenza season. Methods We conducted a prospective case-control study in five hospitals, in Valencia, Spain. Study subjects were consecutive emergency hospitalizations for predefined conditions associated with an influenza-like illness episode <8 days before admission. Patients were considered immunized if vaccinated ≥14 days before influenza-like illness onset. Cases were those with a real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive for influenza and controls were RT-PCR positive for other respiratory viruses. Adjusted IVE was estimated as 100×(1−adjusted odds ratio). To account for indication bias we computed adjusted IVE for respiratory syncytial virus related hospitalizations. Results Of 826 eligible hospitalized patients, 102 (12%) were influenza positive and considered cases, and 116 (14%) were positive for other respiratory viruses and considered controls. Adjusted IVE was 54% (95% confidence interval, 11–76%). By subgroup, adjusted IVE was 53% (4–77%) for those with high-risk conditions, 59% (16–79%) for those ≥60 years of age, and, 54% (4–79%) for those ≥60 years of age with high-risk conditions. No influenza vaccine effect was observed against respiratory syncytial virus related hospitalization.

370,Effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccine against laboratory-confirmed influenza pneumonia among adults aged ≥65 years in Japan,"Abstract Background The effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) against laboratory-confirmed influenza pneumonia in older adults remains to be established. Methods Pneumonia patients aged ≥65 years who visited a study hospital in Chiba, Japan, were prospectively enrolled from February 2012 to January 2014. Sputum samples were collected from participants and tested for influenza virus by polymerase chain reaction assays. Influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against laboratory-confirmed influenza pneumonia was estimated by a test-negative design. Results Among a total of 814 pneumonia patients, 42 (5.2%) tested positive for influenza: 40 were positive for influenza A virus, and two were positive for influenza B virus. The IVE against laboratory-confirmed influenza pneumonia was 58.3% (95% confidence interval, 28.8–75.6%). The IVE against influenza pneumonia hospital admission, severe pneumonia, and death was 60.2% (95% CI, 22.8–79.4%), 65.5% (95% CI, 44.3–78.7%), and 71% (95% CI, −62.9% to 94.8%), respectively. In the subgroup analyses, the IVE against influenza pneumonia was higher for patients with immunosuppressive conditions (85.9%; 95% CI, 67.4–93.9%) than for those without (48.7%; 95% CI, 2.7–73%) but did not differ by patients’ statin use status.

371,Clinical characteristics and outcomes of respiratory syncytial virus infection in pregnant women,"Abstract Objective To describe the clinical presentation and laboratory diagnosis of pregnant women with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Methods Pregnant women in their second and third trimester were enrolled during the course of routine prenatal care visits when they were asymptomatic within the preceding two weeks (healthy controls) or when they reported symptoms of acute respiratory illness (ARI) of ≤7 days of duration (cases). Clinical outcomes were assessed at enrollment and two weeks after. Re-enrollment was allowed. Nasal-pharyngeal secretions were evaluated for respiratory pathogens by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sera were tested for RSV-specific antibody responses by Western Blot, microneutralization assay, and palivizumab competitive antibody assay. Results During the 2015–2016 respiratory virus season, 7 of 65 (11%) pregnant women with ARI at their initial enrollment and 8 of 77 (10%) pregnant women with ARI during the study period (initial or re-enrollment) had PCR-confirmed RSV infection. Four (50%) PCR-confirmed RSV ARI cases reported symptoms of a lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI), one was hospitalized. Combining PCR and serology data, the RSV attack rate at initial enrollment was 12% (8 of 65), and 13% (10 of 77) based on ARI episodes. Among healthy controls, 28 of 88 (32%) had a Western Blot profile suggestive of a recent RSV infection either in the prior and/or current season. Conclusion RSV had an attack rate of 10–13% among ambulatory pregnant women receiving routine prenatal care during the respiratory virus season. The serology results of healthy controls suggest a potentially higher attack rate. Future studies should be aware of the combined diagnostic strength of PCR and serology to identify RSV infection. As maternal RSV vaccine candidates are evaluated to protect young infants, additional priority should be placed on outcomes of pregnant women.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.18365309800000001,-0.049932382000000004,-0.023160307,0.018950059,-0.008715671999999999,-0.061898153,0.0053007969999999995,-0.065168144,0.10769963099999999,-0.0754904,0.043895647999999995,-0.07058458599999999,-0.106885986,-0.055585872,-0.037533686000000004,0.005401871999999999,-0.014152895,0.02113381,0.022206409,-0.071165966,-0.014585886999999999,-0.13156646800000002,-0.000206888,-0.07900953599999999,0.089974029,-0.08799385400000001,0.20796126199999998,0.07869353,-0.026416402000000002,0.035267026
374,Revisión sobre las infecciones no bacterianas del aparato respiratorio: neumonías víricas,"Resumen Aunque las bacterias son los principales patógenos involucrados en la neumonía adquirida en la comunidad, algunos virus son responsables directos o en coinfección de un importante número de neumonías adquiridas en la comunidad. La clínica de estas neumonías puede ser muy similar, en el caso de los virus afectan más frecuentemente a la población infantil y geriátrica, con frecuencia no elevan la cifra de leucocitos, la fiebre es inconstante y frecuentemente se acompañan de síntomas de vías respiratorias altas. Característicamente no elevan la procalcitonina. Durante años el diagnóstico ha recaído en cultivos celulares y en detección de antígenos; desde la incorporación en la clínica de la PCR, la identificación de estos patógenos ha aumentado, descubriéndose nuevos microorganismos como el bocavirus. En general, el virus influenza A y el virus respiratorio sincitial siguen siendo los principales virus implicados. Sin embargo, la irrupción en los últimos años de epidemias con alta letalidad de coronavirus y de zoonosis de virus influenza hace que sea necesario mostrarse alerta ante estos nuevos patógenos emergentes. Los inhibidores de la neuraminidasa para neumonías víricas han demostrado disminuir la transmisión en casos expuestos y mejorar la evolución clínica en pacientes en Cuidados Intensivos; su uso en infecciones banales no está recomendado. La ribavirina ha sido utilizada en niños con infecciones por virus respiratorio sincitial, así como en inmunodeprimidos. Fuera de estos fármacos, ningún otro antiviral ha probado su eficacia. Las medidas de prevención con vacunación para virus influenza y con anticuerpos monoclonales para virus respiratorio sincitial podrían disminuir la incidencia de neumonía. Abstract Although bacteria are the main pathogens involved in community-acquired pneumonia, a significant number of community-acquired pneumonia are caused by viruses, either directly or as part of a co-infection. The clinical picture of these different pneumonias can be very similar, but viral infection is more common in the pediatric and geriatric populations, leukocytes are not generally elevated, fever is variable, and upper respiratory tract symptoms often occur; procalcitonin levels are not generally affected. For years, the diagnosis of viral pneumonia was based on cell culture and antigen detection, but since the introduction of polymerase chain reaction techniques in the clinical setting, identification of these pathogens has increased and new microorganisms such as human bocavirus have been discovered. In general, influenza virus type A and syncytial respiratory virus are still the main pathogens involved in this entity. However, in recent years, outbreaks of deadly coronavirus and zoonotic influenza virus have demonstrated the need for constant alert in the face of new emerging pathogens. Neuraminidase inhibitors for viral pneumonia have been shown to reduce transmission in cases of exposure and to improve the clinical progress of patients in intensive care; their use in common infections is not recommended. Ribavirin has been used in children with syncytial respiratory virus, and in immunosuppressed subjects. Apart from these drugs, no antiviral has been shown to be effective. Prevention with anti-influenza virus vaccination and with monoclonal antibodies, in the case of syncytial respiratory virus, may reduce the incidence of pneumonia.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.082100335,-0.089982528,-0.037126265,-0.006181638000000001,-0.046616973,0.089870567,0.007220629,0.003080183,0.018984914,-0.006607459,-0.018973946000000002,0.014068643,0.031816963999999996,-0.15338544699999998,0.275991825,0.335060209,0.499114813,0.118306304,-0.049621612999999995,0.141787294,0.06993572099999999,0.10949051900000001,0.10535859,0.066932057,-0.08253956700000001,-0.092229996,0.063639887,0.003998155,-0.019836583999999997,0.023325593999999998
375,"The relation between serum vitamin D levels, viral infections and severity of attacks in children with recurrent wheezing","Abstract Introduction and Objectives Vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased susceptibility to infections and wheezing. We aimed to evaluate the relation between vitamin D levels, viral infections and severity of attacks in children with recurrent wheezing. Materials and methods A total of 52 patients who applied with wheezing, at the ages of 12–60 months with a history of three or more wheezing attacks in the last year and 54 healthy children were included. Sociodemographic data, risk factors for recurrent wheezing, and the severity of the wheezing attacks were recorded. 25(OH)D3, calcium, phosphor, alkaline phosphatase and parathormone levels of all children were measured. Nasopharyngeal samples of the patients for viruses were studied by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Results For the patient group, being breastfed for six months or less, history of cesarean section, cigarette exposure, humid home environment, and family history of allergic disease were significantly higher compared with the control group. Serum vitamin D levels in the patient group were significantly lower compared to the control group. There was no significant relationship between vitamin D levels and hospitalization, oxygen or steroid therapy. Virus was detected in 38 patients (73%). Rhinovirus (63.2%) was the most frequently detected virus. Coinfection was found in 14 (36.8%) patients. There was no statistically significant difference between detection of virus and vitamin D levels. Conclusions Cigarette exposure, being breastfed six months or less, humid home environment, history of cesarean section, family history of allergic disease and vitamin D deficiency might be risk factors for recurrent wheezing.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.10934541,-0.059916807,-0.054031267,-0.10007611300000001,-0.019325501999999998,-0.053850575,0.032980239,-0.010177931,-0.019154723999999998,-0.015176126000000002,0.00019977799999999998,-0.024328149,-0.057519049,0.008047855999999999,-0.013383923,0.02675163,0.0046441320000000005,-0.012633716000000001,0.002760041,-0.010210871,-0.021348026000000003,-0.044019033,-0.02910914,0.034398049,-0.052871315,-0.009760961,0.015926871999999998,-0.053175275,-0.021694185,0.021133206
380,Exacerbations de l’asthme et identification virale associée à celle du Chlamydiae pneumoniae et du Mycoplasma pneumoniae : épidémiologie comparative entre nourrissons et enfants âgés de plus de deux ans,"Résumé Objectifs. – L’utilisation des nouvelles techniques d’identification par les méthodes moléculaires apporte de nouvelles données épidémiologiques. Patients et méthodes. – Cent dix-huit aspirations nasales pratiquées chez des enfants hospitalisés pour une exacerbation aiguë d’asthme ont été colligées. Les techniques conventionnelles ont associé la culture virale et l’immunofluorescence et les techniques moléculaires une polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Résultats. – L’utilisation des techniques conventionnelles a mis en évidence un virus dans 34 % des prélèvements respiratoires (40 cas sur 118), tandis que l’étude par PCR permet une identification positive sur 68 % des prélèvements (80 cas sur 118) et l’association des deux méthodes amène la positivité à 77 % (91 cas sur 118). Les co-infections ont concerné 23 % des prélèvements positifs. L’identification virale par les outils traditionnels est significativement plus fréquente chez les jeunes asthmatiques, ainsi que lors de l’utilisation des outils de biologie moléculaire de façon non significative. L’épidémiologie comparative retrouve la prépondérance dans les deux groupes d’âge du rhinovirus (45 %), puis du virus respiratoire syncytial (28 %) et de l’entérovirus (8,5 %). Chez les enfants âgés de moins de deux ans, rhinovirus et virus respiratoire syncytial ont une prévalence proche (42 et 36 % respectivement) sensiblement différente de celle des enfants âgés de plus de deux ans (66 et 27 % respectivement). L’identification par PCR de Chlamydia pneumoniae et de Mycoplasma pneumoniae reste rare (six cas sur 118 prélèvements). Conclusion. – La prééminence du rhinovirus et du virus respiratoire syncytial est retrouvée lors des exacerbations d’asthme chez le nourrisson tandis que C. pneumoniae et M. pneumoniae ne semblent pas particulièrement impliqués. L’identification est plus forte chez les jeunes asthmatiques avec probablement une charge virale plus importante, car la positivité de la culture virale est plus fréquente chez les enfants âgés de moins de deux ans. Abstract Purpose.– Molecular processes can have a different impact on epidemiological data. Patients and methods. – The study covers 118 nasal aspirate samples taken on children hospitalized for acute asthma exacerbation for 2 years. Conventional techniques associated viral culture and immunofluorescence while molecular techniques used polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results. – Virus presence was revealed with conventional techniques in 34% of the respiratory samples (40/118), while PCR study of viruses and genomes of Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae allowed positive identification in 68% of the samples (80/118). The combination of both techniques allowed identification of an infectious agent in 77% of cases (91/118). More than one pathogenic agent was isolated in 23% of positive samples. Epidemiological study shows prevalence of rhinovirus (45%), then respiratory syncytial virus (28%) and enterovirus (8.5%). In children under 2 years of age, rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus have a close prevalence (respectively 42 and 36%), which is not the same result as in older children (respectively 66 and 27%). Moreover, PCR techniques allowed the identification of just a few Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (6/118). Conclusion. – In this study, molecular techniques of identification demonstrate a clear advantage in sensitivity compared to performances of viral cultures or immunofluorescence. The importance of rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus is remarkable while Chlamydia pneumoniae an Mycoplasma pneumoniae do not seem to be particularly involved.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.078779843,-0.062201495999999995,0.017562203000000002,-0.049420444,-0.011680436,-0.031445184,0.041840653,-0.013437205,-0.001681175,0.043886685999999994,-0.017335124,-0.010307645,0.036952944,-0.113821509,0.188244777,0.181154722,0.301766715,0.017146107,-0.038643549,-0.014411395,0.005371882,0.066933245,0.13372424800000002,0.007969163000000001,0.009465696,0.050304457999999996,-0.026377823999999998,-0.016167193,0.020456133999999997,0.018766374
383,Acute respiratory viral infections in pediatric cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy,"Abstract Objective To estimate the prevalence of infection by respiratory viruses in pediatric patients with cancer and acute respiratory infection (ARI) and/or fever. Methods Cross-sectional study, from January 2011 to December 2012. The secretions of nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed in children younger than 21 years with acute respiratory infections. Patients were treated at the Grupo em Defesa da Criança Com Câncer (Grendacc) and University Hospital (HU), Jundiaí, SP. The rapid test was used for detection of influenza virus (Kit Biotrin, Inc., Ireland), and real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (FTD, Respiratory pathogens, multiplex Fast Trade Kit, Malta) for detection of influenza virus (H1N1, B), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parechovirus, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, and human coronavirus. The prevalence of viral infection was estimated and association tests were used (χ2 or Fisher's exact test). Results 104 samples of nasopharyngeal aspirate and blood were analyzed. The median age was 12±5.2 years, 51% males, 68% whites, 32% had repeated ARIs, 32% prior antibiotic use, 19.8% cough, and 8% contact with ARIs. A total of 94.3% were in good general status. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (42.3%) was the most prevalent neoplasia. Respiratory viruses were detected in 50 samples: rhinoviruses (23.1%), respiratory syncytial virus AB (8.7%), and coronavirus (6.8%). Codetection occurred in 19% of cases with 2 viruses and in 3% of those with 3 viruses, and was more frequent between rhinovirus and coronavirus 43. Fever in neutropenic patients was observed in 13%, of which four (30.7) were positive for viruses. There were no deaths. Conclusions The prevalence of respiratory viruses was relevant in the infectious episode, with no increase in morbidity and mortality.

403,Reporting effectiveness of an extract of three traditional Cretan herbs on upper respiratory tract infection: Results from a double-blind randomized controlled trial,"Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Observations from the island of Crete, Greece suggest that infusions of traditional Cretan aromatic plants, well known for their ethnopharmacological use in Eastern Mediterranean region and Near East, could be effective in the prevention and treatment of upper respiratory tract infections, including viral-induced infections. The aim of this study was to report the effectiveness of an essential-oil extract of three Cretan aromatic plants in the treatment of cases with an upper respiratory tract infection. Materials and methods A double blind randomized controlled trial was implemented between October 2013 and February 2014. An essential-oil extract of Cretan aromatic plants in olive oil (total volume of 15ml of essential oil per litre of olive oil) was administered as 0.5ml soft gel capsules, twice a day, for 7 days. Placebo treatment was 0.5ml olive oil in soft gel capsules. Eligible patients were those presenting for clinical examination in the selected setting with signs and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection that had begun within the previous 24hours. Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was used for the detection of respiratory viruses. The primary outcome was the severity and duration of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, assessed using the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory System Survey (WURSS-21) questionnaire. A secondary outcome of interest was the change in C-reactive protein (CRP) status. Results One hundred and five patients completed the study: 51 in the placebo group, and 54 in the intervention (treated) group. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. No statistically significant differences were found in symptom duration or severity between the two groups, although small and clinically favorable effects were observed. When the analysis was restricted to subjects with a laboratory-documented viral infection, the percentage of patients with cessation of symptoms after 6 days of treatment was 91% in the intervention group and 70% in the control group (p=0.089). At baseline, one third of the patients in each group had elevated CRP levels. At follow-up, the respective proportions were 0% in the intervention group and 15% in the placebo group (p=0.121). The data were also in a favorable direction when 50% and 80% symptom reduction points were considered for specific virus types. Conclusions Compared with placebo the essential-oil extract of three Cretan aromatic plants provided no detectable statistically significant benefit or harm in the patients with upper respiratory illness, although descriptive differences were identified in favorable direction mainly in the virus-positive population.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.115092977,-0.036739585,-0.062969527,-0.075895145,-0.023563826,-0.019059982,0.001261232,0.034051392,-0.024409238,0.026738162000000003,-0.0055643490000000006,-0.001808129,-0.0014906670000000002,0.041269385,0.000245547,-0.012147459,0.013145043,0.008966264,0.030308387000000003,0.021465408999999998,0.00685162,-0.11488804400000001,-0.06618353099999999,-0.016524798,-0.014802473,-0.000102289,-0.026957524,-0.036633757,0.004951393,-0.022310622999999998
404,Clinical characteristics and outcome of ICU admitted MERS corona virus infected patients,"Abstract Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a novel respiratory illness firstly reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. It is caused by a new corona virus, called MERS corona virus (MERS-CoV). Most people who have MERS-CoV infection developed severe acute respiratory illness. Aim of the work This work is done to determine the clinical characteristics and the outcome of intensive care unit (ICU) admitted patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection. Patients and methods This study included 32 laboratory confirmed MERS corona virus infected patients who were admitted into ICU. It included 20 (62.50%) males and 12 (37.50%) females. The mean age was 43.99±13.03years. Diagnosis was done by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test for corona virus on throat swab, sputum, tracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. Clinical characteristics, co-morbidities and outcome were reported for all subjects. Results The main symptoms among the included patients were: fever (96.87%), cough (93.75%), dyspnea (90.62%), sore throat (75%), runny nose (75%), sputum (50%), headache (43.75%), myalgia (40.62%), chest pain (37.50%), hemoptysis (37.50%), nausea and vomiting (34.37%), abdominal pain (21.87%) and diarrhea (15.62%). The presence of abdominal symptoms is significantly (P <0.05) associated with bad prognosis. Out of the included 32 patients, 18 patients (56.25%) survived and 14 patients (43.75%) expired. There was a statistically significant difference in the duration of symptoms before hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and ICU and total hospital stay between the expired group and survivors (P <0.01). Current smoking and smoking severity were statistically significantly (P <0.01) higher in the expired group compared to survivors. Also, there was a statistically (P <0.05) significant positive correlation between mortality and smoking severity (r =0.640). Most of the expired patients presented with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates or unilateral infiltrates, but most of the survivors presented with normal radiology or increased bronchovascular markings, and this difference in the results was statistically highly significant (P <0.01). There were statistically highly significant (P <0.01) differences in the mean values of APACHE II score (21.11±3.70 vs 24.21±3.82), SOFA score (5.83±2.64 vs 8.85±2.17) and CPIS (7.55±1.14 vs 8.64±1.39) between the expired group and survivors respectively. Also, there was a statistically significant decrease in PH, PaO2, O2 saturation and HCO3 (P <0.05) among the expired group in comparison with the survivors, but no statistical difference regarding PaCO2 (P >0.05). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between mortality and old age (r =0.633), obesity (r =0.712), diabetes mellitus (r =0.685), renal failure (r =0.705), chronic heart diseases (0.591), COPD (r =0.523), malignancy (r =0.692), kidney transplantation (r =0.644) and liver cirrhosis (r =0.525) (P <0.05). There was a statistically (P <0.05) positive correlation between the number of associated co-morbidities and mortality (r =0.735). Conclusions Most MERS corona patients present with fever, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, runny nose and sputum. The presence of abdominal symptoms may indicate bad prognosis. Prolonged duration of symptoms before patients’ hospitalization, prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay, bilateral radiological pulmonary infiltrates, and hypoxemic respiratory failure were found to be strong predictors of mortality in such patients. Also, old age, current smoking, smoking severity, presence of associated co-morbidities like obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic heart diseases, COPD, malignancy, renal failure, renal transplantation and liver cirrhosis are associated with a poor outcome of ICU admitted MERS corona virus infected patients.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.181869015,0.075644636,-0.131028067,-0.128192509,-0.043399394,-0.036042821,-0.07744934,0.24522530899999997,0.017628453999999998,0.014066354,0.001646933,0.021145977000000003,-0.060884164000000005,0.05591656,-0.040746111,-2.68e-05,0.024958856,0.009872015999999999,0.024914587000000002,0.028514357999999997,0.011674836000000001,-0.08031271400000001,-0.029367752,0.018364886,-0.034590758,-0.026218195,-0.0067842430000000006,-0.031357694,-0.062006689000000004,0.012759019
405,Severe acute respiratory syndrome—a global concern—influenza virus isolated from suspected cases in Brazil from April to June 2003,"Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a condition associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Coronavirus has been associated with this severe emerging disease, with a pattern suggesting droplet or contact transmission. From April to June 2003, Institute Adolfo Lutz received 16 respiratory secretions from hospitalized patients with recent history of travel to an area with local transmission of SARS. Rapid antigen detection for influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1, 2 and 3, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus; electron microscopy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription PCR (RT–PCR) and serologic assay were performed. Virus isolation attempts were performed in Hep-2, Vero, MDCK, NCI-H292, MRC-5, LLC-MK2 and FRhK-4.

408,Clinical disease and viral load in children infected with respiratory syncytial virus or human metapneumovirus,"Abstract The relationship between respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) quantity in respiratory secretions and severity of illness in children remains unclear. We assessed the effect of hMPV and RSV viral load as determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on disease characteristics. Data were abstracted from medical records of 418 children with RSV and 81 children with hMPV; associations were evaluated in multivariate analyses, both continuously and comparing lower versus higher viral loads. Increasing viral load in hMPV-infected children was associated with increases in presence of fever, bronchodilator use, obtaining chest radiograph, and length of hospital stay. Increasing viral load in RSV-infected children was associated with decreases in inpatient admissions, use of antibiotics, and respiratory rate. Our study has described a significant relationship between viral load and markers of disease severity for both RSV and hMPV in a large population of children evaluated for respiratory disease.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.22514274899999998,-0.153232425,-0.110142255,0.079454448,0.014882111000000002,-0.189192855,0.11220626199999999,-0.19118651899999997,0.24315044100000002,-0.08568548,0.04044613,-0.136516409,-0.167604129,-0.052033265999999995,-0.135252743,-0.032566488,-0.08025264900000001,0.206464607,-0.153830898,0.048787247,0.053905437,0.037145605,-0.016249217,-0.097370342,-0.068616299,-0.058041824000000006,0.013818411000000001,-0.106519405,-0.042075399000000006,0.068348338
409,Performance of diagnostic tests to detect respiratory viruses in older adults,"Abstract The performance of 4 laboratory methods for diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections (RTI) in older adults was evaluated. Seventy-four nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens were obtained from 60 patients with RTI at a long-term care facility over 2 respiratory seasons. Sixteen specimens were positive for a respiratory virus by at least 1 method. Multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) by the Luminex xTAG® Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) detected 16 (100%) of the positive specimens, RVP of 24-h culture supernatant detected 8 (50%), direct fluorescent antibody testing detected 4 (25%), rapid culture detected 2 (12.5%), and rapid antigen testing detected none. For a comparison group, RVP was performed on NP swabs from 20 outpatient children with RTI. The mean fluorescence intensity by RVP was significantly lower for positive adult patients than pediatric patients (P = 0.0373). Our data suggest that older adult patients shed lower titers of viruses, necessitating a highly sensitive assay such as RT-PCR to reliably detect respiratory viral pathogens.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.23718198,-0.005132589,0.030281106000000002,0.040014257000000004,-0.007962312,-0.134102527,-0.012475803,0.026238166,-0.053414202,0.041308753999999996,-0.005189379,-0.006914375,0.015719799,0.10252345,-0.003413342,-0.055413607000000004,0.06715992,0.013727742,0.026759226,-0.012718803,0.034862175,-0.038774016,0.007198507,-0.028454982,-0.005640131,0.034718047,-0.026106436,-0.061810563,-0.025834802999999996,-0.038332169
414,Use of an improved quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay to determine differences in human rhinovirus viral loads in different populations,"Abstract Human rhinoviruses (HRV) frequently cause acute respiratory infections and chronic respiratory disease exacerbations. However, testing is not generally offered. We developed a modified HRV quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay to assess viral loads in the community and hospital patients. The assay had a lower limit of detection of 2 log10 viral copies/mL and displayed linearity over 5 log10 viral copies, with a lower limit of quantitation of 4 log10 viral copies/mL. Mean viral loads (95% confidence interval) for hospitalized children, university students, and institutionalized elderly, were 7.08 log10 viral copies/mL (6.7–7.5), 6.87 log10 viral copies/mL (6.5–7.2), and 7.09 log10 viral copies/mL (6.9–7.3), respectively (P = 0.67). Serial specimens of 14 university students showed a decrease of mean viral loads from 6.36 log10 viral copies/mL on day 1 to 2.32 log10 viral copies/mL 7 days past symptom onset (P < 0.001).

415,Viral detection using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction–based assay in outpatients with upper respiratory infection,"Abstract We evaluated a commercial multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in a cross-sectional study among 81 adult and pediatric outpatients—40 cases with upper respiratory infection symptoms and 41 asymptomatic controls—from February to April 2008. Two specimens (throat swab and nasal swab) from each participant were tested using the EraGen MultiCode-PLx Respiratory Virus Panel that detects 17 viral targets. Throat swabs were also tested for Group A Streptococcus (GAS) by PCR. Respiratory viruses were detected in 22/40 (55%) cases and in 3/41 (7%) controls (P < 0.001). GAS was detected in 10 (25%) cases; GAS and respiratory virus co-infection was found in 4 (10%). Agreement between nasal and throat swabs for viral detection was 69% in cases and 95% in controls. Of 22 cases with a detectable virus, 12 (54%) were picked up by only 1 (throat or nasal) specimen, and the detection rate was increased by combining results of nasal and throat swab testing.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.179590945,-0.023907854,-0.001943488,0.005303100000000001,0.009782942,-0.048495259000000006,-0.014622241999999999,0.02070338,-0.021904577999999997,-0.006190736999999999,0.027621015,-0.012644533000000001,-0.029350274,-0.001787945,0.031608335,-0.009399094,-0.00743215,-0.06908083,0.08898279099999999,-0.06532165,-0.049894713,0.019082438,-0.032887941000000004,-0.040682776000000004,0.027501627,0.086419913,0.024962555,0.02256027,-0.026125772000000002,-0.101163293
416,"A new factor influencing pathogen detection by molecular assay in children with both mild and severe hand, foot, and mouth disease","Abstract This study aimed to find novel information concerning pathogen detection and some probable coinfection factors in hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). In this study, 1104 clinically diagnosed HFMD patients were included. Enterovirus 71 (EV71), coxsackievirus A16 (CA16), and 14 different respiratory pathogens were examined from nasopharyngeal swabs using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). To evaluate the immune activation in HFMD patients, 8 cytokines and IgM antibodies to EV71 and CA16 from mild and severe patients were detected. Our results indicated that the severity of HFMD may affect the pathogen detection. The lower positive rates of enterovirus and respiratory viruses in severe HFMD cases by RT-PCR were probably related to stronger immune response. Therefore, immunological tests such as ELISA are essential supplements to PCR or RT-PCR in order to increase pathogen diagnosis in HFMD, especially in severe cases.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.12049444599999999,0.041448053,0.076885176,-0.027075156,-0.030761842999999997,-0.041986835,-0.005823,0.024080143999999998,-0.059033332,0.029508797000000003,0.002972784,2e-05,-0.0006262980000000001,0.076299621,-0.0035000709999999996,-0.021187912000000003,0.048050992,0.017423521,-0.047300847,-0.073595563,0.024812351,0.018303378999999998,-0.032708571,0.000590367,0.027517077999999997,0.031137275,0.035278475,-2.61e-05,0.029524009,-0.055088356
417,Molecular detection of gastrointestinal viral infections in hospitalized patients,"Abstract Gastrointestinal viral syndromes are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide. Etiological agents include a large number of viruses encompassing several orders, families, and genera. During the period April 2011 to April 2012, 689 stool samples from as many patients hospitalized at the Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo of Pavia exhibiting gastrointestinal syndromes were examined for the presence of rotavirus, norovirus, astrovirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, sapovirus, cosavirus, and aichi virus using polymerase chain reaction assays. Gastrointestinal viral agents were detected in 246 (36%) patients of the 689 analyzed.

421,Detection of respiratory pathogens in pediatric acute otitis media by PCR and comparison of findings in the middle ear and nasopharynx,"Abstract We conducted a series of polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) in order to detect bacteria (7 species) and viruses (17 species) in middle ear fluid (MEF) and nasopharynx (Nph) of children with acute otitis media (AOM; n=179). Bacterial and viral nucleic acids were detected in MEF of 78.8% and 14.5% patients, respectively. The prevalence was as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 70.4%; Haemophilus influenzae, 17.9%; Staphylococcus aureus, 16.8%; Streptococcus pyogenes, 12.3%; Moraxella catarrhalis, 9.5%; rhinovirus, 9.5%; and adenovirus, 3.4%. The overall rate of PCR-positive specimens for bacterial pathogens was 2.6 times higher, compared to culture results. The rate of PCR-positive results and the distribution of pathogens in the Nph were similar to those in the MEF. Nph PCR results had variable positive predictive values and high negative predictive values in predicting MEF findings.

431,VIRUS-INDUCED WHEEZING IN CHILDREN Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Rhinovirus,"The strong association between infantile wheezing and respiratory tract infections caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been well established. In studies of older children, rhinovirus becomes the major virus associated with asthma. These relationships are outlined in the box on page 36. In the past, this relationship was more difficult to appreciate, because rhinovirus does not always grow well in culture. In addition, the linkage between asthma and atopy during childhood has raised the question whether viral infections alone can precipitate exacerbations of asthma. Use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to measure viral nucleic acid material has provided the opportunity to study virus-induced wheezing among children in greater detail, and investigations of experimental rhinovirus infections in adults have demonstrated how this virus can augment both the early and late phase manifestations of airway hyperreactivity. This article reviews recent advances that have enhanced our understanding of virus-induced wheezing, along with new information indicating that interactions between viral infections and allergic inflammation may be critical to the pathogenesis of acute symptoms.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.118283998,-0.11042374699999999,-0.057453732,0.022701963,-0.03206799,-0.066865651,0.10219162400000001,-0.093722021,0.08862266699999999,0.068055088,-0.016265044,-0.100657883,0.001212212,-0.045261225,0.052561166,-0.0072286369999999996,0.014811019,-0.045380697000000005,0.013591573999999999,0.007566083,-0.03548302,-0.12932181,-0.043924326,0.058247982000000004,0.0061400330000000005,0.071548412,0.000899525,-0.007889128,0.069408851,0.113435544
443,"A prospective, community-based study on virologic assessment among elderly people with and without symptoms of acute respiratory infection","Abstract Background and objective Community-based elderly studies concerning microbiology of acute respiratory infections are scarce. Data on subclinical infections are even totally absent, although asymptomatic persons might act as a source of respiratory infections. Methods In a 1-year community-based study, we prospectively investigated the possible virologic cause of acute respiratory infections in 107 symptomatic case episodes and 91 symptom-free control periods. Participants, persons ⩾60 years, reported daily the presence of respiratory symptoms in a diary. Virologic assessment was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology. Results In 58% of the case episodes a pathogen was demonstrated, the most common being rhinoviruses (32%), coronaviruses (17%), and influenzaviruses (7%). The odds ratio for demonstrating a virus in cases with symptoms vs. controls without symptoms was 30.0 (95% confidence interval 10.2–87.6). In 4% of the symptom-free control periods a virus was detected. Conclusion This study supports the importance of rhinovirus infections in community-dwelling elderly persons, whereas asymptomatic elderly persons can also harbor pathogens as detected by PCR, and thus might be a source of infection for their environment.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.165247061,-0.051470257,-0.04689726,-0.020598365,0.020779454,-0.038825314,0.030316432999999997,-0.012789261000000001,0.026176599999999998,0.020080657,0.018471472,-0.027233182,0.011610748,-0.054178335999999994,0.045086216,0.01130913,-0.014281743000000001,-0.057969299,0.061331378,-0.039884661,-0.054816564000000005,-0.065555512,-0.037676118,0.0007319789999999999,0.069348439,0.038719892,-0.040715553,-0.018560877,0.05673692599999999,-0.051003585
454,Detection of Human Metapneumovirus in Hospitalized Children with Acute Respiratory Tract Infection Using Real-time RT-PCR in a Hospital in Northern Taiwan,"Background/purpose Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a newly discovered respiratory pathogen. This prospective hospital-based study investigated the clinical role and features of hMPV in Taiwan. Methods Respiratory specimens collected from hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection between September 1, 2003 and April 10, 2005 were screened for metapneumovirus using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results During the study period, 930 specimens were obtained from 926 hospitalized children. After exclusion of 200 cases due to lack of clinical evidence of airway infection or diseases with known etiology, 726 were included in the analysis. Among these, 33 children had a positive result for hMPV infection. The majority of these patients were admitted during spring and early summer. Twenty-one (63.6%) were younger than 2 years of age. hMPV accounted for 13.3% of respiratory infections occurring between the ages of 18 and 24 months and was as common a respiratory pathogen as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in that age group. The 11 patients (33.3%) with underlying diseases had a similar disease course to those without underlying diseases. A co-pathogen was found in 11 patients (33.3%). Infected children between 2 and 5 years of age had significantly higher titers of hMPV in their respiratory specimens (103.88 copies/mL) than children younger than 2 years (102.26 copies/mL) (p = 0.013) and children older than 5 years (102.25 copies/mL) (p = 0.005). hMPV positive cases were significantly older than those with RSV infection (p = 0.002) and had a shorter duration of hospitalization (p = 0.001), fewer days of oxygen use (p = 0.001) and higher levels of C-reactive protein (p = 0.004). Conclusion Metapneumovirus circulates in children in northern Taiwan during spring and early summer. hMPV was the most common respiratory pathogen in children aged between 18 and 24 months hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection. Real-time RT-PCR is a sensitive method for investigating the epidemiology and diseases associated with hMPV.

455,Viral infections associated with Kawasaki disease,"Background/Purpose Kawasaki disease (KD) is a disease of unknown cause. To investigate the infectious etiology of Kawasaki disease, we initiated a prospective case-control study to investigate possible links between common viral infections and Kawasaki disease. Methods We enrolled 226 children with KD and 226 age- and sex-matched healthy children from February 2004 to March 2010. Throat and nasopharyngeal swabs were taken for both viral isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for various viruses. Results The mean age of the 226 KD cases was 2.07 years, and the male to female ratio was 1.43 (133 boys to 93 girls). Their mean fever duration was 7.5 days with a mean peak temperature of 39.7°C. In addition to the typical symptoms of fever, neck lymphadenopathy, lip fissure and/or strawberry tongue, skin rash, nonpurulent bulbar conjunctivitis, palm/sole erythema, and induration followed by periungual desquamation, these KD cases also exhibited cough (69%), rhinorrhea (58%), and diarrhea (45%). Cases of KD had a significantly higher positive rate of viral isolation in comparison with the control group (7.5% vs. 2.2%, p = 0.02). Compared with the control group, cases of KD were more likely to have overall positive rates of viral PCR (50.4% vs. 16.4%, p < 0.001) and for various viruses including enterovirus (16.8% vs. 4.4%, p < 0.001), adenovirus (8.0% vs. 1.8%, p = 0.007), human rhinovirus (26.5% vs. 9.7%, p < 0.001), and coronavirus (7.1% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.003). Conclusion We found that some common respiratory viruses, such as adenoviruses, enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses, were associated with KD cases.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.134925965,-0.058180971,-0.053389923,-0.066479907,0.020648477,-0.041312159,0.017627864,0.005064199,-0.034315637,0.007468454,0.024295641,0.015696256999999998,-0.024085797000000003,-0.008931096999999999,0.009368281,0.0051466640000000004,-0.021853683,-0.021529272999999998,0.006964102,-0.040583263,-0.06845411700000001,0.025472771,-0.095137939,0.017035149,-0.057999405999999996,0.065851073,0.022227705,-0.020126414,-0.025428118,-0.060569725
458,Infections respiratoires aiguës à métapneumovirus humain chez l’enfant : études descriptive et comparative avec le virus respiratoire syncytial,"Résumé Objectif. – Un nouveau paramyxovirus, le métapneumovirus humain, a été récemment isolé. Nous rapportons les premiers cas pédiatriques français d’infection respiratoire à ce virus, détectés entre 2000 et 2002. Matériel et méthodes. – Les prélèvements ont été obtenus par aspirations nasales chez des enfants hospitalisés pour infections respiratoires dans les services de pédiatrie du centre hospitalier universitaire de Caen et de l’hôpital de Flers. La recherche du métapneumovirus humain a été effectuée par polymerase chain reaction sur les prélèvements négatifs pour les virus respiratoire syncytial, virus influenza A et B, virus para-influenza (1, 2 et 3), adénovirus, entérovirus, coronavirus et rhinovirus. La comparaison de la morbidité des infections à métapneumovirus et virus respiratoire syncytial a été effectuée après appariement des sexe, âge et mois d’infection. Résultats. – Vingt-six cas d’infection à métapneumovirus humain ont été identifiés. L’étude comparative avec une cohorte appariée de nourrissons infectés par le virus respiratoire syncytial n’a retrouvé aucune différence significative en ce qui concerne les motifs d’hospitalisation, les signes cliniques et la prise en charge thérapeutique. Conclusion. – Le métapneumovirus humain est responsable d’un tableau typique de bronchiolite aiguë du nourrisson. Abstract Background. – A new paramyxovirus, the human metapneumovirus was recently isolated. We report the first French cases collected between 2000 and 2002. Material and methods. – Samples were obtained from nasopharyngeal aspirates from children hospitalised for acute respiratory tract infection in hospitals of Caen and Flers in Basse-Normandie. Human metapneumovirus was studied by polymerase chain reaction on negative samples for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B virus, parainfluenza (1, 2 and 3) virus, adenovirus, coronavirus and rhinovirus. Comparison between metapneumovirus virus and respiratory syncytial virus infections was done after matching sex, age and infection month. Results. – Twenty-six human metapneumovirus infections were identified. A comparative study of a matched group of children infected by respiratory syncytial virus found no significative difference for hospitalisation motive, clinical criteria and treatment.

460,Intérêt de l’identification en routine des agents pathogènes respiratoires chez les enfants hospitalisés pour une exacerbation d’asthme,"Résumé Introduction Chez l’enfant les exacerbations d’asthme sont le plus souvent déclenchées par une infection respiratoire. L’objectif de cette étude était d’évaluer l’intérêt de l’identification des pathogènes respiratoires chez les enfants hospitalisés pour une exacerbation d’asthme. Patients et méthodes Il s’agit d’une étude rétrospective incluant tout enfant hospitalisé pour une exacerbation d’asthme dans notre unité entre janvier 2010 et décembre 2011 et analysant la prescription des examens microbiologiques, leurs indications, leur rendement, leur impact sur la prise en charge médicale et leur coût. Résultats Cent quatre-vingt-dix-sept enfants ont été inclus. Une recherche d’agent pathogène respiratoire avait été réalisée chez 157 enfants (79,7 %), surtout en cas d’infection oto-rhino-laryngologique (ORL), d’hypoxémie ou de pneumonie. Un virus avait été identifié chez 30 (23,8 %) des 126 enfants prélevés. Les analyses bactériologiques avaient eu un rendement faible puisque seulement 3,2 % des analyses par amplification génique (PCR) pour Mycoplasma pneumoniae avaient été positives (n =4/125). Aucune autre bactérie n’avait été identifiée. Aucun lien n’a pu être établi entre les résultats microbiologiques et la gravité de l’exacerbation. La prise en charge thérapeutique avait été peu modifiée par ces résultats. Le coût global avait été de plus de 40 400euros pour les 2ans d’étude. Conclusion D’après nos résultats la recherche de pathogènes respiratoires au cours des exacerbations d’asthme a un intérêt modéré en dehors de l’aspect épidémiologique. L’impact du rhinovirus, du coronavirus, du bocavirus et de l’entérovirus, non recherchés en routine hospitalière, reste cependant à préciser. Summary Background Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood. With its high economic burden, it is considered a disease of major public health importance by the World Health Organization. The link between respiratory tract infections and acute exacerbation has been recognized for a long time. The aim of this retrospective study in routine care was to evaluate our practices concerning microbiological prescriptions in children hospitalized for asthma exacerbation. Study design All children aged from 2 to 15years hospitalized for asthma exacerbation between January 2010 and December 2011 in our unit were included in the study. Microbiological prescriptions, their indications, their results, and their cost were studied. Results One hundred ninety-seven children were included in the study. A potential causative agent was sought in 79.7% of the children (n =157) by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The main indications were upper airway infections, hypoxemia, and pneumonia. Viruses were detected in 23.8% of them (30/126). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected by PCR in only 3.2% of these patients (4/125). No other bacterial agent was identified. There was no correlation between the severity of asthma exacerbation and the microbiological diagnosis of infection. The results did not influence the therapy given. These prescriptions represented a substantial cost for each child. Conclusion These analyses do not seem to have a real advantage for the patient except for epidemiology. It would be important to conduct a new study analyzing the role of rhinovirus, and of other viruses such as coronavirus, bocavirus, and enterovirus, not routinely investigated in our hospital, and to question the value of these costly microbiological tests.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.094411232,-0.0595871,-0.014587068,-0.081355148,-0.019974537,-0.040968525,0.056103148,-0.012800335,0.013456965,0.010928391,-0.024930964,0.005669901,0.01634713,-0.11583249,0.200019038,0.23620046,0.35278757899999996,0.025049174,-0.036052562999999996,0.015601031999999999,0.025254579,0.028605061,0.07746227900000001,0.049311844,-0.04886912,0.063004198,-0.031047203,-0.02192294,0.052326353,0.080095536
461,Étude prospective de l’écologie virale hivernale dans un service de réanimation pédiatrique,"Résumé Le but de cette étude prospective était d’évaluer l’épidémiologie des virus respiratoires chez les enfants hospitalisés dans une unité de réanimation et de soins continus pédiatriques pendant 3 mois d’hiver, en 2012–2013. Ont été inclus tous les enfants admis en réanimation pédiatrique du centre hospitalier universitaire (CHU) de Caen et ayant bénéficié d’une recherche d’infection par un virus respiratoire à partir d’un prélèvement nasal analysé par amplification génique (PCR) multiplex. Sur 105 enfants admis, 84 répondaient aux critères d’inclusion. Trente-sept enfants présentaient un ou plusieurs symptômes respiratoires à l’admission. Cinquante-quatre échantillons étaient positifs (64,3 %) avec 70 virus détectés. Le virus dont la prévalence était la plus élevée était le virus respiratoire syncytial (VRS) (n =28 ; 40,0 %), suivi par le rhinovirus (n =24 ; 34,3 %). Parmi les enfants sans symptômes respiratoires, 42,6 % étaient infectés par un ou plusieurs virus. Aucune différence de durée d’hospitalisation, de durée de ventilation mécanique n’a été mise en évidence en fonction du virus détecté. La principale limite de cette étude est l’analyse par PCR, beaucoup plus sensible que d’autres méthodes de détection, notamment chez des sujets asymptomatiques sur le plan respiratoire. Cette étude révèle cependant un taux élevé d’infections respiratoires causées par des virus chez les enfants qui ne présentent pas de symptômes respiratoires à leur admission en unité de réanimation et soins continus. Elle suggère un intérêt du dépistage de ces infections virales à l’admission des enfants et un bénéfice à l’extension des mesures d’isolement pour tous les enfants en réanimation pédiatrique. Summary Introduction Viral respiratory infections are common in children, most of which are due to a virus. They can lead to serious infections, and these children may require treatment in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). This prospective study evaluated the epidemiology of respiratory viruses and associated illnesses among children hospitalized in a PICU during the three winter months of 2012–2013. Methods All the children admitted to the PICU, University Hospital of Caen, France, were included. Nasal swabs were collected and specimens were tested using a single real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction). Results Of the 105 patients admitted to the PICU during the study period, 84 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The “respiratory group” included 37 patients with respiratory symptoms at admission while the “nonrespiratory group” included 47 patients with no respiratory symptoms. The 84 nasal swabs collected included 54 that were considered positive (64.3%) and 70 viruses were detected. The most commonly detected virus was RSV (n =28; 40.0% positive samples), followed by HRV (n =24; 34.3%). Viruses were more frequently detected in the respiratory (86.5%) than in the nonrespiratory (42.6%) group (P <0.001). Statistical analysis by subgroups revealed that RSV infections were significantly more frequent in the respiratory group (54.1%) than in the nonrespiratory group (6.4%) (P <0.001). There was no difference for HRV (32.4% and 27.7%) or for the other viruses. No difference in duration of hospitalization or duration of mechanical ventilation was demonstrated depending on the virus detected. Discussion The use of the very sensitive multiplex PCR technique increased virus detection rates in both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. Conclusion We have confirmed the frequency of RSV infections in a PICU and found that many patients without respiratory symptoms have respiratory infections caused by viruses. The impact of these infections on patient outcome should now be analyzed in order to demonstrate the role played by respiratory viruses.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.18176707600000003,-0.093186456,-0.049435201,-0.008570821999999999,0.024664741,-0.074330908,0.043676945999999994,-0.020987635,0.039026577,0.015569285,0.0073782909999999995,-0.021002516000000002,0.000148381,-0.068845226,0.196957479,0.19151843300000002,0.332737628,0.026265528,0.012206191000000002,0.033199682,0.026511652,-0.020668894,0.024958116000000002,0.036440644,-0.034545712,0.013047333999999999,0.012226763,-0.039336504,-0.02309869,0.019214181
462,Association between multiple respiratory viral infections and pediatric intensive care unit admission among infants with bronchiolitis,"Abstract Background It is unclear whether multiple respiratory viral infections are associated with more severe bronchiolitis requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. We aimed to identify the association between multiple respiratory viral infections and PICU admission among infants with bronchiolitis. Methods We performed a 1:1 case-control study enrolling previously healthy full-term infants (≤12 months) with bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU as cases and those to the general pediatric ward as controls from 2015 to 2017. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for detection of the respiratory viruses. We summarized the characteristics of infants admitted to the PICU and the general pediatric unit. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to fit the association between multiple respiratory viral infections (≥2 strains) and PICU admission. Results A total of 135 infants admitted to the PICU were compared with 135 randomly selected control infants admitted to the general pediatric unit. The PICU patients were younger (median: 2.2 months, interquartile range: 1.3–4.2) than the general ward patients (median: 3.2 months, interquartile range: 1.6–6.4). Respiratory syncytial virus (74.1%), rhinovirus (28.9%), and coronavirus (5.9%) were the most common viruses for bronchiolitis requiring PICU admission. Patients with bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU tended to have multiple viral infections compared with patients on the general ward (23.0% vs. 10.4%, P <0.001). In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, bronchiolitis with multiple viral infections was associated with higher odds of PICU admission (adjusted odds ratio: 2.56, 95% confidence interval: 1.17–5.57, P =0.02). Conclusion Infants with multiviral bronchiolitis have higher odds of PICU admission compared with those with a single or nondetectable viral infection.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.12364666199999999,-0.066456684,-0.06764704,-0.050706193,-0.018000935,-0.064272977,0.016810016,0.005959105,-0.006889868,0.012288022,-0.0016667239999999999,-0.006770675,-0.027231796000000003,-0.029216707999999997,0.012575643000000001,0.056610843,0.029529082999999998,-0.017395936,0.029823457,0.011173493999999999,-0.036897687,-0.046801416,-0.05653598,0.025568572,0.022382878999999998,-0.045753108,0.032851946,-0.048214995999999996,-0.025235365,-0.010777848000000001
463,A one-year prospective study of infectious etiology in patients hospitalized with acute exacerbations of COPD and concomitant pneumonia,"Summary Aim This study assessed the infectious etiology of patients hospitalized for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) with concomitant pneumonia. Methods Patients admitted to medical wards in an acute hospital were recruited prospectively from May 1, 2004 to April 30, 2005. Sputum culture, blood culture, paired serology, and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) viral culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies were performed. Spirometry was assessed in stable phase at 2–3 months post-hospital discharge. Results Seventy eight subjects were admitted for AECOPD with concomitant pneumonia. The mean (SD) age was 77.1 (7.5) years, with FEV1 of 41.5 (20.8)% predicted normal. Overall, an infectious etiology could be established in 48.7% of the subjects. Among the 71 subjects with sputum collected, 40.8% had positive bacterial culture. The commonest bacteria identified were Streptococcus pneumoniae (8[11.3%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7[9.9%]) and Haemophilus influenzae (7[9.9%]). Among the 66 subjects with NPA collected, 9.0 and 12.2% had positive viral culture and PCR results, respectively. The commonest viruses identified by NPA PCR were influenza A (4[6.1%] subjects) and rhinovirus (2[3.0%]). Paired serology was positive in 4.4%. Patients on high dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (>1000mcg beclomethasone-equivalent/day) had a higher rate of positive sputum bacterial culture than those on low-medium dose of ICS (50.0% vs 18.2%, p =0.02). Conclusion An infectious etiology could be established in about half of patients hospitalized with AECOPD and concomitant pneumonia. The majority of identifiable causes were bacterial. Patients on high dose ICS might have impaired airway defense as reflected by the higher rate of positive sputum culture.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.172109099,-0.053295920999999996,-0.050154992,-0.106344889,-0.054626842,-0.04391031,-0.048964516,0.067304374,-0.165906117,0.071395914,-0.023652627000000002,-0.009688566,-0.011162743999999999,0.031684288,-0.04142872,-0.021364684,0.030703564,0.00821829,-0.01261322,-0.037029746,-0.008513126,0.018701882,0.08588224400000001,0.013971986,-0.011099142,0.043112215,0.014999341000000001,0.008136716,0.011831265,0.069176295
465,The association between seasonal asthma exacerbations and viral respiratory infections in a pediatric population receiving inhaled corticosteroid therapy with or without long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist: A randomized study,"Abstract Background A seasonal peak in asthma exacerbations in the fall has previously been reported. The association between fall exacerbations and viral respiratory tract infections (RTI) remains uncertain. Objective To investigate the number of fall exacerbations and the incidence of RTIs in a pediatric asthmatic population using an at-home mucus collection methodology. Methods This was a 16-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group exploratory study. Children, 4–11 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of asthma requiring use of an inhaled corticosteroid, a morning peak expiratory flow ≥70% predicted and a history of ≥1 asthma exacerbation during the previous respiratory viral season were eligible for enrollment. Subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/SAL) 100/50 mcg or FP 100 mcg prior to starting school. Subjects collected mucus samples using an at-home kit when they experienced respiratory symptoms. Mucus samples obtained during symptomatic periods were analyzed for common respiratory viruses by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The number of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids was recorded. Results In total, 339 (FP/SAL, n = 171; FP, n = 168) subjects were randomized and included in the intent-to-treat population; 292 (86%) completed the study. Of the 537 mucus samples collected, 64% tested positive for viruses, but only 6% of positive samples were associated with an asthma exacerbation. Exacerbations were infrequent, with only 41 subjects reporting 49 exacerbations in total. Adverse events were reported in 66% of subjects. Conclusions In a susceptible population, the fall asthma exacerbation rates in children were low despite frequent detection of viral RTIs.

466,The clinical impact of pneumocystis and viral PCR testing on bronchoalveolar lavage in immunosuppressed patients,"Abstract Introduction Pulmonary infiltrates in immunosuppressed patients are common. Yields from bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has been reported to be between 31 and 65%. The clinical impact of pneumocystis and viral Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on BAL has not been extensively evaluated in a mixed immunosuppressed patient population. Methods We performed a retrospective chart review of immunosuppressed adults with pulmonary infiltrates who underwent BAL at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Only one BAL per patient was included. We compared the rate of positive PCR testing to conventional testing. We then investigated factors associated with positive PCR testing. Finally, we assessed for changes in antimicrobial therapy after bronchoscopy. Results Three hundred and fifty-nine patients underwent BAL with 249 patients having pneumocystis PCR testing and 142 having viral PCR testing. Pneumocystis identification occurred in 43 patients and viral species identification occurred in 56 patients. PCR testing increased pneumocystis identification compared to microscopy, 14% vs. 5%, p = 0.01, and viral identification compared to culture, 25% vs. 6%, p = 0.0001. Of the patients with positive pneumocystis PCR testing 49% had antibiotics stopped, 66% were started on anti-pneumocystis therapy, and only 6% did not receive treatment. There was no difference in the number of patients with antibiotics stopped based on viral PCR testing results. Discussion PCR testing increases BAL yield in immunosuppressed patients compared to conventional testing. Pneumocystis identified by PCR only may cause a self-limited infection and may not require antimicrobial therapy. PCR testing should be included in the evaluation of pulmonary infiltrates in immunosuppressed patients.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.117626,0.014112233,0.012668523000000001,-0.08501629599999999,-0.078882995,-0.034169871,-0.034153788,0.10475875300000001,-0.132349283,0.06397554700000001,-0.027738132999999998,0.014074315,0.027971158,0.067427649,-0.021720921,-0.023369467,0.045369225,0.055754753,-0.034831276,-0.062727623,0.056541262,-0.025635118,0.006519734,-0.076011219,-0.016614942,-0.013316243,0.03404423,-0.077796235,0.00023103900000000002,0.042781096
474,Altered regulatory cytokine profiles in cases of pediatric respiratory syncytial virus infection,"Abstract Objectives Regulatory cytokines are associated with viral infection. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relation between serum regulatory cytokines concentrations and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease. Methods We enrolled 325 children aged < 24 months who were diagnosed with acute respiratory tract infection. Twenty age-matched healthy children were enrolled as controls. Nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed to identify virus by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and blood samples were taken to quantify the regulatory cytokine concentrations, including interleukin (IL)-35, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 using the Bio-Plex immunoassay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results RSV disease was associated with a great regulatory cytokine response than healthy children, among 89 RSV-infected patients, serum IL-35 (P = .0001) and IL-10 (P = .006) was significantly elevated in comparison with healthy controls. Young children (0< age ≤6 months) with RSV infection had significantly lower IL-35 and IL-10 expression but needed more oxygen therapy and more severe disease comparing with older children (12< age <24 months). Comparing with mild group, the expression levels of IL-10 were significantly lower in children with moderate and severe disease (P = .012 and P = .005, respectively). And levels of IL-10 was inversely associated with total duration of RSV infection symptoms (r = − 0.311, P = .019). Conclusion Children with RSV infected had increased serum regulatory cytokine IL-10 and IL-35 concentrations. Elevated expression of IL-10 and IL-35 were contributed to protect hypoxia and reduce the severity of disease.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.136614761,-0.095575989,-0.056920043,-0.117238196,-0.048542126,-0.082691713,0.065230943,-0.12450865300000001,0.12613730199999998,-0.127795427,0.014533700000000002,-0.10012292,-0.129283838,0.04688742,-0.09933239199999999,0.037711603999999996,-0.040676107999999996,-0.032296038,-0.0077430269999999995,-0.068738938,-0.013080588,-0.08227975,0.08021228,-0.015500729,-0.05774330900000001,-0.105457001,0.173886887,0.063392895,0.014390864,0.041276258999999996
480,Assessment of Adenovirus Infection in Adult Lung Transplant Recipients Using Molecular Surveillance,"Background Little is known about adenovirus infections in adult lung transplant recipients. Because the virus can establish latency, re-activation may be relatively common after transplantation. Methods We assessed adenovirus infection in 80 adult lung transplant recipients. Adenovirus polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR assay; limit of detection ∼25 copies/ml plasma) was done on plasma samples collected at regular intervals until 1 year post-transplant. Results Adenovirus DNA was detected in 18 of 80 patients (22.5%) and in 19 of 595 (3.4%) plasma samples up to 12 months post-transplant. Median time to detection of viremia was 134 days post-transplant (range 1 to 370 days). Median viral load was 180 copies/ml plasma (range 50 to 360 copies/ml). Symptoms were evaluated at the time of adenovirus detection: 14 of 18 (78%) patients were asymptomatic; 4 of 18 (22%) patients had otherwise unexplained febrile/flu-like illness that resolved spontaneously. Adenovirus was not found to be a trigger for acute rejection. No detrimental effect on pulmonary function was seen immediately after adenovirus infection. Conclusions Adenovirus viremia is common in adult lung transplant recipients. In contrast to findings on adenoviral pneumonitis in lung transplant recipients, isolated episodes of low-level viremia are self-limited and do not trigger acute rejection or a decline in pulmonary function.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.10309724,-0.019502032,0.019446868,-0.081063811,-0.036247176,-0.04697898,0.021162531000000002,0.011179874,-0.054977264000000005,0.0012088,-0.023353508999999998,-0.01179874,-0.031412167000000005,0.038589622999999997,0.001977476,-0.019254701000000003,-0.020641789,-0.019329189,0.052737988,-0.030253286,0.030779882,0.002691517,-0.022690521,-0.0027332959999999996,-0.04862836,-0.0071117409999999995,-0.017886962,0.042242157,-0.059971097,-0.002368152

483,Chlamydia pneumoniae and Exacerbations of Asthma in Adults,"Background Chlamydia pneumoniae is a frequent causative agent of acute respiratory disease and has been recently reported as a possible case of asthma. Objective We assessed the prevalence of C. pneumoniae infections in adult patients with acute exacerbations of asthma. Methods One hundred sixty-eight adult patients with acute exacerbations of asthma and 108 control subjects matched for age, sex, and smoking status were studied. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained from all subjects and analyzed by isolation in cell culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for C. pneumoniae. Serum samples were also obtained and tested for C. pneumoniae-specific antibodies by the microimmunofluorescence test. Results C. pneumoniae was isolated from two (1.2%) asthma patients and none from controls and detected by PCR from nine (5.4%) cases and one (0.9%) control. Both culture positive specimens were also positive in PCR. Further, serologic evidence of acute C. pneumoniae infection was present in 15 (8.9%) of asthma patients and in three (2.8%) of controls (P = .048). The prevalence of C. pneumoniae-specific IgG and IgA was significantly higher in asthma cases than in controls (IgG >/= 1:16; 85.1% versus 67.6%, P = .001; IgA ≥ 1:16: 47.6% versus 16.7%, P < .001). Mean titer of IgG and IgA was also significantly greater in asthma cases than in controls (IgG: 38.8 versus 18.1, P = .0001; IgA: 17.2 versus 6.1, P = .0001).

484,Detection of respiratory viruses in adult patients with perennial allergic rhinitis,"Abstract Background The symptoms of allergic rhinitis may be worsened by a viral respiratory infection. However, there are few data on the presence of respiratory virus in patients with allergic rhinitis. Objective To evaluate whether patients with allergic rhinitis have an increased frequency of respiratory virus detection in a prospective case–control study. Methods Fifty-eight adult patients diagnosed with perennial allergic rhinitis were evaluated from September 2011 through June 2012. A control group of 61 adult patients without allergy was included. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to detect respiratory viruses in nasal lavage samples. Results Respiratory viruses were detected in 25 of 58 patients (43.1%) with perennial allergic rhinitis, but in only 15 of 61 control patients (24.6%). In virus-positive samples, multiple viruses were detected in 9 of 25 patients (36.0%) with perennial allergic rhinitis but in only 2 of 15 control patients (12.5%). Rhinovirus was the most common virus in patients without allergy and those with allergic rhinitis. There were significant differences in the detection rates of overall and multiple respiratory viruses and rhinovirus between the 2 groups (P < .05). However, in patients with allergic rhinitis, there was no statistically significant association between the detection of respiratory viruses and symptom scores. Conclusion This study shows that there is a high prevalence of respiratory viruses, especially rhinovirus, in patients with allergic rhinitis. Subsequent studies are needed to determine the clinical significance of highly prevalent respiratory viruses in patients with allergic rhinitis.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.157845753,-0.047906209000000005,-0.060684681,-0.041398351,-0.005795139,-0.055523478,-0.017574084,0.059491441,-0.09275034199999999,0.06256515,-0.031433043,0.004699932,0.013698001000000001,0.061939632,0.007363464,-0.025233197000000002,0.041515685,-0.036475522,0.038287381,0.033599138,0.047765565,-0.112545935,-0.026775788999999998,0.044861958,-0.010123207,-0.005535121,-0.027402702,-0.017687544,-0.038592132,-0.048972124000000006
485,Viral Respiratory Tract Infections in Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Recipients in the Era of Molecular Testing,"Abstract Viral respiratory tract infection (vRTI) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). This study aimed to assess the epidemiologic characteristics, risk factors, and outcomes of vRTI occurring in the period from conditioning to 100 days after allo-HSCT in the era of molecular testing. This study was a retrospective record review of patients who underwent allo-HSCT at Royal Melbourne Hospital between January 2010 and December 2015. Symptomatic patients were tested using respiratory multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to identify risk factors for vRTI and the risk of death or intensive care unit (ICU) admission, respectively. A total of 382 patients were reviewed, and 65 episodes of vRTI were identified in 56 patients (14.7%). Rhinovirus accounted for the majority of infections (69.2%). The majority of episodes presented initially with upper respiratory tract infection (58.5%), with 28.9% of them progressing to lower respiratory tract infection. Eleven episodes (16.9%) were associated with ICU admission. There were no deaths directly due to vRTI. Previous autologous HSCT was associated with an increased risk of vRTI (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 4.1). The risks of death (P = .47) or ICU admission (P = .65) were not significantly different by vRTI status. vRTI is common in the first 100 days after allo-HSCT and is associated with ICU admission.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.127125379,-0.03932263,-0.073941233,-0.09194551,-0.034281119,-0.040508021,-0.01422101,0.050690044000000004,-0.03516256,0.009548863000000001,-0.019926079,0.026566225,-0.012525204,0.022695607000000003,-0.01484174,0.034054562000000003,0.011381338000000001,-0.010690631,0.019834189,0.023408532000000003,0.000559453,-0.092299845,-0.05463128,0.011167426999999999,0.026152386,-0.047720824,-0.01798285,-0.061300713,-0.030911165,-0.022616496
503,Human metapneumovirus-associated respiratory tract infections in the Republic of Ireland during the influenza season of 2003–2004,"ABSTRACT Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a newly identified paramyxovirus that has been associated with respiratory tract illness in children aged < 5 years, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients. This study determined the frequency of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) associated with hMPV in the Republic of Ireland. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from 168 adult patients and respiratory specimens from 122 children aged < 5 years were collected between September 2003 and May 2004. The virus was detected by reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR using hMPV polymerase (L) and matrix (M)-specific primers in four (2.4%) of 171 BAL specimens obtained from 168 adults. No other respiratory virus was detected in these specimens, and no hMPV RNA was detected in respiratory specimens from children during the same time period. In all four adult cases, two of whom had underlying disease, hMPV was associated with mild, self-limiting upper RTIs. The most common clinical findings included fever (3/4 patients), cough (4/4) and rhinorrhoea (3/4). No patient died as a result of these RTI episodes. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the amplified regions of the Mand fusion (F) genes of hMPV. The Irish isolates belonged to cluster 1B, and did not show a separate Irish sub-lineage.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.241533684,-0.072209185,-0.072943596,0.040691531,0.081184365,-0.179105385,0.01080907,-0.081172182,0.122877215,-0.040350221,0.005679381,-0.02558803,-0.079937969,0.060527855,-0.100033324,-0.07363064799999999,-0.009914728000000001,0.21308383399999997,-0.140847894,0.051744411,0.1858829,0.051435191,-0.010516511000000001,-0.092373945,-0.084430306,0.050420901,-0.218201208,-0.114059121,0.019289589,-0.050198272
505,"Prevalence, codetection and seasonal distribution of upper airway viruses and bacteria in children with acute respiratory illnesses with cough as a symptom","Abstract Most studies exploring the role of upper airway viruses and bacteria in paediatric acute respiratory infections (ARI) focus on specific clinical diagnoses and/or do not account for virus–bacteria interactions. We aimed to describe the frequency and predictors of virus and bacteria codetection in children with ARI and cough, irrespective of clinical diagnosis. Bilateral nasal swabs, demographic, clinical and risk factor data were collected at enrollment in children aged <15 years presenting to an emergency department with an ARI and where cough was a symptom. Swabs were tested by polymerase chain reaction for 17 respiratory viruses and seven respiratory bacteria. Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between child characteristics and codetection of the organisms of interest. Between December 2011 and August 2014, swabs were collected from 817 (93.3%) of 876 enrolled children, median age 27.7 months (interquartile range 13.9–60.3 months). Overall, 740 (90.6%) of 817 specimens were positive for any organism. Both viruses and bacteria were detected in 423 specimens (51.8%). Factors associated with codetection were age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for age <12 months = 4.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.0, 7.9; age 12 to <24 months = 6.0, 95% CI 3.7, 9.8; age 24 to <60 months = 2.4, 95% CI 1.5, 3.9), male gender (aOR 1.46; 95% CI 1.1, 2.0), child care attendance (aOR 2.0; 95% CI 1.4, 2.8) and winter enrollment (aOR 2.0; 95% CI 1.3, 3.0). Haemophilus influenzae dominated the virus–bacteria pairs. Virus–H. influenzae interactions in ARI should be investigated further, especially as the contribution of nontypeable H. influenzae to acute and chronic respiratory diseases is being increasingly recognized.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.192713991,-0.11547954699999999,-0.078937908,-0.028533574,0.028474857000000003,-0.05908338900000001,0.027478301,-0.045032740999999994,-0.010991882,-0.06845163,0.021685258,0.043525238,-0.06474675099999999,-0.10234883199999999,-0.049348495,0.098782237,-0.087696365,-0.12713907300000002,0.06453626900000001,-0.030816603999999997,-0.21385169699999998,0.10884533,0.066577506,0.085733376,0.031421579,-0.007291264,-0.013631405,-0.204490013,-0.031933766,-0.085738886
508,E-mail-based symptomatic surveillance combined with self-collection of nasal swabs: a new tool for acute respiratory infection epidemiology,"Summary Objective We examined the feasibility of combining communication by e-mail and self-collection of nasal swabs for the prospective detection of acute respiratory infections in a non-medical setting. Methods The study was conducted among a convenience sample of employees (n =53) at a research institution (December 2009–April 2010). Real-time data on the occurrence of acute respiratory symptoms and a nasal self-swab were collected prospectively, with automated weekly e-mails as a reminder mechanism. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect respiratory viral pathogens in the swabs. Results Fifty-one out of 53 participants completed the study. The study design was well accepted. Thirty (∼57%) participants reported at least one episode of acute respiratory infection and returned the nasal swab during the study period (eight participants reported two episodes). The majority had no difficulties taking the self-swab and preferred this to swabbing by study personnel. Most participants obtained and returned the swabs within the recommended time. Viral respiratory pathogens were detected in 19 of 38 swabs (50%), with coronaviruses 229E/NL63 and OC43 and rhinoviruses A and B constituting 17 positive swabs (89%). Conclusions Combining e-mail-based symptomatic surveillance with nasal self-swabbing promises to be a powerful tool for the real-time identification of incident cases of acute respiratory infections and the associated pathogens in population-based studies.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.18513327899999998,-0.009489571,-0.007602434,0.02814259,0.031278771000000004,-0.046884037999999996,0.021974753,-0.010397848000000001,0.022834504,0.006312244,0.008757495,0.014788497,0.040284468999999996,-0.002839405,0.071516179,-0.007511709,-0.00612151,-0.097055725,0.08983613,-0.085337408,-0.046388782999999996,-0.064855708,-0.076467395,-0.06760536,0.083098851,0.046029306,-0.015634056,0.033230102000000004,0.05687071900000001,-0.117061451
512,Rapid optimization of antimicrobial chemotherapy given to pediatric patients with community-acquired pneumonia using PCR techniques with serology and standard culture,"Abstract Children (n =117; mean age 2.4 ± 2.9 years) were diagnosed as having community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) using clinical symptoms, chest X-rays, and hematological data. The causative pathogen was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (6 bacteria), multiple reverse transcription-PCR (MPCR; 11 viruses), bacterial culture, and serology. The initial chemotherapy was evaluated based on the pathogens identified using PCR. We found 27 viral cases (23.1%), 25 bacterial cases (21.4%), 45 mixed infections with virus and bacteria (38.5%), 10 Mycoplasma pneumoniae (8.5%), 7 mixed infections with M. pneumoniae and another pathogen (6.0%), 1 Chlamydophila pneumoniae (0.9%), and 2 unknown pathogens (1.7%). Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae accounted for 58 (49.5%) and 27 (23.0%) of the cases, respectively. The median values (50%) of the white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) using the box-and-whisker and plot method, respectively, were 11.7 × 103 mm−3 and 1.4mg/dl in viral infections, 15.6 × 103 mm−3 and 4.8mg/dl in mixed infections with virus and bacteria, 17.8 × 103 mm−3 and 6.3mg/dl in bacterial infections, 6.7 × 103 mm−3 and 1.4mg/dl in M. pneumoniae infections, and 21.5 × 103 mm−3 and 6.4mg/dl in mixed infections with M. pneumoniae and other bacterial infections. Sulbactam/ampicillin (n =61), carbapenems (n =12), and ceftriaxone (n =7) were selected for the patients suspected of having bacterial infections alone or mixed infections with bacterial and viruses in accordance with our criteria defined tentatively. For those with M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae infections, azithromycin or minocycline was initially used. Treatments averaged 3–5 days. The empirical chemotherapy was improper in 9.4% of cases in relation to the etiologic agents finally identified. We conclude that rapid and comprehensive identification using PCR can provide optimal antimicrobial chemotherapy for CAP patients.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.14412867099999999,-0.06615763200000001,-0.012602964,-0.061794525999999995,-0.05152069099999999,-0.063928888,0.02053046,0.043655413,-0.11821626800000001,0.111567091,-0.041533526,-0.049855619000000004,0.024054118,-0.035578237,-0.00278105,-0.055800217,0.014424293999999999,-0.005576098000000001,-0.012852238,-0.009126889000000001,-0.032952284,0.135164974,0.159023956,0.038241375,0.080451618,0.02823218,0.046049757999999996,0.035419953,0.130044907,0.000808351
513,Investigation of pneumonia-causing pathogenic organisms in children and the usefulness of tebipenem pivoxil for their treatment,"Abstract We investigated the usefulness of the novel oral carbapenem antibiotic tebipenem pivoxil (TBPM-PI) for treating bacterial pneumonia in children. Sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected simultaneously, and causative organisms were identified by conventional bacterial culture together with exhaustive bacterial and viral identification by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The subjects were eight patients diagnosed with mild or moderate pneumonia at Sotobo Children’s Clinic Outpatient Department between October 2006 and June 2007. TBPM-PI was administered at the recommended clinical dose of 4mg/kg b.i.d. to five patients and at a high dose of 6mg/kg b.i.d. to three patients. Sputum was collected from all patients, and 11 strains were detected from washed sputum culture. Causative organisms were mainly Streptococcus pneumoniae (3 strains) and Haemophilus influenzae (6 strains), and nasopharyngeal swabs showed the same organisms as coughed-up sputum. Real-time PCR for individual viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae identified four cases of only bacterial infection, one case of M. pneumoniae coinfection, two cases of viral coinfection, and one case of both viral and M. pneumoniae coinfection. The clinical results indicated efficacy in all patients, and causative organisms were 100% eliminated. In the four patients with only bacterial infection, the average fever of 38.9°C at the start of treatment normalized the following day, showing excellent efficacy. No clinically problematic adverse events occurred, and compliance was good. We consider that these cases provide valuable insights into the identity of pathogenic organisms of pneumonia in children and the possible role of TBPM-PI in outpatient treatment.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.17927304,-0.042716227,-0.049914981,-0.116687883,-0.049102614,-0.053747154000000005,-0.01625986,0.082369339,-0.14784282099999999,0.103663028,-0.038928659,-0.00404965,-0.008041774,-0.011591318,-0.027502022,-0.042332102,-0.012919348999999998,0.037542377,-0.028050341,0.001641586,-0.007178423000000001,0.169157592,0.11571625,0.014753521,0.028442323999999998,0.051448015,0.062314052,0.031657674,0.05767563,0.035276654
524,Virological surveillance of influenza-like illness in the community using PCR and serology,"Abstract Background: Surveillance of winter respiratory viral illness has been carried out for nearly 30 years using a clinical diagnosis by general practitioners as part of the Scottish Sentinel General Practice (SSGP) network. Contemparaneous laboratory diagnosis has not been available previously. Objectives: To assess the proportion of influenza-like illness (ILI) attributable to influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and picornavirus infection during the winter season. To compare the influenza PCR data with serology of paired blood samples. Study design: Combined nose and throat swabs, from patients with ILI attending 15 general practices across Scotland, were submitted to the laboratory in virus PCR sample solution (VPSS). The extracted nucleic acid was tested using a multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Serological analysis was performed on paired serum samples using complement fixation assays. The rate of influenza virus positivity was compared with reports of ILI obtained from the SSGP network. Results: Of 240 samples received at the laboratory, 132 (55%) were PCR positive for influenza A virus. There were nine (3.8%) picornavirus and three (1.2%) RSV PCR positives, two (0.8%) were dual influenza A/picornavirus infections. Ninety four (39.2%) were negative for all viruses tested. Results on paired sera from 89 patients showed a rising titre to influenza A in 48 of the 57 PCR positive samples (84.2%). One PCR negative patient displayed a significant rising titre to influenza A. Virological data paralleled the SSGP data but was available at least a week earlier. Conclusions: Influenza A infection was detected in the majority of patients with ILI; picornavirus infection was also shown to be an important cause of illness. PCR is a rapid and sensitive method for respiratory virus surveillance. Serology is slow, insensitive and difficult to interpret at low titres.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.248832446,-0.048768461,0.048351187000000004,0.209769488,0.011256631999999999,0.17387926199999998,-0.163287407,-0.001225191,-0.04516354400000001,-0.07790349099999999,0.052499449000000004,-0.04266575,0.005688606999999999,0.045445728,-0.006837116999999999,-0.043404266,0.057666422,-0.026139871000000002,0.006702921,-0.08905448099999999,0.027989552999999997,-0.064341562,0.028487042,-0.09574347400000001,0.033605143999999997,-0.044113550999999994,0.050670745999999996,0.035510493,-0.008053801,0.028197754
527,Detection and quantification of human metapneumovirus in pediatric specimens by real-time RT-PCR,"Abstract Background: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), a recently identified virus, causes respiratory illness in children. Objectives: A real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed and used to detect and quantify hMPV in respiratory specimens. Study design: The quantitative RT-PCR assay amplified an approximately 70 base pair fragment from the hMPV fusion protein gene. The assay was validated and used to test respiratory specimens obtained from children seen at a hospital in Seattle, Washington, from December 2002 through May 2003. Results: The assay detected 1000hMPV copies/mL of specimen, did not detect 19 other respiratory viruses, and was able to detect and accurately quantify isolates from the four known hMPV genetic lineages in a proficiency panel of 20 previously tested samples. hMPV was detected in 52 (7.2%) of 719 pediatric respiratory specimens. The mean log10copies/mL of hMPV in the 52 positive specimens was 7.67 (range=4.59–10.60). Children aged 7–12 months had a significantly higher hMPV prevalence (12.4%) than did children younger than 7 months (4.7%) (P <0.005). Children in this age group also had significantly higher levels of hMPV in their respiratory specimens (mean log8.43 copies/mL) than did the younger children (mean log6.93copies/mL) (P =0.0025). Conclusions: The rapid real-time RT-PCR assay described here is a sensitive test for clarifying the epidemiology of and diseases associated with hMPV.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.233135155,-0.030806407,0.072358765,0.10912938800000001,0.070335172,-0.21022588600000003,0.040548095,-0.159267829,0.179537361,-0.124175787,0.019317385,-0.059174979,-0.15398473099999999,0.061940359,-0.12454823300000001,-0.07547606400000001,-0.002738527,0.21038257800000001,-0.12252270900000001,0.021808986000000002,0.156323129,0.12130757,0.047167457,-0.10992733800000001,-0.15057710900000001,0.094776001,-0.183742562,-0.172905315,0.029712926,-0.05149120099999999
531,Presence of the newly discovered human polyomaviruses KI and WU in Australian patients with acute respiratory tract infection,"Abstract Background Currently, the role of the novel human polyomaviruses, KI (KIV) and WU (WUV) as agents of human disease remains uncertain. Objectives We sought to determine the prevalence of these viruses and their rate of co-detection with other viral respiratory pathogens, in an Australian population. Study design Polymerase chain reaction assays previously described were used to examine the presence of KIV and WUV in 2866 respiratory specimens collected from January to December 2003 from Australian patients with acute respiratory infections. Results KIV and WUV were present in our population with an annual prevalence of 2.6% and 4.5%, respectively. There was no apparent seasonal variation for KIV, but a predominance of infection was detected during late winter to early summer for WUV. The level of co-infection of KIV or WUV with other respiratory viruses was 74.7% and 79.7%, respectively. Both viruses were absent from urine and blood specimens collected from a variety of patient sources. Conclusions KIV and WUV circulate annually in the Australian population. Although there is a strong association with the respiratory tract, more comprehensive studies are required to prove these viruses are agents causing respiratory disease.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.090750411,-0.037084268,-0.027861785,-0.005494611,0.019236641000000002,-0.016600763,0.05081688,-0.00645249,0.018317236,0.03425099,-0.006845044000000001,0.023462307999999998,0.053100827,0.010466763,0.032067298,-0.015159188,-0.0073312640000000005,-0.020019646999999998,0.011161543000000001,-0.003605345,0.045144944000000006,-0.032798261,-0.030758512000000002,0.009586582,0.01428848,0.000278342,-0.055865875999999995,-0.010419981,0.001929208,-0.074162597
532,Multiple simultaneous viral infections in infants with acute respiratory tract infections in Spain,"Abstract Background The clinical significance of the presence of more than one type of virus in the respiratory specimens of children with respiratory infections is not clear. Objectives To describe the clinical characteristics of multiple viral infections versus single infection by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in hospitalized infants. Study design This is a prospective study conducted in all infants under 2 years of age admitted for acute respiratory infection (September 2000–June 2003) in a secondary teaching hospital. Virological diagnosis was made by two different multiplex reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays in nasopharyngeal aspirates. We describe the clinical characteristics of the patients with multiple viral infections and compare them to a group of 86 randomly selected patients infected only with RSV. Results 749 specimens taken were analyzed. Respiratory viruses were detected in 65.9% of the samples. 86 children had multiple viral infections (17.4% of all positive specimens). The most frequent clinical diagnosis in this group was recurrent wheezing in 44% and bronchiolitis in 52%. Fever was significantly more frequent (p <0.001), hospital stays were longer (p =0.05), and antibiotic treatment was used more (p =0.03) in infants with multiple viral infections than in the RSV-infected group. Conclusions Multiple viral infections are frequent in hospitalized children with respiratory tract disease (17.4%). Multiple viral infections are linked to higher fever, longer hospital stays and more frequent use of antibiotics than in the case of infants with single RSV infections.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.304405505,-0.118957412,-0.101307955,0.070826125,0.010894743,-0.17664490600000002,0.069355309,-0.08057091200000001,0.09639608699999999,0.040809452999999996,0.03901526,-0.11191738,-0.039723642999999996,0.003929976,0.023650962,-0.025234008,0.039435655,0.041674154,0.023382816,0.023748291,-0.021984342,-0.089015678,-0.09650811599999999,-0.003650343,0.069095747,-0.081842851,0.12704916800000002,0.0067464840000000005,-0.016487705,0.026607238999999998
534,Importance of viral and bacterial infections in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations,"Abstract Background Few studies have evaluated the contribution of both viruses and bacteria in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Objectives This study estimated the burden of both types of pathogens among adults seeking care for an AECOPD during two consecutive winter seasons. Study design Patients 50 years or older who consulted within 10 days of AECOPD onset were eligible. Clinical data were collected on a standardized questionnaire, and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA), paired sera, and non-induced sputum were collected. Polymerase chain reaction (PRC) assays were used to identify viral, atypical and bacterial pathogens in NPA specimen. Results Overall, 108 patients with AECOPD were included, 88% of patients were admitted and 2 patients (2%) received intensive care. A third of patients (31%) had evidence of a viral infection, 9% with influenza A, 7% RSV and 7% with PIV-3. One patient was positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 49% of patients with available sputum, most frequently Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae. Among virus-infected patients, 14 (58%) also had bacteria in their sputum, but co-infected patients did not present with different symptoms than patients with single infections. Conclusions These results suggest that influenza and RSV are frequent contributors of AECOPD, and that coinfection with bacteria does not appear to be more severe among virus-infected patients. Clinicians should be aware that AECOPD may be frequently triggered by viruses, and may consider antivirals and proper infection control measures in appropriate epidemiological setting.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.218737235,-0.071596732,-0.112077135,-0.06734412,-0.078570485,-0.031375133,-0.065671645,0.088557038,-0.182588983,0.080589025,-0.053784193,-0.026738742000000003,-0.012277912,0.069236852,-0.050416119,-0.034364222,0.02915886,0.025661508,0.013571123999999999,0.04682739599999999,0.039597913,-0.076115777,0.040517248,0.02013537,0.024173596000000002,-0.02120426,0.059702987,0.046320256,-0.013012433,0.091559026
535,Human bocavirus and rhino-enteroviruses in childhood otitis media with effusion,"Abstract Background Viral respiratory infections play an important role in the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion (OME) in children. The most common human rhinoviruses (HRVs) have been detected in middle ear effusions (MEE), but there is only limited data available about the closely related human enteroviruses (HEVs). The newly discovered human bocavirus (HBoV) has not, however, been identified in MEE of OME children. Objectives The aim of our study was to determine the presence of HBoV and HRV/HEV and the rate of coinfection in a set of MEE samples collected from OME children. Study design Seventy-five MEE samples from 54 children with no acute respiratory symptoms were studied with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of HRV/HEV and quantitative PCR for detection of HBoV. Results Twenty-six (35%) of 75 MEE samples were positive for viral nucleic acid, 22 (29%) for HEV, 10 (13%) for HRV and 2 (3%) for HBoV. There was no statistically significant difference between mucoid and serous effusions in the rate of virus detection. Forty-three percent of bilateral cases showed a contra-lateral difference in viral finding. Conclusions Our results suggest that these common respiratory viruses can be associated with OME in children.

537,Viral agents responsible for febrile respiratory illnesses among military recruits training in tropical Singapore,"Abstract Background Military personnel are highly susceptible to febrile respiratory illnesses (FRI), likely due to crowding, stress and other risk factors present in the military environment. Objective Our objective was to investigate the viral etiological agents responsible for FRI among military recruits training in a tropical climate in Singapore. Study design From March 2006 through April 2007, a total of 1354 oropharyngeal (throat) swabs were collected from military recruits who reported sick with an oral temperature of ≥38°C and a cough and/or sore throat. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to assay for the presence of influenza A and B viruses and adenoviruses (H-AdV), and conventional PCR used for the remaining respiratory viruses in all specimens. Results Influenza A virus was the dominant infection with a laboratory-confirmed incidence of 24% (326/1354) and a predominance of the H3N2 subtype. The temporal pattern for influenza A virus infections coincided with the nation-wide pattern in the civilian community. Detection rates of 12% (159/1354) and 2.7% (5/1354) were obtained for influenza B virus and other respiratory viruses, respectively. Conclusions The laboratory findings identified influenza A virus as the primary causative viral agent for FRI in the Singapore military, in strong contrast to findings from temperate countries and countries where recruits are often vaccinated for influenza. Our results suggest that influenza vaccination should be considered as a requirement to reduce the incidence of influenza infections.

538,Etiology of bronchiolitis in a hospitalized pediatric population: Prospective multicenter study,"Abstract Background In 2006, bronchiolitis due to adenovirus nosocomial infections resulted in the closure of a pediatric department in northern Portugal. Objectives To determine the etiology of bronchiolitis in northern Portugal. Study design It was a prospective multicenter study on the etiology of bronchiolitis during the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season (November–April). Children ≤24 months of age admitted for a first wheezing episode were included. Nasopharyngeal specimens were analyzed by an indirect immunofluorescent-antibody assay (IFA) for RSV, adenovirus (HAdV), parainfluenza (PIV) 1–3 and influenza (IV) A and B and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription-PCR for the same viruses and for human metapneumovirus (hMPV), bocavirus (HBoV), rhinovirus (HRV), coronaviruses (229/E; NL63; OC43; HKU1) and enterovirus. Results During this period, 253 children were included, 249 IFA analyses and 207 PCRs were performed. IFA detected RSV in 58.1%; PCR increased it to 66.7%. IFA detected HAdV in 3.2%, PCR 10.0%. PCR detected IV A in 5; IV B in 2; PIV 1 in 6, PIV 2 in 4 and PIV 3 in 11 cases. HBoV, as single agent in 2 cases, and HRV were positive in 8 samples and hMPV in 11. With this virus panel, 19.7% remained without etiology. Conclusions The most frequent agent was RSV, followed by HAdV. PCR can be cost-effective and more accurate than IFA, which is crucial for HAdV that may be associated with significant mortality (IFA alone did not detect 2/3 of the cases).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.195412948,-0.09161572800000001,-0.011385225,0.035903748,0.069402805,-0.110999869,0.043985124,-0.106358702,0.103882026,-0.070710062,0.021269352000000002,-0.030859685,-0.097634256,-0.021286426,-0.014113893,-0.021259528,-0.02134735,0.081526757,-0.024965084,-0.091518074,0.055925367000000004,0.120913355,0.021900189,0.0047053220000000005,-0.094439936,0.055835635,0.03452189,0.173096895,-0.07570726,0.09967551
539,Correlation of viral load of respiratory pathogens and co-infections with disease severity in children hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infection,"Abstract Background The clinical significance of viral load and co-infections in children with respiratory infections is not clear. Objective To evaluate the correlation of viral load as well as viral and bacterial co-infections with disease severity in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Study design This is a prospective study conducted in children admitted for LRTIs for two seasons. To determine viral and bacterial load of respiratory pathogens we performed multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction and semiquantitative bacterial cultures on nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA). Results During the study period 244 (60%) children were hospitalized for LRTI with acute virus-induced wheezing and 160 (40%) for radiologic confirmed pneumonia. In the first NPA, viruses were identified in 315 (78%) of the 404 samples and bacteria in 198 (63.3%) of 311 samples. The viral load significantly decreased between the first and second NPA sample in most single and viral co-infections, except rhinovirus and human bocavirus infections. Viral load was inversely related to CRP in RSV infections, whereas a positive correlation was observed in adenovirus infections. Duration of hospitalization was significantly longer in RSV single infections compared to rhinovirus single infections whereas in the latter, leucocytosis and use of systemic steroids was more common. In RSV viral co-infections the presence of fever, leucocytosis, and the use of antibiotics was significantly more frequent. Positive cultures of Haemophilus influenzae dominated in RSV and rhinovirus single infections and Moraxella catarrhalis in RSV viral co-infections. Conclusions Specific viral single and co-infections as well as viral load contribute to disease severity in children with LRTIs.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.237520492,-0.155732279,-0.092164411,0.058252055999999997,-0.013023445,-0.169535839,0.132480786,-0.108366285,0.099544884,0.06298567,0.020438208,-0.138147278,-0.032958662,-0.041557895,0.007177655,-0.050446152,-0.027248477000000004,-0.0007683010000000001,0.003863793,0.0029244640000000003,-0.06346500599999999,0.02608346,-0.045619575,0.049174108,0.010842174,-0.046988935,0.139304291,-0.000237445,0.023778106,0.106652278
540,Epidemiology of viral respiratory tract infections in a prospective cohort of infants and toddlers attending daycare,"Abstract Background The epidemiology of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in a daycare cohort has not been explored using molecular techniques. Objectives (1) Determine the overall incidence of RTIs in a daycare cohort using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). (2) Determine the relative incidence and impact of specific respiratory viruses, and characterize and compare clinical features associated with these pathogens. Study design In this prospective cohort study conducted from February 2006 to April 2008, nasal swabs were obtained from symptomatic children ages 0–30 months enrolled in fulltime daycare. RT-PCR was performed to detect respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (MPV), influenza (Flu) viruses A and B, parainfluenza (PIV), adenovirus (AdV), human coronaviruses (CoV) and rhinovirus (RhV). Symptom diaries were completed for each illness. Results We followed 119 children (mean age 10 months; range 2–24 months) for 115 child years. The mean annual incidence of RTI per child was 4.2 the first year and 1.2 the second year of the study. At least 1 virus was identified in 67% RTIs. Co-infections were common (27% RTIs), with RhV, CoV, and AdV the most common co-pathogens. PIV was identified in 12% of RTIs with a high incidence of PIV4. The viruses with the greatest impact on our population were RSV, RhV and AdV. Conclusions Using molecular techniques, viruses were identified in approximately twice as many RTIs as previously reported in a daycare cohort. Infections with newly identified viruses, such as HMPV and CoV subtypes were less frequent and severe than infections with RSV, AdV and RhV.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.216180873,-0.028470089,-0.06157765900000001,0.10246249800000001,0.074455525,-0.071030656,0.059840055,-0.058803567,0.122875334,-0.028682482999999998,0.013110605,-0.059151308,-0.048713705,-0.045580392000000004,-0.013748156000000001,-0.021427907000000003,0.0019661979999999997,0.012382765,-0.010568677,-0.028472622000000003,0.0195306,-0.010915524,0.022497084,0.02552282,0.022684013,-0.025692059,0.056613458,0.038307079,0.001697492,-0.014056312
541,Prevalence and clinical characteristics of human CoV-HKU1 in children with acute respiratory tract infections in China,"Abstract Background Human CoV-HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) has been isolated from a 71-year-old man with pneumonia; however, the impact and role of emerging HCoV-HKU1 have not been defined in children with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI). Objective To investigate the Prevalence and clinical characteristics of HCoV-HKU1 in children with ARTI in Lanzhou, China. Study design The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or PCR was employed to screen HCoV-HKU1 and other common respiratory viruses in 645 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) specimens collected from children with ARTI from November 2006 to October 2008. All PCR positive products were sequenced. And the demographic and clinical data were collected for all patients. Results Nineteen of 645 (2.95%) specimens tested positive for HCoV-HKU1, and all HCoV-HKU1 positive specimens were distributed in the winter and spring season. The HCoV-HKU1 co-infection rate with other respiratory viruses was 47.37% (9/19). There was no statistically significant difference in the detection rate between groups by age or gender, except between patients with and without underlying diseases. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that HCoV-HKU1 genotype B was circulating in the years 2007 and 2008 in children with ARTI in Lanzhou, China. Conclusions HCoV-HKU1 is an uncommon virus existing among Chinese children with ARTI. Children with underlying diseases are more vulnerable to viral infection.

542,"Human bocavirus in children: Mono-detection, high viral load and viraemia are associated with respiratory tract infection","Abstract Background and objectives Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) has recently been detected in children with respiratory tract infections (RTI). In order to study whether HBoV1 can cause RTI, we investigated its presence in children with upper RTI (URTI), lower RTI (LRTI) and a control group of children without RTI. Study design Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) and blood samples were collected from children admitted to hospital with RTI from 6 June 2007 to 28 February 2009 (n =1154), and from children admitted for elective surgery who had no RTI (n =162). Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the NPAs were examined for 17 infectious agents including HBoV1. Blood samples were tested with HBoV1-PCR only. Results HBoV1 was detected in NPAs from 10% of patients and 17% of controls. Adjusted for age, gender and the presence of other viruses, HBoV1 was not associated with RTI. In the HBoV1-positive NPAs, at least one other virus was detected in 75% and the virus appeared alone in 25%. Adjusted for age and gender, the detection of HBoV1 as the sole virus was associated with RTI, but not with LRTI. Viraemia was found only in children with RTI. The study showed that it was associated with RTI and LRTI. A high HBoV1-load was associated with LRTI, but not with RTI. No interactions between HBoV1 and other infectious agents were found. Conclusions Our data support the hypothesis that HBoV1 causes RTI in children, because detection of HBoV1 alone, viraemia and high viral load are associated with RTI and/or LRTI in this age group. However, HBoV1 is common in healthy children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.08487878800000001,-0.067319877,-0.01781523,-0.052273241,0.022977344,-0.06745486,0.060146835999999995,-0.045687860999999996,0.032000179,-0.015186955,0.015663242,-0.0013559639999999999,-0.029639052000000003,-0.032080416,0.006090993,0.016631117,-0.029836881000000003,-0.023985165,0.003157605,-0.032576497999999995,-0.031321463,0.079250368,0.0032918390000000004,0.028958368999999998,-0.056451482000000004,0.033371742,-0.047577111,-0.029960804,-1.74e-06,0.013208718000000001
543,Severe community-acquired pneumonia caused by adenovirus type 11 in immunocompetent adults in Beijing,"Abstract Background Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to human adenoviruses (HAdVs) in immunocompetent adults has raised concerns. Objective To describe the clinical, laboratorial, and radiological characteristics of adenovirus pneumonia and detect the type and diversity of human adenoviruses that caused acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in Beijing. Study design An etiological study of adult community-acquired pneumonia was carried out prospectively at Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital. A total of 18 cases with laboratory-confirmed adenovirus infections in 487 cases with CAP were observed clinically. The viral type and phylogenetic analysis were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results Patients with adenovirus pneumonia typically reported flu-like symptoms. Some of them developed shortness of breath or severe dyspnea on 6 days after disease onset. The patients with ARDS usually present dyspnea, higher level of serum muscle enzymes and bilateral, mutilobal consolidation and patchy/ground-glass opacities. HAdVs type was detected in 17 samples and all of them belonged to species B (HAdV-11, 7, 3 and 14). Among them, HAdV-11 was most frequently (10/17), followed by HAdV-7 (5/17). Phylogenetic analysis of the partial penton nucleotide confirmed a close relationship with stains circulating in the Beijing region. Conclusions Our identification of severe respiratory illness due to adenovirus, especially type 11 may highlight the need for rapid diagnosis and improved surveillance, which may assist with targeted development of antiviral agents or type-specific vaccines.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.153532315,-0.018284642,-0.056617802,-0.078129215,0.0230148,-0.00625254,-0.003615705,0.058335905,-0.10274273800000001,0.055100908,-0.045946303,0.034322658,-0.01131038,-0.028421051,-0.027310641,-0.066535585,-0.071579553,0.062552934,-0.04664237,0.014311365,0.065081894,0.213306968,0.037306029,0.057854602000000005,0.0029361609999999996,0.04957389,-0.010140037,0.22893543100000002,-0.058792008,-0.005388035
544,Epidemiologic report and serologic findings for household contacts of three cases of influenza A (H7N9) virus infection,"Abstract Background and objective We conducted epidemiologic investigations and serologic assays on household contacts that were extensively exposed to three influenza A (H7N9) virus infected case-patients before infection-control practices were implemented. Study design Data on the early clinical course of each patient and the exposure history for each patient's household contacts were obtained by interviewing household members and by reviewing medical records. Viral RNA in patient samples was tested using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. Antibodies against H7N9 virus in serum samples were tested using hemagglutination inhibition and pseudovirus based neutralization assays. Results All household contacts were extensively exposed to the case-patients without the use of measures to protect against infection. Viral RNA was detected in the specimens from case-patients for approximately 7–11 days after confirmation of infection. However, the results of the analyses of serum specimens taken from the household contacts 15–26 days post exposure revealed no evidence of transmission of H7N9 virus from the case-patients to the contacts. Conclusion Despite ample unprotected exposures to case-patients during the virus shedding period, household members in this report were not infected by the H7N9 virus.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.08402894699999999,0.016602671,-0.030353736,-0.039956113,-0.047901321,0.034616071,-0.064495462,0.10117380699999999,-0.045816913,-0.009285864,0.030337323,0.00058144,-0.012718501,0.062739752,0.008774573,0.018460591999999998,-0.001004367,0.008193394,0.007998833,0.004602903,0.012662786,-0.020549556,-0.067394383,-0.046320562,-0.045489722,0.013695282,0.017184913,-0.00405101,-0.064523208,0.042854098
546,Clinical characteristics and outcomes of severe rhinovirus-associated pneumonia identified by bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage in adults: Comparison with severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia,"Abstract Background Rhinoviruses (RVs) may cause pneumonia, but the characteristics of RV-associated pneumonia have not been adequately evaluated. Objective We aimed to compare characteristics, complications, and outcomes between severe RV- and influenza virus (IFV)-associated pneumonia in adults. Study design We used prospective cohort data of adult patients with severe pneumonia who had been admitted to the medical intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital over a 4-year period. The clinical features and outcomes of 27 patients with RV-positive bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were compared to those of 51 pneumonia patients with IFV-positive BAL fluid or IFV-positive nasopharyngeal specimens. Results Of 356 patients who underwent bronchoscopic BAL and respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR), RV was the most commonly identified virus (8.1%) from BAL fluid. Patients with RV-associated pneumonia were more likely to be immunocompromised than patients with IFV-associated pneumonia (81.5% vs. 33.3%, p <0.001). Bacterial coinfection tended to be less common in the RV group (18.5% vs. 37.3%, p =0.09). Although septic shock was less common in the RV group (29.6% vs. 54.9%, p =0.03), other clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and radiologic patterns were similar between the groups. The 28-day mortality of patients with severe RV- and IFV-associated pneumonia was similarly high (29.6% vs. 35.3% respectively, p =0.61). Conclusions Severe RV-associated pneumonia patients were more likely to be immunocompromised and less likely to present septic shock. Overall clinical features were similar and mortalities of both groups were comparably high.

547,Detection of respiratory viruses in gargle specimens of healthy children,"Abstract Background Respiratory tract viral infection is one of the most common and important diseases in children. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are often used to detect viruses in samples, it is difficult to interpret the clinical significance of PCR positivity, which may reflect a past, imminent or active asymptomatic infection due to their high sensitivity. Although single respiratory viruses have been detected in samples from children with symptoms, other respiratory viruses can also be detected simultaneously. However, the clinical importance of these findings for the symptoms is not known. Objectives To investigate the prevalence of respiratory viruses among children without any symptoms such as acute respiratory illness and/or fever. Study design From week twenty-five 2013 to week twenty-six 2014, gargle samples were collected from children once a week and these samples were subjected to real-time PCR to detect respiratory viruses. On each sampling day, we asked the parents about their children’s health condition. Results Among the 286 samples collected, 200 were from asymptomatic children. In the asymptomatic condition, human parechovirus, adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus 229E and HKU1 were observed in 45 episodes. In samples from symptomatic children, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus and coronavirus OC43 were detected in addition to those mentioned above. Conclusions Various viruses of different species were detected in the specimens from the children regardless of their health status. It might be speculated that host factors such as the function of the immune system influence the clinical outcome of the infection. However, this needs to be studied further.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.289043974,-0.084501122,-0.048927520999999995,0.105623379,0.138423656,-0.144995515,0.121504808,-0.092991603,0.11120153,0.049471268,0.045122170999999996,-0.04713986,0.055452028,0.002742101,0.094126981,-0.043721539000000004,-0.01494785,-0.106557321,0.074709256,-0.062770807,-0.022816545,0.101004065,-0.043329245999999995,0.043288457999999995,-0.030804192,0.067401415,-0.043494002999999996,-0.012027698,0.034500256,-0.089142975
550,Seasonal variations of respiratory viruses and etiology of human rhinovirus infection in children,"Abstract Background Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method it is possible to detect uncultivable viruses and discover multiple viral infections. However, the clinical importance of these findings in relation to symptoms is not known. Objectives The seasonal fluctuations of respiratory viruses and the clinical outcomes of single infections and dual infections were investigated. Study design Nasal aspirate samples were obtained from outpatients and inpatients of a children’s hospital and these samples were subjected to real-time PCR to detect 16 respiratory viruses. Seasonal variations of the 16 viruses and the clinical outcomes such as wheezing, the need for oxygenation and prolonged hospitalization of patients with single viral infections and multiple infections were determined for the 5 most often detected viruses. Results Among 512 specimens analyzed, one or more viruses were detected in 424 (83%) specimens. Two or more viruses were detected in 160 samples (31% of all samples). The epidemic peaks of the viruses did not coincide with each other. Rhinoviruses were the most frequently detected viruses and their coinfection rates were also higher. However, the disease severity in the lower respiratory tract did not differ in most respiratory viral infections regardless of whether there was single infection or dual infection with a rhinovirus and other respiratory virus. Conclusions Seasonal distribution was seen for each virus. There were no significant differences in clinical symptoms in the children studied. Because the infection of rhinoviruses is the common occurrence in children, it is hypothesized that the factors related to disease severity are mainly the underlying conditions of the children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.280306979,-0.108705458,-0.052506409000000004,0.118602229,0.07755342400000001,-0.126687816,0.096912899,-0.054265265,0.046866733,0.105669212,0.040519471,-0.079693446,0.05435075,0.027307045,0.078793616,-0.071962115,0.004668858,-0.07859371700000001,0.050113738,0.004467166,0.009318498,0.033951906000000004,-0.078715697,0.092319259,-0.042680819,0.027598453999999998,-0.012986822,-0.041890962999999996,0.029041302,-0.049372039000000006
552,Pitfalls in interpretation of CT-values of RT-PCR in children with acute respiratory tract infections,"Abstract Background The relation between viral load and disease severity in childhood acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) is not fully understood. Objectives To assess the clinical relevance of the relation between viral load, determined by cycle threshold (CT) value of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays and disease severity in children with single- and multiple viral ARI. Study design 582 children with ARI were prospectively followed and tested for 15 viruses. Correlations were calculated between CT values and clinical parameters. Results In single viral ARI, statistically significant correlations were found between viral loads of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and hospitalization and between viral loads of Human Coronavirus (HCoV) and a disease severity score. In multiple-viral ARI, statistically significant correlations between viral load and clinical parameters were found. In RSV-Rhinovirus (RV) multiple infections, a low viral load of RV was correlated with a high length of hospital stay and a high duration of extra oxygen use. The mean CT value for RV, HCoV and Parainfluenza virus was significantly lower in single- versus multiple infections. Conclusion Although correlations between CT values and clinical parameters in patients with single and multiple viral infection were found, the clinical importance of these findings is limited because individual differences in host-, viral and laboratory factors complicate the interpretation of statistically significant findings. In multiple infections, viral load cannot be used to differentiate between disease causing virus and innocent bystanders.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.15455071,-0.089894839,-0.074512588,0.039104024,-0.028479567,-0.103091056,0.095138011,-0.06636624099999999,0.070173081,0.047329775,0.014576463999999999,-0.018191608999999997,0.064552658,0.034036291,-0.003887533,-0.003684986,-0.046803075,-0.015978875,-0.033234553,0.016670242,-0.07735766200000001,0.011110723999999999,-0.09965041599999999,0.027609061,-0.027290722000000003,-0.045913254,0.166066572,-0.06611597,-0.027122121000000003,0.077964424
553,Diagnostic yield and clinical impact of routine cell culture for respiratory viruses among children with a negative multiplex RT-PCR result,"Abstract Background Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the reference standard for respiratory virus testing. However, cell culture may still have added value in identifying viruses not detected by PCR. Objectives We aimed to estimate the yield and clinical impact of routine respiratory virus culture among children with a negative PCR result. Study design A retrospective cohort study was performed from Jan. 2013 to Sept. 2015. Respiratory samples from hospitalized or immunocompromised patients <18years old were routinely inoculated on traditional tube cell culture monolayers if they tested negative by a PCR assay for 12 respiratory viruses. We studied patients with a respiratory specimen negative by PCR and positive by culture. Duplicates and samples of sold services were excluded. Data on demographics, clinical history, laboratory findings, and patient management were collected from patients’ charts. Descriptive and multivariate statistics were performed. Results Overall, 4638 PCR-negative samples were inoculated in cell culture. Of those, 196 (4.2%) were cell culture positive, and 144 met study inclusion criteria. Most subjects (81.9%) were hospitalized. Mean age was 2.4±3.4years. The viruses most frequently isolated were cytomegalovirus (33.3%) and enteroviruses (19.4%). Cell culture results prompted a change in management in 5 patients (3.5%), all of whom had acyclovir initiated for localized HSV-1 infection. Four of these had skin or mucosal lesions that could be sampled to establish a diagnosis. Conclusion In children, routine viral culture on respiratory specimens that were negative by PCR has low yield and minimal clinical impact.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.23023623899999998,-0.00579339,0.018185229,-0.003459415,-0.016762048999999998,-0.082468698,-0.026291189,0.030230301,-0.051706321,0.07327049299999999,0.017901985,-0.04764235,0.037750275,0.108846286,0.050980758,-0.054782360999999995,0.057697847999999996,-0.004533382,0.014237633000000001,-0.091775467,0.04441999,0.022359387,0.038460491,-0.078597869,-0.050537587,0.048260267999999995,-0.014130291000000001,-0.054913083,-0.039400412999999995,-0.039968338
554,Systematic review of respiratory viral pathogens identified in adults with community-acquired pneumonia in Europe,"Abstract Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an important respiratory disease and the fifth leading cause of mortality in Europe. The development of molecular diagnostic tests has highlighted the contributions of respiratory viruses to the aetiology of CAP, suggesting the incidence of viral pneumonia may have been previously underestimated. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to describe the overall identification of respiratory viruses in adult patients with CAP in Europe, following PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO; CRD42016037233). We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, WHOLIS, COCHRANE library and grey literature sources for relevant studies, and screened these against protocol eligibility criteria. Two researchers performed data extraction and risk of bias assessments, independently, using a piloted form. Results were synthesised narratively, and random effects meta-analyses performed to calculate pooled estimates of effect; heterogeneity was quantified using I2. Twenty-eight studies met inclusion criteria of which 21 were included in the primary meta-analysis. The pooled proportion of patients with identified respiratory viruses was 22.0% (95% CI: 18.0%–27.0%), rising to 29.0% (25.0%–34.0%) in studies where polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostics were performed. Influenza virus was the most frequently detected virus in 9% (7%–12%) of adults with CAP. Respiratory viruses make a substantial contribution to the aetiology of CAP in adult patients in Europe; one or more respiratory viruses are detected in about one quarter of all cases.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.167976483,-0.071312638,-0.071395725,0.01614457,-0.016558396,-0.011295707,-0.012512417,0.07117918200000001,-0.13233956300000002,0.090917457,-0.065619685,-0.006442428,0.045877219000000004,-0.006893929,-0.059322677000000004,-0.048691560999999994,-0.008879835,-0.027300616,-0.036337494,0.09045039999999999,-0.007627513000000001,0.062533205,0.15203016,0.084856777,0.083285178,-0.084234686,-0.010881999,-0.006999460999999999,0.08219795099999999,-0.038460118
556,Human coronavirus circulation in the United States 2014–2017,"Abstract Background Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) -OC43, -229E, -NL63 and -HKU1 cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections. HCoVs are globally distributed and the predominant species may vary by region or year. Prior studies have shown seasonal patterns of HCoV species and annual variation in species prevalence but national circulation patterns in the US have not yet been described. Objectives To describe circulation patterns of HCoVs -OC43, -229E, -NL63 and -HKU1 in the US. Study design We reviewed real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test results for HCoV-OC43, -229E, -NL63 and -HKU1 reported to The National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) by U.S. laboratories from July 2014–June 2017. We calculated the total number of tests and percent positive by week. For a subset of HCoV positive submissions with age and sex of the patient available, we tested for differences in age and sex across the four HCoV species using Chi Square and Kruskal Wallace tests. Results 117 laboratories reported 854,575 HCoV tests; 2.2% were positive for HCoV-OC43, 1.0% for HCoV-NL63, 0.8% for HCoV-229E, and 0.6% for HCoV-HKU1. The percentage of positive tests peaked during December – March each year. No significant differences in sex were seen across species, although a significant difference in age distribution was noted. Conclusions Common HCoVs may have annual peaks of circulation in winter months in the US, and individual HCoVs may show variable circulation from year to year. Different HCoV species may be detected more frequently in different age groups. Further years of data are needed to better understand patterns of activity for HCoVs.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.095974455,-0.039658817,-0.0492005,-0.026227236,0.188425748,-0.047674657,0.106318329,-0.029276197,0.131004848,-0.11900801,-0.043234233,0.40332453,0.32617874199999997,0.17584965600000002,0.013174103999999999,0.093154815,-0.061904448,-0.045709827,-0.057357579000000006,-0.002186364,-0.038705942,-0.029363851,0.044565158,-0.09749422199999999,0.01003551,-0.013379816000000001,0.05978107,0.025775277000000003,0.027293046,0.052420691
558,WU polyomavirus detected in children with severe respiratory failure,"Abstract Background WU polyomavirus (WUPyV) is a relatively new virus associated with respiratory infections. However, its role is unclear in children with severe respiratory failure. Objectives We aimed to evaluate the characteristics of severe respiratory failure associated with WUPyV infection in children. Study design We retrospectively reviewed cases of respiratory tract infection at a tertiary children's hospital in Japan and performed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for WUPyV using residual extracted nucleic acid samples taken from respiratory tract samples of pediatric patients primarily with respiratory failure. We investigated the clinical characteristics of patients positive for WUPyV and assessed samples positive for WUPyV for other respiratory pathogens using multiplex PCR. Results WUPyV was detected in 14 of 318 specimens of respiratory tract infections. The median age was 34 months and males were predominant (n = 11, 64%). An underlying disease was found in 11 (79%) patients including five preterm and three immunocompromised patients. The most common clinical diagnosis was pneumonia (n = 13, 93%). The majority of the samples were endotracheal tube aspirates (n = 11, 79%). Other viruses were co-detected in nine (64%) patients, while WUPyV was the only pathogen detected in five patients with a history of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. These five patients presented with fever and cough, and perihilar infiltrates were detected on chest radiograph in several days. Conclusions WUPyV was detected in children with severe respiratory failure independently or concurrently with other pathogens. WUPyV can be a pathogen for children with a history of preterm birth or an underlying disease.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.232509545,-0.040619367999999996,-0.076416602,-0.045214620999999997,0.007537364,-0.11271884900000001,0.0014140270000000002,0.02306454,-0.022060111,0.051534484000000005,-0.003546065,0.007368823,0.010580504,0.023504772,0.007904861,-0.014692786999999999,0.017755868,0.008651079,0.018235168,0.014398923999999999,0.029988166,-0.001868485,-0.025590658,-0.026665322,0.0039448059999999995,0.021000835,-0.061571333,-0.000591072,-0.002892678,-0.036493334
559,Human adenovirus in nasopharyngeal and blood samples from children with and without respiratory tract infections,"Abstract Background Human adenovirus (HAdV) is a double-stranded DNA virus associated with respiratory tract infections (RTI) in children. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, HAdV often is detected together with other virus species, even in healthy controls. Objectives The aim of this study was to compare molecular detection of HAdV with culture, and to examine the associations of various methods to RTI. Study design Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected from 4319 children admitted with RTI and from 361 controls. The NPAs were examined for 23 viral and bacterial pathogens, using inhouse real-time PCR-assays based on TaqMan probes, in addition to bacterial and viral culture. HAdV concentration was evaluated semi-quantitatively from the Ct-value and quantitatively by use of ADENOVIRUS R-gene®. Results HAdV-DNA was detected in 6.1% patient samples and in 10.5% controls (p< 0.001). Compared to controls, patients had an OR of 3.8 (95% CI 1.4–10.3) for mono-detection of HAdV DNA, and an OR of 5.1 (95% CI 2.0–13.4) for HAdV-positive samples grew adenovirus by culture. HAdV DNA loads from children with RTI consisted of two clusters: one cluster with high viral loads (Ct < 30 and >106 copies/ml) and one cluster with low viral loads, whereas among the controls, nearly all had low viral loads (OR 7.8, 95% CI 2.2–27.1). In 61 available plasma samples, 16.4% were positive for HAdV DNA, all were from patients. Conclusion The detection of HAdV DNA per se by qualitative PCR is not useful as a diagnostic test. Detection of HAdV by use of viral culture and a high viral HAdV DNA load are the two methods most strongly associated with RTI in children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.123780053,-0.049390247000000005,0.039446142000000003,-0.052011095,-0.0033904459999999997,-0.092657554,0.066124527,-0.036641796000000004,-0.020475785,0.004263838,-0.031191857000000003,0.003287236,-0.04183107,-0.067475502,-0.012185016000000002,0.010358586,-0.118133345,-0.029302339,0.00154853,-0.106978664,-0.065946461,0.310383849,0.034318796,0.07184948,-0.191559869,0.09366526800000001,-0.064767039,0.18307652,-0.194950764,0.074046832
560,Molecular and clinical characterization of human adenovirus associated with acute respiratory tract infection in hospitalized children,"Abstract Background Human adenovirus (HAdV) is a common pathogen in children that can cause acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI), but the molecular epidemiological and clinical information relating to HAdV among hospitalized children with ARTI are few reported in China. Objectives To evaluate the epidemiological, clinical, and molecular characteristics of HAdV infections among hospitalized children with ARTI in Hebei, Northern China from June 2017 to May 2018. Study design A 12-month longitudinal, retrospective study on HAdV, typed by nested polymerase chain reaction targeting the hexon gene’s hypervariable region (typing was merely performed by sequencing of the hexon neutralization epitope and thus genotypes could not be identified unequivocally), associated with ARTI was performed. The epidemiological and clinical data of different types of HAdV were analyzed using statistical product and service solutions (SPSS) 21.0 software. Results HAdV was detected in 330 (3.71%) of the 8906 specimens, with most (88.48%, 292/330) HAdV-positives cases detected among children < 3 years old. HAdV were detected throughout the year with a higher prevalence in spring. 11 types were identified, with HAdV-2 (33.33%, 110/330) as the predominant type, followed by HAdV-3 (21.21%, 70/330) and HAdV-7 (13.94%, 46/330). Of the 330 HAdV-positive specimens, 247 (74.85%) were co-detected with other respiratory pathogens, most commonly rhinovirus (HRV) (58.7%, 145/247). Additionally, patients with HAdV-7 positive had longer duration of fever than HAdV-2 or -3 positive patients. Conclusions During the study period, HAdV-2, HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 were the predominant types identified from children with ARTI in Hebei Province. Pediatric patients with HAdV-7 positive may not present more severe clinical outcome except a longer duration of fever.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.10322945900000001,-0.058013000999999995,-0.036270776,-0.09651596900000001,0.046325526,-0.061327399000000005,0.032457979,-0.025926072,0.015299358,-0.013329987,-0.021837765,0.049656112999999995,-0.053149444000000004,-0.06428943200000001,0.024054798,-0.022196002000000003,-0.087035464,0.039012185,-0.025821562000000003,-0.075221893,0.037049165,0.253608343,-0.031732339,0.052895497,-0.153295915,0.162261818,-0.061037254000000006,0.346448163,-0.143111378,0.048553815
561,"Detection of viral, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in exacerbations of asthma in children","Abstract Background: A high frequency of virus infections has been recently pointed out in the exacerbations of asthma in children. Objectives: To confirm this, using conventional and molecular detection methods, and expanding the study to younger children. Study design: One hundred and thirty-two nasal aspirates from 75 children hospitalized for a severe attack of asthma were studied (32 infants, mean age 9.1 months; and 43 children, mean age 5.6 years). According to the virus, a viral isolation technique, immunofluorescence assays (IFA) or both were used for the detection of rhinovirus, enterovirus, respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, adenovirus, coronavirus 229E, influenza and parainfluenza virus. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were used for the detection of rhinovirus, enterovirus, RS virus, adenovirus, coronavirus 229E and OC43, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Results: Using IFA and viral isolation techniques, viruses were detected in 33.3% of cases, and by PCR techniques, nucleic acid sequences of virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were obtained in 71.9% of cases. The combination of conventional and molecular techniques detects 81.8% of positive samples. Two organisms were identified in the same nasal sample in 20.4% of the cases. The percentage of detections was higher (85.9%) in the younger group than in the other (77%). The most frequently detected agents were rhinovirus (46.9%) and RS virus (21.2%). Using PCR rather than conventional techniques, the detection rates were increased 5.8- and 1.6-fold in rhinovirus and RS virus infections, respectively. The detection levels of the other organisms are as follows: 9.8, 5.1, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.7, and 2.2% for enterovirus, influenza virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, respectively. Conclusion: These results confirm the previously reported high frequency of rhinovirus detection in asthmatic exacerbations in children. They also point out the frequency of RS virus detection, and emphasize the fact that PCR assays may be necessary to diagnose respiratory infections in asthma.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.22502914899999998,-0.093841318,0.034805814,0.088079755,0.028993524,-0.089205193,0.044603070999999994,-0.053783902,0.000512581,0.078009708,-0.03054731,-0.075558867,0.059125109,-0.09440622800000001,0.077207548,0.000518534,0.028541392999999998,-0.09540525300000001,0.052239151,-0.09228737699999999,-0.071424103,0.03057552,0.132487847,0.052526135999999994,0.028315911000000003,0.110861255,0.007982094,0.048637924000000006,0.032633737,0.0483245
565,A systematic review of emerging respiratory viruses at the Hajj and possible coinfection with Streptococcus pneumoniae,"Abstract Background The annual Hajj to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia attracts millions of pilgrims from around the world. International health community's attention goes towards this mass gathering and the possibility of the development of any respiratory tract infections due to the high risk of acquisition of respiratory viruses. Method We searched MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus databases for relevant papers describing the prevalence of respiratory viruses among Hajj pilgrims. Results The retrieved articles were summarized based on the methodology of testing for these viruses. A total of 31 studies were included in the quantitative/qualitative analyses. The main methods used for the diagnosis of most common respiratory viruses were polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Influenza, rhinovirus and parainfluenza were the most common viruses detected among pilgrims. Coronaviruses other than MERS-CoV were also detected among pilgrims. The acquisition of MERS-CoV remains very limited and systematic screening of pilgrims showed no infections. Conclusions Well conducted multinational follow-up studies using the same methodology of testing are necessary for accurate surveillance of respiratory viral infections among Hajj pilgrims.

567,Role of Atypical Pathogens in Nursing Home–Acquired Pneumonia,"Abstract Objectives No international consensus has been reached on the empirical use of antibiotics with atypical coverage in nursing home–acquired pneumonia (NHAP). Aspiration is an important cause of NHAP, but it may not require antimicrobial treatment. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of AP infections and review the need for empirical antibiotics with atypical coverage in NHAP. Design A prospective cohort study. Setting Four nursing homes with a total number of 772 residents. Participants Patients were aged ≥ 65 years, hospitalized for NHAP, which was defined as the presence of respiratory symptoms and abnormal chest radiographs, from April 2006 to March 2007. Measurements Demographics, clinical parameters, and investigation results were recorded. Microbial investigations comprised sputum routine and mycobacterial cultures, blood and urine cultures, serology, and nasopharyngeal aspirate viral culture and polymerase chain reaction tests. Suspected aspiration pneumonitis was arbitrarily defined as NHAP without pathogens identified. Results After excluding lone bacteriuria, 108 episodes of NHAP in 94 patients were included. Twelve APs were detected in 11 patients. There was no clinical feature to distinguish between infections caused by APs and other pathogens. The commonest APs were Mycoplasma pneumoniae (6) and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (3). No Legionella pneumophila was detected by urinary antigen test. None of the patients with AP infection received antibiotics indicated for AP infections. However, AP infections did not result in mortality. No pathogen was isolated in 31.5% of cases. Patients without pathogens isolated were less likely to have purulent sputum and crepitations on chest auscultation, compared with those with pneumonia caused by identified pathogens. Conclusions Atypical pathogens (APs) were not associated with mortality even in cases where the prescribed antibiotics did not cover APs.

568,"Evaluation of Viruses Associated With Acute Respiratory Infections in Long-Term Care Facilities Using a Novel Method: Wisconsin, 2016‒2019","Abstract Residents of long-term care facilities (LCTFs) have high morbidity and mortality associated with acute respiratory infections (ARIs). Limited information exists on the virology of ARI in LTCFs, where virological testing is reactive. We report on findings of a surveillance feasibility substudy from a larger prospective trial of introducing rapid influenza diagnostic testing (RIDT) at 10 Wisconsin LTCFs. Any resident with symptoms consistent with ARI had a nasal swab specimen collected for RIDT by staff. Following RIDT, the residual swab was placed into viral transport medium and tested for influenza using Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and for 20 pathogens using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction respiratory pathogen panel. Numbers of viruses in each of 7 categories (influenza A, influenza B, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus) across the 3 years were compared using χ2. Totals of 160, 215, and 122 specimens were collected during 2016‒2017, 2017‒2018, and 2018‒2019, respectively. Respiratory pathogen panel identified viruses in 54.8% of tested specimens. Influenza A (19.2%), influenza B (12.6%), respiratory syncytial virus (15.9%), and human metapneumovirus (20.9%) accounted for 69% of all detections, whereas coronaviruses (17.2%), rhinovirus/enterovirus (10.5%) and parainfluenza (3.8%) were less common. The distribution of viruses varied significantly across the 3 years (χ2 = 71.663; df = 12; P < .001). Surveillance in LTCFs using nasal swabs collected for RIDT is highly feasible and yields high virus identification rates. Significant differences in virus composition occurred across the 3 study years. Simple approaches to surveillance may provide a more comprehensive assessment of respiratory viruses in LTCF settings.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.254055896,-0.112799841,-0.050573032000000004,0.21300346399999998,0.062966695,0.12155613300000001,-0.049735655999999996,-0.008733383,9.39e-05,-0.011055935,-0.000504115,-0.030412629,0.064860073,-0.024592158,0.04195793900000001,-0.039518042,0.0072356040000000005,-0.08846733,0.063971395,-0.01934574,-0.014911683,-0.064853363,-0.009967272,-0.012472318,0.051477388,0.035338437,-0.02842286,0.056624987,0.008096382,-0.137644022
588,Review of Non-bacterial Infections in Respiratory Medicine: Viral Pneumonia,"Abstract Although bacteria are the main pathogens involved in community-acquired pneumonia, a significant number of community-acquired pneumonia are caused by viruses, either directly or as part of a co-infection. The clinical picture of these different pneumonias can be very similar, but viral infection is more common in the pediatric and geriatric populations, leukocytes are not generally elevated, fever is variable, and upper respiratory tract symptoms often occur; procalcitonin levels are not generally affected. For years, the diagnosis of viral pneumonia was based on cell culture and antigen detection, but since the introduction of polymerase chain reaction techniques in the clinical setting, identification of these pathogens has increased and new microorganisms such as human bocavirus have been discovered. In general, influenza virus type A and syncytial respiratory virus are still the main pathogens involved in this entity. However, in recent years, outbreaks of deadly coronavirus and zoonotic influenza virus have demonstrated the need for constant alert in the face of new emerging pathogens. Neuraminidase inhibitors for viral pneumonia have been shown to reduce transmission in cases of exposure and to improve the clinical progress of patients in intensive care; their use in common infections is not recommended. Ribavirin has been used in children with syncytial respiratory virus, and in immunosuppressed subjects. Apart from these drugs, no antiviral has been shown to be effective. Prevention with anti-influenza virus vaccination and with monoclonal antibodies, in the case of syncytial respiratory virus, may reduce the incidence of pneumonia.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.216812013,-0.107293184,-0.099294015,0.097915404,-0.073916358,0.093858408,0.005314584,0.039195337999999996,-0.025688619,0.113537015,-0.043460519,-0.0475929,0.109092908,-0.053747817999999996,0.02743601,-0.039945475,-0.006809826999999999,0.063713882,-0.022363187000000003,0.111432423,-0.002078179,0.067162189,0.06141349,0.04198212,0.0799923,0.016973548999999997,0.015028096000000001,0.011884705,0.030728726,-0.03496822
590,Viral etiology of acute lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized young children in Northern Taiwan,"Background Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) comprise a great proportion of diagnoses among hospitalized children. This study identifies the viral pathogens causing LRTIs in young children and compares their clinical features and disease severity. Methods Children younger than 36 months old, hospitalized at a medical center in Northern Taiwan with acute bronchiolitis or pneumonia from April to December 2007, were prospectively enrolled. Nasopharyngeal aspiration fluid samples were sent for virus culture, for direct immunofluorescence test of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), for rapid influenza viral identification, and for polymerase chain reaction of human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human boca virus (hBoV), and human corona virus. The clinical features and laboratory findings were recorded and analyzed. Results A total of 48 children were enrolled. RSV was the most common pathogen (41.7%), followed by hMPV (27.1%), hBoV, and enterovirus (both 6.3%). There were no significant differences in clinical presentation and disease severity between the RSV and hMPV groups. However, the hMPV group had a higher mixed infection rate (p = 0.038). Fourteen children had no identifiable viruses. Children with single, dual, and triple pathogens numbered 26, 7, and 1, respectively. The mixed infection rate reached 23.5% among 34 children with identifiable viruses. Children with a higher severity score had greater chance to develop asthma in the next 2 years (p = 0.042). Conclusion RSV is the most common pathogen causing LRTIs in young children, followed by hMPV. The hMPV group had higher mixed infection rate than RSV group. hBoV does circulate in northern Taiwan.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.277001974,-0.179587243,-0.110385132,0.076271253,0.06324924,-0.173046637,0.099964207,-0.179011242,0.19567496899999998,-0.068539728,0.028550742999999996,-0.112008675,-0.148586788,-0.064065665,-0.115270328,-0.032423592,-0.061455142000000004,0.182174682,-0.136424816,0.052542097,0.068382106,0.083704524,0.030453147000000003,-0.061734736,-0.09684012199999999,-0.00015847,-0.058536042,-0.054657869000000005,-0.009931299000000001,0.05343823
591,Viral etiology of bronchiolitis among pediatric inpatients in northern Taiwan with emphasis on newly identified respiratory viruses,"Purpose Viral etiology of bronchiolitis in children in Taiwan has been fragmentary. We conducted a prospective study to figure out the viral epidemiology of bronchiolitis in Taiwan. Materials and methods From January 2009 to March 2011, a total of 113 children with bronchiolitis, aged <2 years, hospitalized in Chang Gung Children’s Hospital were randomly selected for viral etiology investigation. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from each case and sent for viral detection by tissue culture, antigen test, and polymerase chain reaction. Results A total of 120 viruses were detected from 113 children. Positive viral etiology was identified in 86 (76%) children. Mixed viral pathogens were found in 28 cases (25%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common pathogen and was identified in 43.4% of the cases. Human bocavirus (hBoV) was the second most common identified virus (in 19.5%), followed by human metapneumovirus (hMPV), rhinovirus, influenza viruses, and coronavirus OC43. In terms of clinical characteristics, no significant difference was found among the children with bronchiolitis either caused by different single or mixed viral infection. Conclusion RSV was the most common etiologic agent for children with bronchiolitis in Taiwan. Newly identified viruses, including hMPV and hBoV, were also among the common causative agents.

592,Epidemiology of human coronavirus NL63 infection among hospitalized patients with pneumonia in Taiwan,"Abstract Background/Purpose Human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 is recognized in association with upper or lower respiratory tract illnesses in children. This study surveyed the prevalence of HCoV-NL63 and influenza viruses in patients with influenza-like illness in Taiwan during 2010–2011. Methods Throat samples from 107 hospitalized patients with pneumonia and 175 outpatients with influenza-like illness were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction assays with virus-specific primers, and then virus-positive specimens were confirmed by sequencing the polymerase chain reaction products. Results HCoV-NL63 infection was identified in 8.4% (9/107) of hospitalized patients with pneumonia, but not found in outpatients with influenza-like illness. Age distribution of HCoV-NL63 infection in hospitalized patients with pneumonia indicated that the group aged 16–25 years (20%) had the highest positive rate compared with the other groups, and exhibited a similar age-specific pattern to influenza A/H1N1 infection, but not influenza A/H3N2 and B infections in hospitalized patients. Seasonal prevalence of HCoV-NL63 infection was late winter, overlapping the highest peak of the influenza A/H1N1 epidemic during December 2010 to March 2011 in Taiwan. Co-infection of HCoV-NL63 and influenza A/H1N1 was detected in three hospitalized patients. Clinical manifestation analysis indicated that the main symptoms for HCoV-NL63 infection included fever (88.9%), cough (77.8%), and pneumonia (100%). Co-infection caused significantly higher rates of breathing difficulties, cough, and sore throat than those of single infection with HCoV-NL63 and influenza A/H1N1. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a low level of heterogeneity between Taiwan and global HCoV-NL63 strains. Conclusion Understanding epidemiology of HCoV-NL63 in Taiwan provides an insight for worldwide surveillance of HCoV-NL63 infection.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.209624858,-0.098313774,-0.105033244,0.04382642900000001,0.113346975,0.09527044800000001,-0.071138332,-0.005664811,0.032916263,-0.13309783,-0.037966326,0.368961017,0.26459159600000004,0.19540006,-0.033190167,0.073321891,-0.042160834,-0.007943844,-0.096118588,0.052892432,0.009124636,0.007418369,0.033259343999999996,-0.09347070800000001,-0.022642735,-0.004049528,0.025604481000000002,0.036788378,-0.001278305,0.10257528699999999
593,Characteristics of community-acquired respiratory viruses infections except seasonal influenza in transplant recipients and non-transplant critically ill patients,"Abstract Background/Purpose Transplant recipients are vulnerable to life-threatening community-acquired respiratory viruses (CA-RVs) infection (CA-RVI). Even if non-transplant critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU) have serious CA-RVI, comparison between these groups remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate clinical characteristics and mortality of CA-RVI except seasonal influenza A/B in transplant recipients and non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU. Methods We collected 37,777 CA-RVs multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test results of individuals aged ≥18 years from November 2012 to November 2017. The CA-RVs tests included adenovirus, coronavirus 229E/NL63/OC43, human bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus A/B. Results We found 286 CA-RVI cases, including 85 solid organ transplantation recipients (G1), 61 hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients (G2), and 140 non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU (G3), excluding those with repeated isolation within 30 days. Adenovirus positive rate and infection cases were most prominent in G2 (p < 0.001). The median time interval between transplantation and CA-RVI was 30 and 20 months in G1 and G2, respectively. All-cause in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in G3 than in G1 or G2 (51.4% vs. 28.2% or 39.3%, p = 0.002, respectively). The mechanical ventilation (MV) was the independent risk factor associated with all-cause in-hospital mortality in all three groups (hazard ratio, 3.37, 95% confidence interval, 2.04–5.56, p < 0.001). Conclusions This study highlights the importance of CA-RVs diagnosis in transplant recipients even in long-term posttransplant period, and in non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU with MV.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.09973513,-0.041748049,-0.046024449,-0.07544062900000001,-0.024493325,-0.006237256,-0.018570056,0.041613395,-0.046721539000000006,-0.013437573999999999,-0.021622544,0.042905597999999996,0.010177188,0.024355343999999998,-0.01994056,0.021270529,0.00694533,0.001144199,0.005410356,0.013410773,0.011530221,-0.041408125,-0.02054292,-0.002166967,-0.006159558000000001,-0.02336879,-0.017882586000000002,-0.015397161999999999,-0.042948825,-0.03066677

Background Human metapneumovirus (hPMV) is a recently identified virus that is recognized as a cause of respiratory tract illness in the pediatric population. Objectives To determine the incidence of respiratory tract infections caused by hPMV in hospitalized infants and to describe the clinical characteristics and possible presence of coinfection with other viral agents. Patients and methods We performed a prospective study from September to June 2003 in all children aged less than 24 months who were admitted to the Severo Ochoa Hospital (Leganés, Madrid) with a respiratory tract infection. Virological diagnosis was made with a direct immunofluorescent assay and/or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on specimens obtained from nasopharyngeal washing. Demographic and clinical data from patients with an hPMV respiratory tract infection were analyzed. Results During the study period, 200 infants were admitted with a respiratory tract infection, of which 18 (9 %) had an hPMV infection. HPMV was the viral agent isolated in 13.8% of positive nasopharyngeal washings. All patients were admitted between March and April. The mean age was 6.7 ± 6.1 months. The most common diagnoses were recurrent wheezing (55.5 %) and bronchiolitis (38.8%). Oxygen therapy was required by 55.5 % of infants during hospitalization. Coinfection with other respiratory viruses was confirmed in 33.3% of the patients. Conclusions Human metapneumovirus is a major cause of respiratory tract illness in hospitalized infants.

En nuestro medio no se ha descrito el papel del rinovirus en infecciones respiratorias de niños hospitalizados. Objetivos Describir las infecciones confirmadas por rinovirus en niños hospitalizados por infección respiratoria en un hospital de segundo nivel. Pacientes y métodos Estudio descriptivo prospectivo de las infecciones confirmadas por rinovirus en niños hospitalizados por fiebre o infección respiratoria en la temporada 2004-2005. Para el diagnóstico virológico se realizó inmunofluorescencia y reacción en cadena de la polimerasa (PCR) en aspirado nasofaríngeo. Se describen las características clínicas de los pacientes. Resultados Se describen un total de 76 niños hospitalizados con infección por rinovirus, lo que supuso el 25 % de los pacientes hospitalizados por procesos respiratorios o fiebre. El rinovirus fue el segundo agente viral identificado tras el virus respiratorio sincitial (29,9% de los hospitalizados). El 71,1 % de los pacientes fueron menores de 2 años. Los diagnósticos más frecuentes fueron sibilancias recurrentes en el 60,5 %, bronquiolitis en 23,7 %, neumonía en el 7,9 % e infección respiratoria de vías altas en el 5,3%. Presentaron fiebre de más de 38 °C el 57,9 % de los niños e infiltrado radiológico el 23,7%. Presentaron hipoxia el 43,4% de los niños. En niños mayores de 2 años el diagnóstico fue crisis asmática en 21 de los 22 casos. Conclusiones Los rinovirus se detectaron en un importante porcentaje de los niños hospitalizados a consecuencia de infección respiratoria, siendo precedidos en frecuencia sólo por el virus respiratorio sincitial. En nuestra serie es el agente viral más frecuentemente asociado con episodios de sibilancias recurrentes en niños mayores de 2 años, y el segundo en los más pequeños. Background Rhinovirus is a recognized cause of common cold and has been shown to cause asthma exacerbations in adults and children. The burden of rhinovirus infections in hospitalized children has not been described in Spain. Objective To describe confirmed rhinovirus infections in children hospitalized for respiratory tract infection in a secondary public hospital. Patients and methods We performed a prospective descriptive study in children admitted to hospital with fever or respiratory tract infection and with a positive isolation of rhinovirus in nasopharyngeal washings between September 2004 and July 2005. Virological diagnosis was made with direct immunofluorescent assay and/or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in specimens obtained from nasopharyngeal washings. The clinical characteristics of the patients were analyzed. Results There were 76 children with rhinovirus infection, representing 25 % of admissions in 304 children with fever or respiratory tract infection. Rhinovirus was the second most frequent viral agent identified after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (29.9 % of admissions). Fifty-four children (71.1%) were under 2 years of age. The most frequent clinical diagnoses were recurrent wheezing in 60.5 %, bronchiolitis in 23.7%, pneumonia in 7.9%, and upper respiratory tract infection in 5.3 %. Fever > 38 °C was present in 57.9% of the patients and radiologic infiltrate was found in 23.7%. Oxygen saturation less than 95% was found in 43.4% of the patients. Of 22 children aged more than 2 years, a diagnosis of asthmatic crisis was made in 21.

597,Etiología de bronquiolitis en niños hospitalizados en el sureste de España,"Resumen Introducción La bronquiolitis es una de las infecciones respiratorias más comunes en niños menores de 2 años y una de las principales causas de ingreso en niños pequeños, especialmente durante el invierno. Objetivos Determinar la prevalencia y etiología de bronquiolitis en el sureste de España. Material y métodos Se realizó un estudio prospectivo durante la temporada de bronquiolitis (diciembre-abril). En el estudio se incluyeron niños menores de 18 meses ingresados en el hospital con motivo del primer episodio de bronquiolitis. Se analizaron aspirados nasofaríngeos mediante una técnica de reacción en cadena de la polimerasa (múltiple), precedida de transcripción inversa del ARN viral (RT-PCR). Resultados Se incluyeron en el estudio 235 niños, de cada uno de los cuales se obtuvo una muestra de aspirado nasofaríngeo. Se detectaron virus respiratorios en muestras de 204 niños (en total 287 virus). El virus respiratorio sincitial se detectó con mayor frecuencia seguido del rinovirus. Se observaron infecciones virales mixtas en el 36% de los niños en los que se detectó algún virus respiratorio. La asociación más frecuente fue el virus respiratorio sincitial A con rinovirus. Conclusiones Se detectaron virus respiratorios en la mayoría de los niños menores de 18 meses hospitalizados por bronquiolitis, en forma de infección mixta en el 36% de aquellos con infección viral. Abstract Background Bronchiolitis is the most common respiratory disease in children under 2 years-old and a major cause of hospitalization in young children, especially during the winter. Objectives To determine the prevalence and etiology of bronchiolitis in south-east of Spain. Study design A prospective study was conducted during the bronchiolitis season (December-April). Children below 18 months-old admitted to the hospital for a first bronchiolitis episode were included. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were analysed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) respiratory syncytial virus. Results A total of 235 children were included during this period, and 235 RT-PCR were performed. A total of 287 viruses were detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from 204 infants. Respiratory syncytial virus was the virus detected more frequently, followed by rhinovirus. Co-infections were found in the 36% of children.

598,Infecciones virales de las vías respiratorias en la Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos Neonatales,"Resumen Introducción Las infecciones virales respiratorias son causa de importante morbimortalidad en recién nacidos prematuros. Hemos realizado un estudio prospectivo en nuestra unidad de cuidados intensivos neonatales (UCIN) para determinar la incidencia de infecciones respiratorias, su impacto, epidemiología y pronóstico en neonatos de alto riesgo. Pacientes y métodos Estudio prospectivo realizado entre septiembre del 2011 y mayo del 2013 entre todos los recién nacidos < 32 semanas de edad gestacional y aquellos niños cuya patología pudiera dar lugar a pensar en un ingreso superior a las 2 semanas. Se recogieron aspirados nasofaríngeos (ANF) el primer día de vida y semanalmente hasta el alta para estudio virológico mediante reacción en cadena de polimerasa. En los casos en los que los niños presentaban síntomas respiratorios, se procedió a recoger un nuevo ANF. El pediatra cumplimentó un cuestionario con los datos clínicos. Resultados Se estudió a 60 niños; 30 (50%) de ellos con una edad gestacional < 32 semanas y 36 (60%) con un peso < 1.500 g. Se recogió un total de 256 ANF, 24 de los cuales resultaron positivos (9,3%). Estas 24 muestras positivas correspondieron solo a 13 niños (21,6% de los pacientes). De ellos, 9 resultaron sintomáticos y presentaron 11 episodios de infección (2 pacientes experimentaron 2 episodios diferentes con control negativo entre ellos). El virus más frecuentemente identificado —el 79% de las muestras (19)— fue el rinovirus (RV). El dato clínico más frecuente fue la presencia o incremento de apneas (75%) y la necesidad de oxigenoterapia. Conclusiones Las infecciones por RV son frecuentes en la UCIN y los recién nacidos pretérmino tienen un alto riesgo de presentar infecciones de relevancia clínica. Abstract Introduction Viral respiratory infections cause major morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. We have performed a prospective study in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to determine the incidence of respiratory infections, their impact and the epidemiology and outcome in high risk neonates. Patients and methods From September 2011 to May 2013 a prospective study was conducted in all preterm infants < 32 weeks gestational age and in all term newborns admitted to NICU for any pathology that are anticipated to have an income exceeding two weeks. A nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was collected the first day of life and weekly until discharge for virologic study with polymerase chain reaction. When these babies presented respiratory symptoms a new NPA was collected in this moment. A clinical form was filled by the physician. Results A total of 60 infants were analyzed: 30 (50%) had a gestational age < 32 weeks and 36 (60%) weighing less than 1500 grams. We collected a total of 256 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, 24 of them being positive (9.3%). These 24 positive samples corresponded to 13 infants in our cohort (21.6% of the patients). Of them, 9 were symptomatic and had 11 episodes of infection (2 patients had two different episodes with negative control between them). The most frequently identified virus was rhinovirus in (19) 79% of cases. The most frequent clinical data was the presence or increased of apneas (75%) and the needed of oxygenotherapy.

599,Estudio prospectivo para estimar la carga de hospitalización y visitas a urgencias de la gripe en población pediátrica en Bilbao (2010-2011),"Resumen Introducción El estudio se llevó a cabo para estimar la carga de enfermedad de la gripe confirmada por laboratorio en niños menores de 15 años. Pacientes y métodos Los niños que acudieron al Hospital Universitario de Basurto con síntomas de infección respiratoria aguda y/o fiebre aislada entre noviembre de 2010 y mayo de 2011 fueron incluidos en el estudio (NCT01592799). Se tomaron 2muestras de secreción nasofaríngea: una para un test de diagnóstico rápido en el Servicio de Urgencias y otra para análisis en laboratorio con reacción en cadena de la polimerasa en tiempo real y cultivo viral. Resultados Se seleccionó a un total de 501 niños, de los que 91 fueron hospitalizados. El diagnóstico de gripe se confirmó en 131 (26,1%); 120/410 (29,3%) fueron tratados ambulatoriamente y 11/91 (12,1%), hospitalizados. En 370/501 niños (73,9%) el resultado no fue positivo. La proporción de otros virus respiratorios fue 145/501 (28,9%) casos y de coinfección con otro virus respiratorio además de gripe de 7/501 (1,4%). Los tipos de virus de gripe fueron: A (H1N1 y H3N2) 53,2% (67/126); B (Victoria y Yamagata) 46,0% (58/126); A+B 0,8% (1/126). El coste médico directo medio asociado con cada caso de gripe confirmada fue de 177,00€ (N=131). No se observaron diferencias estadísticamente significativas entre el coste asociado con gripe A o B. Conclusión Casi la mitad de los casos fueron virus de gripe B. La administración de una vacuna que incluya tipos A y B de gripe debería reducir la carga de la enfermedad. Abstract Introduction This study was undertaken to estimate the burden of morbidity associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza in children below 15 years of age. Patients and methods Children presenting with acute respiratory infection and/or isolated fever at the Basurto University Hospital, Bilbao, Spain between November 2010 and May 2011 were included in this study (NCT01592799). Two nasopharyngeal secretion samples were taken from each; one for a rapid influenza diagnostic test in the emergency department, and the second for laboratory analysis using real-time polymerase chain reaction and viral culture. Results A total of 501 children were recruited, of whom 91 were hospitalized. Influenza diagnosis was confirmed in 131 children (26.1%); 120 of 410 (29.3%) treated as outpatients and 11 of 91 (12.1%) hospitalized children. A total of 370 of 501 children (73.9%) had no laboratory test positive for influenza. The proportion of subjects with other respiratory viruses was 145/501 (28.9%) cases and co-infection with the influenza virus plus another respiratory virus was detected in 7/501 (1.4%) cases. Influenza virus types were: A (H1N1 and H3N2) 53.2% (67/126); B (Victoria and Yamagata) 46.0% (58/126); A+B 0.8% (1/126). The median direct medical costs associated with each case of laboratory-confirmed influenza was €177.00 (N=131). No significant differences were observed between the medical costs associated with influenza A and B. Conclusion Almost half of the cases were influenza virus B type. The administration of a vaccine containing influenza A and B types to children below 15 years of age might reduce the overall burden of the illness.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.125924187,-0.100111656,-0.043375286,0.015737415,-0.01239613,0.103316423,-0.053274509000000005,-0.019985686000000003,0.023671009,-0.08247470400000001,0.009588501999999999,0.030075339,-0.03360184,-0.132570079,0.18487575399999998,0.280040104,0.35458914,0.058739411,-0.031448774,0.066238751,0.028677405,0.111562656,0.069469081,0.01271603,-0.116844055,-0.044212271,0.01650023,0.014722113,-0.017519945,0.05181158

Pacientes y métodos Se revisaron retrospectivamente las historias clínicas de los pacientes con diagnóstico microbiológico de infección por B. pertussis mediante reacción en cadena de la polimerasa, de enero de 2008 a diciembre de 2016. Resultados Se identificaron 110 pacientes, de los cuales 105 (95,4%) fueron menores de 6 meses y el 59,1% eran varones. La incidencia anual de hospitalización se estimó entre 13,7 y 425,0 casos por cada 100.000 lactantes menores de 12 meses, con 2picos en 2011 y 2015. Los familiares cercanos fueron las principales fuentes de contagio potenciales. Las principales manifestaciones fueron la tos pertusoide asociada con signos catarrales, cianosis y linfocitosis. El 15,4% de los pacientes presentaron complicaciones (principalmente neumonía), pero la evolución fue favorable en todos los casos. La menor edad y la no vacunación se asociaron con un mayor riesgo de desarrollar complicaciones (p < 0,05). La coinfección viral ocurrió en el 31,6% de los pacientes diagnosticados de infección por B. pertussis. Conclusiones La incidencia de infección por B. pertussis ha aumentado en los últimos años en nuestra área, con un menor desarrollo de complicaciones y con tasas de mortalidad inferiores al período anterior. La menor edad y la no vacunación previa se consideran factores de riesgo para el desarrollo de complicaciones. La vacunación en mujeres embarazadas probablemente disminuirá la incidencia en el futuro, sobre todo en niños menores de 6 meses. Abstract Objective Describe the epidemiological and clinical pattern of Bordetella pertussis infection (whooping cough) among hospitalised infants less than one year-old in a paediatric hospital in Gran Canaria. Patients and methods A retrospective review of the patient hospital records was performed, and recording only those with a microbiological diagnosis of pertussis infection detected using polymerase chain reaction, from January 2008 to December 2016. Results A total of 110 patients were identified, of which 105 (95.4%) were less than 6 months-old, and 59.1% were males. The annual incidence of hospital admissions was estimated between 13.7 to 425.0 cases per 100,000 infants <12 months old, with 2peaks in 2011 and 2015. Household members were the main potential sources of infection. Main clinical features were pertussis cough associated with signs of catarrh, cyanosis, and lymphocytosis. Complications occurred in 15.4% of the patients (mainly pneumonia), but the outcome was favourable in all the cases. A lower age and non-vaccination were associated with an increased risk of developing complications (P<.05). Viral co-infection occurred in 31.6% of infants diagnosed with pertussis. Conclusions The incidence of pertussis has increased in the last years in Gran Canaria, with a lower development of complications and mortality rates compared with the previous period. Lower age and non-vaccination status are considered risk factors for developing complications. Vaccination in pregnant women will probably lead to a decline in the incidence in the future, especially in infants younger than 6 months.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.075570026,-0.064250653,-0.043515165,-0.120659139,-0.037958432,0.0031072540000000003,0.021690736000000002,0.013653233,0.018291453,-0.054304318,0.001300266,0.053048627,-0.05107503,-0.17207466600000001,0.23248532800000002,0.373859791,0.461818206,0.099767034,-0.02673665,0.100520353,0.034148508,0.069499818,0.047181098,0.030227346000000002,-0.075526623,-0.13985321,0.083972399,0.021809508,-0.028990994,0.007144394
606,L’analyse virologique des aspirations nasopharyngées reflète-t-elle l’infection respiratoire basse chez l’enfant ? Étude en PCR multiplex,"Résumé Les infections respiratoires sont un problème de santé publique. Leur cause en est majoritairement virale chez le jeune enfant. La mise au point de techniques de détection par biologie moléculaire a permis d’en élargir le spectre virologique. L’objectif de notre travail est d’évaluer la corrélation entre les résultats des prélèvements effectués par aspiration rhinopharyngée et par lavage bronchoalvéolaire. Trente enfants présentant une symptomatologie d’infection respiratoire basse ont ainsi été prélevés aux deux sites au cours d’une même séance. Les échantillons ont été analysés par Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) virale multiplex (xTAG™RVP). Une corrélation forte est retrouvée entre la positivité de la PCR virale dans les voies respiratoires hautes et basses (p =0,0002). Le virus le plus fréquemment isolé est l’entéro-rhinovirus. Ces résultats confirment que l’infection virale touche l’appareil respiratoire de façon diffuse, et suggèrent que le prélèvement par aspiration rhinopharyngée suffit au diagnostic virologique d’une infection respiratoire virale basse chez l’enfant immunocompétent. Abstract Respiratory tract infections are frequent in young children and are related to viruses in most cases. Multiplex Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based techniques are valuable tools for describing the spectrum of such viruses. The goal of this study was to assess the correlation of virus detection in samples obtained by nasopharyngeal aspiration and by bronchoalveolar lavage. Both samples were taken at the same time in 30 children with lower respiratory tract infection, and were analyzed by multiplex virus PCR (xTAG™RVP). A strong correlation has been found (P =0.0002) and the most frequently isolated virus was the entero-rhinovirus spp. These results strengthen the opinion that viruses colonize both the upper and lower respiratory tract. Nasopharyngeal samples should be sufficient to the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract viral infection in immuno-competent children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.09683995599999999,-0.054481019000000006,0.016747478,-0.020959486,0.00324647,-0.040978867999999995,0.059448757000000005,-0.031962579,0.060015732,0.020428657,0.003024278,-0.006403725,0.04225943,-0.08937536,0.224118309,0.19269398899999998,0.33435320399999996,0.022903144,-0.031397015,0.000332905,0.042607528,0.054770251,0.06741862,0.0037386209999999997,-0.023331797,0.028201754,-0.039902745,-0.05774991,0.001797575,-0.007111239
613,Relationship between CD14-159C/T gene polymorphism and acute brucellosis risk,"Abstract Objective To investigate the association between the cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14)-159C/T (rs2569190) gene polymorphism and susceptibility to acute brucellosis in an Iranian population. Methods The study included 153 Iranian patients with active brucellosis and 128 healthy individuals as the control group. Genotyping of the CD14 variant was performed using an amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction method. Results The prevalence of CD14-159 TT and CT genotypes were associated with increased risk of brucellosis [odds ratio (OR) = 1.993, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.07–3.71, P = 0.03 for CT; OR = 3.869, 95% CI = 1.91–7.84, P = 0.01 for TT genotype. Additionally, the minor allele (T) was significantly more frequently present in brucellosis patients than in controls (61% vs. 45%, respectively), and was a risk factor for brucellosis (OR = 3.058, 95% CI = 1.507–6.315, P = 0.01).

617,Viral infections in patients with an acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia,"Abstract Background Patients with slowly progressive idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, often deteriorate, thus suggesting that the clinical course may be unpredictable. Such episodes are termed acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. The etiology of an acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia is unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that an acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia is induced by respiratory viral infections. Methods Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from patients with an acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia was tested for viral nucleic acid using polymerase chain reaction. Results Only 1 of the 14 patients with an acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia exhibited evidence of respiratory syncytial virus B, and 2 patients exhibited evidence of cytomegalovirus. Seven patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

618,Pathogen profiles and molecular epidemiology of respiratory viruses in Japanese inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia,"Abstract Background The etiological profile of viruses among adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has not been characterized yet. The aim of this study was twofold: first, investigate the pathogen profiles and the molecular epidemiology of respiratory viruses among Japanese CAP patients; and second, explore the clinical significance of viral infections. Methods A cross-sectional observational study was conducted at Kyorin University Hospital. To identify respiratory pathogens, hospitalized CAP patients were enrolled, and reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction technology was applied alongside conventional microbiological methods. Phylogenetic and pairwise distance analyses of 10 viruses were performed. CAP patients were divided into four etiological groups (virus alone, bacteria alone, co-detection of virus and bacteria, and not detected) and the clinical findings were compared. Results Seventy-six patients were enrolled. Bacteria alone were detected in 39.5% (n=30) of CAP patients. Virus alone or co-detection were found in 10.5% (n=8) and 11.8% (n=9) of cases, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae and human metapneumovirus were the most frequently detected bacterium and virus, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses of human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, and human respiratory syncytial virus showed that different subgroups and genotypes might be associated with CAP. Respiratory failure was more common when a virus was detected (both virus alone and co-detection groups; n=17, 100%, p<0.05) than when a bacteria alone was detected (n=17, 56.7%). Conclusion Prevalence of respiratory virus infection in CAP inpatients was 22.3%.

620,"Clinico-epidemiological characteristics of acute respiratory infections by coronavirus OC43, NL63 and 229E","Abstract Background and objectives Acute respiratory infection is a very common condition in the general population. The majority of these infections are due to viruses. This study attempted to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of adult patients with respiratory infection by the coronavirus OC43, NL63 and 229E. Patients and methods Between January 2013 and February 2014, we prospectively studied all patients with suspected clinical respiratory infection by taking throat swabs and performing a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in search of coronavirus. Results In 48 cases (7.0% of the 686 enrolled patients; 12.6% of the 381 in whom a virus was detected) the presence of a coronavirus demonstrated. In 24 cases, the virus was OC43 (50%); in 14 cases, the virus was NL63 (29%); and in 10 cases, the virus was 229E (21%). The mean age was 54.5 years, with a slight predominance of men. The most common clinical presentations were nonspecific influenza symptoms (43.7%), pneumonia (29.2%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (8.3%). Fifty-two percent of the patients required hospitalization, and 2 patients required intensive care. There were no deaths. Conclusion Acute respiratory infections caused by coronavirus mainly affect middle-aged male smokers, who are often affected by previous diseases.

621,Acute respiratory viral infections in pediatric cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy,"Abstract Objective to estimate the prevalence of infection by respiratory viruses in pediatric patients with cancer and acute respiratory infection (ARI) and/or fever. Methods cross‐sectional study, from January 2011 to December 2012. The secretions of nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed in children younger than 21 years with acute respiratory infections. Patients were treated at the Grupo em Defesa da Criança Com Câncer (Grendacc) and University Hospital (HU), Jundiaí, SP. The rapid test was used for detection of influenza virus (Kit Biotrin, Inc. Ireland), and real‐time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (FTD, Respiratory pathogens, multiplex Fast Trade Kit, Malta) for detection of influenza virus (H1N1, B), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parechovirus, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, and human coronavirus. The prevalence of viral infection was estimated and association tests were used (χ2 or Fisher's exact test). Results 104 samples of nasopharyngeal aspirate and blood were analyzed. The median age was 12 ± 5.2 years, 51% males, 68% whites, 32% had repeated ARIs, 32% prior antibiotic use, 19.8% cough, and 8% contact with ARIs. A total of 94.3% were in good general status. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (42.3%) was the most prevalent neoplasia. Respiratory viruses were detected in 50 samples: rhinoviruses (23.1%), respiratory syncytial virus AB (8.7%), and coronavirus (6.8%). Co‐detection occurred in 19% of cases with 2 viruses and in 3% of those with 3 viruses, and was more frequent between rhinovirus and coronavirus 43. Fever in neutropenic patients was observed in 13%, of which four (30.7) were positive for viruses. There were no deaths. Conclusions the prevalence of respiratory viruses was relevant in the infectious episode, with no increase in morbidity and mortality. Viral co‐detection was frequent in patients with cancer and ARIs.

622,Viral respiratory tract infections in the neonatal intensive care unit,"Abstract Introduction Viral respiratory infections cause major morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. We have performed a prospective study in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to determine the incidence of respiratory infections, their impact and the epidemiology and outcome in high risk neonates. Patients and methods From September 2011 to May 2013 a prospective study was conducted in all preterm infants <32 weeks gestational age and in all term newborns admitted to NICU for any pathology that was anticipated to have an admission exceeding two weeks. A nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was collected the first day of life and weekly until discharge for virologic study with polymerase chain reaction. When these babies presented respiratory symptoms a new NPA was collected at this moment. A clinical form was filled by the physician. Results A total of 60 infants were analysed: 30 (50%) had a gestational age <32 weeks and 36 (60%) weighed less than 1500g. We collected a total of 256 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, 24 of them being positive (9.3%). These 24 positive samples corresponded to 13 infants in our cohort (21.6% of the patients). Of them, 9 were symptomatic and had 11 episodes of infection (2 patients had two different episodes with negative control between them). The most frequently identified virus was rhinovirus in (19) 79% of cases. The most frequent clinical data was the presence or increase in apneas (75%) and the need for oxygenotherapy.

623,"A prospective study to assess the burden of influenza-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits among children in Bilbao, Spain (2010–2011)","Abstract Introduction This study was undertaken to estimate the burden of morbidity associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza in children below 15 years of age. Patients and methods Children presenting with acute respiratory infection and/or isolated fever at the Basurto University Hospital, Bilbao, Spain between November 2010 and May 2011 were included in this study (NCT01592799). Two nasopharyngeal secretion samples were taken from each; one for a rapid influenza diagnostic test in the emergency department, and the second for laboratory analysis using real-time polymerase chain reaction and viral culture. Results A total of 501 children were recruited, of whom 91 were hospitalized. Influenza diagnosis was confirmed in 131 children (26.1%); 120 of 410 (29.3%) treated as outpatients and 11 of 91 (12.1%) hospitalized children. A total of 370 of 501 children (73.9%) had no laboratory test positive for influenza. The proportion of subjects with other respiratory viruses was 145/501 (28.9%) cases and co-infection with the influenza virus plus another respiratory virus was detected in 7/501 (1.4%) cases. Influenza virus types were: A (H1N1 and H3N2) 53.2% (67/126); B (Victoria and Yamagata) 46.0% (58/126); A+B 0.8% (1/126). The median direct medical costs associated with each case of laboratory-confirmed influenza was €177.00 (N =131). No significant differences were observed between the medical costs associated with influenza A and B. Conclusion Almost half of the cases were influenza virus B type.

631,Antibodies to Coronaviruses Are Higher in Older Compared with Younger Adults and Binding Antibodies Are More Sensitive than Neutralizing Antibodies in Identifying Coronavirus-Associated Illnesses,"ABSTRACT Problem Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are common causes of respiratory illnesses (RI) despite pre-existing humoral immunity. Methods Sera were obtained near onset of RI and 3 to 4 weeks later as part of a prospective study of 200 subjects evaluated for RI from 2009 to 2013. Antibodies against common HCoV strains were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralization assay comparing older adults with cardiopulmonary diseases (99 subjects) to younger, healthy adults (101 subjects). Virus shedding was detected in respiratory secretions by polymerase chain reaction. Results Of 43 HCoV-associated illnesses, 15 (35%) occurred in 14 older adults (aged ≥ 60 years) and 28 (65%) in 28 younger adults (aged 21 to 40 years). Binding and neutralizing antibodies were higher in older adults. Only 16 (35.7%) of RI with increases in binding antibodies also had increases in neutralizing antibodies to HCoV. Increases in binding antibodies with RI were more frequent than increased neutralizing antibodies and virus shedding, and more frequent in younger compared to older adults. Conclusions Functional neutralizing antibodies were not stimulated as often as binding antibodies, explaining in part a susceptibility to reinfection with HCoV. Monitoring binding antibodies may be more sensitive for serologic detection of HCoV infections. This article is protected by copyright.

637,De-isolating COVID-19 Suspect Cases: A Continuing Challenge,"As of 15 February 2020, Singapore had screened a total of 991 suspect cases for COVID-19, of which 72 cases tested positive, 812 cases tested negative, while the remaining 107 had pending results.(1) Besides optimising sample type to increase yield, (2) the challenge in clinical management of suspect cases lies in deciding whether they may be de-isolated or if further isolation and repeat testing is required. No single indicator may be effectively used to decide on de-isolation of a suspect case. In our series of positive cases, samples from one suspect case only returned positive on the fifth repeated sample (nasopharyngeal swab), on the seventh day of clinical illness. Current evidence suggests that transmission of COVID-19 may be possible even from asymptomatic contacts,(3) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing may not return positive initially. (4) Our suspect case was kept isolated because of a high index of clinical suspicion, with a clinically compatible illness and history of close contact with a laboratory-proven COVID-19 case. While multiplex respiratory virus panels, in general, may be helpful in the evaluation of other viral acute respiratory infections (ARIs), even the detection of an alternate respiratory pathogen may not definitively exclude COVID-19 infection. Dual infections can occur in 10- 20% of viral acute respiratory infections, as has been reported with SARS-CoV and MERSCoV. (5) In our case series, one patient with confirmed COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal aspirate also exhibited clinical symptoms compatible with dengue fever. This was laboratory confirmed by dengue NS1 antigen test.

642,"Clinical Features and Chest CT Manifestations of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Single-Center Study in Shanghai, China","OBJECTIVE. Confronting the new coronavirus infection known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is challenging and requires excluding patients with suspected COVID-19 who actually have other diseases. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical features and CT manifestations of COVID-19 by comparing patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia who presented at a fever observation department in Shanghai, China. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients were retrospectively enrolled in the study from January 19 through February 6, 2020. All patients underwent real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. RESULTS. Eleven patients had RT-PCR test results that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, whereas 22 patients had negative results. No statistical difference in clinical features was observed (p > 0.05), with the exception of leukocyte and platelet counts (p < 0.05). The mean (± SD) interval between onset of symptoms and admission to the fever observation department was 4.40 ± 2.00 and 5.52 ± 4.00 days for patients with positive and negative RT-PCR test results, respectively. The frequency of opacifications in patients with positive results and patients with negative results, respectively, was as follows: ground-glass opacities (GGOs), 100.0% versus 90.9%; mixed GGO, 63.6% versus 72.7%; and consolidation, 54.5% versus 77.3%. In patients with positive RT-PCR results, GGOs were the most commonly observed opacification (seen in 100.0% of patients) and were predominantly located in the peripheral zone (100.0% of patients), compared with patients with negative results (31.8%) (p = 0.05). The median number of affected lung lobes and segments was higher in patients with positive RT-PCR results than in those with negative RT-PCR results (five vs 3.5 affected lobes and 15 vs nine affected segments; p < 0.05). Although the air bronchogram reticular pattern was more frequently seen in patients with positive results, centrilobular nodules were less frequently seen in patients with positive results. CONCLUSION. At the point during the COVID-19 outbreak when this study was performed, imaging patterns of multifocal, peripheral, pure GGO, mixed GGO, or consolidation with slight predominance in the lower lung and findings of more extensive GGO than consolidation on chest CT scans obtained during the first week of illness were considered findings highly suspicious of COVID-19.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.214491939,0.079589763,-0.020855182,-0.124050546,-0.06871534,-0.094771848,-0.14335168199999998,0.142175806,-0.22600620300000002,0.016368614,0.002874642,0.074534052,-0.046322487999999995,0.176590898,-0.056335932000000005,-0.004280643,0.064718636,0.11898655400000001,-0.03677067,-0.023756551,0.022847105,0.022410471,-0.15433354,-0.072381574,-0.005113968,0.100333965,0.135338704,0.006216288,-0.006807987,-0.041265559
644,Construction and evaluation of a novel diagnosis process for 2019-Corona Virus Disease,"Objective: To construct and evaluate a diagnosis process for 2019-Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19).

Their gender, age, onset time were recorded. Take epidemiological history, fever, and the blood lymphocytes decline as clinical indicators, used CT to evaluate the possibility of COVID-19 and range of lung involvement. According to the current national standards, throat swabs of suspected cases were collected and the nucleic acid of COVID-19 was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The Xiangya process was constructed according to multi-index, compared with clinical indicators, CT results and national standards, the efficiency of detecting confirmed cases were verified in the test and verification library. Results: A continuous cohort of 382 adults who screened COVID-19 was included in which 261 cases were in the test library and 121 cases were in the verification library. In the 382 cases, 192 were males (50.3%) and 190 were females (49.7%), with a median age of 35 years (range: 15-92 years). There were 183 cases (47.9%) with epidemiological history, 275 cases (72.0%) with fever, 212 cases (55.5%) with decreased hemolytic lymphocytes, CT positive 114 cases (29.8%), 43 cases (11.3%) with positive CT-COVID-19, and 30 cases (7.9%) with positive throat swab nucleic acid. Compared with clinical indicators, the sensitivity and specificity of CT were 0.950 and 0.704, respectively. The accuracy of CT to make a definite diagnosis was higher than that of epidemiological history, fever, and blood lymph count decline (0.809 vs 0.660, 0.532, 0.596, P=0.001, 0.002, 0.003, respectively). The sensitivity of this process and the program recommended by the Health Commission all were high (all were 1.000) , and the specificity and accuracy of the process were higher than the program recommended by the Health Commission (0.872 vs 0.765, 0.778 vs 0.592, both P<0.001). The CT-COVID-19 would have reduced the missed diagnosis rate caused by false negative of nucleic acid test (31 vs 64, difference rate 51.6%), the positive rate of nucleic acid test was 64.5% (20/31). In validation library, the specificity and accuracy of the Xiangya process was 0.967, the positive rate of nucleic acid test was 76.9% (10/13). Conclusions: The Xiangya process can predict the nucleic acid test results of COVID-19 well, and can be applied as a reliable basis for confirmed cases detection in adults and adolescent (≥12 years) in areas other than Hubei during the epidemic period of COVID-19. The cohort size needs to be increased for further validation.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.10960114800000001,0.03687865,0.01732601,-0.077643801,-0.053484961,-0.010503268999999999,-0.042603137,0.069287628,-0.069048934,-0.030003828,0.02775043,0.052458125999999994,-0.033753583,-0.075680225,0.001027234,0.03040082,-0.033419288,0.067857136,-0.03582621,-0.069626255,-0.089621729,0.053295585,-0.148217853,-0.131846353,0.001476476,0.155848155,0.1117931,0.073223518,-0.030515287999999998,-0.035055684
647,Persistence and clearance of viral RNA in 2019 novel coronavirus disease rehabilitation patients,"Background: A patient&rsquo;s infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in different body fluids, secretions, and excreta. The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear. This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence. Methods: The clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients&rsquo; oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed. Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs. The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed. Results: In the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study. In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0&ndash;62.0) years were analyzed. After in-hospital treatment, patients&rsquo; inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition. The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0&ndash;11.0) days. By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients&rsquo; stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0&ndash;16.0) days after symptom onset. Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0&ndash;4.0) days. Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients&rsquo; urine specimens after throat swabs were negative. Using a multiple linear regression model ( F =2.669, P =0.044, and adjusted R 2 =0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients&rsquo; stools ( t =-2.699, P =0.010). The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs 8.0 days, respectively; t =2.550, P =0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs 11 days, respectively; t =4.631, P &lt;0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results ( P &gt;0.05). Conclusions: In brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients&rsquo; stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence. Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease. The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.129467883,0.03345718,-0.076609243,-0.034171076,-0.070454845,-0.11696555,-0.083178316,0.149930671,-0.225470363,0.055988197,0.056516194000000006,0.02248196,-0.046327713,0.161356625,-0.009619525,-0.012068357,-0.001987017,0.083585,0.034187802999999996,-0.020805116000000002,-0.059619791,0.015937748,-0.200740526,-0.097420263,-0.038240731,0.030994657999999998,0.14653354400000002,-0.021369667000000002,-0.043688622999999996,0.017148112
650,Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy: analysis of nine cases,"Objective To evaluate the clinical characteristics and pregnant outcomes of gravidae with COVID-19. Methods This study involved nine gravidae with COVID-19 admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 22 to February 1, 2020. Their clinical data, including epidemiological history, clinical symptoms, laboratory examinations, chest CT, treatment, delivery mode, and pregnancy outcomes, were analyzed retrospectively. Descriptive analysis was applied in this study. Results (1) Among the nine cases, five were admitted in the third trimester and four in the second trimester. The median incubation period of COVID-19 was 8 (1-14) d. Fever was presented in all cases on admission, and the other commonly seen symptoms were cough (seven cases) and diarrhea (five cases). Other signs and symptoms were also reported, including shortness of breath, myalgia and fatigue (four cases in each), nasal obstruction, pharyngalgia, chest pain, and headache/dizziness (three cases in each), rash (two cases), and chills and expectoration (one case in each). The most common laboratory abnormalities were a decreased number of lymphocytes (seven cases) and elevated C-reactive protein (six cases). Chest CT scans were performed in seven women, and all showed patchy areas or ground-glass opacity in both lungs. Oligohydramnios was detected in only one case at 37 +5 weeks, which was 7 d after the diagnosis of COVID-19. (2) All nine cases received empiric antibiotic and antiviral therapy with Chinese medicine as adjuvant treatment. Eight patients required oxygen inhalation, and seven were treated with glucocorticoid. One case received immunotherapy due to worsening conditions. (3) Four of the nine cases had delivered, including three cesarean sections and one spontaneous vaginal preterm birth after premature rupture of membranes, and the mother was transferred to the intensive care unit 2 d after delivery due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. One case was terminated at 26 gestational weeks. Of the four neonates, there were two term and two premature babies, and one preterm babies was small-for-gestational-age. No neonatal asphyxia was observed. Serial real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed negative results in the detection of 2019-novel coronavirus in all samples obtained from amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood, neonatal nasopharynx, breast milk, and vagina. Maternal conditions were all stable in all cases, including the four continuing pregnancy, and the terminated ones, except the case mentioned above. Conclusions There is no distinguishable clinical feature between pregnant and non-pregnant COVID-19 patients. Currently, the evidence for vertical transmission of COVID-19 needs further studies with larger size of examples, but pregnancy may deteriorate COVID-19. Given that COVID-19 may have adverse effects on perinatal outcomes, it's recommended to take positive and effective measures for COVID-19 women in the third trimester.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.117176009,0.041027033,-0.063331597,-0.121842255,-0.06772771799999999,-0.000584917,-0.04707626400000001,0.09715178,-0.058412723,-0.019570496,0.032704079,0.046993840999999995,-0.040237476,-0.035119323,0.025540722999999998,0.035535405,-0.025139162000000003,0.095827833,-0.014785321,-0.050718307000000004,-0.059486112,0.06534659799999999,-0.223277703,-0.112515017,0.029942049,0.148784107,0.139383688,0.07342161900000001,0.013295208999999999,-0.059364679000000004
657,Surveillance recommendations based on an exploratory analysis of respiratory syncytial virus reports derived from the European Influenza Surveillance System,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important pathogen that can cause severe illness in infants and young children. In this study, we assessed whether data on RSV collected by the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS) could be used to build an RSV surveillance system in Europe. METHODS: Influenza and RSV data for the 2002–2003 winter season were analysed for England, France, the Netherlands and Scotland. Data from sentinel physician networks and other sources, mainly hospitals, were collected. Respiratory specimens were tested for influenza and RSV mainly by virus culture and polymerase chain reaction amplification. RESULTS: Data on RSV were entered timely into the EISS database. RSV contributed noticeably to influenza-like illness: in England sentinel RSV detections were common in all age groups, but particularly in young children with 20 (40.8%) of the total number of sentinel swabs testing positive for RSV. Scotland and France also reported the highest percentages of RSV detections in the 0–4 year age group, respectively 10.3% (N = 29) and 12.2% (N = 426). In the Netherlands, RSV was detected in one person aged over 65 years. CONCLUSION: We recommend that respiratory specimens collected in influenza surveillance are also tested systematically for RSV and emphasize the use of both community derived data and data from hospitals for RSV surveillance. RSV data from the EISS have been entered in a timely manner and we consider that the EISS model can be used to develop an RSV surveillance system equivalent to the influenza surveillance in Europe.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.20209517899999999,-0.14280294300000002,-0.070482145,0.142224298,0.040997871,0.050920244,-0.024689766000000002,-0.129660941,0.137023171,-0.16240903199999998,0.03527181,-0.088161721,-0.168902258,-0.103356619,-0.087666873,0.004855521,-0.040359768,0.063113056,-0.017252685,-0.047869817,-0.004615522,-0.14794116300000001,0.035702772,-0.11065212199999999,0.123652519,-0.19420257600000002,0.26364540000000003,0.186906405,-0.053604424000000005,0.07456024900000001
675,RNA viruses in community-acquired childhood pneumonia in semi-urban Nepal; a cross-sectional study,"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is among the main causes of illness and death in children <5 years of age. There is a need to better describe the epidemiology of viral community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in developing countries. METHODS: From July 2004 to June 2007, we examined nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from 2,230 cases of pneumonia (World Health Organization criteria) in children 2 to 35 months old recruited in a randomized trial of zinc supplementation at a field clinic in Bhaktapur, Nepal. The specimens were examined for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus type A (InfA) and B (InfB), parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3 (PIV1, PIV2, and PIV3), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) using a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. RESULTS: We identified 919 virus isolates in 887 (40.0%) of the 2,219 NPA specimens with a valid PCR result, of which 334 (15.1%) yielded RSV, 164 (7.4%) InfA, 129 (5.8%) PIV3, 98 (4.4%) PIV1, 93 (4.2%) hMPV, 84 (3.8%) InfB, and 17 (0.8%) PIV2. CAP occurred in an epidemic pattern with substantial temporal variation during the three years of study. The largest peaks of pneumonia occurrence coincided with peaks of RSV infection, which occurred in epidemics during the rainy season and in winter. The monthly number of RSV infections was positively correlated with relative humidity (r(s )= 0.40, P = 0.01), but not with temperature or rainfall. An hMPV epidemic occurred during one of the three winter seasons and the monthly number of hMPV cases was also associated with relative humidity (r(s )= 0.55, P = 0.0005). CONCLUSION: Respiratory RNA viruses were detected from NPA in 40% of CAP cases in our study. The most commonly isolated viruses were RSV, InfA, and PIV3. RSV infections contributed substantially to the observed CAP epidemics. The occurrence of viral CAP in this community seemed to reflect more or less overlapping micro-epidemics with several respiratory viruses, highlighting the challenges of developing and implementing effective public health control measures.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.21206328600000002,-0.12496153199999999,-0.077140783,0.089328561,0.025563809,-0.079197539,0.012532015,-0.067718243,0.062386998,-0.027338737000000002,0.008170963,-0.070495107,-0.111136184,-0.049752185,-0.10419072900000001,-0.067393998,-0.044415092,0.129957926,-0.12107215199999999,0.092394951,0.042661414,0.088304953,0.131981365,-0.029295721,0.066102182,-0.09399736300000001,0.07173894900000001,0.06787094099999999,0.047574767999999996,0.002857841
679,"Genetics, Recombination and Clinical Features of Human Rhinovirus Species C (HRV-C) Infections; Interactions of HRV-C with Other Respiratory Viruses","To estimate the frequency, molecular epidemiological and clinical associations of infection with the newly described species C variants of human rhinoviruses (HRV), 3243 diagnostic respiratory samples referred for diagnostic testing in Edinburgh were screened using a VP4-encoding region-based selective polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HRV-C along with parallel PCR testing for 13 other respiratory viruses. HRV-C was the third most frequently detected behind respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus, with 141 infection episodes detected among 1885 subjects over 13 months (7.5%). Infections predominantly targeted the very young (median age 6–12 months; 80% of infections in those <2 years), occurred throughout the year but with peak incidence in early winter months. HRV-C was detected significantly more frequently among subjects with lower (LRT) and upper respiratory tract (URT) disease than controls without respiratory symptoms; HRV-C mono-infections were the second most frequently detected virus (behind RSV) in both disease presentations (6.9% and 7.8% of all cases respectively). HRV variants were classified by VP4/VP2 sequencing into 39 genotypically defined types, increasing the current total worldwide to 60. Through sequence comparisons of the 5′untranslated region (5′UTR), the majority grouped with species A (n = 96; 68%, described as HRV-Ca), the remainder forming a phylogenetically distinct 5′UTR group (HRV-Cc). Multiple and bidirectional recombination events between HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc variants and with HRV species A represents the most parsimonious explanation for their interspersed phylogeny relationships in the VP4/VP2-encoding region. No difference in age distribution, seasonality or disease associations was identified between HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc variants. HRV-C-infected subjects showed markedly reduced detection frequencies of RSV and other respiratory viruses, providing evidence for a major interfering effect of HRV-C on susceptibility to other respiratory virus infections. HRV-C's disease associations, its prevalence and evidence for interfering effects on other respiratory viruses mandates incorporation of rhinoviruses into future diagnostic virology screening.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.129646894,-0.091567804,-0.039626281,-0.011809688999999998,0.070668155,-0.07828075400000001,0.083719671,-0.04978635,0.063810013,0.013939466000000001,0.007125499,-0.051613936,-0.027699922999999998,-0.026695375,0.036513721,0.006326854,-0.016846991999999998,-0.024783861,0.081620487,-0.078869158,0.038835294,-0.197398236,-0.11582370300000001,0.13529552,-0.101306914,0.148108086,-0.09277784900000001,0.012276272,0.133469557,0.321774302
684,Collection by trained pediatricians or parents of mid-turbinate nasal flocked swabs for the detection of influenza viruses in childhood,"This study evaluated the efficiency of pediatric mid-turbinate nasal flocked swabs used by parents in 203 children aged 6 months to 5 years with signs and symptoms of respiratory disease. Two nasal samples were collected from each child in a randomised sequence: one by a trained pediatrician and one by a parent. The real-time polymerase chain reaction influenza virus detection rates were similar in the samples collected using the two methods (Cohen's kappa = 0.86), as were the cycle threshold values. In comparison with the pediatrician-collected samples, the sensitivity and specificity of the parental collections were respectively 89.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 77.8-100%) and 97.7% (95% CI: 95.5-100%), and the positive and negative predictive values were respectively 86.2% (95% CI: 73.7-95.1%) and 98.2% (95% CI: 96.4-100%). The children were significantly more satisfied with the parental collections (median values ± standard deviation, 1.59 ± 0.55 vs 3.51 ± 0.36; p < 0.0001). These findings show that mid-turbinate nasal flocked swabs specifically designed for infants and children can be used by parents without reducing the influenza virus detection rate. Moreover, the direct involvement of parents significantly increases patient acceptance, thus simplifying collection and suggesting that this novel swab design should be considered for epidemiological surveys and vaccine efficacy studies.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.15339147,-0.063605043,0.018316098,-0.006357764,0.023295902,0.002707125,-0.036460163999999996,-0.044324379000000004,-0.015839048999999997,-0.120134882,0.037422647999999996,0.061430646,-0.111335196,-0.09161671699999999,-0.043774269000000005,0.101647645,-0.092901859,-0.126621239,0.09817424300000001,-0.10281753199999999,-0.193390098,0.079556924,0.04449129,0.050328088,0.015811163,-0.016205888999999998,-0.010266418000000001,-0.21533351899999997,-0.08151267400000001,-0.064563392
693,Flocked nasal swab versus nasopharyngeal aspirate for detection of respiratory tract viruses in immunocompromised adults: a matched comparative study,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have compared nasal swabs to the more invasive nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) for detection of respiratory viruses. Mostly, the comparisons have been performed on immunocompetent children with upper respiratory tract symptoms. The results range from a relatively poor sensitivity for the swabs to an even higher sensitivity than for the NPA. We aimed to investigate the sensitivity of a flocked nasal swab (fNS) on immunocompromised adults with febrile neutropenia. METHODS: During 16 months, adults with a hematological disorder presenting with febrile neutropenia were enrolled in the study. Paired samples of the fNS and NPA were collected in the outer part of the nasal cavity and the nasopharynx, respectively. The samples were analyzed regarding a panel of 15 respiratory viruses by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, as an indirect measure of cell yield by either method, the copy number of the human beta actin gene was also determined. Cohen's kappa was calculated as a measure of agreement of the results obtained from either method. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for comparison of cell yield. RESULTS: A total of 98 paired samples from a total of 89 patients were collected. Twenty of the pairs had virus detected in at least one of the specimens; 11 in both, 7 in NPA only, and 2 in fNS only. For the fNS, the overall sensitivity for any virus and for rhinovirus only was 65% and 78%, respectively. NPA was significantly superior to the fNS in collecting epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: We found the overall sensitivity of 65% to be too low to replace NPA with this sampling technique in this patient category.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.133844685,-0.031851106000000004,0.033619995,-0.015737307,0.0059079,-0.061792415,0.011272103,-0.019890879,-0.005566504,0.002017367,-0.015453268000000001,-0.018318027,-0.020665842,0.01745882,0.024774416,-0.005440349000000001,-0.003698284,-0.076066462,0.063279258,-0.06840176099999999,-0.018101575,-0.040214999,0.019562908,-0.0006130619999999999,0.01964008,0.035005939,-0.027811192000000002,0.020298755,-0.045531786,-0.062607597

The aim of this study was to retrospectively examine the characteristics of all subjects admitted to the Unit of Infectious Diseases with symptoms indicating H1N1 infection, and to identify any differences between H1N1 positive or negative patients. Patients from the ED (emergency department) with flu-like symptoms (sore throat, cough, rhinorhea, or nasal congestion) and fever >37.5°C were admitted in the Unit of Infectious diseases and gave pharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs. Swabs were tested with real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR). FINDINGS: Patients were divided into two groups. Group A comprised 33 H1N1 positive patients and Group B (control group) comprised of 27 H1N1 negative patients. The two groups did not differ in terms of patient age, co-morbidities, length of hospitalization, temperature elevation, hypoxemia, as well as renal and liver function. There were also no significant differences in severity on admission. C-reactive protein (CRP) (mean 12.8 vs. 5.74) and white blood count (WBC) (mean 10.528 vs. 7.114) were significantly higher in group B than in group A upon admission. Obesity was noted in 8 patients of Group A (mean 31.67) and 14 patients of Group B (mean 37.78). Body mass index (BMI) was lower in H1N1 positive than in H1N1 negative patients (mean 31.67 vs. 37.78, respectively; p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients in both groups were young male adults. CRP, WBC and BMI were higher among H1N1 negative patients. Finally, clinical course of patients in both groups was mild and uneventful.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.193299931,-0.022688525,-0.08250286,-0.10072437599999999,-0.047806323,0.035718606,-0.149394315,0.13440861099999998,-0.207604029,-0.030335424,-0.021065893,0.055021052,-0.048698927999999995,0.104084535,-0.07355086,0.005166422,0.037344687,0.06810021200000001,-0.013289051999999999,0.0063819340000000006,0.017192659,-0.09790422900000001,-0.090946791,-0.07149343799999999,-0.103404021,0.019966424,-0.007555934,-0.031958071,-0.060816117999999995,0.058270445
695,"Viral Etiology of Influenza-Like Illnesses in Antananarivo, Madagascar, July 2008 to June 2009","BACKGROUND: In Madagascar, despite an influenza surveillance established since 1978, little is known about the etiology and prevalence of viruses other than influenza causing influenza-like illnesses (ILIs). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From July 2008 to June 2009, we collected respiratory specimens from patients who presented ILIs symptoms in public and private clinics in Antananarivo (the capital city of Madagascar). ILIs were defined as body temperature ≥38°C and cough and at least two of the following symptoms: sore throat, rhinorrhea, headache and muscular pain, for a maximum duration of 3 days. We screened these specimens using five multiplex real time Reverse Transcription and/or Polymerase Chain Reaction assays for detection of 14 respiratory viruses. We detected respiratory viruses in 235/313 (75.1%) samples. Overall influenza virus A (27.3%) was the most common virus followed by rhinovirus (24.8%), RSV (21.2%), adenovirus (6.1%), coronavirus OC43 (6.1%), influenza virus B (3.9%), parainfluenza virus-3 (2.9%), and parainfluenza virus-1 (2.3%). Co-infections occurred in 29.4% (69/235) of infected patients and rhinovirus was the most detected virus (27.5%). Children under 5 years were more likely to have one or more detectable virus associated with their ILI. In this age group, compared to those ≥5 years, the risk of detecting more than one virus was higher (OR = 1.9), as was the risk of detecting of RSV (OR = 10.1) and adenovirus (OR = 4.7). While rhinovirus and adenovirus infections occurred year round, RSV, influenza virus A and coronavirus OC43 had defined period of circulation. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we found that respiratory viruses play an important role in ILIs in the Malagasy community, particularly in children under 5 years old. These data provide a better understanding of the viral etiology of outpatients with ILI and describe for the first time importance of these viruses in different age group and their period of circulation.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.275951434,-0.152846561,-0.08958039400000001,0.200717809,0.087230051,0.09144143199999999,-0.053511974000000004,-0.051758103,0.011644128,-0.057380405,0.008541813,-0.055465043,-0.006624496999999999,0.005924331999999999,0.018042941,-0.023779062000000004,5.07e-05,-0.057559031,0.056630739000000006,0.010918421999999999,-0.007060705,-0.051614174000000006,0.000261177,0.0035124490000000004,0.019883307,-0.019863147,0.076957117,0.100848236,-0.054742487,-0.025881341000000002
696,Human Rhinovirus Infections in Rural Thailand: Epidemiological Evidence for Rhinovirus as Both Pathogen and Bystander,"BACKGROUND: We describe human rhinovirus (HRV) detections in SaKaeo province, Thailand. METHODS: From September 1, 2003–August 31, 2005, we tested hospitalized patients with acute lower respiratory illness and outpatient controls without fever or respiratory symptoms for HRVs with polymerase chain reaction and molecularly-typed select HRVs. We compared HRV detection among hospitalized patients and controls and estimated enrollment adjusted incidence. RESULTS: HRVs were detected in 315 (16%) of 1919 hospitalized patients and 27 (9.6%) of 280 controls. Children had the highest frequency of HRV detections (hospitalized: <1 year: 29%, 1–4 year: 29%, ≥65 years: 9%; controls: <1 year: 24%, 1–4 year: 14%, ≥65 years: 2.8%). Enrollment adjusted hospitalized HRV detection rates were highest among persons aged <1 year (1038/100,000 persons/year), 1–4 years (457), and ≥65 years (71). All three HRV species were identified, HRV-A was the most common species in most age groups including children aged <1 year (61%) and all adult age groups. HRV-C was the most common species in the 1–4 year (51%) and 5–19 year age groups (54%). Compared to controls, hospitalized adults (≥19 years) and children were more likely to have HRV detections (odds ratio [OR]: 4.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5, 15.8; OR: 2.0, CI: 1.2, 3.3, respectively) and hospitalized children were more likely to have HRV-A (OR 1.7, CI: 0.8, 3.5) or HVR-C (OR 2.7, CI: 1.2, 5.9) detection. CONCLUSIONS: HRV rates were high among hospitalized children and the elderly but asymptomatic children also had substantial HRV detection. HRV (all species), and HRV-A and HRV-C detections were epidemiologically-associated with hospitalized illness. Treatment or prevention modalities effective against HRV could reduce hospitalizations due to HRV in Thailand.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.176591296,-0.10674631300000001,-0.083292832,-0.05652675,0.04200069,-0.092800059,0.062955103,-0.041784643999999996,0.014468683999999999,-0.065527171,-0.014101997,0.0213074,-0.088839222,-0.052141277,-0.026469107000000002,0.078677948,-0.054957358,-0.038853315,0.07306941,-0.071087376,-0.074340117,-0.061443017,-0.07644373900000001,0.145481787,-0.140057169,0.18623457399999999,-0.14993400099999998,-0.047505717,0.128993603,0.31968030399999997
698,"Access to a polymerase chain reaction assay method targeting 13 respiratory viruses can reduce antibiotics: a randomised, controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Viral respiratory infections are common worldwide and range from completely benign disease to life-threatening illness. Symptoms can be unspecific, and an etiologic diagnosis is rarely established because of a lack of suitable diagnostic tools. Improper use of antibiotics is common in this setting, which is detrimental in light of the development of bacterial resistance. It has been suggested that the use of diagnostic tests could reduce antibiotic prescription rates. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether access to a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay panel for etiologic diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) would have an impact on antibiotic prescription rate in primary care clinical settings. METHODS: Adult patients with symptoms of ARTI were prospectively included. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were analysed by using a multiplex real-time PCR method targeting thirteen viruses and two bacteria. Patients were recruited at 12 outpatient units from October 2006 through April 2009, and samples were collected on the day of inclusion (initial visit) and after 10 days (follow-up visit). Patients were randomised in an open-label treatment protocol to receive a rapid or delayed result (on the following day or after eight to twelve days). The primary outcome measure was the antibiotic prescription rate at the initial visit, and the secondary outcome was the total antibiotic prescription rate during the study period. RESULTS: A total sample of 447 patients was randomised. Forty-one were excluded, leaving 406 patients for analysis. In the group of patients randomised for a rapid result, 4.5% (9 of 202) of patients received antibiotics at the initial visit, compared to 12.3% (25 of 204) (P = 0.005) of patients in the delayed result group. At follow-up, there was no significant difference between the groups: 13.9% (28 of 202) in the rapid result group and 17.2% (35 of 204) in the delayed result group (P = 0.359), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Access to a rapid method for etiologic diagnosis of ARTIs may reduce antibiotic prescription rates at the initial visit in an outpatient setting. To sustain this effect, however, it seems necessary to better define how to follow and manage the patient according to the result of the test, which warrants further investigation.

699,PCR Improves Diagnostic Yield from Lung Aspiration in Malawian Children with Radiologically Confirmed Pneumonia,"BACKGROUND: Accurate data on childhood pneumonia aetiology are essential especially from regions where mortality is high, in order to inform case-management guidelines and the potential of prevention strategies such as bacterial conjugate vaccines. Yield from blood culture is low, but lung aspirate culture provides a higher diagnostic yield. We aimed to determine if diagnostic yield could be increased further by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae b) and viruses in lung aspirate fluid. METHODS: A total of 95 children with radiological focal, lobar or segmental consolidation had lung aspirate performed and sent for bacterial culture and for PCR for detection of bacteria, viruses and Pneumocystis jirovecii. In children with a pneumococcal aetiology, pneumococcal bacterial loads were calculated in blood and lung aspirate fluid. RESULTS: Blood culture identified a bacterial pathogen in only 8 patients (8%). With the addition of PCR on lung aspirate samples, causative pathogens (bacterial, viral, pneumocystis) were identified singly or as co-infections in 59 children (62%). The commonest bacterial organism was S.pneumoniae (41%), followed by H. influenzae b (6%), and the commonest virus identified was adenovirus (16%), followed by human bocavirus (HBoV) (4%), either as single or co-infection. CONCLUSIONS: In a select group of African children, lung aspirate PCR significantly improves diagnostic yield.

702,"During the summer 2009 outbreak of ""swine flu"" in Scotland what respiratory pathogens were diagnosed as H1N1/2009?","BACKGROUND: During the April-July 2009 outbreak of H1N1/2009 in scotland the West of Scotland Specialist Virology Centre (WoSSVC) in Glasgow tested > 16 000 clinical samples for H1N1/2009. Most were from patients clinically diagnosed with H1N1/2009. Out of these, 9% were positive. This study sought to determine what respiratory pathogens were misdiagnosed as cases of H1N1/2009 during this time. METHODS: We examined the results from 3247 samples which were sent to the laboratory during April-July 2009. All were from patients clinically diagnosed as having H1N1/2009 (based on accepted criteria) and all were given a full respiratory screen using real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) assays. RESULTS: In total, respiratory pathogens were detected in 27.9% (95% confidence interval, 26.3-29.5%) of the samples submitted. Numerous pathogens were detected, the most common of which were rhinovirus (8.9% (95% confidence interval, 7.9-9.9%)), parainfluenza 1 (1.9% (95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.4%)) and 3 (4.1% (95% confidence interval, 3.3-4.9%)), and adenovirus ((3.5% (95% confidence interval, 2.9-4.2%)). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the problems of using a clinical algorithm to detect H1N1/2009. Clinicians frequently misdiagnosed common respiratory pathogens as H1N1/2009 during the spring/summer outbreak in Scotland.

703,Severe community-acquired adenovirus pneumonia in an immunocompetent 44-year-old woman: a case report and review of the literature,"INTRODUCTION: This case report describes a rare condition: community-acquired adenovirus pneumonia in an immunocompetent adult. The diagnosis was achieved by using a multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and highlights the usefulness of these novel molecular diagnostic techniques in patients hospitalized with acute respiratory illness. We also performed a literature search for previously published cases and present a summary of the clinical, laboratory and radiological features of this condition. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old immunocompetent Caucasian woman was admitted to our hospital with an acute febrile respiratory illness associated with a rash. Her blood tests were non-specifically abnormal, and tests for bacterial pathogens were negative. Her condition rapidly deteriorated while she was in our hospital and required mechanical ventilation and inotropic support. A multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay performed on respiratory specimens to detect respiratory viruses was negative for influenza but positive for adenovirus DNA. The patient recovered on supportive treatment, and antibiotics were stopped after 5 days. CONCLUSIONS: Community-acquired adenovirus pneumonia in immunocompetent adult civilians presents as a non-specific acute febrile respiratory illness followed by the abrupt onset of respiratory failure, often requiring mechanical ventilation. Its laboratory and radiological features are typical of viral infections but also are non-specific. Novel multiplex real-time RT-PCR testing for respiratory viruses enabled us to rapidly make the diagnosis in this case. The new technology could be used more widely in patients with acute respiratory illness and has potential utility for rationalization of the use of antibiotics and improving infection control measures.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.25738763600000003,0.039009785,0.025279032000000003,0.057670865,-0.049939423,-0.055461313,-0.040283359,0.058232373,-0.049363490999999995,0.04958708,-0.017563604,-0.02788645,0.060637450999999995,0.028890423999999998,0.010532663999999999,-0.043721727,0.026391013999999997,0.021741198,-0.014130252,-0.021692556,0.031416334,0.015108885,-0.029750767999999997,-0.06047493599999999,0.004240915,0.020883818999999998,-0.009236634,0.001083522,0.028098185,-0.08426417900000001
713,Etiology and Clinical Characterization of Respiratory Virus Infections in Adult Patients Attending an Emergency Department in Beijing,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) represent a serious global health burden. To date, few reports have addressed the prevalence of respiratory viruses (RVs) in adults with ARTIs attending an emergency department (ED). Therefore, the potential impact of respiratory virus infections on such patients remains unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To determine the epidemiological and clinical profiles of common and recently discovered respiratory viruses in adults with ARTIs attending an ED in Beijing, a 1-year consecutive study was conducted from May, 2010, to April, 2011. Nose and throat swab samples from 416 ARTI patients were checked for 13 respiratory viruses using multiple reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) assays for common respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses (Flu) A, B, and adenoviruses (ADVs), picornaviruses (PICs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1–3, combined with real-time RT-PCR for human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human coronaviruses (HCoVs, -OC43, -229E, -NL63, and -HKU1). Viral pathogens were detected in 52.88% (220/416) of patient samples, and 7.21% (30/416) of patients tested positive for more than one virus. PICs (17.79%) were the dominant agents detected, followed by FluA (16.11%), HCoVs (11.78%), and ADV (11.30%). HMPV, PIVs, and FluB were also detected (<3%), but not RSV. The total prevalence and the dominant virus infections detected differed significantly between ours and a previous report. Co-infection rates were high for HCoV-229E (12/39, 30.76%), PIC (22/74, 29.73%), ADV (12/47, 25.53%) and FluA (15/67, 22.39%). Different patterns of clinical symptoms were associated with different respiratory viruses. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of RV involvement in adults with ARTIs attending an ED in China differs from that previously reported. The high prevalence of viruses (PIC, FluA, HCoVs and ADV) reported here strongly highlight the need for the development of safe and effective therapeutic approaches for these viruses.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.257926806,-0.081980407,-0.062227657,0.115976312,0.11221765199999999,-0.07214968,0.045329087000000004,-0.033732902,0.04057447,0.006993561999999999,-0.003524457,0.060696645,0.08197296400000001,0.106581766,-0.009260455,-0.060993744,0.014347974,0.027594962,-0.008222887,0.041988239000000004,0.084123006,-0.045312055999999996,-0.018970481,0.008917476,-8.22e-05,-0.015931551000000002,0.022547509,0.021825859,-0.00658828,-0.061571862000000005
714,A Surveillance System to Reduce Transmission of Pandemic H1N1 (2009) Influenza in a 2600-Bed Medical Center,"BACKGROUND: Concerns have been raised about how the transmission of emerging infectious diseases from patients to healthcare workers (HCWs) and vice versa could be recognized and prevented in a timely manner. An effective strategy to block transmission of pandemic H1N1 (2009) influenza in HCWs is important. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An infection control program was implemented to survey and prevent nosocomial outbreaks of H1N1 (2009) influenza at a 2,600-bed, tertiary-care academic hospital. In total, 4,963 employees at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital recorded their temperature and received online education on control practices for influenza infections. Administration records provided vaccination records and occupational characteristics of all HCWs. Early recognition of a pandemic H1N1 (2009) influenza case was followed by a semi-structured questionnaire to analyze possible routes of patient contact, household contact, or unspecified contact. Surveillance spanned August 1, 2009 to January 31, 2010; 51 HCWs were confirmed to have novel H1N1 (2009) influenza by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Prevalence of patient contact, household contact, or unspecified contact infection was 13.7% (7/51), 13.7% (7/51), and 72.5% (37/51), respectively. The prevalence of the novel H1N1 infection was significantly lower among vaccinated HCWs than among unvaccinated HCWs (p<0.001). Higher viral loads in throat swabs were found in HCWs with patient and household contact infection than in those with unspecified contact infection (4.15 vs. 3.53 copies/mL, log(10), p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: A surveillance system with daily temperature recordings and online education for HCWs is important for a low attack rate of H1N1 (2009) influenza transmission before H1N1 (2009) influenza vaccination is available, and the attack rate is further decreased after mass vaccination. Unspecified contact infection rates were significantly higher than that of patient contact and household contact infection, highlighting the need for public education of influenza transmission in addition to hospital infection control.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.10254449199999999,-0.034068673,-0.027407372000000003,0.036617138,-0.043572072,0.22896980100000003,-0.10809602800000001,0.075498831,-0.0045136709999999995,-0.093096333,0.020115658,0.033638587000000005,-0.026279549,-0.023199945,0.018578136000000002,0.05038082,-0.017147516,-0.008233106,-0.030429615,-0.037879732,-0.015130513,-0.024205347999999998,-0.073295526,-0.067391956,-0.063454649,0.036932907,-0.040483432,0.042916324000000006,-0.004956123,0.055159831
720,Respiratory viruses in children hospitalized for acute lower respiratory tract infection in Ghana,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory tract infections are one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality among young children in developing countries. Information on the viral aetiology of acute respiratory infections in developing countries is very limited. The study was done to identify viruses associated with acute lower respiratory tract infection among children less than 5 years. METHOD: Nasopharyngeal samples and blood cultures were collected from children less than 5 years who have been hospitalized for acute lower respiratory tract infection. Viruses and bacteria were identified using Reverse Transcriptase Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction and conventional biochemical techniques. RESULTS: Out of 128 patients recruited, 33(25.88%%, 95%CI: 18.5% to 34.2%) were positive for one or more viruses. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) was detected in 18(14.1%, 95%CI: 8.5% to 21.3%) patients followed by Adenoviruses (AdV) in 13(10.2%, 95%CI: 5.5% to 16.7%), Parainfluenza (PIV type: 1, 2, 3) in 4(3.1%, 95%CI: 0.9% to 7.8%) and influenza B viruses in 1(0.8%, 95%CI: 0.0 to 4.3). Concomitant viral and bacterial co-infection occurred in two patients. There were no detectable significant differences in the clinical signs, symptoms and severity for the various pathogens isolated. A total of 61.1% (22/36) of positive viruses were detected during the rainy season and Respiratory Syncytial Virus was the most predominant. CONCLUSION: The study has demonstrated an important burden of respiratory viruses as major causes of childhood acute respiratory infection in a tertiary health institution in Ghana. The data addresses a need for more studies on viral associated respiratory tract infection.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.36131346799999997,-0.133119653,-0.14863064199999998,0.080963617,0.044795323,-0.107375495,0.022226972999999997,-0.062596521,0.013773135,0.016445532,0.009914419,-0.006555536999999999,-0.008329037,-0.009310649,-0.030109072999999997,0.017919355,-0.054798930999999995,-0.126115762,0.09360754199999999,0.045627031,-0.120172995,0.035883257,0.023647462,0.10583051,0.01188367,-0.037679606000000004,-0.037428813,-0.18508480800000002,-0.073796317,-0.089742191
732,Diagnostic value of respiratory virus detection in symptomatic children using real-time PCR,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory tract infections are an important public health problem. Sensitive and rapid diagnostic techniques have been developed and are used in daily clinical practice. Here we evaluate the clinical relevance of detecting 20 common respiratory pathogens by molecular methods in a general pediatric clinic. METHODS: Nasopharynx samples of children < 18 years of age with respiratory symptoms referred to a general pediatric clinic were tested for the presence of 19 viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, using real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Of 177 patients included in this retrospective study, 73% were positive for at least one virus. Respiratory syncytial virus (36.6%) and human rhinovirus (24%) were most frequently detected. Patients in whom a respiratory virus or Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected, were younger (6 versus 24 months; p < 0.001) and more often hospitalized (116 versus 34; p = 0.001) than patients in whom no respiratory pathogen was detected. Also they were more likely to present with feeding problems, dyspnea, rhinorrhea and wheezing (all p < 0.05) than patients without a respiratory pathogen. In the majority of cases, clinicians did not change their antibiotic management after detecting a viral respiratory pathogen. No difference in mean Ct value was found between patients with one respiratory pathogen and those with >1 respiratory pathogen (30.5 versus 31.2; p = 0.573). CONCLUSION: Routine testing of common respiratory pathogens could lead to a better understanding of their role in disease in children with respiratory symptoms.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.33913832899999996,-0.076250592,-0.096315774,0.030565586000000002,-0.0030097329999999997,-0.145568332,0.012440192,0.031554944,-0.03372953,0.129144431,-0.035367056,-0.040631341,0.06859836700000001,-0.002629742,0.0349357,-0.04876599400000001,0.037804447000000005,-0.02504571,0.057524988,0.023577152999999997,0.031592773,-0.065980277,0.019358535,-0.04317663,0.053923457,0.053915381,-0.04607556,0.03909628,0.028442613,-0.09852249699999999
734,Respiratory Viruses in Hospitalized Children with Influenza-Like Illness during the H1n1 2009 Pandemic in Sweden,"BACKGROUND: The swine-origin influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic of 2009 had a slower spread in Europe than expected. The human rhinovirus (HRV) has been suggested to have delayed the pandemic through viral interference. The importance of co-infections over time during the pandemic and in terms of severity of the disease needs to be assessed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate respiratory viruses and specifically the presence of co-infections with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (H1N1) in hospitalized children during the H1N1 pandemic. A secondary aim was to investigate if co-infections were associated with severity of disease. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 502 children with influenza-like illness admitted to inpatient care at a pediatric hospital in Stockholm, Sweden during the 6 months spanning the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. Respiratory samples were analyzed for a panel of 16 viruses by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: One or more viruses were detected in 61.6% of the samples. Of these, 85.4% were single infections and 14.6% co-infections (2–4 viruses). The number of co-infections increased throughout the study period. H1N1 was found in 83 (16.5%) children and of these 12 (14.5%) were co-infections. HRV and H1N1 circulated to a large extent at the same time and 6.0% of the H1N1-positive children were also positive for HRV. There was no correlation between co-infections and severity of disease in children with H1N1. CONCLUSIONS: Viral co-infections were relatively common in H1N1 infected hospitalized children and need to be considered when estimating morbidity attributed to H1N1. Population-based longitudinal studies with repeated sampling are needed to improve the understanding of the importance of co-infections and viral interference.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.204191289,-0.130401347,-0.050837433,0.127586568,0.0070950580000000004,0.11074253,-0.019358964,-0.035744292999999996,0.030529585,-0.043696606,0.024294952999999998,0.002559135,0.006654905,-0.042548534000000006,0.055500296,0.013406471000000001,-0.017470616,-0.023447491,-0.008816368,-0.07850845099999999,-0.016421131000000002,0.019211213,-0.100883742,0.016854911,-0.140732689,0.128655905,-0.103024096,-0.007458162,0.10776607099999999,0.161750521
737,Detection of Bocavirus in Children Suffering from Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in Saudi Arabia,"Human bocavirus (HBoV) was recently discovered in children with respiratory distress and/or diarrhea. To our knowledge, no previous study has reported the existence of bocavirus in Saudi Arabia. Swabs samples from 80 children with respiratory tract infections were examined for the presence of HBoV. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used as a sensitive method to detect the HBoV. Direct gene sequencing was used to determine the genotype of the detected virus isolates. HBoV was detected in 22.5% of the examined patients. The NP1 partial gene sequence from all patients showed that the circulated strains were related to HBoV-1 genotype. Most of HBoV infected patients showed evidence of mixed coinfection with other viral pathogens. The current study clearly demonstrated that genetically conserved HBoV1 circulates in Saudi Arabia. Interestingly, most of the HBoV1 infected cases were associated with high rates of co-infections with other viruses.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.116835533,-0.049183925,-0.026647076000000002,-0.057974501,0.072435967,-0.079791155,0.02178165,0.000199097,0.025568497000000003,0.048057984000000005,-0.034077569,0.018339126,0.014104637,0.017814035,0.012679498999999999,-0.050567929000000005,-0.046150127,-0.017894468,0.009567953,0.015202541000000002,0.041503604,0.065165295,-0.0026687340000000003,0.08169032799999999,-0.081463458,0.022679607999999997,-0.080723327,0.010400016,8.87e-05,0.05440832
739,Prescription Surveillance and Polymerase Chain Reaction Testing to Identify Pathogens during Outbreaks of Infection,"Syndromic surveillance, including prescription surveillance, offers a rapid method for the early detection of agents of bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases. However, it has the disadvantage of not considering definitive diagnoses. Here, we attempted to definitively diagnose pathogens using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) immediately after the prescription surveillance system detected an outbreak. Specimens were collected from 50 patients with respiratory infections. PCR was used to identify the pathogens, which included 14 types of common respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Infectious agents including M. pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, enterovirus, and parainfluenza virus were detected in 54% of patients. For the rapid RSV diagnosis kit, sensitivity was 80% and specificity was 85%. For the rapid adenovirus diagnosis kit, no positive results were obtained; therefore, sensitivity could not be calculated and specificity was 100%. Many patients were found to be treated for upper respiratory tract infections without the diagnosis of a specific pathogen. In Japan, an outbreak of M. pneumoniae infection began in 2011, and our results suggested that this outbreak may have included false-positive cases. By combining syndromic surveillance and PCR, we were able to rapidly and accurately identify causative pathogens during a recent respiratory infection outbreak.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.244079601,-0.014010455,0.037808156,0.061236640999999994,-0.006723071,-0.069904702,-0.000251645,0.01651385,-0.024944785,0.09995068300000001,-0.012023856000000001,-0.060931932,0.044666298,-0.032750454,0.028171455,-0.058249554,0.019429611,0.003678952,0.022362412999999998,-0.03451777,0.024196567999999998,-0.049917109,0.062605251,-0.06282793099999999,0.100544748,-0.033340351000000004,0.045399774000000004,0.12916352,-0.026120771,-0.05625505099999999
740,First introduction of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 and detection of respiratory viruses in pediatric patients in Central African Republic,"BACKGROUND: Acute viral respiratory illnesses in children in sub-Saharan Africa have received relatively little attention, although they are much more frequent causes of morbidity and mortality than in developed countries. Active surveillance is essential to identify the causative agents and to improve clinical management, especially in the context of possible circulation of pandemic viruses. FINDINGS: A prospective study was conducted in the Central African Republic (CAR) between January and December 2010 among infants and children aged 0–15 years attending sentinel sites for influenza-like illness or acute respiratory illness. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected, and one-step real-time and multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to detect respiratory viruses. Respiratory viruses were detected in 49 of the 329 (14.9%) nasopharyngeal samples: 29 (8.8%) contained influenza viruses (5 (1.5%) had pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus and 24 (7.3%) had influenza B viruses), 11 (3.3%) contained parainfluenza viruses types 1 and 3 and 9 (2.7%) contained human respiratory syncytial virus. Most cases were detected during the rainy season in the CAR. Analysis of the amplicon sequences confirmed the identity of each detected virus. CONCLUSIONS: The influenza surveillance system in the CAR has provided valuable data on the seasonality of influenza and the circulation of other respiratory viruses. Our network could therefore play a valuable role in the prevention and control of influenza epidemics in the CAR.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.26990277,-0.15082237199999998,-0.08397232,0.27432027800000003,0.08316127400000001,0.20669446100000002,-0.09023258099999999,-0.040873961,0.011857798000000001,-0.042820435999999996,0.01200743,-0.027027753999999998,0.040226452,-0.030609814,0.06021066,-0.030094812999999998,0.006659371,-0.099031505,0.041574921,-0.00682786,-0.0033675759999999997,0.01153904,-0.027267532999999997,0.028657292,-0.0050603770000000005,0.023547662999999996,-0.057448513,0.062644121,0.021924085,-0.089310098
741,"Accuracy of IgM antibody testing, FQ-PCR and culture in laboratory diagnosis of acute infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae in adults and adolescents with community-acquired pneumonia","BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae in adults and adolescents is hampered by a lack of rapid and standardized tests for detection. METHODS: CAP patients from 12 teaching hospitals were prospectively and consecutively recruited. Basic and clinical information, throat swabs and paired sera were collected. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected by IgG and IgM antibody tests, fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR) and culture. A comparative study of the diagnostic values of three methods, including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and positive likelihood ratio (PLR) was conducted. A fourfold or greater increase of IgG antibody titers of paired sera was set as the diagnostic “gold standard”. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-five CAP patients (52.8% males, median age 47 years, range 14–85) were enrolled. Twenty-seven (21.6%) patients were diagnosed with acute Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections by the “gold standard”. Specificity values of all three methods were around 90%. An increasing trend of sensitivity, positive predictive value and PLR was found, with the lowest in IgM testing (7.4%, 28.6% and 1.45), intermediate in FQ-PCR (40.7%, 50% and 3.63), and highest in culture (55.6%, 75% and 10.9). CONCLUSIONS: In the defined group of patients, there was a good agreement between positive rate of MP cultivation of throat swabs and acute M. pneumoniae infection (PLR of 10.9). Since the sensitivity is low in all of the evaluated methods, the logical approach would be to incorporate PCR, culture and serological tests for optimum diagnosis of acute Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in adults and adolescents.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.18577472899999997,-0.000304316,0.034088497999999995,-0.068370742,-0.072717567,-0.067438923,-0.029062757,0.073306947,-0.176483442,0.06280899599999999,-0.038647986,-0.012473673999999999,0.021963084,-0.022261523,-0.040603213,-0.036823466,0.012074896000000002,0.01317551,-0.024713012000000003,-0.053087660999999994,-0.042031279000000005,0.057651449,0.21064611800000002,-0.050203492,0.079681986,-0.010097276,0.01379167,0.037110986,0.04825211099999999,0.0017210020000000001
742,"Viral Aetiology in Adults with Acute Upper Respiratory Tract Infection in Jinan, Northern China","Our study investigated the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in adult patients with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) between August 2009 and September 2010 in Jinan, northern China. Nasal and throat swabs (n = 596) were collected from adult patients with URTIs. Nine respiratory-related viruses, including IFV, PIV, HRV, HMPV, HBoV, HCoV, ADV, RSV, and EV, were detected in all samples by conventional and reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions. Positive detection rate for respiratory virus was 38.76% and codetection rate was 4.70% in adults with acute respiratory tract infections. IFV (20.81%) was the dominant agent detected and IFVB had a higher incidence (12.58%) than IFVA (7.72%). Detection rates of 8.22%, 5.03%, 3.69%, and 2.52% were observed for HBoV, HRV, EV, and RSV, respectively. HCoV had the lowest detection rate of 0.50%. HBoV, HRV, EV, and ADV infection rates were higher in the 14–25-year-old group than in the 26–65-year-old group. Codetection rates were higher (7.52%) in the 14–25-year-old group than in the older age group (2.64%).

745,"Comparison among nasopharyngeal swab, nasal wash, and oropharyngeal swab for respiratory virus detection in adults with acute pharyngitis","BACKGROUND: Acute pharyngitis is frequently seen in primary care. Acute viral pharyngitis may be easily misdiagnosed as acute bacterial pharyngitis. Laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of respiratory viruses is recommended. The purpose of this study was to compare the sensitivities among oropharyngeal swab (OPS), nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), and nasal wash (NW) in adults with acute pharyngitis. METHODS: OPS, NPS, and NW were obtained from each participant with acute pharyngitis. The specimens were tested for 15 respiratory viruses by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction. A sample was considered to be a true positive if any of the specimens was positive. The sensitivities among samples were compared by chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. RESULTS: One hundred three triple samples collected consecutively by OPS, NPS, and NW were obtained. In 73 patients, one or more viruses were detected by any of the three methods. Among all viruses, the sensitivity of NPS was significantly higher than that of NW (74% vs. 49%, respectively; p < 0.01) and OPS (74% vs. 49%, respectively; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Flocked NPS collection may be the most effective alternative to NW and OPS for detection of respiratory viruses in adults with acute pharyngitis using TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.11804924300000001,-0.006346861999999999,0.015569085,-0.009205063000000001,0.002729027,-0.03571327,0.011926706,0.003759166,-0.044424591,0.01408151,-0.002152799,0.001254093,-0.001719679,-0.002142184,0.024055134,-0.013576598,-0.003989373,-0.068533499,0.047550580999999995,-0.053765047999999996,-0.008110315,-0.016398844,-0.016144658,-0.02231855,-0.004000826,0.023184257000000003,-0.031441484,-0.011946608999999999,-0.00669987,-0.080229404
747,The incidence and aetiology of hospitalised community-acquired pneumonia among Vietnamese adults: a prospective surveillance in Central Vietnam,"BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common infectious disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The patterns of aetiological pathogens differ by region and country. Special attention must be paid to CAP in Southeast Asia (SEA), a region facing rapid demographic transition. Estimates burden and aetiological patterns of CAP are essential for the clinical and public health management. The purposes of the study are to determine the incidence, aetiological pathogens, clinical pictures and risk factors of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the Vietnamese adult population. METHODS: A prospective surveillance for hospitalised adult CAP was conducted in Khanh Hoa Province, Central Vietnam. All adults aged ≥15 years with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) admitted to a provincial hospital from September 2009 to August 2010 were enrolled in the study. Patients were classified into CAP and non-pneumonic LRTI (NPLRTI) according to the radiological findings. Bacterial pathogens were identified from sputum samples by the conventional culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis; 13 respiratory viruses were identified from nasopharyngeal specimens by PCR. RESULTS: Of all 367 LRTI episodes examined, 174 (47%) were CAP. Older age, the presence of underlying respiratory conditions, and higher index score of smoking were associated with CAP. The one-year estimated incidence of hospitalised adult CAP in our study population was 0.81 per 1,000 person years. The incidence increased considerably with age and was highest among the elderly. The case fatality proportion of hospitalised CAP patients was 9.8%. Among 286 sputum samples tested for bacterial PCR, 79 (28%) were positive for H. influenzae, and 65 (23%) were positive for S. pneumoniae. Among 357 samples tested for viral PCR, 73 (21%) were positive for respiratory viruses; influenza A (n = 32, 9%) was the most common. CONCLUSIONS: The current adult CAP incidence in Vietnam was relatively low; this result was mainly attributed to the young age of our study population.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.225221297,-0.090912595,-0.073709669,-0.025605091,-0.005018767,-0.059323807,-0.024300247999999997,0.072509372,-0.150123259,0.07795121599999999,-0.04770734099999999,-0.003849946,0.012871456000000002,-0.023725977000000002,-0.076145891,-0.06130435,0.0027503909999999996,-0.026157555,-0.06283713,0.072451177,-0.013988516999999999,0.128168116,0.234725834,0.074126383,0.15092629400000002,-0.102470053,-0.014677955,0.075684073,0.208151108,0.023869156000000002
760,"Nasal swab samples and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays in community-based, longitudinal studies of respiratory viruses: the importance of sample integrity and quality control","BACKGROUND: Carefully conducted, community-based, longitudinal studies are required to gain further understanding of the nature and timing of respiratory viruses causing infections in the population. However, such studies pose unique challenges for field specimen collection, including as we have observed the appearance of mould in some nasal swab specimens. We therefore investigated the impact of sample collection quality and the presence of visible mould in samples upon respiratory virus detection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. METHODS: Anterior nasal swab samples were collected from infants participating in an ongoing community-based, longitudinal, dynamic birth cohort study. The samples were first collected from each infant shortly after birth and weekly thereafter. They were then mailed to the laboratory where they were catalogued, stored at -80°C and later screened by PCR for 17 respiratory viruses. The quality of specimen collection was assessed by screening for human deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) using endogenous retrovirus 3 (ERV3). The impact of ERV3 load upon respiratory virus detection and the impact of visible mould observed in a subset of swabs reaching the laboratory upon both ERV3 loads and respiratory virus detection was determined. RESULTS: In total, 4933 nasal swabs were received in the laboratory. ERV3 load in nasal swabs was associated with respiratory virus detection. Reduced respiratory virus detection (odds ratio 0.35; 95% confidence interval 0.27-0.44) was observed in samples where the ERV3 could not be identified. Mould was associated with increased time of samples reaching the laboratory and reduced ERV3 loads and respiratory virus detection. CONCLUSION: Suboptimal sample collection and high levels of visible mould can impact negatively upon sample quality. Quality control measures, including monitoring human DNA loads using ERV3 as a marker for epithelial cell components in samples should be undertaken to optimize the validity of real-time PCR results for respiratory virus investigations in community-based studies.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.172119414,-0.007692566,0.07368452,0.06368052099999999,0.00997755,-0.047850248,0.041445097,-0.017150774,0.014732324,0.048097083,0.00472534,-0.030336718999999998,0.028497547,-0.022994082000000002,0.061286938,-0.011324881,-0.027517884,-0.132782301,0.080204601,-0.08432254,-0.040217143999999996,-0.050313619000000004,-0.013222423999999998,-0.047734017000000004,0.030206127000000003,-0.0040041,-0.014259776000000002,-0.031576145,-0.038910322000000004,-0.094170752
761,Transmission of Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) Virus in a Train in China,"BACKGROUND: Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged in North America in April 2009 and spread globally. We describe the epidemiology and public health response to the first known outbreak of 2009 H1N1 in a train, which occurred in June 2009 in China. METHODS: After 2 provinces provided initial reports of 2009 H1N1 infection in 2 persons who had travelled on the same train, we conducted a retrospective epidemiologic investigation to collect information from the passengers, crew members, contacts, and health care providers. We explored the source of infection and possible routes of transmission in the train. All cases were confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. RESULTS: Train #1223 traveled 40 hours, made 28 stops in 4 Chinese provinces, and boarded 2555 passengers, who logged a total of 59 144 person-hours of travel time. Nineteen confirmed 2009 H1N1 cases were identified. Of these, 13 were infected and developed symptoms on the train and 6 occurred among contacts who developed illness during medical monitoring. In addition, 3 asymptomatic cases were identified based on RT-PCR testing of respiratory swabs from contacts. The attack rate among contacts of confirmed cases in the same car was higher than that among contacts in other cars (3.15% vs. 0%, P < 0.001). Attack rates increased with exposure time. CONCLUSIONS: Close contact and long exposure may have contributed to the transmission of 2009 H1N1 virus in the train. Trains may have played an important role in the 2009 influenza pandemic.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.113626448,0.006310402,-0.003970458,0.02747903,-0.026671882,0.17199656,-0.094732549,0.08579587699999999,-0.008903448000000001,-0.08759088599999999,0.018540669,0.041892984,-0.031553897000000004,-0.033236605,0.042737700999999996,0.03195942,-0.022766776000000002,0.005075607,-0.046605854,-0.07557169799999999,-0.007871511,0.023470473999999998,-0.11699371300000001,-0.078725787,-0.075221893,0.092619631,0.009742991999999999,0.074161108,-0.0049452870000000005,0.035199827999999996
762,"Clinical Epidemiology of Bocavirus, Rhinovirus, Two Polyomaviruses and Four Coronaviruses in HIV-Infected and HIV-Uninfected South African Children","BACKGROUND: Advances in molecular diagnostics have implicated newly-discovered respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. We aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of human bocavirus (hBoV), human rhinovirus (hRV), polyomavirus-WU (WUPyV) and –KI (KIPyV) and human coronaviruses (CoV)-OC43, -NL63, -HKU1 and -229E among children hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). METHODS: Multiplex real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was undertaken on archived nasopharyngeal aspirates from HIV-infected and –uninfected children (<2 years age) hospitalized for LRTI, who had been previously investigated for respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza I–III, adenovirus and influenza A/B. RESULTS: At least one of these viruses were identified in 274 (53.0%) of 517 and in 509 (54.0%) of 943 LRTI-episodes in HIV-infected and -uninfected children, respectively. Human rhinovirus was the most prevalent in HIV-infected (31.7%) and –uninfected children (32.0%), followed by CoV-OC43 (12.2%) and hBoV (9.5%) in HIV-infected; and by hBoV (13.3%) and WUPyV (11.9%) in HIV-uninfected children. Polyomavirus-KI (8.9% vs. 4.8%; p = 0.002) and CoV-OC43 (12.2% vs. 3.6%; p<0.001) were more prevalent in HIV-infected than –uninfected children. Combined with previously-tested viruses, respiratory viruses were identified in 60.9% of HIV-infected and 78.3% of HIV-uninfected children. The newly tested viruses were detected at high frequency in association with other respiratory viruses, including previously-investigated viruses (22.8% in HIV-infected and 28.5% in HIV–uninfected children). CONCLUSIONS: We established that combined with previously-investigated viruses, at least one respiratory virus was identified in the majority of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children hospitalized for LRTI. The high frequency of viral co-infections illustrates the complexities in attributing causality to specific viruses in the aetiology of LRTI and may indicate a synergetic role of viral co-infections in the pathogenesis of childhood LRTI.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.148831238,-0.067335795,-0.094279454,0.045414379000000005,0.057595718,-0.069589323,0.095885894,-0.066058062,0.10652079199999999,0.001472491,-0.006660511,0.008740405,0.032330954,-0.011392216,0.026557044,0.00140615,-0.035014528999999996,-0.025153915,0.017871878,0.003182222,-0.020487861,0.076425333,0.018702864,0.10319317900000001,-0.042854842000000004,0.060776579000000004,-0.054762406,-0.019311823,0.023047661,0.026834255
764,"Vaccine Effectiveness against Medically Attended Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza in Japan, 2011–2012 Season","The objective of this study was to estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza during the 2011–2012 season in Japan using a test-negative case-control study design. The effect of co-circulating non-influenza respiratory viruses (NIRVs) on VE estimates was also explored. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from outpatients with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) in a community hospital in Nagasaki, Japan. Thirteen respiratory viruses (RVs), including influenza A and B, were identified from the samples using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The difference in VE point estimates was assessed using three different controls: ILI patients that tested negative for influenza, those that tested negative for all RVs, and those that tested positive for NIRVs. The adjusted VE against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza using all influenza-negative controls was 5.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], −60.5 to 44.1). The adjusted VEs using RV-negative and NIRV-positive controls were −1.5% (95% CI, −74.7 to 41) and 50% (95% CI, −43.2 to 82.5), respectively. Influenza VE was limited in Japan during the 2011–2012 season.

768,"Population-Based Incidence of Severe Acute Respiratory Virus Infections among Children Aged <5 Years in Rural Bangladesh, June–October 2010","BACKGROUND: Better understanding the etiology-specific incidence of severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) in resource-poor, rural settings will help further develop and prioritize prevention strategies. To address this gap in knowledge, we conducted a longitudinal study to estimate the incidence of SARIs among children in rural Bangladesh. METHODS: During June through October 2010, we followed children aged <5 years in 67 villages to identify those with cough, difficulty breathing, age-specific tachypnea and/or danger signs in the community or admitted to the local hospital. A study physician collected clinical information and obtained nasopharyngeal swabs from all SARI cases and blood for bacterial culture from those hospitalized. We tested swabs for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, human metapneumoviruses, adenoviruses and human parainfluenza viruses 1–3 (HPIV) by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We calculated virus-specific SARI incidence by dividing the number of new illnesses by the person-time each child contributed to the study. RESULTS: We followed 12,850 children for 279,029 person-weeks (pw) and identified 141 SARI cases; 76 (54%) at their homes and 65 (46%) at the hospital. RSV was associated with 7.9 SARI hospitalizations per 100,000 pw, HPIV3 2.2 hospitalizations/100,000 pw, and influenza 1.1 hospitalizations/100,000 pw. Among non-hospitalized SARI cases, RSV was associated with 10.8 illnesses/100,000 pw, HPIV3 1.8/100,000 pw, influenza 1.4/100,000 pw, and adenoviruses 0.4/100,000 pw.

772,Viral Infection Is Not Uncommon in Adult Patients with Severe Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia,"BACKGROUND: Viral pathogens have not generally been regarded as important causes of severe hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), except in patients with hematologic malignancy or transplant recipients. We investigated the role and distribution of viruses in adult with severe HAP who required intensive care. METHODS: From March 2010 to February 2012, adult patients with severe HAP required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), 28-bed medical ICU in a tertiary care hospital, were prospectively enrolled. Respiratory viruses were detected using multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and/or shell vial culture. RESULTS: A total of 262 patients were enrolled and 107 patients (40.8%) underwent bronchoscopic BAL for etiologic diagnosis. One hundred and fifty-six patients (59.5%) had bacterial infections and 59 patients (22.5%) had viral infections. Viruses were detected in BAL fluid specimens of 37 patients (62.7%, 37/59). The most commonly identified viruses were respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus (both 27.1%, 16/59), followed by rhinovirus (25.4%, 15/59), and influenza virus (16.9%, 10/59). Twenty-one patients (8.0%, 21/262) had bacterial-viral coinfections and Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly coexisting bacteria (n = 10). Viral infection in non-immunocompromised patients was not uncommon (11.1%, 16/143), although it was not as frequent as that in immunocompromised patients (36.4%, 43/119). Non-immunocompromised patients were significantly older than immunocompromised patients and had significantly higher rates of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tuberculous destroyed lung and chronic kidney disease. The 28 day mortalities of patients with bacterial infections, viral infections and bacterial-viral coinfections were not significantly different (29.5%, 35.6% and 19.0%, respectively; p = 0.321). CONCLUSIONS: Viral pathogens are not uncommon in adult patients with severe HAP who required ICU admission. Since viral pathogens may cause severe HAP and could be a potential source of viral transmission, further investigation is required to delineate the role of viral pathogens in severe HAP.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.21242249600000002,-0.062551598,-0.133650671,-0.070677877,-0.08003615900000001,-0.066878039,-0.036581772,0.10361766300000001,-0.18939495899999997,0.119989808,-0.05761126,-0.009889061,0.030914083999999998,0.09903698300000001,-0.042431362,-0.036675229,0.031449637999999995,0.037464133999999996,-0.008212417,0.102073636,0.03964203,-0.030227816,-0.017849995,0.037281244,-0.010162945,-0.036751698,0.022529427999999997,-0.024068539,-0.038400729,0.017959163
774,Epidemiology of Acute Respiratory Infections in Children in Guangzhou: A Three-Year Study,"Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) are some of the most common human diseases worldwide. However, they have a complex and diverse etiology, and the characteristics of the pathogens involved in respiratory infections in developing countries are not well understood. In this work, we analyzed the characteristics of 17 common respiratory pathogens in children (≤14 years old) with ARI in Guangzhou, southern China over a 3-year period using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Pathogens were identified in 2361/4242 (55.7%) patients, and the positivity rate varied seasonally. Ten of the 17 pathogens investigated showed positivity rates of more than 5%. The most frequently detected pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus (768/2361, 32.5%), influenza A virus (428/2361, 18.1%), enterovirus (138/2361, 13.3%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (267/2361, 11.3%) and adenovirus (213/2361, 9.0%). Co-pathogens were common and found in 503 of 2361 (21.3%) positive samples. When ranked according to frequency of occurrence, the pattern of co-pathogens was similar to that of the primary pathogens, with the exception of human bocavirus, human coronavirus and human metapneumovirus. Significant differences were found in age prevalence in 10 of the 17 pathogens (p≤0.009): four basic patterns were observed, A: detection rates increased with age, B: detection rates declined with age, C: the detection rate showed distinct peaks or D: numbers of patients were too low to detect a trend or showed no significant difference among age groups (p>0.05).

776,"Prevalence of adenovirus in children with acute respiratory tract infection in Lanzhou, China","BACKGROUND: Human adenovirus (HAdV) is an important agent causing respiratory tract infection in children. Information on the epidemiological and clinical features of HAdV is limited in children with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in China, especially those of a novel genotype, Ad55. METHODS: In total, 1169 nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children younger than 14 years with ARTIs between November 2006 and November 2009. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to screen HAdVs. All PCR-positive products were sequenced. RESULTS: 74 of 1169 (6.33%) specimens were positive for HAdVs. Among positive cases, AdV3 (58/74) was detected most frequently, followed by AdV11 (10/74), AdV2 (2/74), AdV7 (2/69), AdV6 (1/74), and AdV1 (1/74). AdV55 was found in one case. The incidence of HAdV infection peaked in children aged 3–7 years. The most common clinical diagnosis was upper respiratory infection, and the most common syndrome was fever and cough.The comparison of HAdV and RSV group revealed that Children infected with group AdV were significant older than children infected with group RSV, had more fever but less frequently wheezing, and cough, crackles, and cyanosis, The duration of hospitalization between the AdV group and RSV group was not significant, but a greater frequency of LRTIs was observed in RSV group. CONCLUSIONS: HAdV is an important viral agent in children with ARTIs in Lanzhou City, China. Multiple HAdV serotypes co-circulated with Ad3, which was predominant in this 3-year study.

781,Influenza and other respiratory virus infections in outpatients with medically attended acute respiratory infection during the 2011-12 influenza season,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory tract infections are a major cause of outpatient visits, yet only a portion is tested to determine the etiologic organism. Multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (MRT-PCR) assays for detection of multiple viruses are being used increasingly in clinical settings. METHODS: During January–April 2012, outpatients with acute respiratory illness (≤7 days) were tested for influenza using singleplex RT-PCR (SRT-PCR). A subset was assayed for 18 viruses using MRT-PCR to compare detection of influenza and examine the distribution of viruses and characteristics of patients using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 662 participants (6 months–82 years), detection of influenza was similar between the MRT-PCR and SRT-PCR (κ = 0·83). No virus was identified in 267 (40.3%) samples. Commonly detected viruses were human rhinovirus (HRV, 15·4%), coronavirus (CoV, 10·4%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 8·4%), human metapneumovirus (hMPV, 8·3%), and influenza (6%). Co-detections were infrequent (6·9%) and most commonly occurred among those <18 years old. In regression analyses, compared with non-viral illnesses, RSV and hMPV were significantly more frequent in children and less frequent in 18- to 49-year-olds than in those ≥50 years (P = 0·01), fever was more common in hMPV and influenza infections (P = 0·008), nasal congestion was more frequent in CoV, HRV, hMPV, influenza and RSV infections (P = 0·001), and body mass index was higher among those with influenza (P = 0·036). CONCLUSIONS: Using MRT-PCR, a viral etiology was found in three-fifths of patients with medically attended outpatient visits for acute respiratory illness during the influenza season; co-detected viruses were infrequent.

782,"Prevalence and Genetic Diversity Analysis of Human Coronavirus OC43 among Adult Patients with Acute Respiratory Infections in Beijing, 2012","To determine the prevalence, epidemiology and genetic diversity of human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) among adult patients with acute respiratory infections (ARI) in Beijing,five hundred and fifty-nine nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from adult patients with ARI in Beijing. The prevalence of HCoV-OC43 infection among these patients was assessed using two different OneStep reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. The epidemiological profiles of the patients with HCoV-OC43 infection were described. Partial S and N genes of HCoV-OC43 circulating strains were sequenced followed by phylogenetic analysis and amino acid alignment. Our results showed that the prevalence of HCoV-OC43 infection was 12.52% (95% CI: 9.78–15.26%), and the epidemic peak occurred in autumn. Fifty partial S and 40 partial N fragments were obtained from these patients. Phylogenetic analysis based on neighbour-joining method showed that at least three distinct clusters (A, B, C/D) of HCoV-OC43 strains were circulating among adult patients with ARI in Beijing. In addition, some novel unique clusters (UNT) of HCoV-OC43 were found in the S- and N-based phylogenetic trees. Furthermore, consensus amino acids substitutes for each cluster were also found after alignment of partial S or N sequence coding region in this study. In conclusion, we herein describe the prevalence of HCoV-OC43 among adult patients and provide substantial evidence for the genetic diversity of HCoV-OC43 circulating in Beijing.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.09479251,-0.017053499,-0.048584547,-0.09229028199999999,0.18753960600000003,-0.054791505,0.011625736000000001,-0.006172782,0.03337329,-0.062039812,-0.06282252299999999,0.39577167399999996,0.275839083,0.183257335,-0.034287622000000004,0.032572593999999996,-0.043457893,-0.006899034,-0.056052187999999996,0.033794517999999996,0.016108277,-0.028225474,0.037429184,-0.008093835,0.007996373000000001,-0.04016596,0.09130745400000001,0.013291954,-0.035861237000000004,0.0867075
783,"Viral etiology and seasonality of influenza-like illness in Gabon, March 2010 to June 2011","BACKGROUND: Surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) in Central Africa began only recently, and few data are therefore available on the circulation of influenza virus and other respiratory viruses. In Gabon, a Central African country, we established a surveillance network in four major towns in order to analyze cases of ILI among patients who visited health centers between March 2010 and June 2011, and to determine the viral etiology. METHODS: Nasal swabs were sent for analysis to the Centre International de Recherches Médicales de Franceville, where they were screened for 17 respiratory viruses in a multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for all pathogens according the following pairs: adenovirus/parainfluenza virus 4, respiratory syncytial virus/human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 1/parainfluenza virus 2, pandemic influenza virus A/seasonal influenza virus A (H1N1, H3N2)/seasonal influenza virus B, human coronaviruses 229E/OC43, human coronaviruses NL63/HKU1, rhinovirus/human parechovirus, and enterovirus/parainfluenza virus 3. RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 1041 specimens, of which 639 (61%) were positive for at least one virus. Three-quarters of the patients were children under five years old. We therefore focused on this age group, in which 68.1% of patients were positive for at least one virus. The most common viruses were adenoviruses (17.5%), followed by parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1–4 (16.8%), enteroviruses (EV) (14.7%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (13.5%), and influenza virus (11.9%). The prevalence of some viruses was subject to geographic and seasonal variations. One-third of positive samples contained more than one virus. CONCLUSIONS: Like most studies in the world, the virus PIVs, EV, RSV, Influenza virus, HRV were predominant among children under five years old in Gabon. An exception is made for adenoviruses which have a high prevalence in our study. However adenoviruses can be detected in asymptomatic persons. These finding gave a better knowledge of the circulation and the seasonality of the viruses involved in ILI in Gabon.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.270356462,-0.178181195,-0.10865403300000001,0.26058769600000004,0.121799218,0.162958351,-0.074148336,-0.044693646,0.016366508000000002,-0.043713413,0.009066697,-0.034214269,0.044498706,0.030756018,0.032821165,-0.050938286,0.020091603,-0.057789405999999995,0.04887535900000001,0.031177543999999998,0.020408087,-0.035585866,0.006382321999999999,0.035888623,-0.008489275,0.027067851,0.025703372000000002,0.11956285800000001,-0.04070698,-0.024292826
784,Human Coronaviruses Associated with Upper Respiratory Tract Infections in Three Rural Areas of Ghana,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries, especially in Africa. This study sought to determine whether human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are associated with upper respiratory tract infections among older children and adults in Ghana. METHODS: We conducted a case control study among older children and adults in three rural areas of Ghana using asymptomatic subjects as controls. Nasal/Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), HCoV-22E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 using Reverse Transcriptase Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction. RESULTS: Out of 1,213 subjects recruited, 150 (12.4%) were positive for one or more viruses. Of these, single virus detections occurred in 146 subjects (12.0%) and multiple detections occurred in 4 (0.3%). Compared with control subjects, infections with HCoV-229E (OR = 5.15, 95%CI = 2.24–11.78), HCoV-OC43 (OR = 6.16, 95%CI = 1.77–21.65) and combine HCoVs (OR = 2.36, 95%CI = 1.5 = 3.72) were associated with upper respiratory tract infections. HCoVs were found to be seasonally dependent with significant detections in the harmattan season (mainly HCoV-229E) and wet season (mainly HCoV-NL63). A comparison of the obtained sequences resulted in no differences to sequences already published in GenBank. CONCLUSION: HCoVs could play significant role in causing upper respiratory tract infections among adults and older children in rural areas of Ghana.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.20039438199999998,-0.050876292999999996,-0.124637594,-0.00852351,0.160052807,-0.10743810599999999,0.08045042200000001,-0.033403348,0.20331117399999998,-0.11236280300000001,-0.03026996,0.371717986,0.26550221,0.117166472,-0.018360774,0.110838605,-0.097441486,-0.11286687699999999,-0.018772037,0.012158788,-0.13393153800000002,0.0019863339999999998,0.06669314400000001,-0.005918997,0.015933496000000002,-0.018698523,0.032700996,-0.097853779,0.035910782999999995,0.025139631000000003
785,Establishment and Clinical Applications of a Portable System for Capturing Influenza Viruses Released through Coughing,"Coughing plays an important role in influenza transmission; however, there is insufficient information regarding the viral load in cough because of the lack of convenient and reliable collection methods. We developed a portable airborne particle-collection system to measure the viral load; it is equipped with an air sampler to draw air and pass it through a gelatin membrane filter connected to a cone-shaped, megaphone-like device to guide the cough airflow to the membrane. The membrane was dissolved in a medium, and the viral load was measured using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and a plaque assay. The approximate viral recovery rate of this system was 10% in simulation experiments to collect and quantify the viral particles aerosolized by a nebulizer. Using this system, cough samples were collected from 56 influenza A patients. The total viral detection rate was 41% (23/56), and the viral loads varied significantly (from <10, less than the detection limit, to 2240 viral gene copies/cough). Viable viruses were detected from 3 samples with ≤18 plaque forming units per cough sample. The virus detection rates were similar among different groups of patients infected with different viral subtypes and during different influenza seasons. Among patients who did not receive antiviral treatment, viruses were detected in one of six cases in the vaccinated group and four of six cases in the unvaccinated group. We found cases with high viral titers in throat swabs or oral secretions but very low or undetectable in coughs and vice versa suggesting other possible anatomical sites where the viruses might be mixed into the cough. Our system is easy to operate, appropriate for bedside use, and is useful for comparing the viral load in cough samples from influenza patients under various conditions and settings. However, further large-scale studies are warranted to validate our results.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.115760986,-0.040828439,-0.002491418,0.066084982,-0.056511426,0.061843786,-0.02494506,0.044369199000000005,-0.093274938,0.027221752999999998,-0.007867146,-0.047111199000000006,-0.013354946999999999,0.056330692,-9.95e-05,-0.032729836,-0.031753432000000005,-0.044548134,0.032653032,0.031603203999999996,-0.046792485,0.038317773,-0.074221075,0.016103246,-0.078132998,-0.012029747,0.046159239000000005,-0.019120392,-0.09122766300000001,0.058876898
788,Single detection of human bocavirus 1 with a high viral load in severe respiratory tract infections in previously healthy children,"BACKGROUND: Human bocavirus is a newly discovered parvovirus. Multiple studies have confirmed the presence of human bocavirus1 (HBoV1) in respiratory tract samples of children. The viral load, presentation of single detection and its role as a causative agent of severe respiratory tract infections have not been thoroughly elucidated. METHODS: We investigated the presence of HBoV1 by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from 1229 children hospitalized for respiratory tract infections. The samples were analyzed for 15 respiratory viruses by PCR and 7 respiratory viruses by viral culture. RESULTS: At least one virus was detected in 652 (53.1%) of 1229 children, and two or more viruses were detected in 266 (21.6%) children. HBoV1 was detected in 127 children (10.3%), in which 66/127 (52%) of the cases were the only HBoV1 virus detected. Seasonal variation was observed with a high HBoV1 infection rate in summer. A cutoff value of 10(7) copies/mL was used to distinguish high and low HBoV1 viral loads in the nasopharyngeal aspirates. High viral loads of HBoV1 were noted predominantly in the absence of other viral agents (28/39, 71.8%) whereas there was primarily co-detection in cases of low HBoV1 viral loads (50/88, 56.8%). There were no differences in the clinical symptoms and severity between HBoV1 single detection and co-detection. In cases of HBoV1 single detection, the high viral load group was more prevalent among children with dyspnea and wheezing than was the low viral load group (42.9% vs. 23.7%, P = 0.036; 60.7% vs. 31.6%, P = 0.018). In clinical severity, a significant difference was recorded (25.0% vs. 5.3%, P = 0.003) between high viral load and low viral load groups. Of the HBoV1 positive patients associated with severe respiratory tract infections, 10/18 (55.6%) patients belonged to the HBoV1 high viral load group, and 7/10 (70%) patients had cases of HBoV1 single detection. CONCLUSIONS: HBoV1 at a high viral load is not frequently found in co-detection with other respiratory viruses, and a single detection with a high viral load could be an etiological agent of severe respiratory tract infections.

794,Epidemiology of respiratory viral infections in children enrolled in a study of influenza vaccine effectiveness,"BACKGROUND: Influenza-like illness (ILI) confers a high annual morbidity in young children. We report the epidemiology of ILIs in children who participated in an influenza vaccine effectiveness study during the 2010 Southern Hemisphere influenza season in Sydney, Australia. METHODS: Children aged 0·5–3 years were prospectively recruited from child care centres (CCCs). We classified them as fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated and unvaccinated according to their receipt of unadjuvanted vaccines containing influenza A (H1N1)pdm09. For 13 weeks commencing 30 July 2010, parents reported when their children developed an ILI (fever ≥37·8°C/feverishness plus ≥1 respiratory symptom) and collected nose and/or throat swabs for multiplex respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Health impacts were assessed by telephone interview at enrolment and two weeks after each ILI. RESULTS: There were 124 ILIs reported in 105 of 381 enrolled children. Swabs were taken in 117 ILIs: 175 viruses were identified from 103 swabs. Adeno- and rhinoviruses were most frequently identified; 44% of swabs yielded multiple viruses. No virus was associated with more severe symptoms, although rhinovirus-related ILIs lasted longer. Nose swabs had a higher virus detection rate than throat swabs. Influenza-vaccinated children were 1·6 times (P = 0·001) more likely than unvaccinated children to have a non-influenza ILI. CONCLUSION: Adeno- and rhinoviruses were the most common viruses causing ILI. Swabs taken by parents are an effective method for sample collection. Influenza-like illness was more common in children vaccinated against influenza in this observational study, but prior health-seeking behaviour may have contributed to this difference.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.211016013,-0.136860426,-0.06750627,0.156997954,0.045923720999999994,0.155074306,-0.079178492,-0.056721333,0.027161596,-0.105028435,0.028953226000000002,-0.010858363999999999,-0.052200993,-0.086164374,0.008329043000000001,0.033411315,-0.026947923999999998,-0.079647672,0.023687287999999997,-0.069700282,-0.067105729,0.046386749000000005,-0.0029137459999999996,-0.019565082,-0.022938085,0.062543002,-0.037436433,0.048246459000000005,0.040459281,-0.005664453000000001
795,Impact of 2009 pandemic influenza among Vietnamese children based on a population-based prospective surveillance from 2007 to 2011,"BACKGROUND: Influenza virus is one of the major viral pathogens causing pediatric acute respiratory infection (ARI). The spread of pandemic influenza A (A(H1N1)pdm09) in 2009 around the globe had a huge impact on global health. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of A(H1N1)pdm09 on pediatric ARI in Vietnam. STUDY DESIGN: An ongoing population-based prospective surveillance in central Vietnam was used. All children aged <15 years residing in Nha Trang city, enrolled to the ARI surveillance in Khanh Hoa General Hospital, from February 2007 through March 2011 were studied. Clinical data and nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected. Influenza A was detected and genotyped by multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays and sequencing. RESULTS: Among enrolled 2736 hospitalized ARI cases, 354 (13%) were positive for influenza A. Genotyping results revealed that seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 (sea-H1N1) viruses were cocirculating before A(H1N1)pdm09 appeared in July 2009. The A(H1N1)pdm09 replaced the sea-H1N1 after the pandemic. The majority of influenza A cases (90%) were aged <5 years with incidence rate of 537 (387–775) per 100 000 population. Annual incidence rates of hospitalized influenza cases for pre-, initial and post-pandemic periods among children aged <5 year were 474, 452, and 387 per 100 000, respectively. Children with A(H1N1)pdm09 were elder, visited the hospital earlier, less frequently had severe signs, and were less frequently associated with viral coinfection compared with seasonal influenza cases. CONCLUSIONS: The A(H1N1)pdm09 did not increase the influenza annual hospitalization incidence or disease severity compared with seasonal influenza among pediatric ARI cases in central Vietnam.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.199807115,-0.12638718599999998,-0.069016218,0.150036935,-0.003218264,0.249338368,-0.1388996,-0.007798738,-0.020809816000000002,-0.131048697,0.029647424,0.043906657,-0.016094908999999998,-0.06840448,0.012547996,0.046704122,-0.023973627999999997,-0.038483329,-0.033297486,-0.070879987,-0.040941443,0.05640825,-0.044935305999999994,-0.029883141000000002,-0.052368798,0.063695247,-0.041471856,0.068861838,0.038793657,0.056255885
801,Detection of Influenza Virus Infection Using Two PCR Methods,"Rapid, accurate, and cost-effective methods to identify the cause of respiratory tract infections are needed to maximize clinical benefit. Outpatients with acute respiratory illness were tested for influenza using a singleplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (SRT-PCR) method. A multiplex RT-PCR (MRT-PCR) method tested for influenza and 17 other viruses and was compared with SRT-PCR using chi-square tests. Among 935 patients, 335 (36%) tested positive for influenza A and influenza B using SRT-PCR. Using MRT-PCR, 320 (34.2%) tested positive for influenza A and influenza B.

804,Viral etiology of community-acquired pneumonia among adolescents and adults with mild or moderate severity and its relation to age and severity,"BACKGROUND: Better knowledge of distribution of respiratory viruses (RVs) in adolescents and adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is needed. METHODS: To investigate the RVs etiology among adolescents and adults with CAP, according to age and pneumonia severity index (PSI), a multi-center, prospective study was conducted from November 2010 to April 2012. Fifteen RVs were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Bacteria were detected by urinary antigen, conventional culture and PCR. RESULTS: Mean (SD) age and median (IQR) PSI score of 954 patients enrolled was 45.2 (19.5) years (range 14–94) and 42 (36). RVs were found in 262 patients (27.5%): influenza virus A (IFV A, 9.9%) comprised of pandemic H1N1 (6.7%) and seasonal H3N2 (3.5%), human rhinovirus (4.3%), adenovirus (4.2%), human metapneumovirus (1.8%), parainfluenza virus 1, 3 and 2 (1.7%, 1.5% and 1.2%). Influenza virus B, enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human coronavirus and parainfluenza virus 4 were rarely detected (<1%). Frequency of IFV A was highest among patients aged between 45–64 years (p < 0.001), while adenovirus among patients aged 14–17 years (p < 0.001), no differences was found in other RVs. The proportion of pandemic H1N1 increased with severity of pneumonia evaluated by PSI (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of RVs in CAP is higher than previously reported. IFV A pneumonia are usually found in patients older than 45 years, while, adenovirus pneumonia are common in adolescents and young adults. Pandemic H1N1 virus is still recognized by PSI as a high-severity pathogen.

805,Viral infections in outpatients with medically attended acute respiratory illness during the 2012–2013 influenza season,"BACKGROUND: While it is known that acute respiratory illness (ARI) is caused by an array of viruses, less is known about co-detections and the resultant comparative symptoms and illness burden. This study examined the co-detections, the distribution of viruses, symptoms, and illness burden associated with ARI between December 2012 and March 2013. METHODS: Outpatients with ARI were assayed for presence of 18 viruses using multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (MRT-PCR) to simultaneously detect multiple viruses. RESULTS: Among 935 patients, 60% tested positive for a single virus, 9% tested positive for ≥1 virus and 287 (31%) tested negative. Among children (<18 years), the respective distributions were 63%, 14%, and 23%; whereas for younger adults (18–49 years), the distributions were 58%, 8%, and 34% and for older adults (≥50 years) the distributions were 61%, 5%, and 32% (P < 0.001). Co-detections were more common in children than older adults (P = 0.01), and less frequent in households without children (P = 0.003). Most frequently co-detected viruses were coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A virus. Compared with single viral infections, those with co-detections less frequently reported sore throat (P = 0.01), missed fewer days of school (1.1 vs. 2 days; P = 0.04), or work (2 vs. 3 days; P = 0.03); other measures of illness severity did not vary. CONCLUSIONS: Among outpatients with ARI, 69% of visits were associated with a viral etiology. Co-detections of specific clusters of viruses were observed in 9% of ARI cases particularly in children, were less frequent in households without children, and were less symptomatic (e.g., lower fever) than single infections.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.214055036,-0.113258363,-0.08765691,0.061157376,0.050614152999999995,-0.050002219,0.016423359,-0.036007286,0.01937639,-0.008250641999999999,0.031170726,-0.020429667,-0.013954715,-0.023644855,0.027709317,0.00455394,-0.018584054,-0.065033396,0.027272794,-0.025722767,-0.072038306,0.041873184,-0.041503187000000004,0.047696265999999994,-0.027795577000000002,0.061627224,-0.0016459270000000002,-0.00961197,0.025621302999999998,-0.031463575
808,Molecular Typing and Epidemiology Profiles of Human Adenovirus Infection among Paediatric Patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Infection in China,"BACKGROUND: Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) have been recognised as pathogens that cause a broad spectrum of diseases. The studies on HAdV infection among children with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) are limited. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence, epidemiology, and genotype of HAdV among children with SARI in China. STUDY DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) or induced sputum (IS) was collected from hospitalised children with SARIs in Beijing (representing Northern China; n = 259) and Zhejiang Province (representing Eastern China; n = 293) from 2007 to 2010. The prevalence of HAdV was screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by sequence typing of PCR fragments that targeted the second half of the hexon gene. In addition, co-infection with other human respiratory viruses, related epidemiological profiles and clinical presentations were investigated. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In total, 76 (13.8%) of 552 SARI patients were positive for HAdV, and the infection rates of HAdV in Northern and Eastern China were 20.1% (n = 52) and 8.2% (n = 24), respectively. HAdV co-infection with other respiratory viruses was frequent (infection rates: Northern China, 90.4%; Eastern China, 70.8%). The peak seasons for HAdV-B infection was winter and spring. Additionally, members of multiple species (Human mastadenovirus B, C, D and E) were circulating among paediatric patients with SARI, of which HAdV-B (34/52; 65.4%) and HAdV-C (20/24, 83.3%) were the most predominant in Northern and Eastern China, respectively. These findings provide a benchmark for future epidemiology and prevention strategies for HAdV.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.10742951199999999,-0.049884863,-0.046314955,-0.069259191,0.07410417799999999,-0.023185837,0.039932142000000004,-0.031190811000000002,0.025701465,-0.018779879,-0.021870324,0.056706775,-0.029677576,-0.033027753,0.032812205,-0.0238056,-0.094656023,0.03633904,-0.030642216,-0.053704525,0.036337913,0.236394374,-0.031905493,0.05549119,-0.141806773,0.137882157,-0.034029968,0.326958778,-0.126090266,0.020447585
830,Viral Co-Infections in Pediatric Patients Hospitalized with Lower Tract Acute Respiratory Infections,"BACKGROUND: Molecular techniques can often reveal a broader range of pathogens in respiratory infections. We aim to investigate the prevalence and age pattern of viral co-infection in children hospitalized with lower tract acute respiratory infection (LT-ARI), using molecular techniques. METHODS: A nested polymerase chain reaction approach was used to detect Influenza (A, B), metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza (1–4), rhinovirus, adenovirus (A—F), bocavirus and coronaviruses (NL63, 229E, OC43) in respiratory samples of children with acute respiratory infection prospectively admitted to any of the GENDRES network hospitals between 2011–2013. The results were corroborated in an independent cohort collected in the UK. RESULTS: A total of 204 and 97 nasopharyngeal samples were collected in the GENDRES and UK cohorts, respectively. In both cohorts, RSV was the most frequent pathogen (52.9% and 36.1% of the cohorts, respectively). Co-infection with multiple viruses was found in 92 samples (45.1%) and 29 samples (29.9%), respectively; this was most frequent in the 12–24 months age group. The most frequently observed co-infection patterns were RSV—Rhinovirus (23 patients, 11.3%, GENDRES cohort) and RSV—bocavirus / bocavirus—influenza (5 patients, 5.2%, UK cohort). CONCLUSION: The presence of more than one virus in pediatric patients admitted to hospital with LT-ARI is very frequent and seems to peak at 12–24 months of age. The clinical significance of these findings is unclear but should warrant further analysis.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.289960522,-0.126856348,-0.104811907,0.053000647000000005,0.06988045,-0.08538138099999999,0.01459198,-0.069361568,0.060656314,-0.01647439,0.014610768,-0.033298415,-0.013816113,0.0018601470000000001,-0.006619376,-0.009909771999999999,0.025967472999999998,-0.00363286,0.044155489000000006,0.001448189,0.0061472,-0.093313378,0.009165844,-0.021111657000000002,0.073610725,-0.085332559,0.077557261,0.07403548,-0.059046790999999994,0.01160576
833,New Epidemiological and Clinical Signatures of 18 Pathogens from Respiratory Tract Infections Based on a 5-Year Study,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a heavy burden on society. However, due to the complex etiology of RTIs, the clinical diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of these infections remain challenging, especially in developing countries. METHODS: To determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 18 respiratory pathogens, we analyzed 12,502 patients with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) by performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on patient pharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: Samples positive for at least 1 pathogen were obtained from 48.42% of the total patients. Of these pathogen-positive patients, 17.99% were infected with more than 1 pathogen. Of the 18 pathogens analyzed, four were detected with a positive detection rate (PDR) > 5%: influenza A virus (IAV) > respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) >Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) > human coronavirus (HCoV). The pathogens with the 4 highest co-infection rates (CIRs) were as follows: HCoV > human bocavirus (HBoV) > enterovirus (EV) > parainfluenza virus (PIV). The overall positive detection rate (PDR) varied significantly according to patient age, the season and year of detection, and the disease subgroup, but not according to patient sex. The individual PDRs of the pathogens followed 3 types of distributions for patient sex, 4 types of distributions for patient age, 4 types of seasonal distributions, 2 types of seasonal epidemic trends, 4 types of yearly epidemic trends, and different susceptibility distributions in the disease subgroups. Additionally, the overall CIR showed significantly different distributions according to patient sex, patient age, and the disease subgroup, whereas the CIRs of individual pathogens suggested significant preference characteristics. CONCLUSION: IAV remains the most common pathogen among the pathogens analyzed. More effort should be directed toward the prevention and control of pathogens that show a trend of increasing incidence such as HCoV, human adenovirus (ADV), and RSV. Although clinically distinguishing specific pathogens responsible for RTIs is difficult, the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the various RTI-causing agents could provide clues for clinicians, thereby informing decisions regarding prevention and medication and guiding appropriate public health strategies.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.203165199,-0.057445265999999995,-0.042998905,0.005135567,0.031267455,-0.041058705,0.041757364,0.005666873,0.02702429,0.043044035,-0.01870181,0.064598634,0.099962824,0.014587008,0.029037386000000002,-0.016650171000000002,-0.041768962,-0.008436451,-0.015345214,0.004624235,0.01631345,-0.025543126,0.034163347999999996,-0.052461827,0.044211043,-0.024947193,0.044793346,0.08976879300000001,0.0033759140000000003,0.001726743
835,"Viral and atypical bacterial aetiologies of infection in hospitalised patients admitted with clinical suspicion of influenza in Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia","BACKGROUND: Influenza constitutes a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. There is limited information about the aetiology of infection presenting clinically as influenza in hospitalised adults and children in South-East Asia. Such data are important for future management of respiratory infections. OBJECTIVES: To describe the aetiology of infection presenting clinically as influenza in those hospitalised in South-East Asia. METHODS: Respiratory specimens archived from July 2008 to June 2009 from patients hospitalised with suspected influenza from Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam were tested for respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A total of 1222 patients’ samples were tested. Of 1222, 776 patients (63·5%) were under the age of 5. Viruses detected included rhinoviruses in 229 of 1222 patients (18·7%), bocaviruses in 200 (16·4%), respiratory syncytial viruses in 144 (11·8%), parainfluenza viruses in 140 (11·5%; PIV1: 32; PIV2: 12; PIV3: 71; PIV4: 25), adenovirus in 102 (8·4%), influenza viruses in 93 (7·6%; influenza A: 77; influenza B: 16) and coronaviruses in 23 (1·8%; OC43: 14; E229: 9). Bacterial pathogens were Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 33, 2·7%), Chlamydophila psittaci (n = 2), C. pneumoniae (n = 1), Bordetella pertussis (n = 1) and Legionella pneumophila (n = 2). Overall, in-hospital case fatality rate was 29 of 1222 (2·4%). CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses were the most commonly detected pathogens in patients hospitalised with a clinical suspicion of influenza. Rhinovirus was the most frequently detected virus, and M. pneumoniae, the most common atypical bacterium.

838,Viral and bacterial etiology of severe acute respiratory illness among children < 5 years of age without influenza in Niger,"BACKGROUND: Globally, pneumonia is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children, with the highest burden experienced in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. However, there is a dearth of information on the etiology of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in Africa, including Niger. METHODS: We implemented a retrospective study as part of national influenza sentinel surveillance in Niger. We randomly selected a sample of nasopharyngeal specimens collected from children <5 years of age hospitalized with SARI from January 2010 through December 2012 in Niger. The samples were selected from individuals that tested negative by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for influenza A and B virus. The samples were analyzed using the Fast Track Diagnostic Respiratory Pathogens 21plus Kit (BioMérieux, Luxemburg), which detects 23 respiratory pathogens including 18 viral and 5 bacterial agents. RESULTS: Among the 160 samples tested, 138 (86 %) tested positive for at least one viral or bacterial pathogen; in 22 (16 %) sample, only one pathogen was detected. We detected at least one respiratory virus in 126 (78 %) samples and at least one bacterium in 102 (64 %) samples. Respiratory syncytial virus (56/160; 35 %), rhinovirus (47/160; 29 %) and parainfluenza virus (39/160; 24 %) were the most common viral pathogens detected. Among bacterial pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae (90/160; 56 %) and Haemophilus influenzae type b (20/160; 12 %) predominated.

839,Impact of antibacterials on subsequent resistance and clinical outcomes in adult patients with viral pneumonia: an opportunity for stewardship,"INTRODUCTION: Respiratory viruses are increasingly recognized as significant etiologies of pneumonia among hospitalized patients. Advanced technologies using multiplex molecular assays and polymerase-chain reaction increase the ability to identify viral pathogens and may ultimately impact antibacterial use. METHOD: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study to evaluate the impact of antibacterials in viral pneumonia on clinical outcomes and subsequent multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infections/colonization. Patients admitted from March 2013 to November 2014 with positive respiratory viral panels (RVP) and radiographic findings of pneumonia were included. Patients transferred from an outside hospital or not still hospitalized 72 hours after the RVP report date were excluded. Patients were categorized based on exposure to systemic antibacterials: less than 3 days representing short-course therapy and 3 to 10 days being long-course therapy. RESULTS: A total of 174 patients (long-course, n = 67; short-course, n = 28; mixed bacterial-viral infection, n = 79) were included with most being immunocompromised (56.3 %) with active malignancy the primary etiology (69.4 %). Rhinovirus/Enterovirus (23 %), Influenza (19 %), and Parainfluenza (15.5 %) were the viruses most commonly identified. A total of 13 different systemic antibacterials were used as empiric therapy in the 95 patients with pure viral infection for a total of 466 days-of-therapy. Vancomycin (50.7 %), cefepime (40.3 %), azithromycin (40.3 %), meropenem (23.9 %), and linezolid (20.9 %) were most frequently used. In-hospital mortality did not differ between patients with viral pneumonia in the short-course and long-course groups. Subsequent infection/colonization with a MDRO was more frequent in the long-course group compared to the short-course group (53.2 vs 21.1 %; P = 0.027). CONCLUSION: This study found that long-course antibacterial use in the setting of viral pneumonia had no impact on clinical outcomes but increased the incidence of subsequent MDRO infection/colonization.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.171073681,-0.059391044000000004,-0.097630575,-0.07089108200000001,-0.076316589,-0.038173885,-0.031911609,0.09741761,-0.143542665,0.066849502,-0.037153278,-0.01391244,0.006602294,0.039288422999999996,-0.04492153,-0.008480415,0.0055687869999999995,0.049288077,-0.019053268999999998,0.070658668,-0.008252188,0.0006579019999999999,-0.018714106,-0.001850421,-0.01014667,-0.04436699400000001,0.021888325,-0.048780576,-0.056621439,0.027752746000000002
840,Viral aetiology of common colds of outpatient children at primary care level and the use of antibiotics,"Although antibiotics are ineffective against viral respiratory infections, studies have shown high rates of prescriptions worldwide. We conducted a study in Brazil to determine the viral aetiologies of common colds in children and to describe the use of antibiotics for these patients. Children up to 12 years with common colds were enrolled from March 2008-February 2009 at a primary care level facility and followed by regular telephone calls and medical consultations. A nasopharyngeal wash was obtained at enrollment and studied by direct fluorescence assay and polymerase chain reaction for nine different types of virus. A sample of 134 patients was obtained, median age 2.9 years (0.1-11.2 y). Respiratory viruses were detected in 73.9% (99/134) with a coinfection rate of 30.3% (30/99). Rhinovirus was the most frequent virus (53/134; 39.6%), followed by influenza (33/134; 24.6%) and respiratory syncytial virus (8/134; 13.4%).

841,Detection of respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus in healthy infants,"BACKGROUND: Despite the research importance of rhinovirus detection in asymptomatic healthy infants, the literature remains sparse. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (and its species). METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 110 healthy, non-hospitalized infants without acute illness at an academic medical center from November 2013 through May 2014. We tested nasal swab specimens by using polymerase chain reaction and genetic sequencing. RESULTS: Overall, the median age was 3.8 months (IQR 2.0–5.1 months), 56 % were male, and 90 % were born >37 weeks. RSV was detected in nasal swabs from infants (1.8 %). By contrast, rhinovirus was detected in nasal swabs from 16 infants (14.5 %). Molecular typing assay revealed rhinovirus species: six rhinovirus-A (5.5 %), one rhinovirus-B (0.9 %), eight rhinovirus-C (7.3 %), and one untypeable (0.9 %). CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study of healthy, community-based infants, RSV was rare (<2 %) in nasal swabs, while rhinovirus was detected in 14.5 % with a predominance of rhinovirus-A and -C. These finding are important for understanding the clinical significance of rhinovirus detection among infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.164913902,-0.09108388099999999,-0.028173342,-0.001144035,0.053534617,-0.082995295,0.080306591,-0.064320976,0.06753870599999999,-0.041009796,0.031313155,-0.06111226,-0.078090508,-0.08662931300000001,0.040643168,0.051032306,0.014867683000000001,-0.06973557400000001,0.104832094,-0.054896457999999995,-0.043256862,-0.14411869800000002,-0.047559826,-0.013806743,0.126459672,-0.053129515,0.10661992,0.11362454,0.004701454,-0.037553249
849,Prevalence and characteristics of hypoxic hepatitis in the largest single-centre cohort of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus-infected patients with severe liver impairment in the intensive care unit,"Avian influenza A(H7N9) virus (A(H7N9)) emerged in February 2013. Liver impairment of unknown cause is present in 29% of patients with A(H7N9) infection, some of whom experience severe liver injury. Hypoxic hepatitis (HH) is a type of acute severe liver injury characterized by an abrupt, massive increase in serum aminotransferases resulting from anoxic centrilobular necrosis of liver cells. In the intensive care unit (ICU), the prevalence of HH is ∼1%–2%. Here, we report a 1.8% (2/112) incidence of HH in the largest single-centre cohort of ICU patients with A(H7N9) infection. Both HH patients presented with multiple organ failure (MOF) involving respiratory, cardiac, circulatory and renal failure and had a history of chronic heart disease. On admission, severe liver impairment was found. Peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values were 937 and 1281 U/L, and 3117 and 3029 U/L, respectively, in the two patients. Unfortunately, both patients died due to deterioration of MOF. A post-mortem biopsy in case 1 confirmed the presence of centrilobular necrosis of the liver, and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of A(H7N9)-specific genes was negative, which excluded A(H7N9)-related hepatitis. The incidence of HH in A(H7N9) patients is similar to that in ICU patients with other aetiologies. It seems that patients with A(H7N9) infection and a history of chronic heart disease with a low left ventricular ejection fraction on admission are susceptible to HH, which presents as a marked elevation in ALT at the time of admission.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.085718104,-0.003910269,-0.063320625,-0.114617985,-0.062829421,0.034578803,-0.067803394,0.082035633,-0.08595781300000001,0.008015555,-0.019911658999999998,0.029338727000000002,-0.00135283,0.075315311,-0.038533077,0.026468755,0.007796103,0.06576506900000001,0.005376205,0.038543647,0.077421185,-0.075655885,-0.049194617999999996,0.001809285,-0.039439825,-0.031727552,-0.021930836000000002,0.009422729,-0.047601992999999995,-0.010722364
850,"Molecular characterization of human coronaviruses and their circulation dynamics in Kenya, 2009–2012","BACKGROUND: Human Coronaviruses (HCoV) are a common cause of respiratory illnesses and are responsible for considerable morbidity and hospitalization across all age groups especially in individuals with compromised immunity. There are six known species of HCoV: HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV and SARS-HCoV. Although studies have shown evidence of global distribution of HCoVs, there is limited information on their presence and distribution in Kenya. METHODS: HCoV strains that circulated in Kenya were retrospectively diagnosed and molecularly characterized. A total of 417 nasopharyngeal specimens obtained between January 2009 and December 2012 from around Kenya were analyzed by a real time RT-PCR using HCoV-specific primers. HCoV-positive specimens were subsequently inoculated onto monolayers of LL-CMK2 cells. The isolated viruses were characterized by RT-PCR amplification and sequencing of the partial polymerase (pol) gene. RESULTS: The prevalence of HCoV infection was as follows: out of the 417 specimens, 35 (8.4 %) were positive for HCoV, comprising 10 (2.4 %) HCoV-NL63, 12 (2.9 %) HCoV-OC43, 9 (2.1 %) HCoV-HKU1, and 4 (1 %) HCoV-229E. The Kenyan HCoV strains displayed high sequence homology to the prototypes and contemporaneous strains. Evolution analysis showed that the Kenyan HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 isolates were under purifying selection. Phylogenetic evolutionary analyses confirmed the identities of three HCoV-HKU1, five HCoV-NL63, eight HCoV-OC43 and three HCoV-229E. CONCLUSIONS: There were yearly variations in the prevalence and circulation patterns of individual HCoVs in Kenya.

852,"Influenza hospitalization epidemiology from a severe acute respiratory infection surveillance system in Jordan, January 2008–February 2014","BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Influenza typically contributes substantially to the burden of ARI, but only limited data are available on influenza activity and seasonality in Jordan. METHODS: Syndromic case definitions were used to identify individuals with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) admitted to four sentinel hospitals in Jordan. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza using real‐time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and typed as influenza A or B, with influenza A further subtyped. RESULTS: From January 2008–February 2014, 2891 SARI cases were tested for influenza, and 257 (9%) were positive. While 73% of all SARI cases were under 5 years of age, only 57% of influenza‐positive cases were under 5 years of age. Eight (3%) influenza‐positive cases died. An annual seasonal pattern of influenza activity was observed. The proportion of influenza‐positive cases peaked during November–January (14–42%) in the non‐pandemic years. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in Jordan. The seasonal pattern of influenza aligns with known Northern Hemisphere seasonality.

856,"Epidemiological study of canine parvovirus infection in and around Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India","AIM: An epidemiological study of canine parvovirus infection in dogs in and around Bhubaneswar, Odisha was conducted between December 2012 to March 2013 and prevalence rate was studied on the basis of age, breed, and sex. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 71 fecal samples from suspected diarrheic dogs were collected in sterile phosphate buffer saline (10% W/V) and examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of canine parvo virus infection, followed by epidemiological study in relation to age, breed, and sex. RESULTS: Of 71 samples analyzed, 29 (40.85%) were found to be positive by PCR assay. The infection was higher in Deshi/local breeds (34.48%), followed by German shepherd (17.24%), equal incidences in mixed and Labrador retriever (10.34%), Rottweiler and German spitz showed 6.90% each and finally lower incidences in four breeds (3.45%) such as Dalmatians, Nea politan mastiff, Pug and Great Dane. Age-wise prevalence study revealed the infection being more in the age group of 3-6 months (41.37%), followed by equal incidences of 27.59% in 1-3 months and 6-12 months age group, and a low incidence in age groups above 12 months (3.45%). The incidence was predominantly higher in males (86.21%) than females (13.79%).

858,"Epidemiology, Seasonality and Treatment of Hospitalized Adults and Adolescents with Influenza in Jingzhou, China, 2010-2012","BACKGROUND: After the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, we conducted hospital-based severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance in one central Chinese city to assess disease burden attributable to influenza among adults and adolescents. METHODS: We defined an adult SARI case as a hospitalized patient aged ≥ 15 years with temperature ≥38.0°C and at least one of the following: cough, sore throat, tachypnea, difficulty breathing, abnormal breath sounds on auscultation, sputum production, hemoptysis, chest pain, or chest radiograph consistent with pneumonia. For each enrolled SARI case-patient, we completed a standardized case report form, and collected a nasopharyngeal swab within 24 hours of admission. Specimens were tested for influenza viruses by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). We analyzed data from adult SARI cases in four hospitals in Jingzhou, China from April 2010 to April 2012. RESULTS: Of 1,790 adult SARI patients enrolled, 40% were aged ≥ 65 years old. The median duration of hospitalization was 9 days. Nearly all were prescribed antibiotics during their hospitalization, less than 1% were prescribed oseltamivir, and 28% were prescribed corticosteroids. Only 0.1% reported receiving influenza vaccination in the past year. Of 1,704 samples tested, 16% were positive for influenza. Influenza activity in all age groups showed winter-spring and summer peaks. Influenza-positive patients had a longer duration from illness onset to hospitalization and a shorter duration from hospital admission to discharge or death compared to influenza negative SARI patients. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial burden of influenza-associated SARI hospitalizations in Jingzhou, China, especially among older adults.

860,Infection with and Carriage of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in Children,"“Atypical” pneumonia was described as a distinct and mild form of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) already before Mycoplasma pneumoniae had been discovered and recognized as its cause. M. pneumoniae is detected in CAP patients most frequently among school-aged children from 5 to 15 years of age, with a decline after adolescence and tapering off in adulthood. Detection rates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or serology in children with CAP admitted to the hospital amount 4–39%. Although the infection is generally mild and self-limiting, patients of every age can develop severe or extrapulmonary disease. Recent studies indicate that high rates of healthy children carry M. pneumoniae in the upper respiratory tract and that current diagnostic PCR or serology cannot discriminate between M. pneumoniae infection and carriage. Further, symptoms and radiologic features are not specific for M. pneumoniae infection. Thus, patients may be unnecessarily treated with antimicrobials against M. pneumoniae. Macrolides are the first-line antibiotics for this entity in children younger than 8 years of age. Overall macrolides are extensively used worldwide, and this has led to the emergence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae, which may be associated with severe clinical features and more extrapulmonary complications. This review focuses on the characteristics of M. pneumoniae infections in children, and exemplifies that simple clinical decision rules may help identifying children at high risk for CAP due to M. pneumoniae. This may aid physicians in prescribing appropriate first-line antibiotics, since current diagnostic tests for M. pneumoniae infection are not reliably predictive.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.20710093899999998,-0.085548504,-0.075177841,-0.070973096,-0.049419425999999995,-0.107482496,0.038905519,0.030386602999999998,-0.10321401599999999,0.08811515800000001,-0.059227592999999995,-0.036272474,0.016443616,-0.08788954199999999,-0.060817312000000005,-0.006678391999999999,-0.025445697000000003,0.01982251,-0.07573139599999999,0.03757028,-0.043111609,0.202222467,0.252268316,0.039852328,0.08736104199999999,0.003678421,-0.006154756,0.064962298,0.155885837,0.010809198
863,"Surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections in Southern Arizona, 2010–2014","BACKGROUND: The Binational Border Infectious Disease Surveillance program began surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) on the US–Mexico border in 2009. Here, we describe patients in Southern Arizona. METHODS: Patients admitted to five acute care hospitals that met the SARI case definition (temperature ≥37·8°C or reported fever or chills with history of cough, sore throat, or shortness of breath in a hospitalized person) were enrolled. Staff completed a standard form and collected a nasopharyngeal swab which was tested for selected respiratory viruses by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: From October 2010–September 2014, we enrolled 332 SARI patients. Fifty‐two percent were male and 48% were white non‐Hispanic. The median age was 63 years (47% ≥65 years and 5·2% <5 years). During hospitalization, 51 of 230 (22%) patients required intubation, 120 of 297 (40%) were admitted to intensive care unit, and 28 of 278 (10%) died. Influenza vaccination was 56%. Of 309 cases tested, 49 (16%) were positive for influenza viruses, 25 (8·1%) for human metapneumovirus, 20 (6·5%) for parainfluenza viruses, 16 (5·2%) for coronavirus, 11 (3·6%) for respiratory syncytial virus, 10 (3·2%) for rhinovirus, 4 (1·3%) for rhinovirus/enterovirus, 3 (1·0%) for enteroviruses, and 3 (1·0%) for adenovirus. Among the 49 influenza‐positive specimens, 76% were influenza A (19 H3N2, 17 H1N1pdm09, and 1 not subtyped), and 24% were influenza B.

864,Clinical Presentation and Birth Outcomes Associated with Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Pregnancy,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of viral pneumonia in children worldwide. A maternal vaccine may protect both the mother and infant from RSV illness. The epidemiology and clinical presentation of RSV in pregnant and postpartum women is not well-described. METHODS: Data were collected from a prospective, randomized trial of influenza immunization in pregnant women in rural southern Nepal. Women were enrolled in their second trimester of pregnancy and followed until six months postpartum. Active weekly home-based surveillance for febrile respiratory illness was performed. Mid-nasal swabs collected with episodes of respiratory illness were tested for RSV by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: RSV was detected in 14 (0.4%) illness episodes in 3693 women over 3554 person-years of surveillance from 2011–2014. RSV incidence was 3.9/1000 person-years overall, and 11.8/1000 person-years between September and December. Seven (50%) women sought care for RSV illness; none died. Of the 7 (50%) illness episodes during pregnancy, all had live births with 2 (29%) preterm births and a median birthweight of 3060 grams. This compares to 469 (13%) preterm births and a median birthweight of 2790 grams in women without RSV during pregnancy.

866,Does Viral Co-Infection Influence the Severity of Acute Respiratory Infection in Children?,"BACKGROUND: Multiple viruses are often detected in children with respiratory infection but the significance of co-infection in pathogenesis, severity and outcome is unclear. OBJECTIVES: To correlate the presence of viral co-infection with clinical phenotype in children admitted with acute respiratory infections (ARI). METHODS: We collected detailed clinical information on severity for children admitted with ARI as part of a Spanish prospective multicenter study (GENDRES network) between 2011–2013. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach was used to detect respiratory viruses in respiratory secretions. Findings were compared to an independent cohort collected in the UK. RESULTS: 204 children were recruited in the main cohort and 97 in the replication cohort. The number of detected viruses did not correlate with any markers of severity. However, bacterial superinfection was associated with increased severity (OR: 4.356; P-value = 0.005), PICU admission (OR: 3.342; P-value = 0.006), higher clinical score (1.988; P-value = 0.002) respiratory support requirement (OR: 7.484; P-value < 0.001) and longer hospital length of stay (OR: 1.468; P-value < 0.001). In addition, pneumococcal vaccination was found to be a protective factor in terms of degree of respiratory distress (OR: 2.917; P-value = 0.035), PICU admission (OR: 0.301; P-value = 0.011), lower clinical score (-1.499; P-value = 0.021) respiratory support requirement (OR: 0.324; P-value = 0.016) and oxygen necessity (OR: 0.328; P-value = 0.001). All these findings were replicated in the UK cohort. CONCLUSION: The presence of more than one virus in hospitalized children with ARI is very frequent but it does not seem to have a major clinical impact in terms of severity. However bacterial superinfection increases the severity of the disease course. On the contrary, pneumococcal vaccination plays a protective role.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.158855475,-0.084062255,-0.070174716,-0.013844886,5.25e-06,-0.083187583,0.050040148,-0.041325001,0.048993265999999994,0.02123282,0.006234473000000001,-0.025761026,-0.017855328,-0.035158973999999996,0.01604506,0.024541621,-0.01339289,-0.044278662999999996,0.011656111,-0.019552093,-0.03399706,0.006417541,-0.023142958999999998,0.011556251000000002,-0.006059767,0.024983942000000002,-0.023770602000000002,-0.053071314,0.017573734,-0.036623697000000004
870,Presentation and outcome of Middle East respiratory syndrome in Saudi intensive care unit patients,"BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection is associated with high mortality rates but limited clinical data have been reported. We describe the clinical features and outcomes of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of data from all adult (>18 years old) patients admitted to our 20-bed mixed ICU with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection between October 1, 2012 and May 31, 2014. Diagnosis was confirmed in all patients using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on respiratory samples. RESULTS: During the observation period, 31 patients were admitted with MERS-CoV infection (mean age 59 ± 20 years, 22 [71 %] males). Cough and tachypnea were reported in all patients; 22 (77.4 %) patients had bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Invasive mechanical ventilation was applied in 27 (87.1 %) and vasopressor therapy in 25 (80.6 %) patients during the intensive care unit stay. Twenty-three (74.2 %) patients died in the ICU. Nonsurvivors were older, had greater APACHE II and SOFA scores on admission, and were more likely to have received invasive mechanical ventilation and vasopressor therapy. After adjustment for the severity of illness and the degree of organ dysfunction, the need for vasopressors was an independent risk factor for death in the ICU (odds ratio = 18.33, 95 % confidence interval: 1.11–302.1, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: MERS-CoV infection requiring admission to the ICU is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The need for vasopressor therapy is the main risk factor for death in these patients.

874,Frequent Respiratory Viral Infections in Children with Febrile Neutropenia - A Prospective Follow-Up Study,"OBJECTIVE: Febrile neutropenia is common in children undergoing chemotherapy for the treatment of malignancies. In the majority of cases, the cause of the fever is unknown. Although respiratory viruses are commonly associated with this condition, the etiologic significance of this finding remains unclear and is therefore the subject of this study. STUDY DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected during 87 episodes of febrile neutropenia in children age 0–18 years, being treated at a children’s oncology unit between January 2013 and June 2014. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the presence of 16 respiratory viruses. Follow-up samples were collected from children who tested positive for one or more respiratory viruses. Rhinoviruses were genotyped by VP4/VP2 sequencing. Fisher’s exact test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for group comparisons. RESULTS: At least one respiratory virus was detected in samples from 39 of 87 episodes of febrile neutropenia (45%), with rhinoviruses the most frequently detected. Follow-up samples were collected after a median of 28 days (range, 9–74 days) in 32 of the 39 virus-positive episodes. The respiratory viral infection had resolved in 25 episodes (78%). The same virus was detected at follow-up in one coronavirus and six rhinovirus episodes. Genotyping revealed a different rhinovirus species in two of the six rhinovirus infections. CONCLUSION: The frequency of respiratory viral infections in this group of patients suggests an etiologic role in febrile neutropenia. However, these findings must be confirmed in larger patient cohorts.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.213422525,-0.088498649,-0.082889591,-0.000138662,0.069802585,-0.09623834699999999,0.049320017,-0.028603467999999996,0.022963493999999997,0.031645075,0.025207196,-0.051750093,-0.024082227999999997,-0.010017561,0.067095478,-0.014825143,0.000197811,-0.06433765799999999,0.083068143,-0.014862291000000001,-0.026288531,-0.027322204,-0.082182406,0.029130522000000002,0.005634828000000001,0.059312418,-0.031078346,0.002142148,0.006418764,-0.036768918
878,"Viral etiology of severe acute respiratory infections in hospitalized children in Cameroon, 2011–2013","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) is recognized as an important cause of morbidity, mortality, and hospitalization among children in developing countries. Little is known, however, in tropical countries like Cameroon about the cause and seasonality of respiratory infections, especially in hospitalized settings. Objectives: Our study investigates the viral etiology and seasonality of SARI in hospitalized children in Yaounde, Cameroon. METHODS: Prospective clinic surveillance was conducted to identify hospitalized children aged ≤15 years presenting with respiratory symptoms ≤5‐day duration. Demographic and clinical data, and respiratory specimens were collected. Nasopharyngeal samples were tested for 17 respiratory viruses using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The viral distribution and demographic data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: From September 2011 through September 2013, 347 children aged ≤15 years were enrolled. At least one virus was identified in each of 65·4% children, of which 29·5% were coinfections; 27·3% were positive for human adenovirus (hAdV), 13·2% for human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), 11·5% for rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV), 10·6% for human bocavirus (hBoV), 9·8% for influenza virus (Inf), 6·6% for human parainfluenza virus (hPIV), 5·7% for human coronavirus (hCoV), and 2·3% for human metapneumovirus (hMPV). While hRSV showed seasonal patterns, hAdV and RV/EV were detected throughout the year and no evident temporal patterns were observed for the remaining viruses. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses were associated with a high burden of hospitalizations among children in Cameroon. Nevertheless, additional studies evaluating asymptomatic Cameroonian children will be important in understanding the relationship between viral carriage and disease.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.300906829,-0.168214086,-0.14331629099999998,0.12120365300000001,0.118021495,-0.102326594,0.086880637,-0.124806586,0.157810337,-0.020700671,-0.007000765999999999,0.015980131,0.024116132000000002,-0.02467621,0.021644989,-0.028275974,-0.055319191,-0.019831628,-0.015512296,0.018879006,-0.004386064,0.157149743,-0.010220545,0.057312216,-0.081690417,0.10515474400000001,-0.09168011699999999,0.120684987,-0.019890128,-0.034471832
879,Respiratory Virus Detection and Clinical Diagnosis in Children Attending Day Care,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory viruses often have been studied in children with respiratory tract infection (RTI), but less knowledge exists about viruses in asymptomatic children. We have studied the occurrence of a broad panel of respiratory viruses in apparently healthy children attending day care, taking into account the influence of possible confounding factors, such as age, clinical signs of respiratory tract infection (RTI), location (day-care section) and season. METHODS: We have studied 161 children in two day-care centers, each with separate sections for younger and older children, during four autumn and winter visits over a two-year period. A total of 355 clinical examinations were performed, and 343 nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) were analyzed by semi-quantitative, real-time, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for 19 respiratory pathogens. RESULT: Forty-three percent of all NPS were PCR-positive for ≥ 1 of 13 virus species, with high species variation during visits. Rhinovirus 26% (88/343 NPS), enterovirus 12% (40/343) and parechovirus 9% (30/343) were detected in every visit, and the rates varied in relation to age, day-care section and season. Ten other viruses were detected in ≤ 3% of the NPS. Generally, viruses occurred together in the NPS. In 24% (79/331) of the clinical examinations with available NPS, the children had clear signs of RTI, while in 41% (135/331) they had mild signs, and in 35% (117/331) the children had no signs of RTI. Moreover, viruses were found in 70% (55/79) of children with clear signs of RTI, in 41% (55/135) with mild signs and in 30% (35/117) without any signs of RTI (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Positive PCR tests for respiratory viruses, particularly picornaviruses, were frequently detected in apparently healthy children attending day care.

881,Pertussis in infants: an underestimated disease,"BACKGROUND: The clinical diagnosis of pertussis is not easy in early infancy since clinical manifestations can overlap with several different diseases. Many cases are often misclassified and underdiagnosed. We conducted a retrospective study on infants to assess how often physicians suspected pertussis and the actual frequency of Bordetella pertussis infections. METHODS: We analyzed all infants with age ≤90 days hospitalized from March 2011 until September 2013 for acute respiratory symptoms tested with a Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction able to detect Bordetella pertussis and with a Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction for a multipanel respiratory virus. Therefore, we compared patients with pertussis positive aspirate, patients with respiratory virus positive aspirate and patients with negative aspirate to identify symptoms or clinical findings predictive of pertussis. RESULTS: Out of 215 patients analyzed, 53 were positive for pertussis (24.7 %), 119 were positive for respiratory virus (55.3 %) and 43 had a negative aspirate (20 %). Pertussis was suspected in 22 patients at admission and 16 of them were confirmed by laboratory tests, while 37 infants with different admission diagnosis resulted positive for pertussis. The sensitivity of clinical diagnosis was 30.2 % and the specificity 96.3 %. Infants with pertussis had more often paroxysmal cough, absence of fever and a higher absolute lymphocyte count than infants without pertussis. CONCLUSIONS: Pertussis is a serious disease in infants and it is often unrecognized; some features should help pediatricians to suspect pertussis, but clinical suspicion has a low sensitivity. We suggest a systematic use of Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction to support the clinical suspicion of pertussis in patients with less than 3 months of age hospitalized with acute respiratory symptoms.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.147259291,-0.024426082999999998,-0.028911662999999997,-0.066488984,-0.032752501,-0.058741152000000005,-0.012060888999999998,0.033093731,-0.036338522000000005,0.000564069,0.005195242,0.013092588999999998,-0.021733977,-0.049051200999999996,0.047537237999999996,0.075415125,0.056951919000000004,0.006964554,0.056698717999999995,-0.007818139,-2.54e-05,-0.062601259,-0.05526671,-0.076896277,0.044727234000000005,-0.03378349,0.009480141,0.049112308,0.008271777,-0.08841190199999999
882,Sustained Viremia and High Viral Load in Respiratory Tract Secretions Are Predictors for Death in Immunocompetent Adults with Adenovirus Pneumonia,"The predictors for fatal adenovirus (AdV) pneumonia among immunocompetent adults are unclear. Laboratory-confirmed, hospitalized AdV pneumonia adults were prospectively enrolled in Beijing Chao-Yang hospital from March to June 2013. Clinical data and serial whole blood and respiratory tract secretions from such patients were collected. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify the viral load. A total of 14 AdV pneumonia cases were consecutively enrolled, and four of them were fatal. Ten cases were caused by AdV-55, three by AdV-7 and one by AdV-3. There were no differences in age, gender or underlying diseases between the patients in the fatal cases and surviving cases. At admission (on day 5–7 after illness onset), the patients in fatal cases presented higher initial viral loads in respiratory tract secretions (8.578 ± 2.115 vs 6.263 ± 1.225 Log(10) copies/ml, p = 0.023). All patients in fatal cases presented with viremia on day 12–14 (100% vs 66.7%, p = 0.017). A higher initial viral load in the respiratory tract and sustained viremia (more than 2 weeks) may be predictors for fatal clinical outcomes.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.180586765,-0.030686823,-0.087824704,-0.086758729,-0.052321623,-0.061099345,-0.025572152999999997,0.064106546,-0.069830436,0.008608435,-0.008731758000000001,0.007242581,-0.025536239,0.014917118,-0.031614135,-0.007317896999999999,-0.029186844,0.044923784,-0.003759094,0.024729145,0.00281447,0.045166690999999995,-0.057176458,-0.010597916,-0.03885051,0.017228172,0.03308353,0.037666393,-0.065261531,0.0071811999999999996
884,"Human Respiratory Coronaviruses Detected In Patients with Influenza-Like Illness in Arkansas, USA","Acute respiratory viruses often result in significant morbidity and mortality. The potential impact of human respiratory coronavirus (CoV) infections was underestimated until the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2003, which showed that new, highly pathogenic coronaviruses could be introduced to humans, highlighting the importance of monitoring the circulating coronaviruses. The use of sensitive molecular methods has contributed to the differential diagnosis of viruses circulating in humans. Our study aim was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of human CoV strains circulating in Arkansas, their genetic variability and their association with reported influenza-like symptoms. We analyzed 200 nasal swab samples, collected by the Arkansas Department of Health in 2010, for influenza diagnosis. All samples were from patients showing acute respiratory symptoms while testing negative for influenza. Samples were pre-screened, using a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) multiprobe for coronavirus, and subjected to confirmatory pancoronavirus and/or strain-specific reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR followed by sequence analysis. Seventy-nine samples (39.5%) were positive by qRT-PCR and 35 samples (17.5%) were confirmed by conventional RT-PCR. Twenty-three of the confirmed samples (59%) were sequenced. The most frequent strain detected was HCoV-OC43-like followed by NL63-like; only one sample was positive for HCoV-229E and one for HCoV-HKU1. Feline-like CoV strains were detected in three samples, representing possible evidence of interspecies transmission or a new human strain. Seventeen percent of the coronavirus positive samples were also positive for other respiratory viruses, such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Parainfluenza 2 and 3, and Rhinovirus. Thus, HCoV-OC43, NL63, HKU1 and new feline-like strains were circulating in Arkansas in 2010. HCoV was the sole respiratory virus detected in 16% of the patients who showed acute respiratory symptoms with negative diagnoses for influenza virus.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.235504838,0.125501314,-0.056615633,0.121897215,0.24190434100000002,0.033916504,-0.04842014,-0.050200068,0.102767285,-0.039943276,0.050285540999999996,0.224731349,0.25526514100000003,0.163933841,0.040601447,-0.047001997000000004,0.010258455,-0.058674974000000005,0.014257181,0.008341317,0.031785945,-0.033834046,-0.00245201,-0.012880906000000001,0.064569538,-0.031123467000000002,0.024359963,0.035934826,0.011014785,-0.000796611
885,"Morbidity, Mortality, and Seasonality of Influenza Hospitalizations in Egypt, November 2007-November 2014","BACKGROUND: Influenza typically comprises a substantial portion of acute respiratory infections, a leading cause of mortality worldwide. However, influenza epidemiology data are lacking in Egypt. We describe seven years of Egypt’s influenza hospitalizations from a multi-site influenza surveillance system. METHODS: Syndromic case definitions identified individuals with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) admitted to eight hospitals in Egypt. Standardized demographic and clinical data were collected. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and typed as influenza A or B, and influenza A specimens subtyped. RESULTS: From November 2007–November 2014, 2,936/17,441 (17%) SARI cases were influenza-positive. Influenza-positive patients were more likely to be older, female, pregnant, and have chronic condition(s) (all p<0.05). Among them, 53 (2%) died, and death was associated with older age, five or more days from symptom onset to hospitalization, chronic condition(s), and influenza A (all p<0.05). An annual seasonal influenza pattern occurred from July–June. Each season, the proportion of the season’s influenza-positive cases peaked during November–May (19–41%). CONCLUSIONS: In Egypt, influenza causes considerable morbidity and mortality and influenza SARI hospitalization patterns mirror those of the Northern Hemisphere.

886,"Etiology of Influenza-Like Illnesses from Sentinel Network Practitioners in Réunion Island, 2011-2012","In Réunion Island, despite an influenza surveillance established since 1996 by the sentinel general practitioner’s network, little is known about the etiology of Influenza like-illness (ILI) that differs from influenza viruses in a tropical area. We set up a retrospective study using nasal swabs collected by sentinel GPs from ILI patients in 2011 and 2012. A total of 250 swabs were randomly selected and analyzed by multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) including research of 18 viruses and 4 bacteria. We detected respiratory viruses in 169/222 (76.1%) samples, mostly rhinovirus (23.4%), influenza A virus (21.2%), influenza B virus (12.6%), coronavirus (4.9%) and Human metapneumovirus (3.6%). Nine swabs (5.3% of positive swabs) revealed co-infections with two viruses identified, among which six concerned co-infections with influenza viruses. We observed important seasonal differences, with circulation of Human Metapneumoviruses, RSV A and B and coronavirus only during summer; whereas parainfluenza viruses were identified only during winter. In conclusion, this study highlights a substantial circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens in Réunion Island throughout the year. It shows that ILI are not only attributable to influenza and underlines the need for biological surveillance. As the use of multiplex RT-PCR showed its efficacy, it is now used routinely in the surveillance of ILI.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.22074354899999998,-0.110847705,-0.017279268,0.252827262,0.086891346,0.209542537,-0.106867301,-0.02340385,-0.020705907,-0.072163862,0.022194533,-0.025376087999999998,0.011891967,0.027488997,0.02344947,-0.046654886,0.048741367,-0.07440654599999999,0.035612255,-0.046485437000000004,0.006526481,-0.041086989,-0.011471553,0.019980448,0.057985965,-0.017446927,0.023197184,0.08404773,0.035205493,-0.088941248
890,Ability of device to collect bacteria from cough aerosols generated by adults with cystic fibrosis,"Background: Identifying lung pathogens and acute spikes in lung counts remain a challenge in the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Bacteria from the deep lung may be sampled from aerosols produced during coughing. Methods: A new device was used to collect and measure bacteria levels from cough aerosols of patients with CF. Sputum and oral specimens were also collected and measured for comparison. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus mitis were detected in specimens using Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) molecular assays. Results: Twenty adult patients with CF and 10 healthy controls participated. CF related bacteria (CFRB) were detected in 13/20 (65%) cough specimens versus 15/15 (100%) sputum specimens. Commensal S. mitis was present in 0/17 (0%, p=0.0002) cough specimens and 13/14 (93%) sputum samples. In normal controls, no bacteria were collected in cough specimens but 4/10 (40%) oral specimens were positive for CFRB. Conclusions: Non-invasive cough aerosol collection may detect lower respiratory pathogens in CF patients, with similar specificity and sensitivity to rates detected by BAL, without contamination by oral CFRB or commensal bacteria.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.130186729,0.000899634,0.016161869,-0.08660682199999999,-0.030923621000000002,-0.05455493,-0.015567208999999999,0.042776376,-0.114595059,0.02994331,-0.034727623,0.01497995,-0.017713373,0.044854752000000005,-0.012899215,-0.026763544,-0.0015171520000000001,-0.024754909,0.022393577,-0.041633925,0.015287075,0.01095669,0.070543408,-0.008191346,0.014144141,0.01654309,-0.006060483,0.02430386,0.026886496,-0.049905855
891,"Epidemiology, Co-Infections, and Outcomes of Viral Pneumonia in Adults: An Observational Cohort Study","Advanced technologies using polymerase-chain reaction have allowed for increased recognition of viral respiratory infections including pneumonia. Co-infections have been described for several respiratory viruses, especially with influenza. Outcomes of viral pneumonia, including cases with co-infections, have not been well described. This was observational cohort study conducted to describe hospitalized patients with viral pneumonia including co-infections, clinical outcomes, and predictors of mortality. Patients admitted from March 2013 to November 2014 with a positive respiratory virus panel (RVP) and radiographic findings of pneumonia within 48 h of the index RVP were included. Co-respiratory infection (CRI) was defined as any organism identification from a respiratory specimen within 3 days of the index RVP. Predictors of in-hospital mortality on univariate analysis were evaluated in a multivariate model. Of 284 patients with viral pneumonia, a majority (51.8%) were immunocompromised. A total of 84 patients (29.6%) were found to have a CRI with 48 (57.6%) having a bacterial CRI. Viral CRI with HSV, CMV, or both occurred in 28 patients (33.3%). Fungal (16.7%) and other CRIs (7.1%) were less common. Many patients required mechanical ventilation (54%) and vasopressor support (36%). Overall in-hospital mortality was high (23.2%) and readmissions were common with several patients re-hospitalized within 30 (21.1%) and 90 days (36.7%) of discharge. Predictors of in-hospital mortality on multivariate regression included severity of illness factors, stem-cell transplant, and identification of multiple respiratory viruses. In conclusion, hospital mortality is high among adult patients with viral pneumonia and patients with multiple respiratory viruses identified may be at a higher risk.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.27079422,-0.080458346,-0.167771577,-0.040626695,-0.07122983,-0.071533899,-0.050966312,0.137374007,-0.151611994,0.112089989,-0.055157465999999995,0.0018564570000000002,0.028160701,0.074596657,-0.052612081,-0.028321626000000003,0.033050233,0.052849074,-0.026627507999999998,0.10934432599999999,0.031459243,-0.006168356,-0.038266338,0.032465503,-0.002331568,-0.04422187599999999,0.007172409,-0.054780202,-0.053816017,-0.02854892
892,"Phylogenetic analysis of human rhinoviruses collected over four successive years in Sydney, Australia","BACKGROUND: Human rhinoviruses (HRV) cause a wide spectrum of disease, ranging from a mild influenza‐like illness (ILI) to severe respiratory infection. Molecular epidemiological data are limited for HRV circulating in the Southern Hemisphere. OBJECTIVES: To identify the species and genotypes of HRV from clinical samples collected in Sydney, Australia, from 2006 to 2009. METHODS: Combined nose and throat swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from individuals with ILI were tested for HRV using real‐time reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR). Sequencing data of 5′UTR and VP4/VP2 coding regions on RT‐PCR‐positive specimens were analysed. RESULTS: Human rhinoviruses were detected by real‐time PCR in 20.9% (116/555) of samples tested. Phylogenetic analysis of 5′UTR and VP4/VP2 on HRV‐positive samples was concordant in the grouping of HRV A and B species but not HRV C species. Eighty per cent (16/20) of sequences that grouped as HRV C in the VP4/VP2 tree clustered as HRV A, alongside some previously described C strains as subspecies C/A. Discordant branching was seen within HRV A group: two sequences clustering as A in the VP4/VP2 tree branched within the C/A subspecies in the 5′UTR tree, and one sequence showed identity to different HRV A strains in the two genes. The prevalence of HRV C and C/A species was greater in paediatric compared to adult patients (47.9% vs 25.5%, P = .032). CONCLUSION: Human rhinoviruses are a common cause of respiratory infections, and HRV C is present in the Southern Hemisphere.

894,Microorganisms Causing Community-Acquired Acute Bronchitis: The Role of Bacterial Infection,"BACKGROUND: Although acute bronchitis is quite common, there is relatively limited information regarding the microorganisms that are involved in this illness. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of acute bronchitis at 31 hospitals and clinics in Korea from July 2011 to June 2012. Sputum specimens were collected for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture of microorganisms. RESULTS: Of the 811 enrolled patients, 291 had acceptable sputum specimens that were included for analysis of the etiologic distribution. With multiplex PCR testing, viruses were identified in 36.1% (105/291), most commonly rhinovirus (25.8%) and coronavirus (3.8%). Typical bacteria were isolated in 126/291 (43.3%) patients. Among these patients Haemophilus influenzae (n = 39) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 30) were isolated most commonly; atypical bacteria were identified in 44 (15.1%) patients. Bacteria-only, virus-only, and mixed infections (bacteria plus virus) accounted for 36.7% (98/291), 17.2% (50/291), and 18.9% (55/291) of infections, respectively. In particular, 52.4% of patients with viral infection had a concurrent bacterial infection, and rhinovirus was the most common virus in mixed infections (40/55). Additionally, infections with typical bacteria were more common in patients with chronic lung disease (p = 0.029), and typical bacterial infections showed a trend towards a higher prevalence with older age (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria were associated with almost half of community-acquired acute bronchitis cases.

897,Viral-bacterial coinfection affects the presentation and alters the prognosis of severe community-acquired pneumonia,"BACKGROUND: Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) enables recovery of viruses from airways of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), although their clinical impact remains uncertain. METHODS: Among consecutive adult patients who had undergone a mPCR within 72 hours following their admission to one intensive care unit (ICU), we retrospectively included those with a final diagnosis of CAP. Four etiology groups were clustered: bacterial, viral, mixed (viral-bacterial) and no etiology. A composite criterion of complicated course (hospital death or mechanical ventilation > 7 days) was used. A subgroup analysis compared patients with bacterial and viral-bacterial CAP matched on the bacterial pathogens. RESULTS: Among 174 patients (132 men [76 %], age 63 [53–75] years, SAPSII 38 [27;55], median PSI score 106 [78;130]), bacterial, viral, mixed and no etiology groups gathered 46 (26 %), 53 (31 %), 45 (26 %) and 30 (17 %) patients, respectively. Virus-infected patients displayed a high creatine kinase serum level, a low platelet count, and a trend toward more frequent alveolar-interstitial infiltrates. A complicated course was more frequent in the mixed group (31/45, 69 %), as compared to bacterial (18/46, 39 %), viral (15/53, 28 %) and no etiology (12/30, 40 %) groups (p < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, the mixed (viral-bacterial) infection was independently associated with complicated course (reference: bacterial pneumonia; OR, 3.58; CI 95 %, 1.16–11; p = 0.03). The subgroup analysis of bacteria-matched patients confirmed these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Viral-bacterial coinfection during severe CAP in adults is associated with an impaired presentation and a complicated course.

Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are important cause of mortality and morbidity in children under five in developing country. Methods. This observational study was conducted over two-year period in a tertiary care teaching hospital of Eastern India. Nasal and throat swabs were collected, transported to the laboratory at 2–8°C in viral transport media, and then processed for detection of viruses using mono/multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results. A total of 300 children aged 2–60 months with ARIs were included. The most common age group affected with LRI was 2–12 mo and with URI was >12–60 mo. Viruses were detected in 248 cases. In URI, 77 were positive for single virus and 19 were positive for more than one virus; in LRI, 113 were positive for single virus and 12 were positive for more than one virus. The most common viruses isolated from URI cases were rhinovirus and adenovirus. The most common viruses isolated from LRI cases were respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus. Most cases occurred in the months of January, December, and August. Conclusion. Viruses constitute a significant cause of ARI in children under five.

903,Epidemiology and clinical characteristics of respiratory syncytial virus infections among children and adults in Mexico,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading etiological agent of acute respiratory tract infections and hospitalizations in children. However, little information is available regarding RSV infections in Latin American countries, particularly among adult patients. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of RSV infection and to analyze the factors associated with severe infections in children and adults in Mexico. METHODS: Patients ≥1 month old, who presented with an influenza‐like illness (ILI) to six hospitals in Mexico, were eligible for participation in the study. Multiplex reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction identified viral pathogens in nasal swabs from 5629 episodes of ILI. Patients in whom RSV was detected were included in this report. RESULTS: Respiratory syncytial virus was detected in 399 children and 171 adults. RSV A was detected in 413 cases and RSV B in 163, including six patients who had coinfection with both subtypes; 414 (72.6%) patients required hospital admission, including 96 (16.8%) patients that required admission to the intensive care unit. Coinfection with one or more respiratory pathogens other than RSV was detected in 159 cases. Young age (in children) and older age (in adults) as well as the presence of some underlying conditions were associated with more severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that RSV is an important respiratory pathogen in children in Mexico. In addition, a substantial number of cases in adults were also detected highlighting the relevance of this virus in all ages. It is important to identify subjects at high risk of complications who may benefit from current or future preventive interventions.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.34312312100000003,-0.153961183,-0.170711677,0.064306969,0.017440731,-0.11594038,0.005381224,-0.077657085,0.077899834,-0.035037901,0.008474735,-0.082944676,-0.11783513,-0.050970441,-0.082163583,-0.019366774,-0.028705177000000002,0.06980655,-0.00885253,0.035257282,0.006993676,-0.106096657,-0.0027904329999999997,-0.054084932999999995,0.102857504,-0.118769971,0.19753221699999998,0.134929217,-0.032446433999999996,0.068972533
910,Single- and multiple viral respiratory infections in children: disease and management cannot be related to a specific pathogen,"BACKGROUND: The number of viral pathogens associated with pediatric acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) has grown since the introduction of reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Multiple viruses are detected during a single ARI episode in approximately a quarter of all cases. The clinical relevance of these multiple detections is unclear, as is the role of the individual virus. We therefore investigated the correlation between clinical data and RT-PCR results in children with single- and multiple viral ARI. METHODS: Data from children with ARI were prospectively collected during two winter seasons. RT-PCR testing for 15 viruses was performed in 560 ARI episodes. In the patients with a single-viral etiology, clinical data, laboratory findings, patient management- and outcome data were compared between the different viruses. With this information, we compared data from children of whom RT-PCR data were negative, with children with single- and multiple viral positive results. RESULTS: The viral detection rate was 457/560 (81.6%) of which 331/560 (59.1%) were single infections and 126/560 (22.5%) were multiple infections. In single viral infections, some statistically significant differences in demographics, clinical findings, disease severity and outcome were found between children with different viral etiologies. However, no clinically recognizable pattern was established to be virus-specific. In a multivariate analysis, the only variables that were correlated with longer hospital stay were the use of oxygen and nebulizer therapy, irrespective of the viral pathogen. Children with RT-PCR positive test results had a significant higher disease severity, fever, length of hospital stay, days of extra oxygen supply, and days of antibiotic treatment than children with a negative RT-PCR test result. For children with single- versus children with multiple positive RT-PCR test results, these differences were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Disease (severity), management and outcome in pediatric ARI are not associated with a specific virus. Single- and multiple viral ARI do not significantly differ with regard to clinical outcome and patient management. For general pediatrics, RT-PCR assays should be restricted to pathogens for which therapy is available or otherwise may have clinical consequences.

912,"Comparing Human Metapneumovirus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus: Viral Co-Detections, Genotypes and Risk Factors for Severe Disease","BACKGROUND: It is unclarified as to whether viral co-detection and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) genotypes relate to clinical manifestations in children with HMPV and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), and if the clinical course and risk factors for severe LRTI differ between HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). METHODS: We prospectively enrolled hospitalized children aged <16 years with LRTI from 2006 to 2015. Children were clinically examined, and nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed using semi-quantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction tests for HMPV, RSV and 17 other pathogens. HMPV-positive samples were genotyped. RESULTS: A total of 171 children had HMPV infection. HMPV-infected children with single virus (n = 106) and co-detections (n = 65) had similar clinical manifestations. No clinical differences were found between HMPV genotypes A (n = 67) and B (n = 80). The HMPV-infected children were older (median 17.2 months) than RSV-infected children (median 7.3 months, n = 859). Among single virus-infected children, no differences in age-adjusted LRTI diagnoses were found between HMPV and RSV. Age was an important factor for disease severity among single virus-infected children, where children <6 months old with HMPV had a milder disease than those with RSV, while in children 12–23 months old, the pattern was the opposite. In multivariable logistic regression analysis for each virus type, age ≥12 months (HMPV), and age <6 months (RSV), prematurity, ≥1 chronic disease and high viral loads of RSV, but not high HMPV viral loads, were risk factors for severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalized children with LRTI, HMPV manifests independently of viral co-detections and HMPV genotypes. Disease severity in HMPV- and RSV-infected children varies in relation to age. A history of prematurity and chronic disease increases the risk of severe LRTI among HMPV- and RSV-infected children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.228492565,-0.16676455099999998,-0.090634202,0.066365094,0.049746394000000006,-0.200071985,0.104776967,-0.219382467,0.273566102,-0.136553751,0.057447763,-0.115663639,-0.20939906,-0.048992734,-0.172864008,-0.021998507999999996,-0.08678949300000001,0.287501117,-0.203331039,0.070675191,0.118814985,0.10993286599999999,0.04168013,-0.14140477099999998,-0.095410854,-0.032155697999999996,-0.10232377,-0.136309643,-0.017542247,0.057367189000000006
915,Clinical Features and Courses of Adenovirus Pneumonia in Healthy Young Adults during an Outbreak among Korean Military Personnel,"BACKGROUND: The number of pneumonia patients increased suddenly in Korean military hospitals in late December 2014, indicating the urgent need for an epidemic outbreak investigation. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of pneumonia etiology among immunocompetent young adults admitted to Daejeon Armed Forces hospital. Patient blood and sputum samples were subjected to conventional culture, serology, and polymerase chain reaction tests for respiratory viruses and atypical pathogens. RESULTS: From January to May 2015, we enrolled 191 (189 male) adults with pneumonia; the mean age was 20.1 ± 1.3 years. Five patients had severe pneumonia, and one died. Pathogenic human adenoviruses were most common (HAdV, 153/191 [80.1%]), indicating a HAdV pneumonia outbreak. Genotyping of 35 isolates indicated that 34 matched HAdV-55 and one matched HAdV-2. HAdV pneumonia infected recruit trainees most frequently. High and prolonged fever, nasal congestion, sore throat, and pharyngeal inflammation were significantly more common in the HAdV pneumonia group, compared to patients with other or unknown causes of pneumonia. Only 12% of HAdV pneumonia patients displayed leukocytosis, whereas febrile leukopenia (62.7%) and thrombocytopenia (41%) were commonly observed. HAdV pneumonia patient chest CT scans displayed ground glass opacity (with or without septal thickness) with consolidation in 50.0% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: An outbreak of HAdV respiratory infection occurred at the Korean military training center. HAdV pneumonia exhibited specific laboratory and clinical features, and although most patients were cured without complication, some progressed to respiratory failure and fatality. Therefore, HAdV vaccine should be provided to military trainees in Korea.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.153664513,-0.035604713999999996,-0.079011842,-0.135246232,-0.022644777999999997,-0.035522343,-0.034721344,0.079630548,-0.11191849400000001,0.039550517,-0.049629232,0.062028255,-0.047904335,-0.031588853,-0.032933448,-0.029415797,-0.086350291,0.087768452,-0.070386915,0.008833964,0.036383692,0.25117821100000004,0.020757133,0.03927251,-0.087801999,0.12294978,-0.015380898999999998,0.311377635,-0.175853741,-0.003320026
916,In Vivo Persistence of Human Rhinoviruses in Immunosuppressed Patients,"Several species of the genus Enterovirus cause persistent infections in humans. Human rhinovirus (HRV) infections are generally self-limiting but occasionally persistent infections have been described. This study aimed to identify persistent HRV infections and investigate the clinical and virologic characteristics of patients with persistent infections. From January 2012 to March 2015, 3714 respiratory specimens from 2608 patients were tested for respiratory viruses by using a multiplex reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction. A retrospective study was performed. Patients with at least two specimens positive for HRV/enterovirus taken 45 days or longer apart were identified and the HRV/enteroviruses were typed. Patients with persistent infection were compared to patients with reinfection and patients with cleared infection. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral protein(VP)4/VP2 region was performed. 18 patients with persistent HRV/enterovirus infection were identified. Minimum median duration of persistence was 92 days (range 50–455 days). All but one patients with persistence were immunosuppressed. Immunosuppression and hematologic disorders were more frequent in patients with persistence (n = 18) than in patients with reinfection (n = 33) and with cleared infection (n = 25) (p = 0.003 and p = 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, this retrospective study identified HRV persistence in vivo which occurred mainly in immunosuppressed patients.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.17918111899999997,-0.04972438,-0.10527827199999999,-0.100085083,-0.012236098999999999,-0.08700342400000001,-0.019914888999999998,0.076429745,-0.11313648300000001,0.060959694,-0.045610233,0.00246045,0.00276463,0.111678333,-0.001821388,-0.032519662000000005,0.05471759999999999,0.029801946,0.062804058,0.0074970819999999995,0.074465662,-0.15876378800000002,-0.11775557199999999,0.090910899,-0.09171960400000001,0.093709137,-0.080674786,-0.007809592,0.050305839000000005,0.20775425399999997
920,Detection of viral respiratory pathogens in mild and severe acute respiratory infections in Singapore,"To investigate the performance of laboratory methods and clinical case definitions in detecting the viral pathogens for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) from a prospective community cohort and hospital inpatients, nasopharyngeal swabs from cohort members reporting ARIs (community-ARI) and inpatients admitted with ARIs (inpatient-ARI) were tested by Singleplex Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (SRT-PCR), multiplex RT-PCR (MRT-PCR) and pathogen-chip system (PathChip) between April 2012 and December 2013. Community-ARI and inpatient-ARI was also combined with mild and severe cases of influenza from a historical prospective study as mild-ARI and severe-ARI respectively to evaluate the performance of clinical case definitions. We analysed 130 community-ARI and 140 inpatient-ARI episodes (5 inpatient-ARI excluded because multiple pathogens were detected), involving 138 and 207 samples respectively. Detection by PCR declined with days post-onset for influenza virus; decrease was faster for community-ARI than for inpatient-ARI. No such patterns were observed for non-influenza respiratory virus infections. PathChip added substantially to viruses detected for community-ARI only. Clinical case definitions discriminated influenza from other mild-ARI but performed poorly for severe-ARI and for older participants. Rational strategies for diagnosis and surveillance of influenza and other respiratory virus must acknowledge the differences between ARIs presenting in community and hospital settings.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.141257642,-0.057918222000000005,-0.0033105770000000003,0.06166658,-0.001236123,0.055216947,-0.030601417000000002,-0.005166479,-0.00197178,-0.02691924,0.015246455,-0.0014046360000000001,0.016760248999999998,-0.030833084,0.033901102999999995,0.011603902,0.004255999,-0.066795026,0.020271166,-0.051097683,-0.047589407,0.011608128,-0.013973373999999998,-0.0071955909999999994,0.047860111,0.029780165,0.008422666,0.006769096,0.054099837000000005,-0.060989441
921,Prevalence and risk factors of chlamydia infection in Hong Kong: A population-based geospatial household survey and testing,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia causes infertility and increases risk of HIV infection, and population-based studies provide essential information for effective infection control and prevention. This study examined Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence and risk factors among a representative sample of 18-49-year-old residents in Hong Kong. METHODS: Census boundary map of 412 constituency areas was used as primary sampling units to construct the sampling frame and, residential buildings and units were randomly selected using geospatial modelling. A questionnaire on sexual practice and health was conducted, and polymerase chain reaction was used to test the urine for genital chlamydial infection. Invitation letters were sent to the selected households and a team of interviewers were sent to recruit one subject per household. Prevalence data was weighted according to the 2011 census and risk factors identified through logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 881 participants (response rate of 24.5%), the overall Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence was low at 1.4% (95%CI 0.8–2.5%) but sexually active young (18–26 years) women had relatively high prevalence (5.8%, 95%CI 1.7–18.2%) in Hong Kong. A unique U-shape disease burden was observed with peaks in younger and older (40–49 years) women. Amongst the sexually active women, the risk factors of Chlamydia trachomatis infection were: younger age (aOR = 25.4, 95% CI 2.81–230); living alone (aOR = 8.99, 95% CI 1.46–55.40); and, among all the sexually active participants, males (including the male partners of the female participants) who had travelled out of Hong Kong in the previous 12 months had higher risks of infection (aOR = 5.35; 95% CI 1.25–22.8). A core-peripheral geographical distribution of Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence was also observed. CONCLUSION: Young and older sexually active women in Hong Kong have high prevalence of chlamydia. Routine screening for sexually active women and young men should be considered. Further research on testing feasibility and linkage-to-care are urgently needed to control the infection.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.076700586,-0.049063847,-0.034200917000000004,-0.088772796,-0.009346071999999999,0.021172889,0.015050602,-0.004334328,-0.005765177,-0.076529739,0.024859767999999997,0.05404603,-0.060722829000000006,-0.079980473,-0.055731018,0.10308146300000001,-0.06949569900000001,-0.058610073,0.031557776,-0.03551668,-0.138069062,0.026281729,0.011861245,0.029265517999999997,0.02456433,-0.041571437,0.008044490999999999,-0.15443637699999999,-0.050744200999999996,-0.007177679
923,Human metapnuemovirus infections in hospitalized children and comparison with other respiratory viruses. 2005-2014 prospective study,"BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) has an important etiological role in acute lower respiratory infections in children under five years. Our objectives were to estimate the relative contribution of HMPV to hospitalization in children with acute respiratory infection, to define the clinical and epidemiological features of HMPV single and multiple infections, and to compare HMPV infections with respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), rhinovirus (HRV), adenovirus and human bocavirus infections in the same population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective study performed on all children less than 14 years of age with a respiratory tract disease admitted to a secondary hospital between September 2005- June 2014. Clinical characteristics of patients were analyzed. Nasopharyngeal aspirate was taken at admission for viral study with polymerase chain reaction for 16 respiratory viruses. A total of 3,906 children were included. At least one respiratory virus was detected in 75.2% of them. The most common identified virus was HRSV, followed by HRV. HMPV was detected in 214 cases (5.5%); 133 (62%) were single infections and the remaining were detected in coinfection with other viruses. 90.7% cases were detected between February and May. Children’s mean age was 13.83 ± 18 months. Fever was frequent (69%), and bronchiolitis (27%), and recurrent wheezing (63%) were the main clinical diagnosis. Hypoxia was present in 65% of the patients and 47% of them had an infiltrate in X-ray. Only 6 (2.8%) children were admitted to the intensive care unit. Only the duration of the hospitalization was different, being longer in the coinfections group (p <0.05). There were many differences in seasonality and clinical characteristics between HMPV and other respiratory viruses being more similar to HRSV. CONCLUSIONS: HMPV infections accounted for 5.5% of total viral infections in hospitalized children. The clinical characteristics were similar to HRSV infections, but seasonality and clinical data were different from other viral infections.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.330619909,-0.16798376399999998,-0.152485898,0.074873534,0.060145093,-0.20888961,0.10182548,-0.12098072,0.16769877,0.004354742,0.013447502,-0.087521465,-0.06540103400000001,-0.019842403,-0.049778160999999994,-0.054380883,-0.008343988,0.172113104,-0.086786852,0.08943735400000001,0.110012493,0.05658458,-0.062913396,-0.01447224,-0.104892128,0.093779659,-0.207040572,-0.108110712,0.043159844,0.013431512
929,Is Higher Viral Load in the Upper Respiratory Tract Associated With Severe Pneumonia? Findings From the PERCH Study,"BACKGROUND. The etiologic inference of identifying a pathogen in the upper respiratory tract (URT) of children with pneumonia is unclear. To determine if viral load could provide evidence of causality of pneumonia, we compared viral load in the URT of children with World Health Organization–defined severe and very severe pneumonia and age-matched community controls. METHODS. In the 9 developing country sites, nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs from children with and without pneumonia were tested using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for 17 viruses. The association of viral load with case status was evaluated using logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine optimal discriminatory viral load cutoffs. Viral load density distributions were plotted. RESULTS. The mean viral load was higher in cases than controls for 7 viruses. However, there was substantial overlap in viral load distribution of cases and controls for all viruses. ROC curves to determine the optimal viral load cutoff produced an area under the curve of <0.80 for all viruses, suggesting poor to fair discrimination between cases and controls. Fatal and very severe pneumonia cases did not have higher viral load than less severe cases for most viruses. CONCLUSIONS. Although we found higher viral loads among pneumonia cases than controls for some viruses, the utility in using viral load of URT specimens to define viral pneumonia was equivocal. Our analysis was limited by lack of a gold standard for viral pneumonia.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.13622247199999998,-0.073055637,-0.087908474,-0.009799450999999999,-0.051079975,-0.067404932,0.05095011,0.015349858000000001,-0.063073865,0.059134559,-0.004702238,-0.051798973,-0.014880984,-0.033565637999999995,-0.035710827,-0.014919652,-0.08392991699999999,-0.018820808,-0.041934242999999996,0.021493241,-0.119150033,0.212781463,-0.03195468,0.066050522,-0.073963433,0.02581274,0.08547326300000001,-0.043954678,-0.050977467,0.031774903

Until now, there is no study that proves the association between HBoV and hepatitis. HBoV viremia/DNAemia has been associated closely with acute primary infection and moderate-to-severe illness but, more detailed clinical data about HBoV dissemination are still unavailable. CASE REPORT: Here we report a 2-years-5-months-old girl suffering from respiratory distress and heptitis followed in our intensive care unit.

932,Impact of viral multiplex real-time PCR on management of respiratory tract infection: a retrospective cohort study,"BACKGROUND: Significance and clinical utility of multiple virus detection by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) in respiratory tract infection remain unclear. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed how virus detection affected clinical management. During a 27-month period, clinical and laboratory information was collected from all children and adults in two Swiss tertiary centres whose respiratory samples were tested for respiratory viruses with a 16-plex rtPCR test. RESULTS: Pathogens were identified in 140 of 254 patients (55%); of those patients, there was ≥1 virus in 91 (65%), ≥ 1 bacterium in 53 (38%), and ≥1 virus and bacterium in 11 (8%). Of 80 patients with viral infection, 59 (74%) received antibiotics. Virus detection was associated with discontinuation of antibiotics in 2 of 20 adults (10%) and 6 of 14 children (43%). Overall 12 adults (34%) and 18 children (67%) were managed correctly without antibiotics after virus detection (p = 0.01). When taking biomarkers, radiologic presentations, and antibiotic pre-treatment into account, the impact of rtPCR and appropriateness of therapy for clinically viral infections increased to 100% in children and 62% in adults. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial reduction of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions seems possible. Appropriate application of rtPCR results in respiratory tract infections should be encouraged.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.233904437,-0.076815892,-0.038092031,0.019467814,-0.01819096,-0.095224444,0.017788305,0.000759193,-0.001306484,0.06711151,-0.013365083,-0.03214226,0.023506802,-0.007731836999999999,0.005562429,-0.012201094,-0.006261735,-0.008099544,0.035372381,0.037972481,-0.003082258,-0.01041307,0.019052575,-0.015360418999999998,-0.003067168,0.023781102000000002,-0.010185238000000001,-0.019912322,-0.007897296,0.005828019
933,"A cluster of adenovirus type B55 infection in a neurosurgical inpatient department of a general hospital in Guangdong, China","BACKGROUND: Human adenovirus type 55 is a re‐emerging human respiratory pathogen that is associated with several respiratory infections outbreaks in military and school populations. In this study, we describe the first HAdV55‐associated hospital outbreak documented in Guangdong, China. METHODS: Active surveillance was conducted in the involved neurosurgical inpatient department. All staff and patients in the involved neurosurgical department were surveyed for any symptoms of fever (≥38°C) and enlarged tonsils during the outbreak period. Throat swabs and demographic information were collected for all cases. For each specimen, assays for common respiratory viruses were performed using one‐step reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction. HAdV‐positive samples were inoculated onto Hep‐2 cells for isolation. Hexon genes, fiber genes, penton genes, and whole genomes were sequenced. A phylogenetic tree was constructed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Forty‐three cases, including 24 laboratory‐confirmed cases and 19 possible cases, were identified. Nurses had the highest attack rate of infection, with a rate of 36.4%. The attack rate for doctors and inpatients was 20.0% and 16.7%, respectively. HAdV55 was the sole pathogen identified during this outbreak. The hexon, fiber, and penton genes from seven isolated HAdV55 stains were sequenced. All these genes showed 100% homology and fell into the HAdV55 [P14H11F14] cluster, indicating that HAdV55 was the single viral strain for the outbreak. While not conclusive, the epidemic investigation revealed that the outbreak was introduced by nurses from sources outside the hospital. It was likely that a transmission from staff to inpatients had occurred.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.10518582800000001,0.001380969,-0.045723715,-0.06853648400000001,0.057977481,0.008359684000000001,-0.020386132,0.033209154,-0.00010931399999999999,0.006332709000000001,-0.026121169,0.02293842,-0.016327145,-0.028979672,0.04665467400000001,-0.054452272999999995,-0.05033107,-0.011506328,-0.020430659,-0.030097101,0.030530211,0.09241486199999999,-0.10087472,0.018922356,-0.084173341,0.059395891,0.02721665,0.202835488,-0.07242209,-0.063071986
934,Infants hospitalized for Bordetella pertussis infection commonly have respiratory viral coinfections,"BACKGROUND: Whether viral coinfections cause more severe disease than Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) alone remains unclear. We compared clinical disease severity and sought clinical and demographic differences between infants with B. pertussis infection alone and those with respiratory viral coinfections. We also analyzed how respiratory infections were distributed during the 2 years study. METHODS: We enrolled 53 infants with pertussis younger than 180 days (median age 58 days, range 17–109 days, 64.1% boys), hospitalized in the Pediatric Departments at “Sapienza” University Rome and Bambino Gesù Children’s Hospital from August 2012 to November 2014. We tested in naso-pharyngeal washings B. pertussis and 14 respiratory viruses with real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Clinical data were obtained from hospital records and demographic characteristics collected using a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: 28/53 infants had B. pertussis alone and 25 viral coinfection: 10 human rhinovirus (9 alone and 1 in coinfection with parainfluenza virus), 3 human coronavirus, 2 respiratory syncytial virus. No differences were observed in clinical disease severity between infants with B. pertussis infection alone and those with coinfections. Infants with B. pertussis alone were younger than infants with coinfections, and less often breastfeed at admission. CONCLUSIONS: In this descriptive study, no associations between clinical severity and pertussis with or without co-infections were found.

938,Etiology of acute respiratory disease in fattening pigs in Finland,"BACKGROUND: The objective of our study was to clinically and etiologically investigate acute outbreaks of respiratory disease in Finland. Our study also aimed to evaluate the clinical use of various methods in diagnosing respiratory infections under field conditions and to describe the antimicrobial resistance profile of the main bacterial pathogen(s) found during the study. METHODS: A total of 20 case herds having finishing pigs showing acute respiratory symptoms and eight control herds showing no clinical signs suggesting of respiratory problems were enrolled in the study. Researchers visited each herd twice, examining and bleeding 20 pigs per herd. In addition, nasal swab samples were taken from 20 pigs and three pigs per case herd were necropsied during the first visit. Serology was used to detect Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP), swine influenza virus (SIV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae antibodies. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to investigate the presence of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in serum and SIV in the nasal and lung samples. Pathology and bacteriology, including antimicrobial resistance determination, were performed on lung samples obtained from the field necropsies. RESULTS: According to the pathology and bacteriology of the lung samples, APP and Ascaris suum were the main causes of respiratory outbreaks in 14 and three herds respectively, while the clinical signs in three other herds had a miscellaneous etiology. SIV, APP and PCV2 caused concurrent infections in certain herds but they were detected serologically or with PCR also in control herds, suggesting possible subclinical infections. APP was isolated from 16 (80%) case herds. Marked resistance was observed against tetracycline for APP, some resistance was detected against trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin and penicillin, and no resistance against florfenicol, enrofloxacin, tulathromycin or tiamulin was found. Serology, even from paired serum samples, gave inconclusive results for acute APP infection diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: APP was the most common cause for acute respiratory outbreaks in our study. SIV, A. suum, PCV2 and certain opportunistic bacteria were also detected during the outbreaks; however, viral pathogens appeared less important than bacteria. Necropsies supplemented with microbiology were the most efficient diagnostic methods in characterizing the studied outbreaks.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.136796027,-0.013351868000000001,0.022766052999999998,-0.041107719,0.009162653,0.015620506000000001,0.009012258,-0.018886635,0.007748459,0.048821305999999995,0.025755235,-0.007802746,-0.00355655,-0.012140531000000001,0.14571969699999998,-0.10763613400000001,-0.013985058,-0.036297365,0.029036662999999997,0.030922002999999997,-0.022142315,-0.041200007999999996,0.02024981,-0.044392470999999996,0.066568211,0.017204903,-0.067353575,-0.01637041,0.040814448999999996,-0.069386502
941,Nasopharyngeal bacterial load as a marker for rapid and easy diagnosis of invasive pneumococcal disease in children from Mozambique,"BACKGROUND: Current diagnostic methods for detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae in children with suspected invasive pneumococcal disease have limitations of accuracy, timeliness, and patient convenience. This study aimed to determine the performance of pneumococcal load quantified with a real-time polymerase-chain reaction in nasopharyngeal samples to diagnose invasive pneumococcal disease in children. METHODS: Matched case-control study of patients <5 years of age with invasive pneumococcal disease admitted to the Manhiça District Hospital (Mozambique) and asymptomatic controls recruited in different periods between 2006 and 2014. Cases were confirmed by a positive bacterial culture for S. pneumoniae in blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from cases and controls and pneumococcal density was quantified by lytA real-time polymerase-chain reaction. RESULTS: Thirty cases (median age 12.8 months) and sixty controls (median age 11.7 months) were enrolled and 70% of them were male. Nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage was high in both groups: 28/30 (93.3%) for cases vs. 53/60 (88.3%) for controls (p = 0.71). Mean nasopharyngeal pneumococcal load was identified as a marker for invasive pneumococcal disease (7.0 log(10) copies/mL in cases vs. 5.8 log(10) copies/mL in controls, p<0.001) and showed good discriminatory power (AUC-ROC: 82.1%, 95% CI 72.5%-91.8%). A colonization density of 6.5 log(10) copies/mL was determined as the optimal cut-off value to distinguish cases from controls (sensitivity 75.0%, specificity 73.6%). CONCLUSION: Use of non-invasive nasopharyngeal aspirates coupled with rapid and accurate quantification of pneumococcal load by real-time polymerase chain reaction has the potential to become a useful surrogate marker for early diagnosis of invasive pneumococcal disease in children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.13407770800000002,-0.02752897,0.01235826,-0.086898628,-0.042407354,-0.060690264,0.012458486999999999,0.0069454040000000005,-0.03147925,-0.02726376,-0.002612356,0.002491666,-0.07214374,-0.076974675,-0.030337693,0.038442458,-0.061568884000000004,-0.020434328,0.022971532000000003,-0.06346104400000001,-0.092814681,0.10554216599999999,0.04292891099999999,-0.009553856,-0.054605296,0.043211875,0.019264774,-0.014492605,-0.029678135,0.0070339719999999994
944,"Multiplex PCR point of care testing versus routine, laboratory-based testing in the treatment of adults with respiratory tract infections: a quasi-randomised study assessing impact on length of stay and antimicrobial use","BACKGROUND: Laboratory-based respiratory pathogen (RP) results are often available too late to influence clinical decisions such as hospitalisation or antibiotic treatment due to time delay in transport of specimens and testing schedules. Ward-based i.e. point of care (POC) testing providing rapid results may alter the clinical management pathway. METHODS: FilmArray® RP polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems were placed in three in-patient and out-patient medical areas. Patients presenting with influenza-like illness /upper respiratory tract infection +/− lower RTI were recruited between January–July 2015. FilmArray® POC testing occurred on even days of the month (intervention) or routine, laboratory-based RP PCR testing +/− atypical serology on odd days (control). The primary outcome was length of hospital stay. The secondary outcomes were impact on the use of antimicrobials, readmissions, all-cause mortality, length of ward stay and turn-around time (TAT) (time to result from admission). RESULTS: Of 606 eligible patients, 545 (89.9%) were included; 211 in the control arm and 334 in the intervention arm. 20% of control arm patients and 24% of intervention arm patients had an RP detected. POC testing was not associated with the primary outcome measure, length of stay, but reduced the TAT from 39.5 h to 19.0 h, p < 0.001. Only the prescribing decision differed between study arms, p < 0.001. When antivirals were given, the intervention was associated with a reduction in the median time to the first dose of 36 h and allowed appropriate treatment of mycoplasma infection. CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between respiratory PCR POC testing and length of stay or most of the secondary outcomes except the antimicrobial prescribing decision. This was probably due to a delay in initiating FilmArray® testing. Despite this, POC testing allowed time-critical antivirals to be given significantly faster, appropriate mycoplasma treatment and results were available considerably faster than routine, laboratory-based testing. Ward-staff of all grades performed POC testing without difficulty suggesting potential use across many divergent healthcare settings. Further studies evaluating the implementation of rapid respiratory PCR POC testing and the effect on length of stay and antimicrobial use are required.

945,"The viral aetiology of influenza-like illnesses in Kampala and Entebbe, Uganda, 2008","BACKGROUND: As the threat of zoonoses and the emergence of pandemic-prone respiratory viruses increases, there is a need to establish baseline information on the incidence of endemic pathogens in countries worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the presence of viruses associated with influenza-like illnesses (ILI) in Uganda. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in which nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from patients diagnosed with ILI in Kampala and Entebbe between 14 August 2008 – 15 December 2008. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay for detecting 12 respiratory viruses was used. RESULTS: A total of 369 patients (52.3% females) was enrolled; the median age was 6 years (range 1–70). One or more respiratory viruses were detected in 172 (46.6%) cases and their prevalence were influenza A virus (19.2%), adenovirus (8.7%), human rhinovirus A (7.9%), coronavirus OC43 (4.3%), parainfluenza virus 1 (2.7%), parainfluenza virus 3 (2.7%), influenza B virus (2.2%), respiratory syncytial virus B (2.2%), human metapneumovirus (1.4%), respiratory syncytial virus A (1.1%), parainfluenza virus 2 (0.5%) and coronavirus 229E (0.5%). There were 24 (14.0%) mixed infections. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified some of the respiratory viruses associated with ILI in Uganda.

946,Molecular epidemiology of influenza B virus among hospitalized pediatric patients in Northern Italy during the 2015-16 season,"BACKGROUND: The influenza B viruses belong to two lineages distinguished by their genetic and antigenic characteristics, which are referred to as the Yamagata and Victoria lineages, designated after their original isolates, B/Yamagata/16/88 and B/Victoria/2/87. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the molecular characteristics of influenza B viruses circulating in a region of Northern Italy, Lombardia, during the influenza season of 2015–2016. METHODS: Influenza B virus was detected using a respiratory virus panel of assays and an influenza B-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction. The complete influenza B hemagglutinin (HA) gene was amplified and sequenced directly from clinical specimens. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using nucleotide sequences. RESULTS: A total of 71 hospitalized pediatric patients were influenza B positive. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the great majority of influenza B strains (66/71, 93.0%) belonged to the Victoria-lineage and were antigenically like vaccine strain (B/Brisbane/60/2008) included only in the quadrivalent vaccine. In the detected influenza B strains, a series of amino acid changes were observed in the antigenic regions: I117V, V124A, N129D, V146I, N197D, T199A, and A202T. However, only 2 amino acid changes were observed in the HA regions involved in receptor binding or in antibody recognition. CONCLUSIONS: All the influenza B strains identified in this study belonged to the influenza B Victoria lineage not included in the trivalent vaccine commonly used by the general population during the 2015–2016 influenza season in Italy. This indicates that protection against influenza B infection in the vaccinated population was in general very poor during the 2015–2016 influenza season.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.105977196,-0.110923177,-0.015256987,0.153497626,0.08892725300000001,0.357511198,-0.20566905,-0.0024756129999999998,-0.040596178999999996,-0.08793061,-0.0052644630000000005,0.051205943,-0.006458675,-0.037565867,-0.033013198,-0.025751836,0.010214713,-0.027600591,-0.005013926,-0.0038335120000000003,0.072504133,-0.013119263,0.049079847,0.015452078000000001,-0.00047470300000000004,-0.023049952000000002,-0.047792195,0.014192786,-0.021360806,0.067370578
956,"Etiology of respiratory tract infections in the community and clinic in Ilorin, Nigeria","OBJECTIVE: Recognizing increasing interest in community disease surveillance globally, the goal of this study was to investigate whether respiratory viruses circulating in the community may be represented through clinical (hospital) surveillance in Nigeria. RESULTS: Children were selected via convenience sampling from communities and a tertiary care center (n = 91) during spring 2017 in Ilorin, Nigeria. Nasal swabs were collected and tested using polymerase chain reaction. The majority (79.1%) of subjects were under 6 years old, of whom 46 were infected (63.9%). A total of 33 of the 91 subjects had one or more respiratory tract virus; there were 10 cases of triple infection and 5 of quadruple. Parainfluenza virus 4, respiratory syncytial virus B and enterovirus were the most common viruses in the clinical sample; present in 93.8% (15/16) of clinical subjects, and 6.7% (5/75) of community subjects (significant difference, p < 0.001). Coronavirus OC43 was the most common virus detected in community members (13.3%, 10/75). A different strain, Coronavirus OC 229 E/NL63 was detected among subjects from the clinic (2/16) and not detected in the community.

957,The impact of virus infections on pneumonia mortality is complex in adults: a prospective multicentre observational study,"BACKGROUND: Various viruses are known to be associated with pneumonia. However, the impact of viral infections on adult pneumonia mortality remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify the effect of virus infection on pneumonia mortality among adults stratified by virus type and patient comorbidities. METHODS: This multicentre prospective study enrolled pneumonia patients aged ≥15 years from September 2011 to August 2014. Sputum samples were tested by in-house multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays to identify 13 respiratory viruses. Viral infection status and its effect on in-hospital mortality were examined by age group and comorbidity status. RESULTS: A total of 2617 patients were enrolled in the study and 77.8% was aged ≥65 years. 574 (21.9%) did not have comorbidities, 790 (30.2%) had chronic respiratory disease, and 1253 (47.9%) had other comorbidities. Viruses were detected in 605 (23.1%) patients. Human rhinovirus (9.8%) was the most frequently identified virus, followed by influenza A (3.9%) and respiratory syncytial virus (3.9%). Respiratory syncytial virus was more frequently identified in patients with chronic respiratory disease (4.7%) than those with other comorbidities (4.2%) and without comorbidities (2.1%) (p = 0.037). The frequencies of other viruses were almost identical between the three groups. Virus detection overall was not associated with increased mortality (adjusted risk ratio (ARR) 0.76, 95% CI 0.53–1.09). However, influenza virus A and B were associated with three-fold higher mortality in patients with chronic respiratory disease but not with other comorbidities (ARR 3.38, 95% CI 1.54–7.42). Intriguingly, paramyxoviruses were associated with dramatically lower mortality in patients with other comorbidities (ARR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01–0.70) but not with chronic respiratory disease. These effects were not affected by age group. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of virus infections on pneumonia mortality varies by virus type and comorbidity status in adults.

961,"Epidemiology and clinical characteristics of human coronaviruses OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1: a study of hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection in Guangzhou, China","Human coronaviruses (HCoV) OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1 are common respiratory viruses which cause various respiratory diseases, including pneumonia. There is a paucity of evidence on the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of these four HCoV strains worldwide. We collected 11,399 throat swabs from hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection from July 2009 to June 2016 in Guangzhou, China. These were tested for four strains of HCoV infection using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HCoV-positive patients were then tested for 11 other respiratory pathogens. 4.3% (489/11399) of patients were positive for HCoV, of which 3.0% were positive for OC43 (346/11399), 0.6% for 229E (65/11399), 0.5% for NL63 (60/11399), and 0.3% for HKU1 (38/11399). Patients aged 7–12 months had the highest prevalence of HCoV and OC43 when compared with other age groups (p < 0.001). The peak seasons of infection varied depending on the HCoV strain. Patients infected with a single strain of HCoV infection were less likely to present fever (≥ 38 °C) (p = 0.014) and more likely to present pulmonary rales (p = 0.043) than those co-infected with more than one HCoV strain or other respiratory pathogens. There were also significant differences in the prevalence of certain symptoms, including coughing (p = 0.032), pneumonia (p = 0.026), and abnormal pulmonary rales (p = 0.002) according to the strain of HCoV detected. This retrospective study of the prevalence of four HCoV strains and clinical signs among a large population of pediatric patients in a subtropical region of China provides further insight into the epidemiology and clinical features of HCoV.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.192391156,-0.056870748,-0.102713191,-0.068841036,0.200165211,-0.095634515,0.036947003,-0.023421055,0.09496501800000001,-0.063992256,-0.047744572,0.498325439,0.38078131299999995,0.251020278,-0.0031478170000000002,0.06259803900000001,-0.0745248,-0.013508091000000002,-0.065568762,0.078886161,0.016019312,-0.015549336,0.044433228,-0.093800249,0.03597194,-0.025898935,0.071194166,0.040495628,-0.005029149,0.087642367
963,Human metapneumovirus - what we know now,"Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a leading cause of acute respiratory infection, particularly in children, immunocompromised patients, and the elderly. HMPV, which is closely related to avian metapneumovirus subtype C, has circulated for at least 65 years, and nearly every child will be infected with HMPV by the age of 5. However, immunity is incomplete, and re-infections occur throughout adult life. Symptoms are similar to those of other respiratory viral infections, ranging from mild (cough, rhinorrhea, and fever) to more severe (bronchiolitis and pneumonia). The preferred method for diagnosis is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction as HMPV is difficult to culture. Although there have been many advances made in the past 16 years since its discovery, there are still no US Food and Drug Administration-approved antivirals or vaccines available to treat HMPV. Both small animal and non-human primate models have been established for the study of HMPV. This review will focus on the epidemiology, transmission, and clinical manifestations in humans as well as the animal models of HMPV pathogenesis and host immune response.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.14126737,-0.077822145,-0.06271602,0.036332097,0.001715816,-0.06536771599999999,0.09430202800000001,-0.09980877,0.17384229999999998,-0.032153689,0.000670978,-0.052857192000000004,-0.07220984700000001,0.011645747,-0.1149723,-0.063102983,-0.051782062000000004,0.312103539,-0.21376264399999997,0.126039067,0.17432108899999998,0.07239361799999999,-0.029106162999999997,-0.112422044,-0.09698845800000001,0.016500736999999998,-0.25292580800000003,-0.16871627,0.044916276,-0.063420021
966,A case series on common cold to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children following human metapneumovirus infection in Sri Lanka,"OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of hMPV infections in Sri Lanka has not been reported and here we report a case series of hMPV infection in children less than 5 years. Patients with ARTI were included from Teaching Hospital, Anuradhapura from March 2013 to August 2014. Indirect fluorescence assay was performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates for the identification of respiratory viruses [respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus 1, 2 and 3, influenza A and B and hMPV]. Moreover, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was done to further confirm the hMPV infection. RESULTS: In this case series, hMPV infection showed a range of respiratory symptoms from common cold to life threatening lower respiratory tract infections with varying severity. In some cases, the clinical presentation of hMPV infection was similar to the ARTI caused by RSV. hMPV co-infections with of RSV have also been seen in some cases of ARTI. A child delivered through cesarean section and birth order > 3 has an Odds ratio of 3.5 and 4.3 (95% CI) for developing co-infection with RSV compared to hMPV mono-infections. Lack of diagnostic facilities to identify the viral aetiology has contributed to the use of antibiotics indicating the need for establishing viral diagnostic facilities in the country.

967,Comparison of viral infection in healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP),"BACKGROUND: Although viruses are known to be the second most common etiological factor in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), the respiratory viral profile of the patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) has not yet been elucidated. We investigated the prevalence and the clinical impact of respiratory virus infection in adult patients with HCAP. METHODS: Patients admitted with HCAP or CAP, between January and December 2016, to a tertiary referral hospital in Korea, were prospectively enrolled, and virus identification was performed using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Among 452 enrolled patients (224 with HCAP, 228 with CAP), samples for respiratory viruses were collected from sputum or endotracheal aspirate in 430 (95.1%) patients and from nasopharyngeal specimens in 22 (4.9%) patients. Eighty-seven (19.2%) patients had a viral infection, and the proportion of those with viral infection was significantly lower in the HCAP than in the CAP group (13.8% vs 24.6%, p = 0.004). In both the HCAP and CAP groups, influenza A was the most common respiratory virus, followed by entero-rhinovirus. The seasonal distributions of respiratory viruses were also similar in both groups. In the HCAP group, the viral infection resulted in a similar length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality as viral–bacterial coinfection and bacterial infection, and the CAP group showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of viral infection in patients with HCAP was lower than that in patients with CAP, and resulted in a similar prognosis as viral–bacterial coinfection or bacterial infection.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.276807873,-0.08813947800000001,-0.15921978,-0.047090979000000005,-0.054631060999999995,-0.097914171,-0.071466581,0.142873856,-0.24960177600000003,0.135524704,-0.084189949,-0.037562948,0.021797447999999997,0.139536794,-0.11467811300000001,-0.084356777,0.051106066,0.010447116999999999,-0.050327709000000005,0.186997272,0.015585453,0.059779155,0.142439958,0.114480825,0.094075299,-0.112299602,0.016008366,0.005764928000000001,0.070290162,0.05276616
979,Respiratory virus of severe pneumonia in South Korea: Prevalence and clinical implications,"BACKGROUND: Severe viral pneumonia is associated with a high mortality rate. However, due to the vulnerability of critically ill patients, invasive diagnostic methods should be performed with caution in the intensive care unit (ICU). It would be helpful if the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical impact of virus detection are elucidated. METHODS: We evaluated patients with severe pneumonia between January 1(st) 2008 and December 31(st) 2015. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was performed for 8 respiratory viruses when viral pathogen could not be excluded as the origin of severe pneumonia. The baseline characteristics, laboratory results, microbiological findings, and clinical outcomes of the patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 2,347 patients admitted to the medical ICU, 515 underwent RT-PCR for respiratory viruses, 69 of whom had positive results. The detection rate was higher during the winter, with a community onset, in patients with history of recent chemotherapy, and low platelet count. Additional bronchoscopic sampling along with upper respiratory specimen increased the yield of viral detection. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most common pathogen detected, while influenza A was the most common virus with bacterial coinfection. Respiratory virus detection led to changes in clinical management in one-third of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of viral pathogens in patients with severe pneumonia is not rare, and can be more common in certain group of patients. Invasive sampling for RT-PCR can be helpful, and such detection can lead to positive changes in clinical management.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.295008098,0.0029404559999999997,-0.023067028,0.025855907,-0.06819196799999999,-0.09067091699999999,-0.06283466900000001,0.12015515800000001,-0.205570367,0.12368548300000001,-0.047767167,-0.017088863,0.044248305999999994,0.105908374,-0.052133705,-0.043254685,0.04598464,0.041077813,-0.041067421,0.080552927,0.035281267000000005,-0.004909458,0.000591205,0.028503872000000003,0.015773933,-0.021397044,0.044452494,-0.031283162999999996,-0.052555675999999996,-0.02572652
983,Transmission of rhinovirus in the Utah BIG-LoVE families: Consequences of age and household structure,"BACKGROUND: Common cold viruses create significant health and financial burdens, and understanding key loci of transmission would help focus control strategies. This study (1) examines factors that influence when individuals transition from a negative to positive test (acquisition) or a positive to negative test (loss) of rhinovirus (HRV) and other respiratory tract viruses in 26 households followed weekly for one year, (2) investigates evidence for intrahousehold and interhousehold transmission and the characteristics of individuals implicated in transmission, and (3) builds data-based simulation models to identify factors that most strongly affect patterns of prevalence. METHODS: We detected HRV, coronavirus, paramyxovirus, influenza and bocavirus with the FilmArray polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform (BioFire Diagnostics, LLC). We used logistic regression to find covariates affecting acquisition or loss of HRV including demographic characteristics of individuals, their household, their current infection status, and prevalence within their household and across the population. We apply generalized linear mixed models to test robustness of results. RESULTS: Acquisition of HRV was less probable in older individuals and those infected with a coronavirus, and higher with a higher proportion of other household members infected. Loss of HRV is reduced with a higher proportion of other household members infected. Within households, only children and symptomatic individuals show evidence for transmission, while between households only a higher number of infected older children (ages 5-19) increases the probability of acquisition. Coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses and bocavirus also show evidence of intrahousehold transmission. Simulations show that age-dependent susceptibility and transmission have the largest effects on mean HRV prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Children are most likely to acquire and most likely to transmit HRV both within and between households, with infectiousness concentrated in symptomatic children. Simulations predict that the spread of HRV and other respiratory tract viruses can be reduced but not eliminated by practices within the home.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.10530578,-0.06330182599999999,-0.056812025999999995,-0.021334272,0.036937439,-0.018394389,0.067840352,-0.017392182,0.05334227,-0.030062409,0.025202096,-0.019290261,-0.025873887,-0.022883707000000003,0.034721236,0.047296804000000005,-0.033706104,-0.055577177,0.036687437999999996,-0.062230865,-0.048821192,-0.052005164000000006,-0.10826212699999999,0.069921813,-0.099099609,0.139017171,-0.091376124,-0.02506524,0.098960768,0.19167309300000002
986,Expanding severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance beyond influenza: The process and data from 1 year of implementation in Vietnam,"BACKGROUND: In 2016, as a component of the Global Health Security Agenda, the Vietnam Ministry of Health expanded its existing influenza sentinel surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) to include testing for 7 additional viral respiratory pathogens. This article describes the steps taken to implement expanded SARI surveillance in Vietnam and reports data from 1 year of expanded surveillance. METHODS: The process of expanding the suite of pathogens for routine testing by real‐time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (rRT‐PCR) included laboratory trainings, procurement/distribution of reagents, and strengthening and aligning SARI surveillance epidemiology practices at sentinel sites and regional institutes (RI). RESULTS: Surveillance data showed that of 4003 specimens tested by the RI laboratories, 20.2% (n = 810) were positive for influenza virus. Of the 3193 influenza‐negative specimens, 41.8% (n = 1337) were positive for at least 1 non‐influenza respiratory virus, of which 16.2% (n = 518), 13.4% (n = 428), and 9.6% (n = 308) tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus, respectively.

991,Association between semi-quantitative microbial load and respiratory symptoms among Thai military recruits: a prospective cohort study,"BACKGROUND: Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assays have improved diagnostic sensitivity for a wide range of pathogens. However, co-detection of multiple agents and bacterial colonization make it difficult to distinguish between asymptomatic infection or illness aetiology. We assessed whether semi-quantitative microbial load data can differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic states for common respiratory pathogens. METHODS: We obtained throat and nasal swab samples from military trainees at two Thai Army barracks. Specimens were collected at the start and end of 10-week training periods (non-acute samples), and from individuals who developed upper respiratory tract infection during training (acute samples). We analysed the samples using a commercial multiplex respiratory panel comprising 33 bacterial, viral and fungal targets. We used random effects tobit models to compare cycle threshold (Ct) value distributions from non-acute and acute samples. RESULTS: We analysed 341 non-acute and 145 acute swab samples from 274 participants. Haemophilus influenzae type B was the most commonly detected microbe (77.4% of non-acute and 64.8% of acute samples). In acute samples, nine specific microbe pairs were detected more frequently than expected by chance. Regression models indicated significantly lower microbial load in non-acute relative to acute samples for H. influenzae non-type B, Streptococcus pneumoniae and rhinovirus, although it was not possible to identify a Ct-value threshold indicating causal etiology for any of these organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Semi-quantitative measures of microbial concentration did not reliably differentiate between illness and asymptomatic colonization, suggesting that clinical symptoms may not always be directly related to microbial load for common respiratory infections.

993,"Epidemiology of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness and Risk Factors for Influenza Infection and Clinical Severity among Adults in Malawi, 2011–2013","Data on the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in adults from low-income, high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence African settings are scarce. We conducted adult SARI surveillance in Blantyre, Malawi. From January 2011 to December 2013, individuals aged ≥ 15 years with SARI (both inpatients and outpatients) were enrolled at a large teaching hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction. We estimated hospital-attended influenza-positive SARI incidence rates and assessed factors associated with influenza positivity and clinical severity (Modified Early Warning Score > 4). We enrolled 1,126 SARI cases; 163 (14.5%) were positive for influenza. Human immunodeficiency virus prevalence was 50.3%. Annual incidence of hospital-attended influenza-associated SARI was 9.7–16.8 cases per 100,000 population. Human immunodeficiency virus was associated with a 5-fold greater incidence (incidence rate ratio 4.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.83–6.32). On multivariable analysis, female gender, as well as recruitment in hot, rainy season (December to March; adjusted odds ratios (aOR): 2.82, 95% CI: 1.57–5.06) and cool, dry season (April to August; aOR: 2.47, 95% CI: 1.35–4.15), was associated with influenza positivity, whereas influenza-positive patients were less likely to be HIV-infected (aOR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.43–0.80) or have viral coinfection (aOR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.36–0.73). Human immunodeficiency virus infection (aOR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.35–2.56) and recruitment in hot, rainy season (aOR: 4.98, 95% CI: 3.17–7.81) were independently associated with clinical severity. In this high HIV prevalence population, influenza was associated with nearly 15% of hospital-attended SARI. Human immunodeficiency virus infection is an important risk factor for clinical severity in all-cause and influenza-associated SARI.

994,Seasonality and clinical impact of human parainfluenza viruses,"BACKGROUND: Widespread availability of rapid diagnostic testing for respiratory viruses allows more in‐depth studies of human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV). OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess seasonality of HPIV types 1‐4, clinical outcomes by HPIV type, and risk factors for illness severity. PATIENTS/METHODS: This retrospective study was performed from January 2013 to December 2015 in children and adults with HPIV, detected by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, participating in a community surveillance study of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in New York City and patients admitted to a tertiary care center in the same neighborhood. Seasonality trends by HPIV type were compared between the community and hospital groups. The associations between HPIV type, demographics, clinical characteristics, and illness severity were assessed. RESULTS: HPIV was detected in 69 (4%) of 1753 community surveillance participants (median age 9.2 years) and 680 hospitalized patients (median age 6.8 years). Seasonality for HPIV types 1‐3 agreed with previously described patterns; HPIV‐4 occurred annually in late summer and fall. In the community cohort, 22 (32%) participants sought medical care, 9 (13%) reported antibiotic use, and 20 (29%) reported ≥1 day of missed work or school. Among hospitalized patients, 24% had ≥4 chronic conditions. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression demonstrated that increased severity of illness was significantly associated with HPIV‐4 and chronic cardiovascular and respiratory conditions in children and with age ≥65 years and chronic respiratory conditions in adults. CONCLUSIONS: HPIV‐4 presented late summer and early fall annually and was associated with increased severity of illness in hospitalized children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.171705103,-0.07821666299999999,-0.084275019,-0.035165406,-0.009544657,-0.054045163,0.012835966,0.004988322,0.00294197,-0.01134698,-0.017118298,0.02069402,-0.025421864,-0.032328857,-0.009856626,0.02504409,-0.030908666,-0.0026338670000000002,-0.006683085,0.018453582,-0.000632196,-0.022243179,-0.022682092,0.00580879,0.00150599,0.019196813,-0.04656627,0.018822743,-0.002471109,-0.015406671
996,Burden and Risk Factors for Coronavirus Infections in Infants in Rural Nepal,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge of risk factors for symptomatic human coronavirus (HCoV) infections in children in community settings is limited. We estimated the disease burden and impact of birth-related, maternal, household, and seasonal factors on HCoV infections among children from birth to 6 months old in rural Nepal. METHODS: Prospective, active, weekly surveillance for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) was conducted in infants over a period of 3 years during 2 consecutive, population-based randomized trials of maternal influenza immunization. Midnasal swabs were collected for acute respiratory symptoms and tested for HCoV and other viruses by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Association between HCoV incidence and potential risk factors was modeled using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Overall, 282 of 3505 (8%) infants experienced an HCoV ARI within the first 6 months of life. HCoV incidence overall was 255.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 227.3–286.5) per 1000 person-years, and was more than twice as high among nonneonates than among neonates (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.53; 95% CI, 1.52–4.21). HCoV ARI incidence was also positively associated with the number of children <5 years of age per room in a household (IRR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01–1.28). Of the 296 HCoV infections detected, 46% were coinfections with other respiratory viruses. While HCoVs were detected throughout the study period, seasonal variation was also observed, with incidence peaking in 2 winters (December–February) and 1 autumn (September–November). CONCLUSIONS: HCoV is associated with a substantial proportion of illnesses among young infants in rural Nepal. There is an increased risk of HCoV infection beyond the first month of life.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.193719107,-0.116325772,-0.115124944,-0.009068883,0.130500593,-0.062427172999999996,0.08885107800000001,-0.082993365,0.155213888,-0.146646978,-0.004428325,0.355722275,0.20073516600000002,0.063219452,-0.016116087,0.16988994,-0.10858892699999999,-0.121047936,-0.022316051,-0.000629522,-0.168220122,0.006236831,0.009557529,-0.013048573999999999,0.063124928,-0.066341264,0.087356948,-0.089382954,0.018442592,0.017207476
998,"Human bocavirus, coronavirus, and polyomavirus detected among patients hospitalised with severe acute respiratory illness in South Africa, 2012 to 2013","AIM: To investigate the prevalence of human bocavirus (hBoV), human coronaviruses (hCoV), and human polyomaviruses (hPyV) among patients with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), in South Africa. METHODS: The study included 680 South African patients randomly selected in age‐defined categories from hospitalised patients enrolled through SARI surveillance during 2012 to 2013. A multiplex reverse transcription real‐time polymerase chain reaction assay was used to detect hBoV; hCoV‐OC43, hCoV‐229E, hCoV‐NL63, and hCoV‐HKU1; and Washington University hPyV (hPyV‐WU) and Karolinska Insitute hPyV (hPyV‐KI), in respiratory tract specimens collected from patients with SARI. All respiratory specimens from patients enrolled through SARI surveillance were also routinely tested by multiplex reverse transcription real‐time polymerase chain reaction for adenovirus; enterovirus; human metapneumovirus; parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3; respiratory syncytial virus; rhinovirus; influenza A, and influenza B. RESULTS: Human bocavirus, hCoV‐229E, and hPyV‐WU were detected in 3.7% (25/680), 4.1% (28/680), and 4.1% (28/680) of respiratory specimens, respectively. All other viruses were detected in <2% of specimens. Rhinovirus was the most common coinfecting virus (21.4%‐60.7%), followed by adenovirus (21.4%‐39.3%), and respiratory syncytial virus (10.7%‐24.0%). Testing for the additional viruses (hBoV, hCoV, and hPyV) decreased the number of specimens that initially tested negative by 2.9% (20/680). CONCLUSION: Inclusion of laboratory tests for hBoV, hCoV‐229E, and hPyV‐WU in differential testing algorithms for surveillance and diagnostics for suspected cases of respiratory illness of unknown cause may improve our understanding of the etiology of SARI, especially in a country like South Africa with a high number of immune compromised persons.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.248345793,-0.072902836,-0.088078715,0.066061015,0.134886326,-0.055712440999999994,0.01287124,-0.031976656,0.078360783,-0.06179251400000001,-0.070404223,0.309266203,0.293011042,0.189439957,0.009209958,0.019942156000000003,-0.038179183,-0.070573331,-0.012569694,0.020859983999999998,0.027401632000000002,-0.018102936,0.04922548400000001,-0.051314785999999994,-0.022158504,0.004618903,-0.003485197,0.10264058,-0.018380566,-0.021255017999999997
1004,"The impact of influenza infection on young children, their family and the health care system","BACKGROUND: Influenza is a major cause of respiratory illness in young children. Assessing the impact of infection on children and the community is required to guide immunisation policies. OBJECTIVES: To describe the impact of laboratory‐proven influenza in young children and to compare its impact with that of other respiratory viruses on the child, their family and the health care system. METHODS: Preschool children presenting for care or admission to a tertiary paediatric hospital during the 2008‐2014 influenza seasons were tested for respiratory virus by polymerase chain reaction and culture. Parental surveys were used to determine the impact of infection on illness duration, medication use, absenteeism and health service utilisation. Multivariate regression analyses were used to assess the impact of influenza and to evaluate the association between influenza status and outcomes. RESULTS: Among 1191 children assessed, 238 had influenza. Among children with influenza, 87.8% were administered antipyretics and 40.9% antibiotics. 28.6% had secondary complications. 65.4% of children missed school/day care, and 53.4% of parents missed work. When influenza and other viruses were compared, significant differences were noted including duration of illness (influenza: 9.54 days, other viruses: 8.50 days; P = 0.005) and duration of absenteeism for both the child (23.1 vs 17.3 hours; P = 0.015) and their parents (28.5 vs 22.7 hours; P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Influenza infection in young children has a significant impact on medication use, absenteeism and the use of health care service.

1007,Identfication of viral and bacterial etiologic agents of the pertussis-like syndrome in children under 5 years old hospitalized,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) represent an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children, remaining a major public health concern, especially affecting children under 5 years old from low-income countries. Unfortunately, information regarding their epidemiology is still limited in Peru. METHODS: A secondary data analysis was performed from a previous cross-sectional study conducted in children with a probable diagnosis of Pertussis from January 2010 to July 2012. All samples were analyzed via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for the following etiologies: Influenza-A, Influenza-B, RSV-A, RSV-B, Adenovirus, Parainfluenza 1 virus, Parainfluenza 2 virus, Parainfluenza 3 virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. RESULTS: A total of 288 patients were included. The most common pathogen isolated was Adenovirus (49%), followed by Bordetella pertussis (41%) from our previous investigation, the most prevelant microorganisms were Mycoplasma pneumonia (26%) and Influenza-B (19.8%). Coinfections were reported in 58% of samples and the most common association was found between B. pertussis and Adenovirus (12.2%). CONCLUSIONS: There was a high prevalence of Adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and other etiologies in patients with a probable diagnosis of pertussis. Despite the presence of persistent cough lasting at least two weeks and other clinical characteristics highly suspicious of pertussis, secondary etiologies should be considered in children under 5 years-old in order to give a proper treatment.

1018,"Respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and influenza virus infection in Bangkok, 2016-2017","Children and adults residing in densely populated urban centers around the world are at risk of seasonal influenza-like illness caused by respiratory viruses such as influenza virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In a large metropolitan of Thailand’s capital city Bangkok, most respiratory infections are rarely confirmed by molecular diagnostics. We therefore examined the frequency of RSV, hMPV, and influenza virus in 8,842 patients who presented influenza-like illness and sought medical care at a large hospital in Bangkok between 2016 and 2017. Using a multiplex real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 30.5% (2,699/8,842) of nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples tested positive for one or more of these viruses. Influenza virus comprised 17.3% (1,528/8,842), of which the majority were influenza A/H3N2. Such infection was most prevalent among adults and the elderly. RSV was identified in 11.4% (1,011/8,842) and were mostly ON1 and BA9 genotypes. Of the hMPV-positive samples (3.6%, 318/8,842), genotypes A2, B1, and B2 were detected. A small number of individuals experienced co-infections (1.8%, 155/8,842), most commonly between RSV and influenza A/H3N2. RSV and hMPV co-infections were also found, but mainly in young children. Viral respiratory tract infection peaked locally in the rainy season (June to September).

1028,"Human adenovirus among hospitalized children with respiratory tract infections in Beijing, China, 2017–2018","BACKGROUND: Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) cause a wide range of diseases. However, the genotype diversity and epidemiological information relating to HAdVs among hospitalized children with respiratory tract infections (RTIs) is limited. Here, we describe the epidemiology and genotype distribution of HAdVs associated with RTIs in Beijing, China. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected from hospitalized children with RTIs from April 2017 to March 2018. HAdVs were detected by a TaqMan-based quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay, and the hexon gene was used for phylogenetic analysis. Epidemiological data were analyzed using statistical product and service solutions (SPSS) 21.0 software. RESULTS: HAdV was detected in 72 (5.64%) of the 1276 NPA specimens, with most (86.11%, 62/72) HAdV-positives cases detected among children < 6 years of age. HAdV-B3 (56.06%, 37/66) and HAdV-C2 (19.70%, 13/66) were the most frequent. Of the 72 HAdV-infected cases, 27 (37.50%) were co-infected with other respiratory viruses, most commonly parainfluenza virus (12.50%, 9/72) and rhinovirus (9.72%, 7/72). The log number of viral load ranged from 3.30 to 9.14 copies per mL of NPA, with no significant difference between the HAdV mono- and co-infection groups. The main clinical symptoms in the HAdV-infected patients were fever and cough, and 62 (86.11%, 62/72) were diagnosed with pneumonia. Additionally, HAdVs were detected throughout the year with a higher prevalence in summer. CONCLUSIONS: HAdV prevalence is related to age and season. HAdV-B and HAdV-C circulated simultaneously among the hospitalized children with RTIs in Beijing, and HAdV-B type 3 and HAdV-C type 2 were the most frequent.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.115725527,-0.063707366,-0.0269786,-0.077300164,0.051100060999999995,-0.060493461,0.04328638,-0.039555961,0.025208697000000002,-0.024767237,-0.019551382,0.04452523,-0.06043374,-0.051057459000000006,0.021160269,-0.014300972,-0.094693366,0.026257787999999997,-0.009086373,-0.066558648,0.017393913,0.258158457,-0.018565029,0.066029018,-0.14532003400000001,0.147782316,-0.033889182000000004,0.308452506,-0.151731994,0.040414434
1029,Respiratory virus associated with surgery in children patients,"BACKGROUND: Viral respiratory infection (VRI) is a common contraindication to elective surgery. Asymptomatic shedding among pediatric surgery patients (PSPs) could potentially lead to progression of symptomatic diseases and cause outbreaks of respiratory diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of infection among mild symptomatic PSP group and asymptomatic PSP group after surgical procedure. METHODS: We collected the induced sputum from enrolled 1629 children (under 18 years of age) with no respiratory symptom prior to pediatric surgery between March 2017 and February 2019. We tested 16 different respiratory virus infections in post-surgery mild symptomatic PSP group and asymptomatic PSP group using a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay panel. We analyzed symptom data and quantitative viral load to investigate the association between viruses, symptoms and viral quantity in qRT-PCR-positive PSPs. RESULTS: Out of 1629 children enrolled, a total of 204 respiratory viruses were present in 171 (10.50%) PSPs including 47 patients with mild symptoms and 124 with no symptoms after surgery. Commonly detected viruses were human rhino/enterovirus (HRV/EV, 42.19%), parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3, 24.48%), coronavirus (CoV NL63, OC43, HKU1, 11.46%), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 9.9%). PIV3 infection with a higher viral load was frequently found in PSPs presenting with mild symptoms, progressing to pneumonia with radiographic evidence after surgery. HRV/EV were the most commonly detected pathogens in both asymptomatic and mild symptomatic PSPs. CoV (OC43, HKU1) infections with a higher viral load were mostly observed in asymptomatic PSPs progressing to alveolar or interstitial infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that PIV3 is a new risk factor for VRI in PSPs. Employing a more comprehensive, sensitive and quantitative method should be considered for preoperative testing of respiratory viruses in order to guide optimal surgical timing.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.20076366899999998,-0.025438644,-0.083800659,0.00372878,0.029222062000000004,-0.082796124,0.059787667,0.00148006,0.049207167,0.030917200000000002,0.014052953,-0.028490415,0.025036389,0.044272119000000006,0.023298975,-0.025859289,-0.012752293,-0.039738245,0.04732426,-0.012013525,-0.038640656,-0.032743648,-0.066629653,0.033241006000000003,-0.022744547,0.03520309,0.03039884,-0.000596188,0.027607186000000002,0.030751436
1030,Comparing the yield of oropharyngeal swabs and sputum for detection of 11 common pathogens in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infection,"BACKGROUND: Advances in molecular laboratory techniques are changing the prospects for the diagnosis of viral infectious diseases. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay (multiplex-PCR) can detect dozens of pathogens simultaneously, greatly reducing turnaround time (TAT) and improving detection sensitivity. But as a double-edged sword, due to the high sensitivity of PCR, the type of respiratory specimens is critical to diagnosis. In this work, we performed a head-to-head comparison to evaluate the multiplex-PCR yields between two samples, sputum and flocked oropharyngeal swabs (OPS). METHODS: Eleven common respiratory pathogens were tested in hospitalized children< 13 years of age who met the criteria for lower respiratory tract infection by GeXP-based multiplex-PCR of paired OPS and sputum. RESULTS: From January to June 2018, 440 children with paired OPS and sputum were tested. The positive rate was 84% (369/440) for OPS and 88% (386/440) for sputum (p = .007). The frequency of detection of HRV, RSV, Influenza A virus, HMPV, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, M. pneumoniae, coronavirus, bocavirus and C. pneumoniae in sputa was higher than that of OPSs (all p < .001). Both types of specimens had similarly very good kappa values for most of pathogens, except for Mycoplasma pneumonia (κ = 0.61) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (κ = 0.24). Additionally, 79.3% (349/440) of cases showed consistent results between the two types of samples, and they were significantly younger than patients with inconsistent results (p = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Flocked oropharyngeal swabs and sputum performed similarly for the detection of common respiratory pathogens in hospitalized children by multiplex-PCR, except for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae.

1040,"Enhanced surveillance for severe pneumonia, Thailand 2010–2015","BACKGROUND: The etiology of severe pneumonia is frequently not identified by routine disease surveillance in Thailand. Since 2010, the Thailand Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) and US CDC have conducted surveillance to detect known and new etiologies of severe pneumonia. METHODS: Surveillance for severe community-acquired pneumonia was initiated in December 2010 among 30 hospitals in 17 provinces covering all regions of Thailand. Interlinked clinical, laboratory, pathological and epidemiological components of the network were created with specialized guidelines for each to aid case investigation and notification. Severe pneumonia was defined as chest-radiograph confirmed pneumonia of unknown etiology in a patient hospitalized ≤48 h and requiring intubation with ventilator support or who died within 48 h after hospitalization; patients with underlying chronic pulmonary or neurological disease were excluded. Respiratory and pathological specimens were tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for nine viruses, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 14 bacteria. Cases were reported via a secure web-based system. RESULTS: Of specimens from 972 cases available for testing during December 2010 through December 2015, 589 (60.6%) had a potential etiology identified; 399 (67.8%) were from children aged < 5 years. At least one viral agent was detected in 394 (40.5%) cases, with the most common of single vial pathogen detected being respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (110/589, 18.7%) especially in children under 5 years. Bacterial pathogens were detected in 341 cases of which 67 cases had apparent mixed infections. The system added MERS-CoV testing in September 2012 as part of Thailand’s outbreak preparedness; no cases were identified from the 767 samples tested. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced surveillance improved the understanding of the etiology of severe pneumonia cases and improved the MOPH’s preparedness and response capacity for emerging respiratory pathogens in Thailand thereby enhanced global health security. Guidelines for investigation of severe pneumonia from this project were incorporated into surveillance and research activities within Thailand and shared for adaption by other countries.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.21163911600000002,0.040995792999999996,-0.12854264699999998,-0.010219586999999999,0.004042184,-0.020003822,-0.012993011,0.125113269,0.033538274,0.034873159,-0.004970358,-0.011562399999999999,-0.017901768000000002,-0.086210047,-0.017924045,-0.028213506,-0.049617481,0.019081623,-0.052855813,0.023109559,-0.022953584,0.143333121,0.02811744,-0.010439126,0.05727097900000001,0.036430616,0.029667456000000002,0.12027870199999999,0.000724934,-0.045687694
1041,"Comparison of viral and epidemiological profiles of hospitalized children with severe acute respiratory infection in Beijing and Shanghai, China","BACKGROUND: No comparison data have been reported on viral and epidemiological profiles of hospitalized children with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in Beijing or Shanghai, China. METHODS: We collected 700 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from hospitalized children with SARI in Beijing (northern China) and Shanghai (southern China). Multiple respiratory viruses (including 15 common viruses) were screened by validated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays and confirmed by sequencing. Demographic data and the distribution of viral infections were also examined. RESULTS: Of 700 samples, 547 (78.1%) tested positive for viral infections. The picornaviruses (PIC), which included rhinovirus (RV) and enterovirus (EV), were the most common (34.0%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (28.3%), human bocavirus (HBoV) (19.1%), adenovirus (ADV) (13.7%), human coronaviruses (HCoV) (10.7%), influenza A and B (8.9%), parainfluenza virus (PIV 1–3) (7.9%), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (5.0%). PIC (RV/EV) and RSV were the most prevalent etiological agents of SARI in both cities. The total and age-matched prevalence of RSV, HCoV, and hMPV among SARI children under 5 years old were significantly higher in Beijing than in Shanghai. Different age and seasonal distribution patterns of the viral infections were found between Beijing and Shanghai. CONCLUSIONS: Viral infection was tested and shown to be the most prevalent etiological agent among children with SARI in either the Beijing or the Shanghai area, while showing different patterns of viral and epidemiological profiles. Our findings provide a better understanding of the roles of geographic location and climate in respiratory viral infections in hospitalized children with SARI.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.213399024,-0.12091786,-0.08856517400000001,0.083846659,0.09242929,-0.081834091,0.081308357,-0.122825531,0.137647073,-0.05501274,0.010699702,0.027759481000000003,0.011847756999999999,0.024413659,-0.016444022,-0.025519302999999997,-0.048680935999999994,0.03479719,-0.053956805999999996,0.009575539000000001,0.008253998,0.09738664300000001,-0.022027702000000003,-0.008687397,-0.04699257,0.00644037,0.040691053,0.09594554300000001,0.002110217,0.053862306
1045,Molecular detection of respiratory pathogens and typing of human rhinovirus of adults hospitalized for exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"BACKGROUND: Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) and asthma are associated with a variety of precipitating factors including infection. This study assessed the infective viral etiologies by real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction of patients hospitalized with AECOPD and asthma exacerbations. In addition, infective etiologies were assessed for association with the clinical outcome of the patients. METHODS: Adults admitted with AECOPD and asthma exacerbations between August 2016 and July 2017 were recruited. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were obtained from the patients within 1–2 days of admission and subjected to pathogen detection and human rhinovirus (HRV) typing. RESULTS: Altogether 402 patients with AECOPD, 80 stable COPD, 100 asthma exacerbation and 21 stable asthma subjects were recruited. Among those admitted for AECOPD and asthma exacerbations, 141(35.1%) and 45(45.0%) respectively had pathogens identified in the NPA specimens. The commonest virus identified was influenza A followed by HRV. HRV typing identified HRV-A and HRV-C as the more common HRV with a wide variety of genotypes. Identification of pathogens in NPA or HRV typing otherwise did not affect clinical outcomes including the hospital length of stay, readmission rates and mortality except that identification of pathogens in asthma exacerbation was associated with a lower rate of readmissions at 30 and 60 days. CONCLUSIONS: Many respiratory viruses were associated with AECOPD and asthma exacerbation. HRV-A and HRV-C were the more common HRV associated with exacerbations. Identification of pathogens in NPA was associated with less readmissions for asthma patients at 30 and 60 days. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02866357.

1046,Acute human bocavirus 1 infection in child with life-threatening bilateral bronchiolitis and right-sided pneumonia: a case report,"BACKGROUND: Human bocavirus 1 is a commonly detected human parvovirus. Many studies have shown human bocavirus 1 as a pathogen in association with acute respiratory tract infections in children. However, because human bocavirus 1 persists in the upper airways for extensive time periods after acute infection, the definition and diagnostics of acute human bocavirus 1 infection is challenging. Until now, detection of human bocavirus 1 exclusively, high viral load in respiratory samples, and viremia have been associated with a clinical picture of acute respiratory illness. There are no studies showing detection of human bocavirus 1 messenger ribonucleic acid in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells as a diagnostic marker for acute lower respiratory tract infection. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 17-month-old Latvian boy who presented in intensive care unit with acute bilateral bronchiolitis, with a history of rhinorrhea and cough for 6 days and fever for the last 2 days prior to admission, followed by severe respiratory distress and tracheal intubation. Human bocavirus 1 was the only respiratory virus detected by a qualitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction panel. For the diagnosis of acute human bocavirus 1 infection, both molecular and serological approaches were used. Human bocavirus 1 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was detected simultaneously in nasopharyngeal aspirate, stool, and blood, as well as in the corresponding cell-free blood plasma by qualitative and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, revealing high DNA-copy numbers in nasopharyngeal aspirate and stool. Despite a low-load viremia, human bocavirus 1 messenger ribonucleic acid was found in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells. For detection of human bocavirus 1-specific antibodies, non-competitive immunoglobulin M and competitive immunoglobulin G enzyme immunoassays were used. The plasma was positive for both human bocavirus 1-specific immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of human bocavirus 1 genomic DNA in blood plasma and human bocavirus 1 messenger ribonucleic acid in peripheral blood mononuclear cells together with human bocavirus 1-specific immunoglobulin M are markers of acute human bocavirus 1 infection that may cause life-threatening acute bronchiolitis.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.10427945599999999,-0.024691783,-0.016117812,-0.025508995,-0.010503408999999998,-0.043814335,0.069811451,-0.047793993,0.060291177,0.01594764,-0.011114491,-0.029681759,0.089313549,0.00034511800000000005,0.026723415,-0.013607605,-0.028360482000000003,-0.023433574,0.007954906999999999,0.00049944,0.029398274,-0.003859202,-0.008929296,0.010901181999999999,-0.012203203000000001,0.015027897,-0.09745069,0.048786465999999994,-0.04558177,-0.049026187
1051,Clinical outcomes of patients treated with intravenous zanamivir for severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection: a case report series,"BACKGROUND: Intravenous (IV) zanamivir could be a suitable alternative for the treatment of severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in patients who are unable to take oral or inhaled medication, for example, those on mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). However, data on the clinical outcomes of such patients is limited. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the clinical outcomes of four patients who were admitted at the intensive care unit during the 2017–2018 influenza season with severe sepsis (SOFA score > 11) and acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring ECMO and mechanical ventilation. Two patients were immune-compromised. The A(H1N1)pdm09 genome was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on nasopharyngeal specimen swabs prior to administration of IV zanamivir at a dose of 600 mg twice daily. Weekly qualitative PCR analysis was done to monitor viral clearance, with zanamivir treatment being discontinued upon receipt of negative results. In addition, the patients were managed for concomitant multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, with infection resolution confirmed with blood cultures. The median time for zanamivir treatment was 10 days (IQR 10–17). The clinical outcome was favourable with all four patients surviving and improving clinically. All four patients achieved viral clearance of A(H1N1)pdm09 genome, and resolution of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. CONCLUSIONS: IV zanamivir could be a good therapeutic option in patients with severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection who are unable to take oral or aerosolised antiviral medication. We recommend prospective randomized control trials to support this hypothesis.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.151417456,-0.023548872000000002,-0.079124946,-0.02950368,-0.103827114,0.097760347,-0.107457422,0.096392689,-0.127150027,-0.001264532,-0.010805045,0.022626423,0.020135196,0.058987403,-0.035001215,0.0025796070000000003,0.01496513,0.073741563,-0.011902025,0.014134563999999999,0.034892546,-0.042788072999999996,-0.051167352,-0.039172578,-0.04873181,-0.006886781999999999,-0.004377165,-0.005013343,0.004344901,0.062736193
1052,"Outbreak of macrolide-resistant mycoplasma pneumoniae in a primary school in Beijing, China in 2018","BACKGROUND: On 7th June, 2018, a primary school in Beijing, China notified Shunyi CDC of an outbreak of acute respiratory disease characterized by fever and cough among students and resulting in nine hospitalization cases during the preceding 2 weeks. We started an investigation to identify the etiologic agent, find additional cases, develop and implement control measures. METHODS: We defined probable cases as students, teachers and other staffs in the school developed fever (T ≥ 37.5 °C) with cough or sore throat; or a diagnosis of pneumonia during May 1–June 31, 2018. Confirmed cases were probable cases with Mycoplasma pneumoniae detected in oropharyngeal (OP) swabs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We searched case by reviewing school absenteeism records and interviewing students, teachers and staff in this school. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from symptomatic students. Two qPCR) assay, a duplex qPCR assay, and sequencing were performed to determine the pathogen, genotype and macrolide resistance at the gene level, respectively. RESULTS: From May 1st to June 31st, 2018, we identified 55 cases (36 probable and 19 confirmed), of whom 25 (45%) were hospitalized for complications. All cases were students, none of the teachers and other staffs in the school were with similar symptoms. The attack rate (AR) was 3.9% (55/1398) for all students. The cases were mainly male (58%), with an age range of 7–8 years (median: 7 years). 72% (18/25) of inpatients had radiograph findings consistent with pneumonia, and some cases were hospitalized for up to 4 weeks. Pathogen detection results indicated that Mycoplasma pneumonia (M. pneumoniae) P1 type 1 was the causative agent in this outbreak, and the strain harbored one point mutation of A to G at position 2063. CONCLUSIONS: The infections by macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae are not always mild and pneumonia was common and M. pneumoniae could causes serious complications which require long-term hospitalization. In the future infectious disease prevention and control practice, M. pneumoniae should be paid more attention. It is necessary to establish and improve the pathogen and drug resistance surveillance system in order to prevent and control such mutated strains of M. pneumoniae from causing future outbreaks or epidemics in China.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.121967304,-0.012564198,-0.014852416,-0.080128824,-0.026462675,0.009732054,-0.017708202,0.050955087999999996,-0.059279219,0.025551647,-0.011924572,0.030044161,-0.038207844,-0.098327228,0.010321895,-0.00196332,-0.055360560999999996,0.02347276,-0.019954951000000002,-0.006408199,-0.027379944,0.14570212,0.025105047999999998,-0.005419873,0.017154951,0.090215216,0.053708142,0.135221505,0.033418975,-0.054679575
1053,Clinical outcomes among hospital patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection,"BACKGROUND: Mortality is high among patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. We aimed to determine hospital mortality and the factors associated with it in a cohort of MERS-CoV patients. METHODS: We reviewed hospital records of confirmed cases (detection of virus by polymerase chain reaction from respiratory tract samples) of MERS-CoV patients (n = 63) admitted to Buraidah Central Hospital in Al-Qassim, Saudi Arabia between 2014 and 2017. We abstracted data on demography, vital signs, associated conditions presented on admission, pre-existing chronic diseases, treatment, and vital status. Bi-variate comparisons and multiple logistic regressions were the choice of data analyses. RESULTS: The mean age was 60 years (SD = 18.2); most patients were male (74.6%) and Saudi citizens (81%). All but two patients were treated with Ribavirin plus Interferon. Hospital mortality was 25.4%. Patients who were admitted with septic shock and/or organ failure were significantly more likely to die than patients who were admitted with pneumonia and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR = 47.9, 95% CI = 3.9, 585.5, p-value 0.002).

1054,Risk factors and patterns of household clusters of respiratory viruses in rural Nepal,"Viral pneumonia is an important cause of death and morbidity among infants worldwide. Transmission of non-influenza respiratory viruses in households can inform preventative interventions and has not been well-characterised in South Asia. From April 2011 to April 2012, household members of pregnant women enrolled in a randomised trial of influenza vaccine in rural Nepal were surveyed weekly for respiratory illness until 180 days after birth. Nasal swabs were tested by polymerase chain reaction for respiratory viruses in symptomatic individuals. A transmission event was defined as a secondary case of the same virus within 14 days of initial infection within a household. From 555 households, 825 initial viral illness episodes occurred, resulting in 79 transmission events. The overall incidence of transmission was 1.14 events per 100 person-weeks. Risk of transmission incidence was associated with an index case age 1–4 years (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 2.35; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40–3.96), coinfection as initial infection (IRR 1.94; 95% CI 1.05–3.61) and no electricity in household (IRR 2.70; 95% CI 1.41–5.00). Preventive interventions targeting preschool-age children in households in resource-limited settings may decrease the risk of transmission to vulnerable household members, such as young infants.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.152895324,-0.079433972,-0.089000476,-0.015252301000000001,0.011067107,0.060418022,-0.00654416,0.013584553999999999,0.029228716000000002,-0.095403394,0.041259858999999996,0.032871159,-0.08256739099999999,-0.09762234800000001,-0.017813575,0.114845455,-0.07723477200000001,-0.08263662299999999,0.044311489,-0.014764686,-0.154218676,0.008566175,-0.060385272000000004,0.045934363,0.039143242,-0.044042643,0.03208524,-0.116563568,-0.044613655,-0.041619867000000005
1065,"Viral etiology of pneumonia among severely malnourished under-five children in an urban hospital, Bangladesh","BACKGROUND: In Bangladesh, pneumonia has a higher mortality among malnourished children aged <5 years. Evaluating pneumonia etiology among malnourished children may help improve empiric treatment guidelines. METHODS: During April 2015—December 2017, we conducted a case-control study among severe acute malnourished (SAM) children aged <5 years admitted to the Dhaka hospital of International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b). We enrolled hospital admitted SAM children with clinical or radiological pneumonia as cases (during April 2015 to March 2017) and hospital admitted SAM children without any respiratory symptom in the past 10 days before admission as controls (during February 2016 to December 2017). We tested nasopharyngeal wash from both case and control for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza viruses, human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV), rhinovirus and adenovirus by singleplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. To identify the independent association of pneumonia with viral pathogens during February 2016 to March 2017, we used multivariable logistic regression for calculating adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS: We enrolled 360 cases and 334 controls. For case and control the median age was 8 months (IQR: 5–13) and 11 months (IQR: 6–18) (p = 0.001) respectively. Weight/age Z-score was -4.3 (SD ±0.7) for cases and -4.1 (SD ±1.1) for controls (p = 0.01). Among cases 68% had both clinical and radiological pneumonia, 1% had clinical pneumonia and 31% had only radiological pneumonia. Respiratory virus detection was high in cases compared to controls [69.9% (251) vs. 44.8% (148), p = 0.0001]. The most frequently detected viruses among cases were rhinoviruses (79, 22.0%) followed by RSV (32, 8.9%), adenovirus (23, 6.4%), HPIV (22, 6.1%), influenza virus (16, 4.5%), and HMPV (16, 4.5%). Among the controls, rhinoviruses (82, 24.8%) were most commonly detected one followed by adenovirus (26,7.9%), HMPV (5, 1.5%), HPIV (4, 1.2%), RSV (3, 0.9%), and influenza virus (2, 0.6%). RSV (OR 13.1; 95% CI: 1.6, 106.1), influenza virus (OR 8.7; 95% CI: 1.0, 78.9), HPIV (3.8; 95% CI: 1.0, 14.8), and HMPV (2.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 5.5) were independently associated with pneumonia while compared between 178 cases and 174 controls. CONCLUSION: Viral etiology of pneumonia in SAM children were mainly attributable to RSV, influenza, HPIV and HMPV. Our study findings may help in planning further studies targeting vaccines or drugs against common respiratory viruses responsible for pneumonia among SAM children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.302412991,-0.160056434,-0.138554135,0.06221167,0.010021365,-0.03571015,-0.027433234,-0.050548199,0.035606405,-0.097394995,0.011542488,-0.024075978999999997,-0.14731311800000002,-0.09240888,-0.139723613,0.02933088,-0.09744548199999999,0.090061965,-0.064069128,0.04446284599999999,-0.070831674,0.19092610899999998,0.074270558,0.005371590999999999,-0.028354779,0.009559709,-0.005434268000000001,-0.081525978,-0.055883714,-0.033789973
1067,Post-pandemic influenza A/H1N1pdm09 is associated with more severe outcomes than A/H3N2 and other respiratory viruses in adult hospitalisations,"This study compares the frequency and severity of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 (A/H1), influenza A/H3N2 (A/H3) and other respiratory virus infections in hospitalised patients. Data from 17 332 adult hospitalised patients admitted to Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Western Australia, with a respiratory illness between 2012 and 2015 were linked with data containing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results for respiratory viruses including A/H1, A/H3, influenza B, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza. Of these, 1753 (10.1%) had test results. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted to compare the viruses for clinical outcomes including ICU admission, ventilation, pneumonia, length of stay and death. Patients with A/H1 were more likely to experience severe outcomes such as ICU admission (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2–5.5, P = 0.016), pneumonia (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.6–5.7, P < 0.001) and lower risk of discharge from hospital (indicating longer lengths of hospitalisation; HR 0.64 95% CI 0.47–0.88, P = 0.005), than patients with A/H3. Patients with a non-influenza respiratory virus were less likely to experience severe clinical outcomes than patients with A/H1, however, had similar likelihood when compared to patients with A/H3. Patients hospitalised with A/H1 had higher odds of severe outcomes than patients with A/H3 or other respiratory viruses.

1074,Characteristics of fever and response to antipyretic therapy in military personnel with adenovirus-positive community-acquired pneumonia,"BACKGROUND: In 2014, an outbreak of adenoviral pneumonia occurred in the Korean military training center. However, there are limited data on the characteristics of the fever and its response to antipyretic therapy in immunocompetent adults with adenovirus-positive community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). METHODS: The medical records of the patients who were admitted to the Armed Forces Chuncheon Hospital for the treatment of CAP between January 2014 and December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into three groups, namely, the adenovirus-positive (Adv) group, the adenovirus-negative (Non-Adv) group and the unknown pathogen group, according to the results of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and sputum culture used to measure adenovirus and other bacteria or viruses in respiratory specimens. We evaluated and compared the demographics, clinicolaboratory findings and radiological findings upon admission between the two groups. RESULTS: Out of the 251 military personnel with CAP during the study periods, 67 were classified into the Adv group, while 134 were classified into the Non-Adv group and 50 were classified into the unknown pathogen group. The patients in the Adv group had a longer duration of fever after admission (3.2 ± 1.6 vs. 1.9 ± 1.2 vs. 2.2 ± 1.5 days, P = 0.018) and symptom onset (5.8 ± 2.2 vs. 3.9 ± 2.5 vs. 3.7 ± 2.0 days, P = 0.006) than patients in the Non-Adv and unknown pathogen groups, respectively. The patients in the Adv group had a higher mean temperature at admission (37.8 ± 0.3 vs. 37.3 ± 0.3 vs. 37.3 ± 0.3, P = 0.005), and more patients were observed over 40 and 39 to 40(14.9% vs. 2.2% vs. 4.0%, 35.8% vs. 3.7% vs. 6.0%, P < 0.001) than those in the Non-Adv and unknown pathogen groups, respectively. The Adv group more commonly had no response or exhibited adverse events after antipyretic treatment compared to the Non-Adv group (17.9% vs. 1.5%, 35.0% vs. 4.3%, P < 0.001, P = 0.05, respectively). In addition, the time from admission to overall clinical stabilization was significantly longer in the patients in the Adv group than in those in the Non-Adv group (4.3 ± 2.8 vs. 2.9 ± 1.8 days, P = 0.034, respectively). Furthermore, no significant difference in the length of hospital stay was observed between the two groups, and no patient died in either group. CONCLUSION: In this study, Adv-positive CAP in immunocompetent military personnel patients had distinct fever characteristics and responses to antipyretic treatment.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.132042668,-0.04357202,-0.07261533099999999,-0.143119948,-0.021148188,-0.042922487,-0.025401489,0.085053291,-0.162313645,0.020324502,-0.035909352,0.009429879,-0.070526806,0.044783842000000004,-0.064096482,-0.02192098,-0.0066166359999999995,0.042827159000000004,-0.00127198,0.028149991,-0.010862218,-0.029548968,0.003786092,-0.002437482,-0.030421686,-0.024828653,0.024970645,0.000704153,-0.038295339,0.002089806
1075,"Overnutrition in Infants Is Associated With High Level of Leptin, Viral Coinfection and Increased Severity of Respiratory Infections: A Cross-Sectional Study","Objective: To investigate the relationship of overnutrition (obese and overweight) with severity of illness in children hospitalized with acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs), frequency of viral coinfections and leptin levels. Methods: We studied 124 children <2 years old that were hospitalized for ALRI. Nutritional status was calculated by z-scores according to weight-for-age z-scores, length or height-for-age z-scores, and weight-for-height z-scores. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were obtained and viral respiratory pathogens were identified using reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) load was assessed using quantitative RT-PCR. NPA and plasma leptin level were measured. Clinical data and nutritional status were recorded, and patients were followed up until hospital discharge. Viral coinfection was defined as the presence of two or more viruses detected in the same respiratory sample. Severity of illness was determined by length of hospitalization and duration of oxygen therapy. Results: Children with overnutrition showed a greater frequency of viral coinfection than those with normal weight (71% obese vs. 37% normal weight p = 0.013; 68% overweight vs. 37% normal weight p = 0.004). A lower RSV load was found in obese (5.91 log(10) copies/mL) and overweight children (6.49 log(10) copies/mL) compared to normal weight children (8.06 log(10) copies/mL; p = 0.021 in both cases). In multivariate analysis, obese, and overweight infants <6 months old were associated with longer hospital stays (RR = 1.68; CI: 1.30–2.15 and obese: RR = 1.68; CI: 1.01–2.71, respectively) as well as a greater duration of oxygen therapy (RR = 1.80; IC: 1.41–2.29 and obese: RR = 1.91; CI: 1.15–3.15, respectively). Obese children <6 months showed higher plasma leptin level than normal weight children (7.58 vs. 5.12 ng/μl; p <0.046). Conclusions: In infants younger than 6 months, overnutrition condition was related to increased severity of infections and high plasma leptin level. Also, children with overnutrition showed a greater frequency of viral coinfection and low RSV viral load compared to normal weights children. These findings further contribute to the already existent evidence supporting the importance of overnutrition prevention in pediatric populations.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.19416970600000003,-0.108590285,-0.057933358,-0.021638109,0.013144236,-0.137400737,0.050792124,-0.09537732300000001,0.07049522400000001,-0.061867633,0.025949603999999998,-0.042351089,-0.118950525,-0.042003727000000005,-0.048354049,0.036202949,-0.042289022999999995,-0.017552537,0.028994947000000004,-0.035241848,-0.116772689,0.057621110999999996,0.00652982,0.049696853,-0.050147326,-0.021565643,0.08833481300000001,-0.061639023,-0.021930516,0.057059121
1076,Molecular Diagnosis of Pneumonia Using Multiplex Real-Time PCR Assay RespiFinder® SMART 22 FAST in a Group of Moroccan Infants,"BACKGROUND: In Morocco, pediatric pneumonia remains a serious public health problem, as it constitutes the first cause of mortality due to infectious diseases. The etiological diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections is difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to use Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay tests in a routine setting for exact and fast identification. OBJECTIVES: In this paper, we present the clinical results of pediatric pneumonia and describe their etiology by using molecular diagnosis. Study design: Tracheal secretion was collected from infants presenting respiratory distress isolated or associated with systemic signs, attending the unit of Neonatology between December 1, 2016, and Mai 31, 2018. Samples were tested with the multiplex RespiFinder® SMART 22 FAST which potentially detects 18 viruses and 4 bacteria. RESULTS: Of the 86 infants considered in this study (mean age 31 ± 19 days) suspected of acute respiratory tract infections, 71 (83%) were positive for one or multiple viruses or/and bacteria. The majority of acute respiratory tract infections had a viral origin (95%): respiratory syncytial viruses (A and B) (49%), rhinovirus (21%), coronaviruses 229E (11%), humain metapneumovirus (5%), influenza A (3%), influenza H1N1 (1%), adenovirus (2%), and parainfluenza virus type 4 (2%). Among our patients, 6% had Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Coinfections were not associated with severe respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION: The clinical spectrum of respiratory infections is complex and often nonspecific. Thus, the early and fast detection of related causative agents is crucial. The use of multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction may help choose an accurate treatment, reduce the overall use of unnecessary antibiotics, preserve intestinal flora, and decrease nosocomial infection by reducing the length of hospitalization.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.30213488899999996,-0.066976942,-0.050835908,0.098932011,-0.000651819,-0.028535692999999997,0.010272662,0.010014081,-0.01798131,0.091415201,-0.015628508,-0.025241702999999997,0.093444514,-0.02508438,0.050894394,-0.031042232000000003,0.020104738,-0.043633236,0.07638114,0.027256586,0.009724399,-0.03845944,-0.003334115,-0.030658022000000004,0.06417500799999999,-0.003497292,-0.043731847000000004,0.005199271,0.024788312000000003,-0.121407855
1081,"Identification of Adenovirus, Influenza Virus, Parainfluenza Virus, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus by Two Kinds of Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and a Shell Vial Culture in Pediatric Patients with Viral Pneumonia","PURPOSE: Early identification of causative agents in lower respiratory infection of pediatric patients can reduce morbidity and prevent an overuse of antimicrobials. Two kinds of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a commercial shell vial viral culture were performed to identify causative agents in pediatric patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates of 220 children diagnosed with viral pneumonia were obtained. Two kinds of multiplex PCR (Seeplex™ RV detection kit, and Labopass™ RV detection kit), and a shell vial culture by R-Mix were performed. RESULTS: Positive samples from 220 total samples by two multiplex PCRs were 52.7% and 46.4%, respectively. We also cultured 103 samples that showed positive results of the adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by two multiplex PCR. The RSV was most frequently detected in 53.0% (Seeplex) and 51.7% (Labopass) of patients. The detection rate of adenovirus (AdV) was 10.3% and 12.1%, influenza virus (IFV) A and B was 12.5% and 3.4%, and parainfluenza virus (PIFV) 1, 2, and 3 were 2.9% and 2.6%. Shell vial cultures showed concordant results with each multiplex PCR by 96.1% and 77.7%, respectively. Sequencing results were 90% consistent with multiplex PCR. CONCLUSION: Multiplex PCR showed more positivity than the shell vial culture and it can be an effective primary test.

1084,Human Bocavirus in Patients with Respiratory Tract Infection,"BACKGROUND: Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a newly identified viral pathogen, and its clinical epidemiology and significance in respiratory infections have not yet been completely elucidated. We investigated the prevalence of HBoV infection and the association between viral (HBoV) load and clinical features of the infection in patients of all age-groups. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients with symptoms of respiratory infection were tested for presence of HBoV by using real-time polymerase chain reaction. HBoV-positive patients were categorized into low- and high-viral-load groups using 1.0×10(6) copies/mL as the threshold value of viral load. RESULTS: Detection rate of HBoV was 4.8% (N=93) in a total of 1,926 samples with peak incidence of infection being observed in patients aged 6-12 months. HBoV infection was more frequently observed in young children, especially, in children aged less than 5 yr, and the HBoV load decreased with increase in age. HBoV was codetected with other respiratory viruses in 17 (18.3%) of the 93 HBoV-positive patients and 15 patients (88.2%) belonged to the low-viral-load group. Patients infected with HBoV alone showed a higher viral load than those patients in whom HBoV was codetected with other respiratory viruses (median load, 3.78×10(5) copies/mL vs. 1.94×10(4) copies/mL, P=0.014). Higher pulse rate (P=0.007) and respiratory rate (P=0.021) were observed in patients with a high-viral-load.

1085,Human metapneumovirus and human coronavirus infection and pathogenicity in Saudi children hospitalized with acute respiratory illness,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and the Netherlands human coronavirus (HCoV-NL63) have been isolated from children with respiratory tract infection. The prevalence of these viruses has not been reported from Saudi Arabia. We sought to determine whether hMPV and HCoV-NL63 are responsible for acute respiratory illness and also to determine clinical features and severity of illness in the hospitalized pediatric patient population. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective hospital-based study from July 2007 to November 2008. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nasopharyngeal specimens from children less than 16 years old who were suffering from acute respiratory diseases were tested for hMPV and HCoV-NL63 by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction. Samples were collected from July 2007 to November 2008. RESULTS: Both viruses were found among Saudi children with upper and lower respiratory tract diseases during the autumn and winter of 2007 and 2008, contributing to 11.1% of all viral diagnoses, with individual incidences of 8.3% (hMPV) and 2.8% (HCoV-NL63) among 489 specimens. Initial symptoms included fever, cough, and nasal congestion. Lower respiratory tract disease occurs in immunocompromised individuals and those with underlying conditions. Clinical findings of respiratory failure and culture-negative shock were established in 7 children infected with hMPV and having hematologic malignancies, myelofibrosis, Gaucher disease, and congenital immunodeficiency; 2 of the 7 patients died with acute respiratory failure. All children infected with HCoV-NL63 had underlying conditions; 1 of the 4 patients developed respiratory failure. CONCLUSION: hMPV and HCoV-NL63 are important causes of acute respiratory illness among hospitalized Saudi children. hMPV infection in the lower respiratory tract is associated with morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised children. HCoV-NL63 may cause severe lower respiratory disease with underlying conditions.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.291249455,-0.09154628199999999,-0.15106896,0.035225361000000004,0.121019661,-0.180288382,0.081350525,-0.099691494,0.238082866,-0.080126121,-0.010325421999999999,0.225397223,0.153413476,0.137491044,-0.053945488,0.020507143000000002,-0.063785655,0.11821510199999999,-0.160014451,0.089082219,0.099928932,0.02062391,4.35e-05,-0.14133052,-0.068149908,0.033522001,-0.164861452,-0.095842366,0.031372347,-0.024912385
1089,Detection rate and clinical impact of respiratory viruses in children with Kawasaki disease,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this prospective case-control study was to survey the detection rate of respiratory viruses in children with Kawasaki disease (KD) by using multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and to investigate the clinical implications of the prevalence of respiratory viruses during the acute phase of KD. METHODS: RT-PCR assays were carried out to screen for the presence of respiratory syncytial virus A and B, adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 4, influenza virus A and B, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus OC43/229E and NL63, and enterovirus in nasopharyngeal secretions of 55 KD patients and 78 control subjects. RESULTS: Virus detection rates in KD patients and control subjects were 32.7% and 30.8%, respectively (P=0.811). However, there was no significant association between the presence of any of the 15 viruses and the incidence of KD. Comparisons between the 18 patients with positive RT-PCR results and the other 37 KD patients revealed no significant differences in terms of clinical findings (including the prevalence of incomplete presentation of the disease) and coronary artery diameter. CONCLUSION: A positive RT-PCR for currently epidemic respiratory viruses should not be used as an evidence against the diagnosis of KD.

1090,Respiratory Viral Infections after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Children,"This study was performed to characterize respiratory viral infections in pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Study samples included 402 respiratory specimens obtained from 358 clinical episodes that occurred in the 116 children of the 175 consecutive HSCT cohort at Seoul National University Children's Hospital, Korea from 2007 to 2010. Multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions were performed for rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), adenovirus, human coronavirus (hCoV), influenza viruses and human metapneumovirus. Viruses were identified in 89 clinical episodes that occurred in 58 patients. Among the 89 clinical episodes, frequently detected viruses were rhinovirus in 25 (28.1%), RSV in 23 (25.8%), PIV-3 in 16 (18.0%), adenovirus in 12 (13.5%), and hCoV in 10 (11.2%). Lower respiratory tract infections were diagnosed in 34 (38.2%). Neutropenia was present in 24 (27.0%) episodes and lymphopenia was in 31 (34.8%) episodes. Sixty-three percent of the clinical episodes were hospital-acquired. Three patients died of respiratory failure caused by respiratory viral infections. Respiratory viral infections in pediatric patients who have undergone HSCT are common and are frequently acquired during hospitalization.

1095,Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Other Respiratory Viral Infections in Older Adults With Moderate to Severe Influenza-like Illness,"Background. Few studies have prospectively assessed viral etiologies of acute respiratory infections in community-based elderly individuals. We assessed viral respiratory pathogens in individuals ≥65 years with influenza-like illness (ILI). Methods. Multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction identified viral pathogens in nasal/throat swabs from 556 episodes of moderate-to-severe ILI, defined as ILI with pneumonia, hospitalization, or maximum daily influenza symptom severity score (ISS) >2. Cases were selected from a randomized trial of an adjuvanted vs nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine conducted in elderly adults from 15 countries. Results. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in 7.4% (41/556) moderate-to-severe ILI episodes in elderly adults. Most (39/41) were single infections. There was a significant association between country and RSV detection (P = .004). RSV prevalence was 7.1% (2/28) in ILI with pneumonia, 12.5% (8/64) in ILI with hospitalization, and 6.7% (32/480) in ILI with maximum ISS > 2. Any virus was detected in 320/556 (57.6%) ILI episodes: influenza A (104/556, 18.7%), rhinovirus/enterovirus (82/556, 14.7%), coronavirus and human metapneumovirus (each 32/556, 5.6%). Conclusions. This first global study providing data on RSV disease in ≥65 year-olds confirms that RSV is an important respiratory pathogen in the elderly.

1096,Evaluation of the Temporal Association between Kawasaki Disease and Viral Infections in South Korea,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study is aimed at elucidating potential temporal associations between the occurrence of Kawasaki disease (KD) and various viral infections. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We obtained monthly patterns of KD from the seventh nationwide survey and viral detection data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2009 to 2011 and evaluated temporal correlations between them for each month. The respiratory viruses detected using a multiplex real-time-polymerase chain reaction kit were influenza virus (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, A/H5N1, and B), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus (type 1, 2, 3), respiratory syncytial virus (type A, B), human rhinovirus, human coronavirus (OC43/229E, NL63), human bocavirus, and enterovirus. RESULTS: We obtained data from a total of 13031 patients who were treated for acute KD from 87 hospitals with pediatric residence programs. During this survey, KD showed highest overall incidence in summer and winter seasons and lowest incidence in February and October. We received viral detection data for a total of 14267 patients. Viral detection was highest during winter and spring seasons. The most commonly detected virus was human rhinovirus (32.6%), followed by influenza virus (26.8%). The monthly incidence of KD showed significant correlation with the monthly overall viral detection (p=0.022, r=0.382). In particular, human bocavirus and enterovirus have significant correlations with monthly patterns of KD occurrence (p=0.032 and p=0.007, respectively) and influenza virus correlated with KD occurrence with borderline significance (p=0.063).

1099,Detection of respiratory viruses by real-time polymerase chain reaction in outpatients with acute respiratory infection,"Viruses are the major contributors to the morbidity and mortality of upper and lower acute respiratory infections (ARIs) for all age groups. The aim of this study was to determine the frequencies for a large range of respiratory viruses using a sensitive molecular detection technique in specimens from outpatients of all ages with ARIs. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from 162 individuals between August 2007-August 2009. Twenty-three pathogenic respiratory agents, 18 respiratory viruses and five bacteria were investigated using multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIF). Through IIF, 33 (20.4%) specimens with respiratory virus were recognised, with influenza virus representing over half of the positive samples. Through a multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay, 88 (54.3%) positive samples were detected; the most prevalent respiratory viral pathogens were influenza, human rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Six cases of viral co-detection were observed, mainly involving RSV. The use of multiplex real-time RT-PCR increased the viral detection by 33.9% and revealed a larger number of respiratory viruses implicated in ARI cases, including the most recently described respiratory viruses [human bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus, human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 and HCoV HKU1].",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.332493064,-0.055458385,0.051428747000000004,0.30208548,0.111041374,-0.035525251,0.00075275,-0.06831411,0.091354565,-0.013218433,0.002408782,0.055499649000000005,0.136312997,0.141422069,0.049088582,-0.069412708,0.054504868,-0.07927013599999999,0.034816264,-0.004482811,0.034946832000000004,-0.025213305,-0.00627086,-0.0016208720000000002,0.021781613,0.009847394,0.074595799,0.025186672,0.025787157999999998,-0.08745736300000001
1101,Utilization of the respiratory virus multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test for adult patients at a Korean tertiary care center,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Respiratory viruses (RVs) are considered to be important respiratory pathogens in adult patients, and the multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is used frequently in adult patients with respiratory infections. However, clinical data regarding utilization of the multiplex RT-PCR test for RVs are lacking. METHODS: We investigated the utilization of the multiplex RT-PCR test for RVs at Chung-Ang University Hospital in Seoul, Korea, between January 2012 and April 2013. RESULTS: During the study period, the multiplex RT-PCR test was performed for 291 adult patients. The test frequency was 4.9% of rapid influenza antigen detection tests and 0.8% of respiratory bacterial culture studies. A turnaround time of < 48 hours was observed in 25.9% of positive tests. Most of the tests were performed for admitted patients (97.9%) with a community-acquired infection (84.2%) during the flu season (82.5%). RVs were detected in 81 of 291 cases (27.8%). The RV positivity rates for community- and hospital-acquired infections did not differ (28.6% vs. 23.9%, p = 0.52). Of 166 patients with pneumonia, 44 (26.5%) had a viral infection. Among the patients with RV-associated pneumonia, an RV other than influenza was detected in 20 patients (45.4%). CONCLUSIONS: The multiplex RT-PCR test for RVs was infrequently performed at a tertiary care center, and the test results were often reported late. The test was most often performed for admitted adult patients with community-acquired infections during the flu season. The utilization of multiplex RT-PCR testing for RVs in current clinical practice should be improved.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.25422042899999997,0.005807788,0.032771215,0.020850711,-0.05458425099999999,-0.054869430999999996,-0.100077272,0.099527645,-0.156558656,0.040951685,-0.02551369,0.012242965,0.015140053,0.11333431199999999,-0.045108592999999995,-0.033653702,0.09515082400000001,0.044729572999999995,-0.045497667,-0.01120082,0.041448137,-0.010745915,0.030766839,-0.000373809,0.04903495099999999,0.006054974,0.047548495,-0.039691184,0.016723668,-0.000181323
1102,Viral etiology of respiratory infections in children in southwestern Saudi Arabia using multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate 15 respiratory viruses in children with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) using multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and to analyze the clinical and epidemiological features of these viruses. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 135 children, ≤5 years of age who presented with ARTIs in Najran Maternity and Children Hospital, Najran, Saudi Arabia between October 2012 and July 2013 were included. The clinical and sociodemographic data, and the laboratory results were recorded using a standardized questionnaire. Two nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from each child: one for bacteriological examination, and the second for viral detection using multiplex RT-PCR. RESULTS: A single viral pathogen was detected in 76 patients, viral coinfections in 9, and mixed viral and bacterial pathogens in 15. Respiratory syncytial virus was isolated in 33 patients, human rhinovirus (hRV) in 22, adenovirus (AdV) in 19, human metapneumovirus in 13, influenza virus in 10, parainfluenza virus in 7, human corona virus (hCoV) in 4, and human bocavirus in one. CONCLUSION: Respiratory syncytial virus, hRV, and AdV were the most frequent viruses, accounting for more than two-thirds of the cases. Other viruses, such as MPV, hCoV NL63, and hCoV OC43, may play a role in pediatric ARTIs. Of significance is the potential use of multiplex RT-PCR to provide epidemiological and virological data for early detection of the emergence of novel respiratory viruses in the era of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.315891624,-0.07211878299999999,-0.050122519000000004,0.164918461,0.115221804,-0.127785769,0.057374562999999996,-0.032285394,0.09068438,0.03575672,-0.021196721,0.09408129900000001,0.179586838,0.152644423,0.053178109,-0.04208395400000001,0.033805389,-0.063851269,0.006192291999999999,0.02144906,-0.002109508,0.026971712999999998,-0.024160259,0.077757823,-0.04718411,0.091869319,0.029403809,0.021195386,0.034067586000000004,0.023837123999999998
1103,Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein cannot differentiate bacterial or viral infection in COPD exacerbation requiring emergency department visits,"BACKGROUND: Viral and bacterial infections are the most common causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. Whether serum inflammatory markers can differentiate bacterial from virus infection in patients with COPD exacerbation requiring emergency department (ED) visits remains controversial. METHODS: Viral culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to identify the viruses in the oropharynx of patients with COPD exacerbations. The bacteria were identified by the semiquantitative culture of the expectorated sputum. The peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC) counts, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and clinical symptoms were compared among patients with different types of infections. RESULTS: Viruses were isolated from 16 (22.2%) of the 72 patients enrolled. The most commonly identified viruses were parainfluenza type 3, influenza A, and rhinovirus. A total of 30 (41.7%) patients had positive bacterial cultures, with the most commonly found bacteria being Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Five patients (6.9%) had both positive sputum cultures and virus identification. The WBC, CRP, and PCT levels of the bacteria-positive and bacteria-negative groups were not statistically different. Multivariate analysis showed that patients with increased sputum volumes during the COPD exacerbations had higher risks of recurrent exacerbations in the 1-year period following the first exacerbation. CONCLUSION: WBC, CRP, or PCT could not differentiate between bacterial and viral infections in patients with COPD exacerbation requiring ED visits. Those with increased sputum during a COPD exacerbation had higher risks for recurrent exacerbations.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.13699330099999998,-0.067422464,-0.067728725,-0.1209808,-0.075143352,-0.038615595,-0.020079365,0.076591703,-0.17364431600000002,0.093662513,-0.055211642000000005,-0.041951740999999994,0.012514673,0.06760403200000001,-0.027261949,-0.03934404,0.051772103,-0.033267206,0.0007673080000000001,-0.00048301,0.039900639,-0.091805452,0.031641824,0.077241534,-0.017797636000000002,0.052217802,0.00153582,-0.007938865,0.049591079,0.12805176699999998
1104,Prevalence and Incidence of Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Other Respiratory Viral Infections in Children Aged 6 Months to 10 Years With Influenza-like Illness Enrolled in a Randomized Trial,"Background. The high burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated morbidity and mortality makes vaccine development a priority. Methods. As part of an efficacy trial of pandemic influenza vaccines (NCT01051661), RSV epidemiology in healthy children aged 6 months to <10 years at first vaccination with influenza-like illness (ILI) was evaluated in Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand between February 2010 and August 2011. Active surveillance for ILI was conducted for approximately 1 year, with nasal and throat swabs analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. The prevalence and incidence of RSV among ILI episodes were calculated. Results. A total of 6266 children were included, of whom 2421 experienced 3717 ILI episodes with a respiratory sample available. RSV was detected for 359 ILI episodes, a prevalence of 9.7% (95% confidence interval: 8.7–10.7). The highest prevalence was in children aged 12–23 or 24–35 months in all countries except the Philippines, where it was in children aged 6–11 months. The incidence of RSV-associated ILI was 7.0 (6.3–7.7) per 100 person-years (PY). Eighty-eight ILI episodes resulted in hospitalization, of which 8 were associated with RSV (prevalence 9.1% [4.0–17.1]; incidence 0.2 [0.1–0.3] per 100 PY). The incidence of RSV-associated ILI resulting in medical attendance was 6.0 (5.4–6.7) per 100 PY. RSV B subtypes were observed more frequently than A subtypes. Conclusions. Active surveillance demonstrated the considerable burden of RSV-associated illness that would not be identified through hospital-based surveillance, with a substantial part of the burden occurring in older infants and children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.21121148,-0.154756076,-0.08860793300000001,0.08130323099999999,0.053268109,0.002538716,0.007155946,-0.12848316,0.145305397,-0.154929368,0.051884477000000005,-0.048713765,-0.176693949,-0.134132149,-0.077681637,0.045241795999999994,-0.06213976,0.008250408,0.020208344,-0.045147539,-0.051794394,-0.09537785900000001,0.027200508999999998,-0.040129878,0.11098033,-0.135836556,0.197282953,0.138119678,-0.029613831,0.05383736
1106,Cardiac Function in Kawasaki Disease Patients with Respiratory Symptoms,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Respiratory symptoms are often observed in children with Kawasaki disease (KD) during the acute phase. The association of respiratory viruses in children with KD was investigated using multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and tissue Doppler echocardiography. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 138 KD patients were included from January 2010 to June 2013. We compared 3 groups (group 1: n=94, KD without respiratory symptoms; group 2: n=44, KD with respiratory symptoms; and group 3: n=50, febrile patients with respiratory symptoms). Laboratory data were obtained from each patient including N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Echocardiographic measurements were compared between group 1 and group 2. RT-PCR was performed using nasopharyngeal secretion to screen for the presence of 14 viruses in groups 2 and 3. RESULTS: The incidence of KD with respiratory symptoms was 31.8%. The duration of fever was significantly longer, and coronary artery diameter was larger in group 2 than in group 1. Tei index was significantly higher and coronary artery diameter larger in group 2 than group 1. Coronary artery diameter, C-reactive protein levels, platelet count, alanine aminotransferase levels, and NT-pro BNP levels were significantly higher and albumin levels lower in group 2 compared with group 3. CONCLUSION: NT-pro BNP was a valuable diagnostic tool in differentiating KD from other febrile viral respiratory infections. Some viruses were more frequently observed in KD patients than in febrile controls. Tei index using tissue Doppler imaging was increased in KD patients with respiratory symptoms.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.136003367,-0.040356496,-0.04958792,-0.069514578,0.023517757,-0.0699882,-0.011724921000000001,0.007640639,-0.051429344,-0.011744188000000001,-0.019808801,0.004911744,-0.022047947000000002,0.070801749,-0.01771301,-0.018774563,0.034965469,-0.018129736,0.024829273,-0.021131587,-0.015566101,-0.10240069800000001,-0.08276375799999999,0.02142514,-0.047197248,0.012052853,-0.012983109,-0.070333062,-0.01788319,-0.081305282

In 2011, live oral Ad vaccines for serotypes 4 and 7 were reintroduced into US basic military training populations. This study evaluated the impact on clinical presentations and other respiratory pathogens. Methods. The Center for Advanced Molecular Detection at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland prospectively collects demographic, clinical, and polymerase chain reaction data from respiratory specimens (throat swab and nasal wash) among Air Force trainees presenting for care of ARI. Results. From June 2008 to August 2013, 2660 trainees enrolled and were tested for selected respiratory pathogens. Post-vaccine introduction (VI), reported systemic symptoms were less frequent, including fever (38% vs 94%) and myalgia (37% vs 67%; P < .01). Median temperature and heart rate decreased (98.4 vs 101.3°F, 81 vs 96 beats per minute; P < .01). Ad detection decreased for all Ad (3% vs 68%), Ad4 (1% vs 70%), 7 (0% vs 8%), 14 (0% vs 5%), and 3 (0.1% vs 2%); P < .01). Rhinovirus and cases with no pathogen identified increased in frequency (35% vs 18%, 51% vs 14%; P < .01). Conclusions. Acute respiratory illness in military trainees post-VI is associated with decreased severity of systemic symptoms and reduced fever and heart rate. Marked reductions in frequency of Ad serotypes are seen, including those in the vaccine, with no serotype shift. However, detection of several other respiratory pathogens, most notably rhinovirus, is observed in increasing proportions, and a majority are now undiagnosed clinical syndromes.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.125876512,-0.052794072000000004,-0.031141879,-0.057261143,-0.007499549,-0.026479574,0.01284349,0.008395818000000001,-0.007693878,0.013308873,-0.004492883,0.009388131999999999,-0.034961311,-0.05349789,0.009987853,0.01161703,-0.031050496,-0.044610802000000005,0.032866003,-0.037180916,-0.018166536,-0.056302108,-0.032050217,-0.013427395,0.037781208,0.024249269,-0.020263388,0.0209711,-0.0012920730000000001,-0.084637318
1109,Multiplex SYBR Green Real-Time PCR Assay for Detection of Respiratory Viruses,"BACKGROUND: It is often difficult for a physician to distinguish between viral and bacterial causes of respiratory infections and this may result in overuse of antibiotics. In many cases of community-acquired respiratory infections, clinicians treat patients empirically. The development of molecular methods for direct detection of viruses has been progressed recently. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was recognizing the panel of respiratory RNA viruses by multiplex SYBR Green real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Randomized 172 influenza-negative respiratory specimens of all age groups of hospitalized patients were collected. After RNA extraction, cDNA was synthesized. Three SYBR Green multiplex real-time PCR assays were developed for simultaneous detection of 12 respiratory RNA viruses. Each set of multiplex methods detected four viruses, the first set: respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus; the second set: parainfluenza viruses 1 - 4 (PIV1-4); the third set: coronaviruses NL63, 229E, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and OC43. RESULTS: Application of the multiplex SYBR Green real-time PCR in clinical samples from 172 patients in a one-year study resulted in detection of 19 (11.04%) PIV3, 9 (5.23%) PIV4, and 1 (0.58%) coronavirus NL63. All the positive samples were detected during December to March (2011 - 2012). CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex SYBR Green real-time PCR is a rapid and relatively inexpensive method for detection of respiratory viruses.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.23298907600000002,0.031029459,0.02420437,0.183816352,0.047550459,-0.111748085,-0.017380758,-0.009816414,-0.044861217,0.085769637,-0.020518075,-0.005061163,0.11640880699999999,0.096554062,0.06322762400000001,-0.064203396,0.056004509,-0.063570745,0.081499022,-0.047749598,0.040431125,-0.030514956,0.023972865,-0.039743218,-0.016539902,-0.012764156,-0.014910048,-0.003872741,0.012627591,-0.07987834099999999
1110,"Detection of Viral and Bacterial Pathogens in Hospitalized Children With Acute Respiratory Illnesses, Chongqing, 2009–2013","Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) cause large disease burden each year. The codetection of viral and bacterial pathogens is quite common; however, the significance for clinical severity remains controversial. We aimed to identify viruses and bacteria in hospitalized children with ARI and the impact of mixed detections. Hospitalized children with ARI aged ≤16 were recruited from 2009 to 2013 at the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected for detection of common respiratory viruses by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or PCR. Bacteria were isolated from NPAs by routine culture methods. Detection and codetection frequencies and clinical features and severity were compared. Of the 3181 hospitalized children, 2375 (74.7%) were detected with ≥1 virus and 707 (22.2%) with ≥1 bacteria, 901 (28.3%) with ≥2 viruses, 57 (1.8%) with ≥2 bacteria, and 542 (17.0%) with both virus and bacteria. The most frequently detected were Streptococcus pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and influenza virus. Clinical characteristics were similar among different pathogen infections for older group (≥6 years old), with some significant difference for the younger. Cases with any codetection were more likely to present with fever; those with ≥2 virus detections had higher prevalence of cough; cases with virus and bacteria codetection were more likely to have cough and sputum. No significant difference in the risk of pneumonia, severe pneumonia, and intensive care unit admission were found for any codetection than monodetection. There was a high codetection rate of common respiratory pathogens among hospitalized pediatric ARI cases, with fever as a significant predictor. Cases with codetection showed no significant difference in severity than those with single pathogens.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.227226669,-0.105901096,-0.062642958,0.032535178,0.025514872999999997,-0.06968487400000001,0.025038336,-0.013557421000000002,-0.016688916,0.048312821,-0.006632685,-0.030199981,0.002131873,-0.060853908,0.026087175,-0.006628918,-0.018902881,-0.038127047000000004,-0.00324857,0.016160432,-0.058123126,0.104556636,0.03001239,0.052081697999999996,0.012518508000000001,0.087218352,0.006759714,0.019943416000000002,0.033009356000000004,-0.049639014
1112,"Parainfluenza Virus Infection Among Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-Infected and HIV-Uninfected Children and Adults Hospitalized for Severe Acute Respiratory Illness in South Africa, 2009–2014","Background. Parainfluenza virus (PIV) is a common cause of acute respiratory tract infections, but little is known about PIV infection in children and adults in Africa, especially in settings where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence is high. Methods. We conducted active, prospective sentinel surveillance for children and adults hospitalized with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) from 2009 to 2014 in South Africa. We enrolled controls (outpatients without febrile or respiratory illness) to calculate the attributable fraction for PIV infection. Respiratory specimens were tested by multiplex real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay for parainfluenza types 1, 2, and 3. Results. Of 18 282 SARI cases enrolled, 1188 (6.5%) tested positive for any PIV type: 230 (19.4%) were type 1; 168 (14.1%) were type 2; 762 (64.1%) were type 3; and 28 (2.4%) had coinfection with 2 PIV types. After adjusting for age, HIV serostatus, and respiratory viral coinfection, the attributable fraction for PIV was 65.6% (95% CI [confidence interval], 47.1–77.7); PIV contributed to SARI among HIV-infected and -uninfected children <5 years of age and among individuals infected with PIV types 1 and 3. The observed overall incidence of PIV-associated SARI was 38 (95% CI, 36–39) cases per 100 000 population and was highest in children <1 year of age (925 [95% CI, 864–989] cases per 100 000 population). Compared with persons without HIV, persons with HIV had an increased relative risk of PIV hospitalization (9.4; 95% CI, 8.5–10.3). Conclusions.

1113,Frequent Asymptomatic Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections During an Epidemic in a Rural Kenyan Household Cohort,"Background. The characteristics, determinants, and potential contribution to transmission of asymptomatic cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection have not been well described. Methods. A cohort of 47 households (493 individuals) in coastal Kenya was recruited and followed for a 26-week period spanning a complete RSV season. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were requested weekly, during the first 4 weeks, and twice weekly thereafter from all household members, regardless of illness status. The samples were screened for a range of respiratory viruses by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results. Tests on 16 928 samples yielded 205 RSV infection episodes in 179 individuals (37.1%) from 40 different households. Eighty-six episodes (42.0%) were asymptomatic. Factors independently associated with an increased risk of asymptomatic RSV infection episodes were higher age, shorter duration of infection, bigger household size, lower peak viral load, absence of concurrent RSV infections within the household, infection by RSV group B, and no prior human rhinovirus infections. The propensity of RSV spread in households was dependent on symptom status and amount (duration and load) of virus shed. Conclusions. While asymptomatic RSV was less likely to spread, the high frequency of symptomless RSV infection episodes highlights a potentially important role of asymptomatic infections in the community transmission of RSV.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.180350846,-0.105215974,-0.079291616,0.035980387999999995,0.025836704,-0.07530936,0.07415039999999999,-0.08330072599999999,0.150429413,-0.077620487,0.059764635,-0.11390353199999999,-0.138974262,-0.069819248,-0.036594595,0.0031015179999999997,-0.045658567000000004,0.027064248,0.019948981,-0.037559056,-0.024848754,-0.159296357,-0.060810199,-0.048463685,0.11414662800000001,-0.158133902,0.264199545,0.091116418,-0.06336589,0.07188211
1116,"Pilot study of participant-collected nasal swabs for acute respiratory infections in a low-income, urban population","OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and validity of unsupervised participant-collected nasal swabs to detect respiratory pathogens in a low-income, urban minority population. METHODS: This project was conducted as part of an ongoing community-based surveillance study in New York City to identify viral etiologies of acute respiratory infection. In January 2014, following sample collection by trained research assistants, participants with acute respiratory infection from 30 households subsequently collected and returned a self-collected/parent-collected nasal swab via mail. Self/parental swabs corresponding with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction primary research samples were analyzed. RESULTS: Nearly all (96.8%, n=30/31) households agreed to participate; 100% reported returning the sample and 29 were received (median time: 8 days). Most (18; 62.1%) of the primary research samples were positive. For eight influenza-positive research samples, seven (87.5%) self-swabs were also positive. For ten other respiratory pathogen-positive research samples, eight (80.0%) self-swabs were positive. Sensitivity of self-swabs for any respiratory pathogen was 83.3% and 87.5% for influenza, and specificity for both was 100%. There was no relationship between level of education and concordance of results between positive research samples and their matching participant swab.

1118,Comprehensive Molecular Testing for Respiratory Pathogens in Community-Acquired Pneumonia,"Background. The frequent lack of a microbiological diagnosis in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) impairs pathogen-directed antimicrobial therapy. This study assessed the use of comprehensive multibacterial, multiviral molecular testing, including quantification, in adults hospitalized with CAP. Methods. Clinical and laboratory data were collected for 323 adults with radiologically-confirmed CAP admitted to 2 UK tertiary care hospitals. Sputum (96%) or endotracheal aspirate (4%) specimens were cultured as per routine practice and also tested with fast multiplex real-time polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) assays for 26 respiratory bacteria and viruses. Bacterial loads were also calculated for 8 bacterial pathogens. Appropriate pathogen-directed therapy was retrospectively assessed using national guidelines adapted for local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Results. Comprehensive molecular testing of single lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens achieved pathogen detection in 87% of CAP patients compared with 39% with culture-based methods. Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the main agents detected, along with a wide variety of typical and atypical pathogens. Viruses were present in 30% of cases; 82% of these were codetections with bacteria. Most (85%) patients had received antimicrobials in the 72 hours before admission. Of these, 78% had a bacterial pathogen detected by PCR but only 32% were culture-positive (P < .0001). Molecular testing had the potential to enable de-escalation in number and/or spectrum of antimicrobials in 77% of patients. Conclusions. Comprehensive molecular testing significantly improves pathogen detection in CAP, particularly in antimicrobial-exposed patients, and requires only a single LRT specimen. It also has the potential to enable early de-escalation from broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobials to pathogen-directed therapy.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.19223228899999997,-0.031308618999999996,-0.005888861,-0.039280498,-0.07851063700000001,-0.071389892,0.0034152490000000004,0.098345061,-0.18002355,0.148263765,-0.094475931,-0.019043912,0.073094641,-0.036561698,-0.048751222000000004,-0.071567224,-0.011932527,0.001033246,-0.04113962,0.012044309,0.012133463999999998,0.076363634,0.197327205,-0.01580694,0.08586616300000001,-0.048420037,0.012336138,0.039712628,0.137393651,-0.005133904
1119,"Relative frequency, Possible Risk Factors, Viral Codetection Rates, and Seasonality of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Among Children With Lower Respiratory Tract Infection in Northeastern Brazil","Few studies, each limited to a single major city, have investigated the prevalence and seasonal patterns of different viruses among children with low respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in Northeastern Brazil. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and of 7 other viruses in children for LRTI in 4 capitals from this region, and investigate their association with several risk factors, including meteorological data. From April 2012 to March 2013, 507 children, aged up to 24 months and hospitalized with LRTI in one of the participating centers at Aracajú, Salvador, Recife, and Maceió, had a sample of nasopharyngeal aspirate collected and analyzed for the following viruses by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction followed by hybridization on low-density microarrays: RSV, influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, and coronavirus. The result was positive in 66.5% of cases, RSV was the most common virus (40.2%). Except for rhinovirus (17%), all other virus had frequency rates lower than 6%. Viral coinfections were detected in 13.8% of samples. Possible related risk factors for RSV infection were low age upon entry, attendance of daycare, low gestational age, and low educational level of the father. The relative frequency of viral infections was associated with increasing temperature and decreasing humidity separately, but the results also suggested both associated with increased frequency of RSV. Some of these findings differ from those reported for other regions in Brazil and may be used to guide policies that address LRTI.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.20599671,-0.15333576699999998,-0.091370261,0.08647983699999999,0.072463569,-0.083110541,0.06839550700000001,-0.113311938,0.11780681,-0.035742756,0.054517156,-0.08748947,-0.084182047,-0.069428651,-0.015910836,0.000145472,-0.041192313,-0.011216137,-0.004866957,-0.009524364,-0.018800043,-0.025802968,-0.0066726269999999996,0.040139512,0.036084067000000004,-0.087851576,0.156546554,0.071746825,-0.03849284,0.034529931
1121,"Population-based Surveillance for Medically Attended Human Parainfluenza Viruses From the Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project, 2010–2014","BACKGROUND: Parainfluenza viruses (PIV) have been shown to contribute substantially to pediatric hospitalizations in the United States. However, to date, there has been no systematic surveillance to estimate the burden among pediatric outpatients. METHODS: From August 2010 through July 2014, outpatient health care providers with enumerated patient populations in 13 states and jurisdictions participating in the Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project conducted surveillance of patients with influenza-like illness (ILI). Respiratory specimens were collected from the first 10 ILI patients each week with demographic and clinical data. Specimens were tested for multiple respiratory viruses, including PIV1–4, using reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction assays. Cumulative incidence was calculated using provider patient population size as the denominator. RESULTS: PIVs 1–3 were detected in 8.0% of 7716 ILI-related outpatient specimens: 30% were PIV1, 26% PIV2 and 44% PIV3. PIV circulation varied noticeably by year and type, with PIV3 predominating in 2010–2011 (incidence 110 per 100,000 children), PIV1 in 2011–2012 (89 per 100,000), dual predominance of PIV2 and PIV3 (88 and 131 per 100,000) in 2012–2013 and PIV3 (100 per 100,000) in 2013–2014. The highest incidence of PIV detections was among patients aged <5 years (259–1307 per 100,000). The median age at detection for PIV3 (3.4 years) was significantly lower than the median ages for PIV1 (4.5 years) and PIV2 (7.0 years; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PIVs 1–3 comprise a substantial amount of medically attended pediatric ILI, particularly among children aged <5 years.

1123,Incidence of Medically Attended Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Influenza Illnesses in Children 6–59 Months Old During Four Seasons,"Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza are significant causes of seasonal respiratory illness in children. The incidence of influenza and RSV hospitalization is well documented, but the incidence of medically attended, laboratory-confirmed illness has not been assessed in a well defined community cohort. Methods. Children aged 6–59 months with medically attended acute respiratory illness were prospectively enrolled during the 2006–2007 through 2009–2010 influenza seasons in a Wisconsin community cohort. Nasal swabs were tested for RSV and influenza by multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The population incidence of medically attended RSV and influenza was estimated separately and standardized to weeks 40 through 18 of each season. Results. The cohort included 2800–3073 children each season. There were 2384 children enrolled with acute respiratory illness; 627 (26%) were positive for RSV and 314 (13%) for influenza. The mean age was 28 months (standard deviation [SD] = 15) for RSV-positive and 38 months (SD = 16) for influenza-positive children. Seasonal incidence (cases per 10 000) was 1718 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1602–1843) for RSV and 768 (95% CI, 696–848) for influenza. Respiratory syncytial virus incidence was highest among children 6–11 (2927) and 12–23 months old (2377). Influenza incidence was highest (850) in children 24–59 months old.

1126,Detection of Common Respiratory Viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in Patient-Occupied Rooms in Pediatric Wards,"Few studies have assessed viral contamination in the rooms of hospital wards. This cross-sectional study evaluated the air and objects in patient-occupied rooms in pediatric wards for the presence of common respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Air samplers were placed at a short (60–80 cm) and long (320 cm) distance from the head of the beds of 58 pediatric patients, who were subsequently confirmed to be infected with enterovirus (n = 17), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n = 13), influenza A virus (n = 13), adenovirus (n = 9), or M pneumoniae (n = 6). Swab samples were collected from the surfaces of 5 different types of objects in the patients’ rooms. All air and swab samples were analyzed via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for the presence of the above pathogens. All pathogens except enterovirus were detected in the air, on the objects, or in both locations in the patients’ rooms. The detection rates of influenza A virus, adenovirus, and M pneumoniae for the long distance air sampling were 15%, 67%, and 17%, respectively. Both adenovirus and M pneumoniae were detected at very high rates, with high concentrations, on all sampled objects. The respiratory pathogens RSV, influenza A virus, adenovirus, and M pneumoniae were detected in the air and/or on the objects in the pediatric ward rooms. Appropriate infection control measures should be strictly implemented when caring for such patients.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.176394204,-0.078400055,-0.023077797,0.023526602,0.009670585,0.010251089,-0.030566597999999997,0.031471366,-0.086833316,0.027369948999999998,-0.018677576,-0.046117322,-0.030016817,0.000576272,0.010176486,-0.02727883,0.006226843,-0.049630803,0.04462233,-0.014804323999999999,0.016614133,0.019313241999999998,0.108845455,0.005562989,0.047210797,-0.018687825,0.045183595,0.11618245599999999,-0.009648489,-0.046271531
1131,Clinical Impact of Mixed Respiratory Viral Infection in Children with Adenoviral Infection,"BACKGROUND: Although adenovirus (ADV) infection occurs steadily all year round in Korea and the identification of respiratory viral coinfections has been increasing following the introduction of multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction tests, the clinical impact of viral coinfection in children with ADV infection has rarely been reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of children diagnosed with ADV infection were retrospectively reviewed. The enrolled children were divided into two groups based on the identified respiratory viruses: ADV group and coinfection group. Clinical and laboratory parameters were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: In total, 105 children (60 males and 45 females) with a median age of 29 months (range: 0-131 months) diagnosed with an ADV infection were enrolled. Fever (99.0%) was by far the most frequent symptom, followed by respiratory (82.9%), and gastrointestinal (22.9%) symptoms. Upper and lower respiratory tract infections were diagnosed in 56 (53.3%), and 32 (30.5%) children, respectively. Five (4.8%) children received oxygen therapy, and no child died due to ADV infection. Coinfection was diagnosed in 32 (30.5%) children, with rhinovirus (46.9%), and respiratory syncytial virus (21.9%) being the most frequent. The proportions of children younger than 24 months (P <0.001), with underlying medical conditions (P = 0.020), and diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infection (P = 0.011) were significantly higher in the coinfection group than in the ADV group. In a multivariate analysis, only the younger age was significantly associated with coinfection (P <0.001). Although more children in the coinfection group received oxygen therapy (P = 0.029), the duration of fever and hospitalization was not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viral coinfection with ADV occurred more frequently in children younger than 24 months of age compared with children aged 24 months or older. Respiratory viral coinfection may increase the severity of ADV infection, however, appropriate therapy prevented prolonged hospitalization and poor prognosis due to coinfection.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.21717216,-0.114344179,-0.10528872,-0.031119769,0.029206002999999998,-0.126736202,0.069518072,-0.059420855999999994,0.07161072,-0.014184701999999999,0.01118274,-0.044215985,-0.047687465,-0.038001798999999996,0.004197325,0.014931419,-0.015480325,-0.005982711999999999,0.01403686,0.009523424,-0.040667297000000005,0.038397409,-0.005614121,0.007761896,-0.034066615,0.031706385,-0.005395820999999999,-0.030143231,0.001612353,0.007397774
1132,The Relationships between Respiratory Virus Infection and Aminotransferase in Children,"PURPOSE: We sought to examine the relationship between the clinical manifestations of nonspecific reactive hepatitis and respiratory virus infection in pediatric patients. METHODS: Patients admitted to the pediatric unit of Konyang University Hospital for lower respiratory tract disease between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2014 and who underwent reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests were examined. The patients were divided into those with increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and those with normal ALT or AST levels. Further, patients with increased ALT and AST levels were individually compared with patients in the normal group, and the blood test results were compared according to the type of respiratory virus. RESULTS: Patients with increased ALT or AST levels had one more day of hospital stay, on average, compared with patients in the normal group (5.3±3.1 days vs. 4.4±3.0 days, p=0.019). Patients in the increased ALT level group were younger and had a longer mean hospital stay, compared with patients in the normal group (p=0.022 and 0.003, respectively). The incidences of increased ALT or AST were the highest in adenovirus infections (6/24, 25.0%), followed by enterovirus (2/11, 18.2%) and respiratory syncytial virus A (21/131, 16.0%) infections. CONCLUSION: Nonspecific reactive hepatitis is more common among patients with adenovirus, enterovirus and respiratory syncytial virus infection, as well as among those infected at a younger age. Compared with AST levels, ALT levels are better indicators of the severity of nonspecific reactive hepatitis.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.153446561,-0.047538164,-0.09223091,-0.122604086,-0.052850926,-0.055932382999999995,-0.04400812900000001,0.070256972,-0.09514356,0.023859874,-0.031957615,0.00805379,-0.021478115,0.09206153,-0.03229022,0.002400869,0.036527386,0.034607093,0.022232041,0.02798001,0.057841628,-0.119972091,-0.016229214,0.001441373,-0.030948836,-0.007296266,-0.004591469,-0.024579207999999998,-0.06308277799999999,-0.02826177

A cross-sectional, descriptive study was performed in 316 infants younger than 2 years of age who were hospitalized for acute viral bronchiolitis. Respiratory tract infection agents were investigated with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 316 infants were included in this study. Of the 316 infants, at least one respiratory tract pathogen was detected in 75% (237/316). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common virus identified in 127 infants (40.1%) followed by rhinovirus (n = 78, 24.6%). In this study, where viral agents were determined via PCR in patients who were followed-up due to the diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis, RSV was detected as the most common agent, as in other studies.

1143,"The Prevalence of Human Bocavirus, Human Coronavirus-NL63, Human Metapneumovirus, Human Polyomavirus KI and WU in Respiratory Tract Infections in Kuwait","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of human coronavirus (HCoV)-NL63, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (Boca), human polyomavirus KI (KIV) and human polyomavirus WU (WUV) in respiratory tract infections (RTI) in Kuwait. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Respiratory samples from 735 hospitalized patients with RTI from September 2010 to April 2013 were evaluated for the presence of HCoV-NL63, hMPV, Boca, KIV and WUV using molecular assays, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse-transcription PCR. RESULTS: Of the 735 patients, 285 (38.8%) were diagnosed with viral RTI. The distribution of respiratory viruses was hMPV: 15 (5.3%), Boca: 14 (4.9%), WUV: 10 (3.5%) and KIV: 4 (1.4%). HCoV-NL63 was not detected in any of the samples. CONCLUSIONS: These newly discovered viruses were associated with the development of RTI in Kuwait.

1145,Prevalence of Respiratory Viral Infections in Korean Adult Asthmatics With Acute Exacerbations: Comparison With Those With Stable State,"PURPOSE: Viral infections are involved in ~50% of exacerbations among Caucasian adult asthmatics. However, there have been few reports on the causative virus of exacerbations in Korean adult asthmatics. Thus, we compared frequencies and types of viruses between lower respiratory tract illnesses (LRTIs) with exacerbations (exacerbated LRTIs) and those without exacerbations (stable LRTIs) to evaluate contribution of respiratory viruses to exacerbations. METHODS: Viral RNA was extracted from sputum using the Viral Gene-spin™ Kit. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect adenovirus (ADV), metapneumovirus (MPV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1/2/3, influenza virus (IFV) A, IFV B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A/B, and rhinovirus (RV) A. RESULTS: Among the 259 patients, 210 underwent a single sputum examination, and the remaining 49 underwent 2 to 4 sputum examinations. Virus was detected in 68 of the 259 exacerbated episodes and in 11 of the 64 stable episodes. Among the exacerbated episodes, RV was the most frequently detected virus, followed by influenza A, parainfluenza, RSV A/B, and ADV. Among the 11 stable episodes, RV was most frequently detected. Detection rates of these viruses did not differ between the 2 groups (P>0.05). Thirty-five patients underwent the virus examination at 2 episodes of exacerbation, while 14 patients underwent at each time of exacerbated and stable episodes. Virus detection rate at the second examination was significantly higher in cases with 2 exacerbation episodes than in those with initial exacerbation and sequential stable episodes (P=0.003). A seasonal pattern was noted in the detection rates of RV (September to December), IFV (January to April), PIV (May to September), and RSV A/B (September to April). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses were identified in approximately 20% of LRTI irrespective of the presence of asthma exacerbation. RV and IFV A/B were most frequently detected.

1146,Elucidation of Bacterial Pneumonia-Causing Pathogens in Patients with Respiratory Viral Infection,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial pneumonia occurring after respiratory viral infection is common. However, the predominant bacterial species causing pneumonia secondary to respiratory viral infections other than influenza remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to know whether the pathogens causing post-viral bacterial pneumonia vary according to the type of respiratory virus. METHODS: Study subjects were 5,298 patients, who underwent multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction for simultaneous detection of respiratory viruses, among who visited the emergency department or outpatient clinic with respiratory symptoms at Ulsan University Hospital between April 2013 and March 2016. The patients' medical records were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 251 clinically significant bacteria were identified in 233 patients with post-viral bacterial pneumonia. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the most frequent bacterium in patients aged <16 years, regardless of the preceding virus type (p=0.630). In patients aged ≥16 years, the isolated bacteria varied according to the preceding virus type. The major results were as follows (p<0.001): pneumonia in patients with influenza virus (type A/B), rhinovirus, and human metapneumovirus infections was caused by similar bacteria, and the findings indicated that Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia was very common in these patients. In contrast, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus infections were associated with pneumonia caused by gram-negative bacteria. CONCLUSION: The pathogens causing post-viral bacterial pneumonia vary according to the type of preceding respiratory virus.

1147,Effect of Rapid Molecular Diagnostic Testing and Antimicrobial Stewardship on Antimicrobial Therapy of Respiratory Infections,"BACKGROUND: Rapid molecular methods have created new opportunities for the clinical microbiology laboratory to affect patient care in the areas of initial diagnosis and therapy. Rapid diagnostic tests provide collaborative opportunities for antimicrobial stewardship Teams (AST) to improve patient outcomes and decrease antimicrobial use. In January of 2017 our institution initiated use of a FDA approved multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Respiratory Panel. The objective of this evaluation was to assess the clinical impact along with procalcitonin (PCT) on quality of patient care when used in conjunction with antimicrobial stewardship. METHODS: Molecular testing was performed using the BioFire FilmArray® Respiratory Panel [RP] (BioMerieux). The medical staff was encouraged to order an Influenza/RSV PCR test prior to ordering the full RP. The results of RP and PCT were available the same day as ordered. AST recommended the RP as part of its intervention on several patients and provided advice based on results. RESULTS: From January-April the results of 81 tests for the respiratory panel were evaluated. Of these 30 were positive (+) for virus (most common-Human Metapneumovirus [HMV]-13, Coronavirus-7). PCT (ng/mL) results were available on 69. Most common final diagnosis: Pneumonia-31; AECOPD-16. Effect on duration of antimicrobial therapy (ABX) and hospital length of stay (LOS): CONCLUSION: The results of the RP led to a decrease in ABX duration, which was most profound in the patients for whom AST intervened. LOS was also reduced. Utilization of RP and PCT facilitated better ABX use. DISCLOSURES: T. M.

1148,Comparison of cytokine expression profiles in infants with a rhinovirus induced lower respiratory tract infection with or without wheezing: a comparison with respiratory syncytial virus,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether infants with rhinovirus (RV) infection-induced wheezing and those with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection-induced wheezing have different cytokine profiles in the acute stage. METHODS: Of the infants with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) between September 2011 and May 2012, 88 were confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and hospitalized. Systemic interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and Treg-type cytokine (IL-10) responses were examined with multiplex assay using acute phase serum samples. RESULTS: Of the 88 patients, 38 had an RV infection (RV group) and 50 had an RSV infection (RSV group). In the RV group, the IFN-γ and IL-10 concentrations were higher in the patients with than in the patients without wheezing (P=0.022 and P=0.007, respectively). In the RSV group, the differences in IFN-γ and IL-10 concentrations did not reach statistical significance between the patients with and the patients without wheezing (P=0.105 and P=0.965, respectively). The IFN-γ and IL-10 concentrations were not significantly different between the RV group with wheezing and the RSV group with wheezing (P=0.155 and P=0.801, respectively), in contrast to the significant difference between the RV group without wheezing and the RSV group without wheezing (P=0.019 and P=0.035, respectively). CONCLUSION: In comparison with RSV-induced LRTI, RV-induced LRTI combined with wheezing showed similar IFN-γ and IL-10 levels, which may have an important regulatory function.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.10903779999999999,-0.069371015,-0.052379071,-0.12134790699999999,-0.040357317999999996,-0.061861980999999996,0.036671401,-0.065161121,0.045056581,-0.091838081,-0.010608464,-0.083110629,-0.13748554699999999,0.08262069,-0.09376101099999999,0.016844173,0.020903134,0.009337986,0.013563212,-0.022466,0.038955147,-0.20245748,0.03156988,0.002728455,0.00174836,-0.148421545,0.18373352699999998,0.08399071599999999,-0.058000732,0.055374645
1152,"Incidence, Etiology, and Outcomes of Community-Acquired Pneumonia: A Population-Based Study","BACKGROUND: The microbial etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is often unclear in clinical practice, and previous studies have produced variable results. Population-based studies examining etiology and incidence are lacking. This study examined the incidence and etiology of CAP requiring hospitalization in a population-based cohort as well as risk factors and outcomes for specific etiologies. METHODS: Consecutive admissions due to CAP in Reykjavik, Iceland were studied. Etiologic testing was performed with cultures, urine-antigen detection, and polymerase chain reaction analysis of airway samples. Outcomes were length of stay, intensive care unit admission, assisted ventilation, and mortality. RESULTS: The inclusion rate was 95%. The incidence of CAP requiring hospitalization was 20.6 cases per 10000 adults/year. A potential pathogen was detected in 52% (164 of 310) of admissions and in 74% (43 of 58) with complete sample sets. Streptococcuspneumoniae was the most common pathogen (61 of 310, 20%; incidence: 4.1/10000). Viruses were identified in 15% (47 of 310; incidence: 3.1/10000), Mycoplasmapneumoniae were identified in 12% (36 of 310; incidence: 2.4/10000), and multiple pathogens were identified in 10% (30 of 310; incidence: 2.0/10000). Recent antimicrobial therapy was associated with increased detection of M pneumoniae (P < .001), whereas a lack of recent antimicrobial therapy was associated with increased detection of S pneumoniae (P = .02). Symptoms and outcomes were similar irrespective of microbial etiology. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococci, M pneumoniae, and viruses are the most common pathogens associated with CAP requiring hospital admission, and they all have a similar incidence that increases with age. Symptoms do not correlate with specific agents, and outcomes are similar irrespective of pathogens identified.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.133773936,-0.067724906,-0.038498407000000005,-0.06732829900000001,-0.03426892,-0.044959318,0.015878746000000003,0.056553373,-0.116679084,0.055985732,-0.058434707999999995,-0.00012208,-0.012678513,-0.099666984,-0.060243150999999995,-0.006890479000000001,-0.030612751,-0.02289088,-0.041489519,0.042196200999999996,-0.031315726,0.077977879,0.16167717,0.052160204,0.111389044,-0.094026271,0.026089651000000002,0.051252478,0.097171026,0.006818426999999999
1153,Viral and Bacterial Etiologies of Acute Respiratory Infections Among Children Under 5 Years in Senegal,"Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are the leading cause of infectious disease–related morbidity, hospitalization, and morbidity among children worldwide. This study aimed to assess the viral and bacterial causes of ARI morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years in Senegal. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected from children under 5 years who had ARI. Viruses and bacteria were identified using multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and conventional biochemical techniques, respectively. Adenovirus was the most prevalent virus (50%; n = 81), followed by influenza virus (45.68%, n = 74), rhinovirus (40.12%; n = 65), enterovirus (25.31%; n = 41), and respiratory syncytial virus (16.05%; n = 26), whereas Streptococcus pneumoniae (17%; n = 29), Moraxella catarrhalis (15.43%; n = 25), and Haemophilus influenzae (8.02%; n = 13) were the most commonly isolated bacteria. Virus pathogens seem more likely to be more prevalent in our settings and were often associated with bacteria and S. pneumoniae (6%; 16) coinfection.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.225404452,-0.13435607300000002,-0.048447903,0.048006589,0.040734636,-0.051573407,0.02628043,-0.049149577,-0.005435315,0.065478007,-0.002117036,-0.05230332,-0.003042328,-0.06826080000000001,0.035126517999999995,-0.018151122,-0.0029466009999999996,-0.09445967699999999,0.039076962,-0.0022403320000000003,-0.077882855,0.11857784099999999,0.120528518,0.065477466,0.048431478,0.063942939,0.002083122,0.044127089,0.077027458,-0.059337445999999995
1157,Nucleosides for the treatment of respiratory RNA virus infections,"Influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronaviruses, and rhinoviruses are among the most common viruses causing mild seasonal colds. These RNA viruses can also cause lower respiratory tract infections leading to bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Young children, the elderly, and patients with compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or immune systems are at greatest risk for serious disease associated with these RNA virus respiratory infections. In addition, swine and avian influenza viruses, together with severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, represent significant pandemic threats to the general population. In this review, we describe the current medical need resulting from respiratory infections caused by RNA viruses, which justifies drug discovery efforts to identify new therapeutic agents. The RNA polymerase of respiratory viruses represents an attractive target for nucleoside and nucleotide analogs acting as inhibitors of RNA chain synthesis. Here, we present the molecular, biochemical, and structural fundamentals of the polymerase of the four major families of RNA respiratory viruses: Orthomyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae/Paramyxoviridae, Coronaviridae, and Picornaviridae. We summarize past and current efforts to develop nucleoside and nucleotide analogs as antiviral agents against respiratory virus infections. This includes molecules with very broad antiviral spectrum such as ribavirin and T-705 (favipiravir), and others targeting more specifically one or a few virus families. Recent advances in our understanding of the structure(s) and function(s) of respiratory virus polymerases will likely support the discovery and development of novel nucleoside analogs.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.080738739,-0.09565145900000001,-0.155307831,0.26138643100000003,0.008560265,0.023744928,0.08565706199999999,0.011212726999999999,0.043052287,0.138262267,0.046200655,-0.014106196000000001,0.09541968699999999,-0.023840897000000003,0.064056117,-0.060526101,-0.00690701,0.063869016,0.074511227,0.078616422,0.015259611000000001,-0.063852381,-0.047613862,0.098181561,0.017819661,-0.021615678,-0.038532417,-0.039882183,0.07251613400000001,-0.11309693
1159,Identifying agents triggering bronchiolitis in the State of Qatar,"BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis is considered as the most frequent lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children. This disorder is marked by acute inflammation, edema, damage of epithelial cells lining small airways, and augmentation of mucus production. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to identify agents triggering bronchiolitis in the State of Qatar. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective study was performed at Hamad Medical Corporation, the only tertiary and academic medical center in the State of Qatar. The study included infants and young children aged 0–24 months who were admitted to our pediatric ward with diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis (2010–2012) RESULTS: Eight hundred thirty-five infants and young children met the study inclusion criteria with mean age at diagnosis of 3.61±3.56 months. Respiratory virus real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on 769 (92.0%) of the participants. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was positive in 352 (45.7%) children admitted with clinical bronchiolitis. In addition, no viruses were identified in 142 (18.4%) of those admitted, and respiratory viruses other RSV were found in 275 (35.7%) of the children. Our investigations and observations show that there has been a steady and periodic seasonal variation in the RSV rate over the study period. A seasonal trend for the RSV (detected by respiratory virus real-time polymerase chain reaction) rate was evident, showing annual peaks in the months of October, November, December, and January, with a significant test for seasonality (test statistics [T]=3.15, P=0.009). CONCLUSION: In countries with desert hot weather, bronchiolitis might affect children throughout the year. Our results suggest that the combination of date regarding uninterrupted RSV seasonality can provide guidance for health care planning and application of RSV prevention scheme, such as extending the palivizumab immunoglobulin series.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.24595132100000003,-0.126839469,-0.08413087300000001,0.048983927999999996,0.028999828,-0.124535175,0.06605315,-0.12719499,0.16668833800000002,-0.067245979,0.033418817999999996,-0.08340081099999999,-0.129609124,-0.090798299,-0.012013095,0.044520462000000004,-0.008589598,0.016599155,0.02179089,-0.016634648000000002,-0.02228545,-0.05418171,0.0018057079999999998,-0.055810225,0.044792635,-0.070710447,0.164970086,0.083143857,-0.024592363,0.006707978000000001
1160,Community-Acquired Respiratory Paramyxovirus Infection After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: A Single-Center Experience,"BACKGROUND: Paramyxoviruses include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), and human metapneumovirus (MPV), which may cause significant respiratory tract infectious disease (RTID) and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, clinical data regarding frequency and outcome are scarce. METHODS: We identified all paramyxovirus RTIDs in allogeneic HCT recipients diagnosed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction between 2010 and 2014. Baseline characteristics of patients, treatment, and outcome of each episode were analyzed; ie, moderate, severe, and very severe immunodeficiency (verySID) according to HCT ≤6 months, T- or B-cell depletion ≤3 months, graft-versus-host disease, neutropenia, lymphopenia, or hypo-gammaglobulinemia. RESULTS: One hundred three RTID episodes in 66 patients were identified (PIV 47% [48 of 103], RSV 32% [33 of 103], MPV 21% [22 of 103]). Episodes occurred in 85% (87 of 103) at >100 days post-HCT. Lower RTID accounted for 36% (37 of 103). Thirty-nine percent (40 of 103) of RTID episodes required hospitalization and more frequently affected patients with lower RTID. Six percent progressed from upper to lower RTID. Overall mortality was 6% and did not differ between paramyxoviruses. Sixty-one percent (63 of 103) of episodes occurred in patients with SID, and 20.2% (19 of 63) of episodes occurred in patients with verySID. Oral ribavirin plus intravenous immunoglobulin was administered in 38% (39 of 103) of RTIDs, preferably for RSV or MPV (P ≤ .001) and for SID patients (P = .001). Patients with verySID frequently progressed to lower RTID (P = .075), required intensive care unit transfer, and showed higher mortality. CONCLUSION: Paramyxovirus RTID remains a major concern in allogeneic HCT patients fulfilling SID and verySID, emphasizing that efficacious and safe antiviral treatments are urgently needed.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.140011935,-0.057605153,-0.086435143,-0.076539545,-0.034993904,-0.046737018,-0.003970077,0.027735527000000003,-0.043393092,0.010355821999999999,-0.021545419,0.001580805,-0.042425429,0.042449405999999995,-0.041732072,0.006129014,0.012557612,0.059342556,0.015975594,0.033104489,0.051101508,-0.125211378,-0.028488978999999998,-0.003253233,0.03933189,-0.064738506,0.078029257,0.018706671,-0.053229541,0.008031448

1164,Clinical and laboratory profiles of hospitalized children with acute respiratory virus infection,"PURPOSE: Despite the availability of molecular methods, identification of the causative virus in children with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) has proven difficult as the same viruses are often detected in asymptomatic children. METHODS: Multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays were performed to detect 15 common respiratory viruses in children under 15 years of age who were hospitalized with ARI between January 2013 and December 2015. Viral epidemiology and clinical profiles of single virus infections were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 3,505 patients, viruses were identified in 2,424 (69.1%), with the assay revealing a single virus in 1,747 cases (49.8%). While major pathogens in single virus-positive cases differed according to age, human rhinovirus (hRV) was common in patients of all ages. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (IF), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) were found to be seasonal pathogens, appearing from fall through winter and spring, whereas hRV and adenovirus (AdV) were detected in every season. Patients with ARIs caused by RSV and hRV were frequently afebrile and more commonly had wheezing compared with patients with other viral ARIs. Neutrophil-dominant inflammation was observed in ARIs caused by IF, AdV, and hRV, whereas lymphocyte-dominant inflammation was observed with RSV A, parainfluenza virus, and hMPV. Monocytosis was common with RSV and AdV, whereas eosinophilia was observed with hRV. CONCLUSION: In combination with viral identification, recognition of virus-specific clinical and laboratory patterns will expand our understanding of the epidemiology of viral ARIs and help us to establish more efficient therapeutic and preventive strategies.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.265826877,-0.153701716,-0.099333412,0.11658277,0.031985128,-0.11324994199999999,0.054652607,-0.090350031,0.078224881,0.023273789,-0.0037026840000000004,-0.100886048,-0.050519142,0.008942025,-0.016536629,-0.056384508,0.0054818869999999995,0.05611913599999999,0.002071004,0.027608529,0.057877517,-0.07437287599999999,-0.05044086,0.059249874,-0.077239552,0.067701984,0.013244738999999998,0.050063019,0.028855035,0.156046299
1175,"Clinical Features, Severity, and Incidence of RSV Illness During 12 Consecutive Seasons in a Community Cohort of Adults ≥60 Years Old","BACKGROUND: The epidemiology and burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) illness are not well defined in older adults. METHODS: Adults ≥60 years old seeking outpatient care for acute respiratory illness were recruited from 2004–2005 through 2015–2016 during the winter seasons. RSV was identified from respiratory swabs by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were ascertained by interview and medical record abstraction. The incidence of medically attended RSV was estimated for each seasonal cohort. RESULTS: RSV was identified in 243 (11%) of 2257 enrollments (241 of 1832 individuals), including 121 RSV type A and 122 RSV type B. The RSV clinical outcome was serious in 47 (19%), moderate in 155 (64%), and mild in 41 (17%). Serious outcomes included hospital admission (n = 29), emergency department visit (n = 13), and pneumonia (n = 23) and were associated with lower respiratory tract symptoms during the enrollment visit. Moderate outcomes included receipt of a new antibiotic prescription (n = 144; 59%), bronchodilator/nebulizer (n = 45; 19%), or systemic corticosteroids (n = 28; 12%). The relative risk of a serious outcome was significantly increased in persons aged ≥75 years (vs 60–64 years) and in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure. The average seasonal incidence was 139 cases/10 000, and it was significantly higher in persons with cardiopulmonary disease compared with others (rate ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.44–2.48). CONCLUSIONS: RSV causes substantial outpatient illness with lower respiratory tract involvement.

1177,Use of Dipstick Assay and Rapid PCR-DNA Analysis of Nasal Secretions for Diagnosis of Bacterial Sinusitis in Children With Chronic Cough,"BACKGROUND: Chronic cough in children is a diagnostic challenge. OBJECTIVE: To discover the utility of nasal dipsticks and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-DNA analysis in differentiating bacterial sinusitis from other causes of chronic cough and identifying pathogens from the nasal cavity. METHOD: We recruited 22 patients under 15 years of age with cough lasting longer than 4 weeks (group 1), 7 controls with allergic rhinitis (group 2), and 10 controls without respiratory symptoms (group 3). Based on symptoms, the results of nasal secretion assays, and nasal endoscopy, a diagnosis of clinical bacterial sinusitis was made. We identified potential pathogens by quantitative PCR of nasal secretions. RESULTS: Group 1A (cough with clinical bacterial sinusitis n = 10): Eight (80%) patients had bacterial sinusitis associated with dominant potential pathogenic bacteria (PPB): Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Group 1B (cough without clinical bacterial sinusitis n = 12): None had dominant PPB. Group 2 (allergic rhinitis n = 7): None had dominant PPB. Group 3 (asymptomatic n = 10): None had dominant PPB. Twenty to 57% of all groups were colonized with Staphylococcus aureus. Fifty to 70% were colonized with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, and Dolosigranulum pigrum. CONCLUSION: In children with chronic cough, clinicians can utilize a simple and inexpensive nasal secretion dipstick assay for rapid diagnosis of sinusitis and identify PPB by DNA-PCR test for specific antibiotic treatment.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.10961758699999999,-0.026585281000000002,0.011899156999999999,-0.09096325300000001,-0.031987592999999995,-0.054262943,0.029133064,0.023865342999999997,-0.075709236,0.021629235,-0.029124292000000003,-0.023786882999999998,-0.022318547999999997,-0.033327597,-0.019073015,-0.002859615,-0.013845663999999999,-0.012251775,0.026111488,-0.033442787,-0.046057241,-0.011065306,0.036094517,-0.020049308000000002,-0.006530286999999999,0.007931045,-0.014619789,-0.020374389,0.022745519,-0.013236926999999999
1178,Respiratory Viral Infections in Children and Adolescents with Hematological Malignancies,"BACKGROUND: Despite the introduction of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for the diagnosis of respiratory viral infection (RVI), guidance on the application of this test and the management of RVI in immunocompromised children is lacking. This study evaluated the clinical characteristics of RVI and established strategies for the PCR test in children and adolescents with hematological malignancies. METHODS: This study included children and adolescents with underlying hematological malignancies and respiratory symptoms, in whom a multiplex PCR test was performed. Patients in whom RVI was identified and not identified were categorized into Groups I and II, respectively. Group I was sub-divided into patients with upper and lower respiratory infections. The medical records of the enrolled patients were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 93 respiratory illnesses were included. Group I included 46 (49.5%) cases of RVI, including 31 (67.4%) upper and 15 (32.6%) lower respiratory infections. Rhinovirus (37.0%) was the most common viral pathogen. Significantly more patients in Group I had community-acquired respiratory illnesses (p=0.003) and complained of rhinorrhea (p<0.001) and sputum (p=0.008) than those in Group II. In Group I, significantly more patients with lower respiratory infections had uncontrolled underlying malignancies (p=0.038) and received re-induction or palliative chemotherapy (p=0.006) than those with upper respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS: A multiplex PCR test should be considered for RVI diagnosis in immunocompromised children and adolescents with respiratory symptoms, especially in those with rhinorrhea or sputum prominent over a cough.

1184,The contribution of viruses and bacteria to community-acquired pneumonia in vaccinated children: a case–control study,"INTRODUCTION: Respiratory pathogens associated with childhood pneumonia are often detected in the upper respiratory tract of healthy children, making their contribution to pneumonia difficult to determine. We aimed to determine the contribution of common pathogens to pneumonia adjusting for rates of asymptomatic detection to inform future diagnosis, treatment and preventive strategies. METHODS: A case–control study was conducted among children <18 years in Perth, Western Australia. Cases were children hospitalised with radiologically confirmed pneumonia; controls were healthy children identified from outpatient and local immunisation clinics. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and tested for 14 respiratory viruses and 6 bacterial species by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For each pathogen, adjusted odds ratio (aOR; 95% CI) was calculated using multivariate logistic regression and population-attributable fraction (95% CI) for pneumonia was estimated. RESULTS: From May 2015 to October 2017, 230 cases and 230 controls were enrolled. At least one respiratory virus was identified in 57% of cases and 29% of controls (aOR: 4.7; 95% CI: 2.8 to 7.8). At least one bacterial species was detected in 72% of cases and 80% of controls (aOR: 0.7; 95% CI: 0.4 to 1.2). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detection was most strongly associated with pneumonia (aOR: 58.4; 95% CI: 15.6 to 217.5). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the only bacteria associated with pneumonia (aOR: 14.5; 95% CI: 2.2 to 94.8). We estimated that RSV, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza, adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were responsible for 20.2% (95% CI: 14.6 to 25.5), 9.8% (5.6% to 13.7%), 6.2% (2.5% to 9.7%), 4% (1.1% to 7.1%) and 7.2% (3.5% to 10.8%) of hospitalisations for childhood pneumonia, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses, particularly RSV and HMPV, are major contributors to pneumonia in Australian children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.270029052,-0.138835971,-0.10606050199999999,-0.010818526,0.024621487999999997,-0.074116233,0.013587743999999999,-0.033707022999999996,-0.027641205,-0.081078583,-0.008856900000000001,0.014090351000000001,-0.127667471,-0.132514901,-0.137219552,0.074889595,-0.12591714,-0.026975559,-0.008042623,0.007041263000000001,-0.191353665,0.228087486,0.16297616199999998,0.07016591400000001,0.039100436,-0.018856321000000002,-0.001245349,-0.179434173,-0.051451797,-0.081026607
1187,Evidence for Cross-Protection Against Subsequent Febrile Respiratory Illness Episodes From Prior Infections by Different Viruses Among Singapore Military Recruits 2009–2014,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the relative cross-protection conferred by infection with different groups of viruses through studies of sequential infections in humans. We investigated the presence of short-lived relative cross-protection conferred by specific prior viral infections against subsequent febrile respiratory illness (FRI). METHODS: Men enlisted in basic military training between December 2009 and December 2014 were recruited, with the first FRI as the study entry point. ResPlex II assays and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect viral pathogens in nasal wash samples, and survival analyses were performed to determine whether infection with particular viruses conferred short-lived relative cross-protection against FRI. RESULTS: Prior infection with adenovirus (hazard ratio [HR], 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], .14–.44) or influenza virus (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, .38–.73) conferred relative protection against subsequent FRI episode. Results were statistically significant even after adjustment for the interval between enlistment and FRI (P < .001). Adenovirus-positive participants with FRI episodes tended to be protected against subsequent infection with adenovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus/rhinovirus, and influenza virus (P = .062–.093), while men with influenza virus–positive FRI episodes tended be protected against subsequent infection with adenovirus (P = .044) and influenza virus (P = .081). CONCLUSION: Prior adenovirus or influenza virus infection conferred cross-protection against subsequent FRI episodes relative to prior infection due to other circulating viruses.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.085166934,-0.071502142,-0.016130675,0.032527002,0.004831996,0.09220822,-0.015414028,-0.00981736,-0.002874098,-0.042827961,0.004906296,-0.0028635659999999997,-0.01493732,-0.018006671000000002,0.02037358,0.026300401,-0.030982171,-0.072625984,0.039350593999999996,-0.028978477000000002,-0.02914898,0.021251885,-0.006344737,0.040639442000000005,-0.000665887,-0.0007244969999999999,-0.013525358999999999,-0.017816266,-0.04903075900000001,-0.027707087000000002
1188,The prevalence of respiratory pathogens in adults with community-acquired pneumonia in an outpatient cohort,"PURPOSE: Community-acquired pneumonia is a common illness worldwide. In adults, community-acquired bacterial pneumonia has been well studied, but viral pneumonia is less well understood. We designed this study to identify respiratory pathogens, including common pneumonia-causing bacteria, viruses and atypical pneumonia pathogens, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia at the Fever Clinic of Peking University Third Hospital. We collected sputum or throat swabs from patients diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. Multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed for 20 pathogens, including 9 viruses, 3 atypical pathogens and 8 bacteria. RESULTS: There were 232 outpatients enrolled in our study, and 153 patients (65.9%) had positive test results, of which 26.7% were viruses, 19.4% were atypical pathogens and 19.8% were bacteria. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was detected at the highest frequency (19.0%), exceeding Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. The most commonly identified viral pathogens were IFVs (15.1%), PIVs (3.4%) and RhV (2.6%). The most commonly identified bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.1%), Haemophilus influenza (6.5%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.6%). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that viruses were commonly detected in outpatients with CAP, and IFVs were the most common viruses, especially during flu season. Patients with viral infection were prone to viral-bacterial coinfection. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the leading pathogen in the outpatients with CAP. Viral infection occurs in a large number of outpatients with CAP, and it should receive greater attention in clinical work.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.217571443,-0.09777155400000001,-0.09069503599999999,-0.034968444,-0.055563508,-0.051227367,-0.020497709,0.119794624,-0.229514916,0.147535021,-0.081739849,-0.03854745,0.038053698999999996,-0.005198626,-0.055071334000000007,-0.070187333,-0.003965388,-0.018243635,-0.058663107,0.094041809,-0.029369272999999998,0.20341220100000001,0.207794917,0.057598303,0.126800647,-0.008459478000000001,0.035747252,0.102856346,0.14271482300000002,-0.053434015
1189,Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients with Pulmonary Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Infected with Influenza versus Other Respiratory Viruses,"BACKGROUND: Although the frequency of respiratory viral infection in patients with pulmonary acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is not uncommon, clinical significance of the condition remains to be further elucidated. The purpose of this study was to compare characteristics and outcomes of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with influenza and other respiratory viruses. METHODS: Clinical data of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with respiratory viruses January 2014–June 2018 were reviewed. Respiratory viral infection was identified by multiplex reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Among 126 patients who underwent multiplex RT-PCR, respiratory viral infection was identified in 46% (58/126): 28 patients with influenza and 30 patients with other respiratory viruses. There was no significant difference in baseline and clinical characteristics between patients with influenza and those with other respiratory viruses. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was more frequent in patients with influenza than in those with other respiratory viruses (32.1% vs 3.3%, p=0.006). Co-bacterial pathogens were more frequently isolated from respiratory samples of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with influenza virus than those with other respiratory viruses. (53.6% vs 26.7%, p=0.036). There were no significant differences regarding clinical outcomes. In multivariate analysis, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II was associated with 30-mortality (odds ratio, 1.158; 95% confidence interval, 1.022–1.312; p=0.022). CONCLUSION: Respiratory viral infection was not uncommon in patients with pulmonary ARDS.

1190,Comparison of Rates of Hospitalization Between Single and Dual Virus Detection in a Mexican Cohort of Children and Adults With Influenza-Like Illness,"BACKGROUND: Molecular detection methods allow for the simultaneous detection of several infectious agents. This study assesses whether co-infection with 2 viruses as compared with 1 is associated with increased hospitalization in those with acute respiratory infections. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled a cohort of pediatric and adult participants with influenza-like illness during 2010–2014 in Mexico. Clinical information and respiratory samples were collected at enrollment. Respiratory viruses were detected with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and influenza-specific reverse transcription PCR assays. Participants were followed for 14 and 28 days after inclusion. Severity of disease, as measured by hospitalization with acute respiratory infections, was compared between single and dual viral infections. RESULTS: Among 5662 participants in the study, either 1 (n = 3285) or 2 (n = 641) viruses were detected in 3926 participants. Rhinovirus (n = 1433), influenza (n = 888), and coronaviruses (n = 703) were the most frequently detected viruses (either alone or in co-infection). Bocavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), metapneumovirus, and rhinovirus cases were hospitalized more often than other viruses. Bocavirus+rhinovirus cases were hospitalized more often than those with rhinovirus alone (but not bocavirus alone). RSV cases were more likely to be hospitalized than cases with co-infections of RSV and parainfluenza virus or coronavirus. Metapneumovirus cases were hospitalized more often than those co-infected with metapneumovirus+coronavirus. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, detection of 2 viruses did not significantly increase hospitalizations compared with single virus infections. Larger studies will allow for distinguishing between sequential and simultaneous infection and for a better understanding of the role of each virus during the evolution of acute respiratory episodes.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.300375209,-0.124061622,-0.0746493,0.19102151899999997,0.066674218,-0.020976198999999997,0.011609758999999999,-0.075347539,0.080246884,0.026047205,0.028520502000000003,-0.102795121,0.022608514,-0.023703487000000002,0.053683475,-0.047022257000000005,0.020116833,-0.057196389,0.057869685,-0.004667945,0.00387255,-0.08723265,-0.04615833900000001,0.023170656,0.064365496,-0.017793995,0.044637271,0.06528249400000001,-0.024507567999999997,-0.062740933
1192,Respiratory syncytial virus–associated illness in adults with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or congestive heart failure,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is recognized as a serious pathogen in people with chronic cardiopulmonary conditions. Immunoprophylaxis might be considered for adults at high‐risk for frequent and severe RSV infection. Thus, we studied the incidence of RSV‐related medically attended acute respiratory illness (MARI) in adults with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or congestive heart failure (CHF). METHODS: Subjects ≥50 years of age with Gold Class III/IV COPD and/or American Heart Association class III/IV CHF and exposure to children ≥once per month were recruited. Subjects were evaluated over 1.5 to 2.5 years for RSV‐associated MARI, defined as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or seroresponse. RESULTS: Four hundred forty‐five subjects were enrolled between October 2011 and May 2012. Overall, 99 RSV infections were documented by PCR or serology for a cumulative incidence of 22.2%. Of these, 42 (9.4%) subjects had protocol‐specified RSV‐MARI for an incidence of 4.68/100 patient‐seasons. All‐cause MARI was common (63.85/100 patient‐seasons) with rhinovirus most commonly identified. CONCLUSION: RSV infection was common in adults with severe COPD and/or advanced CHF. Given the severity of underlying cardiopulmonary diseases in the study population, most illnesses were surprisingly mild. Thus, active immunization rather than passive immunoprophylaxis with monoclonal antibodies may be a more cost‐effective strategy.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.173672959,-0.087410171,-0.067548527,-0.000989808,-0.003988350999999999,-0.058460341,0.036250581000000004,-0.07426155,0.106486563,-0.066462544,0.020781338,-0.06075258099999999,-0.106440613,-0.074248564,-0.07286703900000001,0.009171021,-0.032610558,0.072992182,-0.024709116,-0.028049995,0.013597347,-0.150557056,0.020666751,-0.040180473,0.10354877400000001,-0.14904151699999998,0.199060562,0.10184535800000001,-0.026115912999999998,0.109386595
1194,Pathogens Causing Respiratory Tract Infections in Children Less Than 5 Years of Age in Senegal,"INTRODUCTION: While acute respiratory tract infections are the main cause of paediatric mortality and morbidity worldwide, pathogen patterns shift due to factors such as hygiene, vaccinations, and antibiotic resistance. Knowledge about current cause of respiratory infections is lacking, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The aim of this study was to identity the various respiratory pathogens causing acute respiratory tract infections in children below 5 years of age visiting a sub-urban primary care clinic in Senegal. METHODS: A case-control study was performed in September and October 2018. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from cases; infants with fever and respiratory symptoms, and controls; children involved in the vaccination programme. Viral identification was conducted by polymerase chain reaction for 21 different viruses; bacteria were identified by culture studies. Associations between microorganisms, acute respiratory infection and severity of disease were calculated by multivariate regression adjusting for confounders such as age, sex, and living area. RESULTS: Overall, 102 cases and 96 controls were included. Microorganisms were detected in 90.1% of cases and 53.7% of controls (P < .001). Influenza virus A (including H1N1), influenza virus B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and Streptococcus pneumoniae were independently associated with acute respiratory tract infections. Co-detection of two or more pathogens was present in 49.5% of cases; 31.7% of cases had a pneumonia and 90.2% was treated with antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: This case-control study in a primary care setting in sub-Saharan Africa found influenza virus A and B, RSV, and S pneumoniae to be the main causes of acute respiratory tract infections in children below 5 years of age. We recommend evaluation of antibiotics prescription behaviour in this setting.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.33482243,-0.138262398,-0.14246814800000002,0.097888112,0.010668858,-0.023828587000000002,0.013665752,-0.031242005,0.06584870599999999,0.041405042,0.002915821,-0.059450197999999996,0.007942231999999999,-0.097749404,0.030312277999999998,-0.017144235,-0.022184363999999998,-0.034203801,0.032085875,0.026712771,-0.051567702,0.00555726,0.009434595,-0.011088168,0.082030104,0.032492098999999997,-0.000322192,0.050575794,0.06660647900000001,-0.0745196
1195,"Hospital-based surveillance of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in Saudi Arabia, 2010-2016","BACKGROUND: Influenza is a highly contagious acute viral respiratory tract infection. The emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2009 caused a pandemic. Since then it has become a seasonal influenza virus. It causes symptoms ranging from mild to severe illness, which might be fatal, particularly in people with underlying chronic medical conditions, immunocompromised people, the elderly, and pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: Describe the data generated by the influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 surveillance in Saudi Arabia from 2010 to 2016. DESIGN: Retrospective, descriptive. SETTING: Hospitals reporting to the Ministry of Health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied aggregate data on hospitalized cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Saudi Arabia between 2010 and 2016. The surveillance system used the case definition proposed by the WHO. The cases were confirmed by performing the real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) on upper respiratory samples. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Suspected and confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases. SAMPLE SIZE: 113 502 suspected H1N1 cases and 17 094 (15.1%) confirmed cases. RESULTS: Most of the reported cases were registered in the Riyadh region. During the period of the study, the highest number of confirmed cases, 9262 (54.2 %), was in 2015. The case fatality rate for confirmed cases was 3.6%. CONCLUSION: Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 showed seasonal trends. The number of suspected influenza cases each year was proportionate to the number of confirmed cases for that year. Riyadh, Jeddah and the Eastern areas (regions with the highest population) reported most of the cases. LIMITATION: Only one strain of H1N1 was tested.

1196,Fatal Primary Human Bocavirus Pneumonia in an Immunocompetent Adult,"A 70-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for dyspnea and a fever of 2 weeks duration. Chest imaging showed bilateral infiltration, and a rapid diagnostic test for influenza virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Legionella spp. was negative.

1197,The profile of respiratory pathogens in induced sputum of elderly and non-elderly asthmatics,"INTRODUCTION: Respiratory pathogens are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis and exacerbations of asthma at all ages; however, little is known about the airway microbiome in the elderly. AIM OF THE STUDY: To identify respiratory pathogens in the induced sputum (IS) of elderly asthmatics, and to determine the association between pathogens and the markers of asthma activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-nine subjects with stable asthma, 15 above 65 years of age and 14 aged 30-49 years, underwent clinical evaluation, fractional exhaled nitric oxide measurement, and sputum induction. Pathogens were detected by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The periostin concentration of IS supernatants was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum eosinophil cationic protein and total IgE levels were measured by ImmunoCAP. RESULTS: Elderly patients, as compared to non-elderly, had significantly higher eosinophilia in IS, although other markers of eosinophilic inflammation were comparable. Half of the subjects were positive for Haemophilus influenzae. Chlamydophila pneumoniae was found in two subjects. Respiratory viruses were detected in more than 70% of patients. The detection rates and profiles of atypical bacteria and respiratory viruses were similar in both groups. Only in the elderly asthmatics was influenza A positivity associated with lower predicted FVC%, RSV A positivity connected with decreased tIgE concentration, and RSV B positivity related to a lower percentage of lymphocytes in IS. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the existence of differences in some clinical and inflammatory characteristics of asthma between elderly and non-elderly asthmatics, the pathogen detection rates in the IS from the two groups are similar.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.15033622,-0.083797332,-0.04682116099999999,-0.036873368,-0.024187467999999997,-0.049234445,0.023643235,-0.014432013999999998,-0.033215899,0.008290349,-0.038419276,-0.039541197,-0.037235736,-0.00011779399999999999,-0.036588483,-0.035152215,0.023477982999999997,-0.06305591,0.020578213999999997,-0.018600743,0.02052858,-0.155242097,0.047495797,0.050112570999999995,0.031184233,0.024251299,-0.009236425,0.035894993,0.088428256,0.052131542999999995
1205,Frequency and clinical relevance of human bocavirus infection in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"OBJECTIVE: Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a recently discovered parvovirus associated with acute respiratory tract infections in children. The objective of the present study was to determine the frequency and clinical relevance of HBoV infection in adult patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD). METHODS: We retrospectively tested 212 COPD patients, 141 (66.5%) with AE-COPD and 71 (33.5%) with stable disease, of whom nasal lavage and induced sputum had been obtained for the presence of HBoV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The specificity of positive polymerase chain reaction results was confirmed by sequencing. RESULTS: Two hundred two of 212 patients for whom PCR results were available both for nasal lavage and induced sputum samples were eligible for data analysis. HBoV DNA was detected in three patients (1.5%). Of those, only one patient had AE-COPD. Thus, the frequency of HBoV infection demonstrated to be low in both AE-COPD (0.8%) and stable COPD (2.9%). HBoV was found in two sputum and one nasal lavage sample in different patients, respectively. Sequencing revealed >99% sequence identity with the reference strain. CONCLUSION: HBoV detection was infrequent. Since we detected HBoV in both upper and lower respiratory tract specimens and in AE-COPD as well as stable disease, a major role of HBoV infection in adults with AE-COPD is unlikely.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.115002342,-0.036673227,-0.028339267999999997,-0.11530040800000001,-0.01563842,-0.073913937,0.0121025,0.021380792000000003,-0.040124343,0.041966086,-0.047225786,0.007188398,0.016409332,0.028857382999999997,-0.02009216,-0.015330657,-0.018651605,-0.022618533,-0.00044067199999999997,-0.02439224,0.066098835,-0.059220582,-0.01161127,0.029580227,-0.049527655,0.010203410999999999,-0.08229749900000001,0.031789065,0.010365013000000001,0.096301416
1207,Detection of multiple respiratory pathogens during primary respiratory infection: nasal swab versus nasopharyngeal aspirate using real-time polymerase chain reaction,"In this study, we present the multiple detection of respiratory viruses in infants during primary respiratory illness, investigate the sensitivity of nasal swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates, and assess whether patient characteristics and viral load played a role in the sensitivity. Healthy infants were included at signs of first respiratory tract infection. Paired nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasal swabs were collected. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out for 11 respiratory pathogens. Paired nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasal swabs were collected in 98 infants. Rhinovirus (n = 67) and respiratory syncytial virus (n = 39) were the most frequently detected. Co-infection occurred in 48% (n = 45) of the infants. The sensitivity of the nasal swab was lower than the nasopharyngeal aspirate, in particular, for respiratory syncytial virus (51% vs. 100%) and rhinovirus (75% vs. 97%). The sensitivity of the nasal swab was strongly determined by the cycle threshold (CT) value (p < 0.001). The sensitivity of the swab for respiratory syncytial virus, but not rhinovirus, was 100% in children with severe symptoms (score ≥11). It is concluded that, for community-based studies and surveillance purposes, the nasal swab can be used, though the sensitivity is lower than the aspirate, in particular, for the detection of mild cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.239385149,-0.062948483,-0.022063566,0.055944584000000006,0.021180265,-0.11111081,0.034782929,-0.046374634000000005,0.070274132,0.011686121,0.022530741,-0.057514776,-0.025851299999999997,-0.040390127000000005,0.06877925,0.008907333,0.024441546,-0.09967593,0.115517414,-0.059373841,-0.045571263,-0.109420432,-0.046117480999999995,-0.029755927999999997,0.124922246,0.005763732,0.035928205,0.046953247999999996,-0.035968303,-0.12241091800000001
1211,Swabbing for respiratory viral infections in older patients: a comparison of rayon and nylon flocked swabs,"The purpose of this study was to compare the sampling efficacy of rayon swabs and nylon flocked swabs, and of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens for the detection of respiratory viruses in elderly patients. Samples were obtained from patients 60 years of age or above who were newly admitted to Sorlandet Hospital Arendal, Norway. The patients were interviewed for current symptoms of a respiratory tract infection. Using rayon swabs and nylon flocked swabs, comparable sets of mucosal samples were harvested from the nasopharynx and the oropharynx. The samples were analysed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. A total of 223 patients (mean age 74.9 years, standard deviation [SD] 9.0 years) were swabbed and a virus was recovered from 11% of the symptomatic patients. Regardless of the sampling site, a calculated 4.8 times higher viral load (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–17, p = 0.017) was obtained using the nylon flocked swabs as compared to the rayon swabs. Also, regardless of the type of swab, a calculated 19 times higher viral load was found in the samples from the nasopharynx as compared to the oropharynx (95% CI 5.4–67.4, p < 0.001). When swabbing for respiratory viruses in elderly patients, nasopharyngeal rather than oropharyngeal samples should be obtained. Nylon flocked swabs appear to be more efficient than rayon swabs.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.20117041300000002,-0.034622499,-0.03818209,-0.04551687,0.006645463000000001,-0.074431784,-0.042801966,0.049280677,-0.113067893,-0.003075365,0.009947781999999999,0.036423178,-0.05651415,0.050302777,-0.028381731,0.011702238,-0.00951875,-0.071638803,0.076105625,-0.036534042999999995,-0.06253221099999999,-0.000184303,-0.025216726000000002,0.014211523,0.000482038,-0.003778652,-0.005046902,-0.089712711,-0.067122013,-0.04944242099999999
1213,Is respiratory viral infection really an important trigger of asthma exacerbations in children?,"We performed a prospective cohort study from September 2003 to December 2004 to delineate attributing the effect of different respiratory viral infections including newly discovered ones to asthma exacerbations in children in Hong Kong. One hundred and fourteen children aged 6–14 years with chronic stable asthma and on regular inhaled steroid were monitored for respiratory symptoms over a full calendar year from recruitment. They would attend the study clinic if peak expiratory flow rate decreased to below 80% of their baselines, if they met a predefined symptom score, or if parents subjectively felt them developing a cold. Virological diagnosis using virus culture, antigen detection, and polymerase chain reaction methods on nasal swab specimens would be attempted for all these visits irrespective of triggers. Physician diagnosed outcome of each episode was documented. Three hundred and five episodes of respiratory illnesses were captured in the cohort. Nasal specimens were available in 166 episodes, 92 of which were diagnosed as asthma exacerbations, and 74 non-asthma related episodes. Respiratory viruses were detected in 61 of 166 episodes (36.7%). There was no significant difference in virus detection rate between asthma exacerbations (32 out of 97 episodes, 34.8%) and non-asthma respiratory illnesses (29 out of 79 episodes, 39.2%). Although newly discovered respiratory viruses were identified in these episodes, rhinovirus was the commonest organism associated with both asthma exacerbations and non-asthma related episodes. Plausible explanations for much lower virus detection rate than previously reported include improved personal hygiene and precautionary measures taken during respiratory tract infections in the immediate post-severe acute respiratory syndrome period together with a significant contribution of other adverse factors like environmental air pollution. We conclude that not all viral infections in children with asthma lead to an asthma exacerbation and the attributing effect of different triggers of asthma exacerbations in children vary across different time periods and across different localities.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.155874992,-0.08561863199999999,-0.06530521,-0.024389106,0.008750238,-0.08884011800000001,0.084513079,-0.053515474,0.043670742,0.032243983,-0.017341332,-0.049863360999999995,-0.022231532999999998,-0.050089332,0.054785552,0.021147072000000003,0.016408953,-0.127546131,0.076834766,-0.054013583,-0.036216332999999996,-0.196198605,-0.086964048,0.109775545,0.000642964,0.13828163,-0.081835904,-0.011636756000000002,0.129024115,0.116325935
1229,Laboratory Diagnosis of SARS,"The virologic test results of 415 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were examined. The peak detection rate for SARS-associated coronavirus occurred at week 2 after illness onset for respiratory specimens, at weeks 2 to 3 for stool or rectal swab specimens, and at week 4 for urine specimens. The latest stool sample that was positive by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was collected on day 75 while the patient was receiving intensive care. Tracheal aspirate and stool samples had a higher diagnostic yield (RT-PCR average positive rate for first 2 weeks: 66.7% and 56.5%, respectively). Pooled throat and nasal swabs, rectal swab, nasal swab, throat swab, and nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens provided a moderate yield (29.7%–40.0%), whereas throat washing and urine specimens showed a lower yield (17.3% and 4.5%). The collection procedures for stool and pooled nasal and throat swab specimens were the least likely to transmit infection, and the combination gave the highest yield for coronavirus detection by RT-PCR.

1238,Microbiological study of patients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD) and the usefulness of analytical and clinical parameters in its identification (VIRAE study),"PURPOSE: Respiratory infection is the most common cause for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD). The aim of this work was to study the etiology of the respiratory infection in order to assess the usefulness of the clinical and analytical parameters used for COPD identification. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 132 patients over a period of 2 years. The etiology of the respiratory infection was studied by conventional sputum, paired serology tests for atypical bacteria, and viral diagnostic techniques (immunochromatography, immunofluorescence, cell culture, and molecular biology techniques). We grouped the patients into four groups based on the pathogens isolated (bacterial versus. viral, known etiology versus unknown etiology) and compared the groups. RESULTS: A pathogen was identified in 48 patients. The pathogen was identified through sputum culture in 34 patients, seroconversion in three patients, and a positive result from viral techniques in 14 patients. No significant differences in identifying etiology were observed in the clinical and analytical parameters within the different groups. The most cost-effective tests were the sputum test and the polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION: Based on our experience, clinical and analytical parameters are not useful for the etiological identification of COPD exacerbations. Diagnosing COPD exacerbation is difficult, with the conventional sputum test for bacterial etiology and molecular biology techniques for viral etiology providing the most profitability. Further studies are necessary to identify respiratory syndromes or analytical parameters that can be used to identify the etiology of new AE-COPD cases without the laborious diagnostic techniques.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.158145699,-0.027173346,-0.030454457999999997,-0.082954483,-0.092207377,-0.05890303400000001,0.0079853,0.070534955,-0.130246166,0.14301946699999998,-0.073390422,-0.037874869,0.076583418,0.004809639,-0.011887874,-0.039670725,0.025514401000000003,0.029902954,-0.039726817000000005,0.002403901,0.039165963,-0.08268034099999999,0.038968321,-0.023697529,0.004049612,0.009751208,-0.010229525,-0.005690279,-0.018978286,0.09517835

Objective To identify and determine the prevalence of major respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal secretions and adenoid tissue pre- and postoperatively of children undergoing adenoidectomy. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted in 36 patients under 12 years of age with upper airway lymphoid hypertrophy who were undergoing adenoidectomy, in which various respiratory viruses were investigated using real-time polymerase chain reaction in adenoid tissue and nasopharyngeal secretions collected preoperatively and 30 days postoperatively. Results At least 1 viral agent was isolated in any of the samples collected in 58.3% of children and 25.9% of total samples. Respiratory viruses were identified in 33.8% of preoperative nasopharyngeal specimens and in 19.8% of postoperative secretion. Of the 21 patients with positive results for any respiratory virus, 6 (28.6%) had more than 1 virus. Considering all 36 respiratory viruses found, the main agent isolated was rhinovirus (27.8%), followed by bocavirus (22.2%). Conclusion The virus found more frequently in all samples was rhinovirus.

1244,Respiratory Syncytial Virus Outbreak in the Basic Military Training Camp of the Republic of Korea Air Force,"OBJECTIVES: An outbreak of acute febrile illness occurred in the Republic of Korea Air Force boot camp from May to July 2011. An epidemiological investigation of the causative agent, which was of a highly infective nature, was conducted. METHODS: Throat swabs were carried out and a multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was performed to identify possible causative factors. RESULTS: The mean age of patients who had febrile illness during the study period was 20.24 years. The multiplex RT-PCR assay identified respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as the causative agent. The main symptoms were sore throat (76.0%), sputum (72.8%), cough (72.1%), tonsillar hypertrophy (67.9%), and rhinorrhea (55.9%). The mean temperature was 38.75°C and the attack rate among the recruits was 15.7% (588 out of 3750 recruits), while the mean duration of fever was 2.3 days. The prognosis was generally favorable with supportive care but recurrent fever occurred in 10.1% of the patients within a month. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first epidemiological study of an RSV outbreak that developed in a healthy young adult group. In the event of an outbreak of an acute febrile illness of a highly infective nature in facilities used by a young adult group, RSV should be considered among the possible causative agents.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.16779450399999998,-0.000639402,0.002980238,-0.013861381,-0.00340626,-0.056615860999999996,-0.024727047000000002,-0.013905082,-0.011845383999999999,-0.04687561,0.017205581,-0.018489565,-0.10928342199999999,0.002169993,-0.023621351000000002,-0.014648063000000001,0.014192773999999998,0.054107505,0.005524099,-0.0057067509999999995,0.026137814,-0.061547248,-0.062166815,-0.039809074,0.016014366999999998,-0.024027003999999998,0.137091254,0.09201755800000001,-0.041513997000000004,-0.003026687
1245,Epidemiology and Virology of Acute Respiratory Infections During the First Year of Life: A Birth Cohort Study in Vietnam,"BACKGROUND: Understanding viral etiology and age-specific incidence of acute respiratory infections in infants can help identify risk groups and inform vaccine delivery, but community-based data is lacking from tropical settings. METHODS: One thousand four hundred and seventy-eight infants in urban Ho Chi Minh City and 981 infants in a semi-rural district in southern Vietnam were enrolled at birth and followed to 1 year of age. Acute respiratory infection (ARI) episodes were identified through clinic-based illness surveillance, hospital admissions and self-reports. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from infants with respiratory symptoms and tested for 14 respiratory pathogens using multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Estimated incidence of ARI was 542 and 2691 per 1000 infant-years, and hospitalization rates for ARI were 81 and 138 per 1000 infant-years, in urban and semi-rural cohorts, respectively, from clinic- and hospital-based surveillance. However self-reported ARI episodes were just 1.5-fold higher in the semi-rural versus urban cohort, indicating that part of the urban–rural difference was explained by under-ascertainment in the urban cohort. Incidence was higher in infants ≥6 months of age than <6 months, but this was pathogen-specific. One or more viruses were detected in 53% (urban) and 64% (semi-rural) of samples from outpatients with ARI and in 78% and 66% of samples from hospitalized ARI patients, respectively. The most frequently detected viruses were rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus A and bocavirus. ARI-associated hospitalizations were associated with longer stays and more frequent ICU admission than other infections. CONCLUSIONS: ARI is a significant cause of morbidity in Vietnamese infants and influenza virus A is an under-appreciated cause of vaccine-preventable disease and hospitalizations in this tropical setting. Public health strategies to reduce infant ARI incidence and hospitalization rates are needed.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.17074207,-0.097944146,-0.064258367,0.023585107,0.030984701,-0.00421969,0.01506532,-0.03374923,0.039490477,-0.017187537,0.024710716,-0.003073415,-0.017124913999999998,-0.071619629,0.047323744,0.045145172000000004,-0.00049171,-0.08880781800000001,0.054489413,-0.030003778,-0.060203585,-0.078318003,-0.05151016,0.023484393,0.10358672099999999,-0.02522915,0.017568963,0.042272144000000005,0.027030362999999998,-0.076833638
1246,Severe Measles Infection: The Spectrum of Disease in 36 Critically Ill Adult Patients,"France has recently witnessed a nationwide outbreak of measles. Data on severe forms of measles in adults are lacking. We sought to describe the epidemiologic, clinical, treatment, and prognostic aspects of the disease in adult patients who required admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). We performed a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 36 adults admitted to a total of 64 ICUs throughout France for complications of measles from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2011. All cases of measles were confirmed by serologic testing and/or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The cohort consisted of 21 male and 15 female patients, with a median age of 29.2 years (25th–75th interquartile range [IQR], 27.2–34.2 yr) and a median Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) of 13 (IQR, 9–18). Among the 26 patients whose measles vaccination status was documented, none had received 2 injections. One patient had developed measles during childhood. Underlying comorbid conditions included chronic respiratory disease in 9 patients, immunosuppression in 7 patients, and obesity in 3 patients, while measles affected 5 pregnant women. Respiratory complications induced by measles infection led to ICU admission in 32 cases, and measles-related neurologic complications led to ICU admission in 2 cases. Two patients were admitted due to concurrent respiratory and neurologic complications. Bacterial superinfection of measles-related airway infection was suspected in 28 patients and was documented in 8. Four cases of community-acquired pneumonia, 6 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia, 1 case of tracheobronchitis, and 2 cases of sinusitis were microbiologically substantiated. Of 11 patients who required mechanical ventilation, 9 developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among the patients with ARDS, extraalveolar air leak complications occurred in 4 cases. Five patients died, all of whom were severely immunocompromised. On follow-up, 1 patient had severe chronic respiratory failure related to lung fibrosis, and 2 patients had mild lower limb paraparesis along with bladder dysfunction, both of which were ascribable to measles-induced encephalitis and myelitis. Among the 5 pregnant patients, the course of measles infection was uneventful, albeit 1 patient underwent emergent cesarean delivery because of fetal growth restriction. Measles is a disease with protean and potentially deceptive clinical manifestations, especially in the immunocompromised patient. Measles-associated pneumonitis and its complications, and less commonly postinfectious encephalomyelitis, are the main source of morbidity and mortality. In contrast with the usually benign course of the disease in immunocompetent patients, measles occurring in immunocompromised patients gives rise to lethal complications including ARDS, with or without bacterial superinfection. Other patients potentially at high risk for severe measles are young adults and pregnant women. Measles pneumonitis may predispose to air leak disease in patients using mechanical ventilation. To date, vaccination remains the most potent tool to control measles infection.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.136865345,-0.005870384,-0.09970362,-0.127435829,-0.0741297,-0.02015519,-0.059510115,0.103226264,-0.108460149,0.033378027000000005,-0.038133214,0.037605371,-0.008821707,0.036519735,-0.04144848,0.021760845,0.008298396999999999,0.066307703,-0.02792076,0.050736465,0.052260364000000004,-0.053191775999999996,-0.05030256,-0.01847553,0.000438594,-0.019892933,-0.0066752190000000005,0.023621512999999997,-0.03849925,-0.002294985
1249,Acute respiratory infection and bacteraemia as causes of non-malarial febrile illness in African children: a narrative review,"The replacement of “presumptive treatment for malaria” by “test before treat” strategies for the management of febrile illness is raising awareness of the importance of knowing more about the causes of illness in children who are suspected to have malaria but return a negative parasitological test. The most common cause of non-malarial febrile illness (NMFI) in African children is respiratory tract inflection. Whilst the bacterial causes of NMFI are well known, the increasing use of sensitive techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests is revealing large numbers of viruses that are potential respiratory pathogens. However, many of these organisms are commonly present in the respiratory tract of healthy children so causality and risk factors for pneumonia remain poorly understood. Inflection with a combination of viral and bacterial pathogens is increasingly recognised as important in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Similarly, blood stream inflections with organisms typically grown by aerobic culture are well known but a growing number of organisms that can be identified only by PCR, viral culture, or serology are now recognised to be common pathogens in African children. The high mortality of hospitalised children on the first or second day of admission suggests that, unless results are rapidly available, diagnostic tests to identify specific causes of illness will still be of limited use in guiding the potentially life saving decisions relating to initial treatment of children admitted to district hospitals in Africa with severe febrile illness and a negative test for malaria. Malaria control and the introduction of vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b and pneumococcal disease are contributing to improved child survival in Africa. However, increased parasitological testing for malaria is associated with increased use of antbiotics to which resistance is already high.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.157052623,-0.062687619,-0.036725177000000005,-0.014503641000000001,-0.047298743,-0.048807854000000005,0.075779951,-0.015648553,0.023639059,0.063116645,-0.012446259,-0.040900489,0.031716591,-0.106350951,0.009839236,-0.001593449,-0.06152118,0.005034015,-0.054157181,-0.033562632,-0.047058193,0.105896923,0.04519352099999999,-0.03530271,-0.013999046000000001,0.038285581,-0.0070074180000000005,-0.056182947999999996,0.055863492,-0.025582848
1253,Virus detection and its association with symptoms during influenza‐like illness in a sample of healthy adults enrolled in a randomised controlled vaccine trial,"Background Viral respiratory infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Many new aetiological agents have been described recently. Objectives We looked for respiratory viruses in a population‐based sample of healthy adults with influenza‐like illness (ILI). We investigated host and spatio‐temporal associations with virus isolation and host, spatio‐temporal and virus associations with self‐reported symptoms. Patients/Methods We recruited 586 participants experiencing 651 illness episodes from a population of healthy adults enrolled in an influenza vaccine effectiveness trial. At ILI assessment visits, a respiratory swab was collected and tested for viruses using a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Participants also completed a questionnaire detailing their clinical course in 336 episodes. Results Of 643 samples analysed, a virus was identified in 44%. Half were picornaviruses, with influenza and coronaviruses the next most common. Individuals with influenza were significantly less likely to have been immunised than the reference (virus negative) population (OR = 0·52 (0·31, 0·87) P = 0·01). The mean symptom score (95% CI) reported by individuals with influenza was significantly higher than in all other episodes [Influenza: 10·2 (9·4, 10·9); Other: 7·4 (7·2, 7·7); Difference (95% CI): 2·5 (1·5, 3·5); P < 0·001]. In an analysis restricted to influenza‐positive cases, the symptom score was not attenuated by vaccination. Conclusions Our findings indicate that a greater number of symptoms are displayed by individuals presenting with influenza confirmed ILI compared with other agents that cause ILI. While influenza vaccination reduced the probability of influenza virus detection, symptom score for influenza‐positive ILI was not attenuated.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.207805606,-0.129019456,-0.069718487,0.179823015,0.013887091,0.283052997,-0.135140709,-0.013213282,-0.044115539,-0.115534519,0.025530085,0.004195274000000001,-0.02310055,-0.027139566,-0.024323827000000003,0.029927795,-0.03141779,-0.09648399,0.048818423,-0.040682171,-0.057089869,-0.06486367900000001,-0.010395118,0.017685781,0.015522186,-0.031495445,-0.024334722000000003,-0.050851354,-0.00015800799999999998,-0.008170854
1254,Hospitalization due to human parainfluenza virus–associated lower respiratory tract illness in rural Thailand,"Background Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are an important cause of acute respiratory illness in young children but little is known about their epidemiology in the tropics. Methods From 2003–2007, we conducted surveillance for hospitalized respiratory illness in rural Thailand. We performed reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal specimens and enzyme immunoassay on paired sera Results Of 10,097 patients enrolled, 573 (5%) of all ages and 370 (9%) of children <5 years of age had evidence of HPIV infection (HPIV1=189, HPIV2=54, HPIV3=305, untyped=27).

1255,"Viral pneumonia in adults and older children in sub-Saharan Africa — epidemiology, aetiology, diagnosis and management","Community-acquired pneumonia causes substantial morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa with an estimated 131 million new cases each year. Viruses — such as influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus — are now recognised as important causes of respiratory disease in older children and adults in the developed world following the emergence of sensitive molecular diagnostic tests, recent severe viral epidemics, and the discovery of novel viruses. Few studies have comprehensively evaluated the viral aetiology of adult pneumonia in Africa, but it is likely to differ from Western settings due to varying seasonality and the high proportion of patients with immunosuppression and co-morbidities. Emerging data suggest a high prevalence of viral pathogens, as well as multiple viral and viral/bacterial infections in African adults with pneumonia. However, the interpretation of positive results from highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction tests can be challenging. Therapeutic and preventative options against viral respiratory infections are currently limited in the African setting.

1256,Upper airway viruses and bacteria detection in clinical pneumonia in a population with high nasal colonisation do not relate to clinical signs,"Indigenous Australian children have high (up to 90%) rates of nasopharyngeal microbial colonisation and of hospitalisation for pneumonia. In Indigenous children hospitalised with pneumonia in Central Australia, we describe the nasopharyngeal detection of viruses and bacteria and assessed whether their presence related to signs of pneumonia (tachypnoea and/or chest in-drawing) on hospital admission and during subsequent days. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and data were prospectively collected from 145 children (median age = 23.5 months, interquartile range [IQR] 8.7–50) hospitalised with pneumonia at Alice Springs Hospital, Australia, between April 2001 and July 2002. The cohort was enrolled in a randomised controlled study using zinc and/or vitamin A supplementation. NPS were taken within 24 hours of hospitalisation and kept frozen at-80°C until analysed in 2014. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and 16 respiratory viruses. Uni- and multi-variate analyses were used to examine the relationships. One or more organisms were present in 137 (94.5%) NPS; 133 (91.7%) detected ≥ 1 bacterium, 34 (37.2%) for ≥ 1 virus and 50 (34.5%) were positive for both viruses and bacteria. C. pneumoniae (n = 3) and M. pneumoniae (n = 2) were rare. In multi-variate analyses, age < 12 months (odds ratio [OR] 6.6 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.7–25.4]) and fever (OR 4.1 [95% CI 1.7–10.4]) were associated with tachypnoea and chest in-drawing. However the presence of bacteria and/or virus type was not associated with tachypnoea and/or chest in-drawing on admission or during recovery. In children with high nasopharyngeal microbial colonisation rates, the utility of NPS in determining the diagnosis of clinical pneumonia or duration of tachypnoea or in-drawing is likely limited.

1257,Respiratory Viruses and Atypical Bacteria Co-Infection in Children with Acute Respiratory Infection,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are one of the prevalent pediatric diseases. Coinfections of respiratory viruses and atypical bacterial respiratory pathogens are common. AIM: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of co-infection between respiratory pathogens including viruses, bacteria and atypical bacteria in a sample of Egyptian children presenting with symptoms of acute respiratory tract infection. METHODS: This one-year prospective cohort study conducted in Abo El Rish Pediatric Hospital, Cairo University over one year included children presenting with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Enrolled children were subjected to nasopharyngeal swabs or throat swabs and then processed to detect viral, bacterial and atypical bacterial causative agents by culture), retrotranscription polymerase, Monoplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Multiplex PCR. RESULTS: Viral etiological agents were detected in 20 cases (20.8%), while 76 patients (79.2%) had no definite viral aetiology. The most abundant virus detected was Rhinovirus in 36 (27.3%), followed by 21 (15.9%) were positive for RSV, 12 (9.1%) were positive for HMPV, 6 (4.5%) were positive for adenovirus and 3 (2.3%) were positive for influenza B. For Atypical bacterial causes Mycoplasma were positive for 9 (6.8%) cases and one case was positive for Bordetella parapertussis. Viral and atypical bacteria Co infection were detected in 14 (10.6%) of cases. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that coinfection with bacteria or atypical bacteria in children with acute respiratory tract infection is common and this co-infection can induce serious illness. The multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction should become an essential tool for epidemiological studies and can fill the gap between clinical presentation and definitive diagnosis.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.316592003,-0.107509424,-0.103502173,0.042098258,0.023195868999999997,-0.121240103,0.031703779,-0.028770237,0.008326732,0.07026356,0.024592173999999998,-0.074086129,0.010769741999999999,-0.013986118,0.047247289000000005,-0.050293304000000004,0.031097562999999998,-0.025350932000000003,0.021294697999999997,0.00583737,-0.015709571000000002,0.089903846,0.027064751,-0.03257967,0.040157042000000004,0.045652242999999995,-0.038893546,0.044270606,0.063294066,-0.066918983
1259,Spectrum of respiratory viral infections in liver disease patients with cirrhosis admitted in critical care unit,"BACKGROUND: Clinical significance of respiratory viruses (RVs) as an etiology of pneumonia in liver disease patients with cirrhosis is usually underestimated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the spectrum of RVs in cirrhotic patients with pneumonia admitted in critical care units (CCUs) and its impact on the clinical outcome of cirrhotic patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective study was conducted in a tertiary care CCU, and consecutive cirrhotic patients with pneumonia were included. Bronchoalveolar lavage or throat swab/nasal swab was collected in viral transport medium for analysis of RVs by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. A total of 135 cirrhotic patients were included, viral and bacterial etiology of pneumonia was identified, and analysis was done with the clinical outcome. RESULTS: Overall, RVs were detected in 30 (22.2%) cirrhotic patients and viral–bacterial coinfection in 16 (11.8%) cirrhotic patients. The most common virus detected was rhinovirus in 9 (30%) patients. Mortality in cirrhotic patients with RV infection was significantly higher in comparison to cirrhotic patients with no RV infection (25 [83.3%] and 11 [12.3%], respectively, P < 0.001).

1260,Identification of etiologic agents and clinical characteristics for patients suspected of having pertussis in a large Children’s Hospital in China,"BACKGROUND: In China, pertussis is a major health problem with an increasing incidence despite immunization efforts. Timely and accurate diagnosis is essential for the optimal management of pertussis, especially in severe cases. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum specimens were obtained from patients suspected of having pertussis on the day of hospitalization at Shanghai Children’s Medical Center from December 01, 2016, to November 30, 2017. The specimens were tested with the FilmArray Respiratory Panel, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that detects 16 viruses, Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae), and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae). RESULTS: Among the 140 children studied, 50.0% (70/140) were detected with a single pathogen, 45.0% (63/140) were detected with multiple pathogens, and 5.0% (7/140) had no detected pathogens. Forty-nine (35%, 49/140) patients tested positive for B. pertussis. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (Para) and rhinovirus/enterovirus (Rhino/Entero) were the most prevalent pathogens in patients with pertussis-like syndrome. No significant differences between the groups with pertussis and pertussis-like syndrome were observed regarding the clinical symptoms. Severe cases were more frequently observed in unvaccinated, premature and pertussis/RSV co-infection patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the importance of the timely and accurate diagnosis of pertussis based on both clinical symptoms and laboratory methods.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.153574515,-0.050357297,-0.04185744,-0.042527024000000004,-0.012519863,-0.053643763,0.0074821340000000005,0.011080159,-0.031299809,0.017853274,-0.008135923,-0.011424695,-0.035787581,-0.07474628400000001,0.019720819,0.035380892000000004,0.03369998,0.0029080079999999997,0.029917496000000002,-0.018577348,-0.004874776,0.005974231,0.050128371,-0.058129481,0.06548458900000001,-0.02453327,0.048028264,0.10701256599999999,0.038260348,-0.078806607
1263,Introducing a New Algorithm for Classification of Etiology in Studies on Pediatric Pneumonia: Protocol for the Trial of Respiratory Infections in Children for Enhanced Diagnostics Study,"BACKGROUND: There is a need to better distinguish viral infections from antibiotic-requiring bacterial infections in children presenting with clinical community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) to assist health care workers in decision making and to improve the rational use of antibiotics. OBJECTIVE: The overall aim of the Trial of Respiratory infections in children for ENhanced Diagnostics (TREND) study is to improve the differential diagnosis of bacterial and viral etiologies in children aged below 5 years with clinical CAP, by evaluating myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) as a biomarker for viral CAP and by evaluating an existing (multianalyte point-of-care antigen detection test system [mariPOC respi] ArcDia International Oy Ltd.) and a potential future point-of-care test for respiratory pathogens. METHODS: Children aged 1 to 59 months with clinical CAP as well as healthy, hospital-based, asymptomatic controls will be included at a pediatric emergency hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. Blood (analyzed for MxA and C-reactive protein) and nasopharyngeal samples (analyzed with real-time polymerase chain reaction as the gold standard and antigen-based mariPOC respi test as well as saved for future analyses of a novel recombinase polymerase amplification–based point-of-care test for respiratory pathogens) will be collected. A newly developed algorithm for the classification of CAP etiology will be used as the reference standard. RESULTS: A pilot study was performed from June to August 2017. The enrollment of study subjects started in November 2017. Results are expected by the end of 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from the TREND study can be an important step to improve the management of children with clinical CAP.

1265,Efficacy and Safety of Nitazoxanide in Addition to Standard of Care for the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness,"BACKGROUND: Effective therapeutics for respiratory viruses are needed. Early data suggest that nitazoxanide (NTZ) may be beneficial for treating acute respiratory viral illness. METHODS: From March 2014 through March 2017, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 260 participants ≥1 year old hospitalized with influenza-like illness at 6 hospitals in Mexico. Participants were randomized 1:1 to NTZ (age ≥12 years, 600 mg twice daily; age 4–11 years and 1–3 years, 200 or 100 mg twice daily, respectively) or placebo for 5 days in addition to standard of care. The primary endpoint was time from first dose to hospital discharge. Influenza reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Respifinder 22 multiplex test were used for virus detection. RESULTS: Of 260 participants enrolled, 257 were randomized and took at least 1 dose of study treatment (intention-to-treat population): 130 in the NTZ group and 127 in the placebo group. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median duration of hospitalization was 6.5 (interquartile range [IQR], 4.0–9.0) days in the NTZ group vs 7.0 (IQR, 4.0–9.0) days in the placebo group (P = .56). Duration of hospitalization between the 2 treatments was similar in children (P = .29) and adults (P = .62), influenza A and B (P = .32), and other respiratory viruses. Seven (5.4%) and 6 (4.7%) participants in the NTZ and placebo groups, respectively, reported serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with NTZ did not reduce the duration of hospital stay in severe influenza-like illness. Further analyses based on age and evaluations by virus did not reveal any subgroups that appeared to benefit from NTZ.

1268,Respiratory Viral Infection: An Underappreciated Cause of Acute Febrile Illness Admissions in Southern Sri Lanka,"The contribution of respiratory viruses to acute febrile illness (AFI) burden is poorly characterized. We describe the prevalence, seasonality, and clinical features of respiratory viral infection among AFI admissions in Sri Lanka. We enrolled AFI patients ≥ 1 year of age admitted to a tertiary care hospital in southern Sri Lanka, June 2012–October 2014. We collected epidemiologic/clinical data and a nasal or nasopharyngeal sample that was tested using polymerase chain reaction (Luminex NxTAG, Austin, TX). We determined associations between weather data and respiratory viral activity using the Spearman correlation and assessed respiratory virus seasonality using a Program for Appropriate Technology definition. Bivariable and multivariable regression analyses were conducted to identify features associated with respiratory virus detection. Among 964 patients, median age was 26.2 years (interquartile range 14.6–39.9) and 646 (67.0%) were male. One-fifth (203, 21.1%) had respiratory virus detected: 13.9% influenza, 1.4% human enterovirus/rhinovirus, 1.4% parainfluenza virus, 1.1% respiratory syncytial virus, and 1.1% human metapneumovirus. Patients with respiratory virus identified were younger (median 9.8 versus 27.7 years, P < 0.001) and more likely to have respiratory signs and symptoms. Influenza A and respiratory viral activity peaked in February–June each year. Maximum daily temperature was associated with influenza and respiratory viral activity (P = 0.03 each). Patients with respiratory virus were as likely as others to be prescribed antibiotics (55.2% versus 52.6%, P = 0.51), and none reported prior influenza vaccination. Respiratory viral infection was a common cause of AFI. Improved access to vaccines and respiratory diagnostics may help reduce disease burden and inappropriate antibiotic use.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.31447690300000003,-0.12450405199999999,-0.16308793900000002,0.147986816,0.005722259,0.016471929,-0.051068221,0.008465802,0.006293711,0.045608341,-0.011069394,-0.024858707999999997,0.062181895,0.040803301,0.007814161,-0.037344189,0.0372728,-0.046070108,0.06665757900000001,0.082679461,0.027651301,-0.120253326,-0.032479873,-0.002878468,0.052442578,0.013140347,-0.074825769,0.014290378000000001,-0.025119962000000003,-0.061866162
1270,Clinical features of Mycoplasma pneumoniae coinfection and need for its testing in influenza pneumonia patients,"BACKGROUND: To investigate the clinical features of coinfection due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae), a common copathogen in influenza, in influenza pneumonia patients. METHODS: We reviewed 4,465 patients with influenza who visited a tertiary care hospital emergency department in Seoul (Korea) from 2010 through 2016, and underwent immunoglobulin M (IgM) serology or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for M. pneumoniae. Influenza pneumonia was defined as laboratory-confirmed influenza plus radiographic pneumonia. Patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia or non-mycoplasma bacterial coinfection were excluded. Clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings and outcomes of the influenza pneumonia patients with and without M. pneumoniae coinfection were compared. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the coinfection. RESULTS: Of 244 influenza pneumonia patients, 41 (16.8%) had M. pneumoniae coinfection. These patients were younger with a higher frequency of age of 5–10 years, and had higher white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte counts; lower concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP). The coinfection had no association with specific radiographic findings and poor outcome. Multivariable analysis showed the age of 5–10 years (adjusted odds ratio, 18.83; 95% confidence interval, 5.899–60.08; P<0.001) as the factor associated with the coinfection. CONCLUSIONS: M. pneumoniae coinfection in influenza pneumonia may be associated with the age of 5–10 years, and otherwise clinically indistinct from influenza pneumonia without the coinfection. This finding suggests the need for M. pneumoniae testing in patients aged 5–10 years with influenza pneumonia.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.22165783100000003,-0.109490448,-0.108710703,-0.010889261,-0.079455878,0.12786888300000002,-0.15557976199999998,0.093469151,-0.20906512100000002,-0.038468962999999995,-0.05335832099999999,0.025290068,-0.028121753,-0.013857676000000001,-0.111212373,0.018272087,-0.004872178,0.019374773999999997,-0.043183594000000006,0.052077759,-0.034258592000000004,0.121568618,0.17552394899999998,0.013767625,0.037372971,-0.012806205,0.007633391999999999,0.016606285,0.017900346,0.008722373
1274,Clinical characteristics and outcomes of human rhinovirus positivity in hospitalized children,"BACKGROUND: The clinical relevance of positive human rhinovirus (HRV) in hospitalized patients is unclear. Our objective was to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of HRV positivity in a heterogeneous population of hospitalized children, compared to those positive for another respiratory virus and those where no respiratory virus was detected. METHODS: A retrospective case–control study of children hospitalized between January 2014 to April 2015 who had a respiratory viral specimen collected. Clinical and laboratory data were collected, and baseline characteristics and clinical variables were compared. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 671 specimens obtained from 577 patients that were processed for the respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction assay, of which 198 were positive for HRV, 167 positive for another respiratory virus, and 306 where no respiratory virus was detected. A history of asthma was significantly associated with HRV-positive patients (odds ratio [OR] 3.71; P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, HRV-positive patients had a higher requirement for mechanical ventilation (OR 1.44), lower rates of readmission (OR 0.53), and lower mortality (OR 0.35) compared to patients with no respiratory virus isolated; however, none were statistically significant. HRV-positive patients did have a significantly shorter length of stay (LOS) compared with patients with no respiratory virus isolated (difference–0.35; P = 0.001). Similar outcomes were seen in patients positive for other respiratory viruses. CONCLUSIONS: HRV-positive hospitalized pediatric patients with a heterogeneous set of clinical diagnoses had higher association with asthma compared to patients who had another, or no, respiratory virus isolated. HRV-positive patients had shorter LOS compared to patients who had no respiratory viruses isolated. These findings suggest that HRV positivity in hospitalized pediatric patients may not lead to adverse clinical outcomes, although asthma is a risk factor regardless of clinical comorbidities and diagnoses.

1278,Respiratory viruses in returning Hajj & Umrah pilgrims with acute respiratory illness in 2014-2015,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Respiratory tract infections are common among Hajj and Umrah pilgrims which pose a public health risk of spread of respiratory infections. Influenza has been reported from Indian Hajj and Umrah returning pilgrims, but data on other respiratory pathogens are sparse in India. Here we report the presence of common respiratory viral pathogens in returning Hajj and Umrah pilgrims suffering from acute respiratory illness (ARI) in 2014-2015. METHODS: Respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and throat swabs) were collected from 300 consenting pilgrims with ARI in the past one week and tested for influenza and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and other respiratory viruses using in-house standardized quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Clinical features among the pathogen positive and negative patients were compared. The patients received symptomatic treatment and antivirals where appropriate and were followed telephonically to collect data on illness outcome. RESULTS: Ninety seven (32.3%) of the 300 participants were tested positive for any virus, most common being influenza viruses (n=33, 11%). Other respiratory viruses that were detected included human coronaviruses [n=26, 8.7%; OC43 (n=19, 6.3%) and C229E (n=7, 2.3%)], rhinovirus (n=20, 6%), adenoviruses (n=8, 2.6%), parainfluenza viruses (n=7, 2.3%), respiratory syncytial virus (n=3, 1%) and bocaviruses (n=2, 0.6%). Clinical features observed in pathogen positive and pathogen negative patients did not differ significantly. Eighteen influenza positive patients were treated with oseltamivir. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Pilgrims returning from mass gatherings are often afflicted with respiratory pathogens with a potential to facilitate transmission of respiratory pathogens across international borders.

1285,Viral infection in community acquired pneumonia patients with fever: a prospective observational study,"BACKGROUND: Patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by viruses can develop severe complications, which result in hospitalization and death. The purpose of this study was to analyse the aetiology, incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of CAP patients with fever during non-pandemics, and then to provide theoretical basis for accurate diagnosis and treatment in CAP patients. METHODS: An enrolment system was established for monitoring the CAP patients with fever. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) kits were used to detect 10 viruses [influenza A and B, adenovirus (ADV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, picornavirus, parainfluenza virus (PIV), coronavirus, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and bocavirus]. Data on age, gender, underlying diseases, complications, laboratory indexes, and outcomes were collected by physicians. RESULTS: This prospective study included 320 patients with fever. Among them, 23.4% were viral-positive by mPCR, with influenza virus most prominent followed by picornavirus. Strong variation in seasonal distribution was shown in viral infections, with peak months from December to February. Patients with influenza infection were likely to be taken to emergency rooms and have respiratory failure with higher creatinine kinase levels and lower white blood cell counts. Streptococcus pneumoniae followed by haemophilus influenzae were the most common bacteria in viral co-infections, which accounted for one third of virus-positive patients. Viral CAP and mixed CAP were not independent factors for death. In addition, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) >246 IU/L [odds ratio (OR) =7.06, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.15–23.2, P=0.001], and serum calcium <2.18 mmol/L (OR =6.67, 95% CI: 1.42–31.3, P=0.016) were associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: Viruses play an important role in CAP patients with fever, a systematic clinical, radiological and biological analysis of these patients can contribute to effective therapy that may prevent the development of CAP and improve the outcomes.

1293,Characteristics and Outcomes of Coronavirus Infection in Children: The Role of Viral Factors and an Immunocompromised State,"BACKGROUND: Immunocompromised children might be predisposed to serious infections from human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including strains OC43, NL63, HKU1, and 229E; however, the virologic and clinical features of HCoV infection in immunocompromised children have not been compared to those in nonimmunocompromised children. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of children who presented to Seattle Children’s Hospital and in whom HCoV was detected by a multiplex respiratory polymerase chain reaction assay of a nasal sample between October 2012 and March 2016. Lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) was defined as possible or definite infiltrate seen in chest imaging, need for oxygen, or abnormal lung examination in conjunction with a physician diagnosis of LRTD. We used logistic regression modeling to evaluate risk factors for LRTD and LRTD that necessitated oxygen use (severe LRTD), including an immunocompromised state, in children with HCoV infection. RESULTS: The median ages of 85 immunocompromised and 1152 nonimmunocompromised children with HCoV infection were 6.3 and 1.6 years, respectively. The prevalence of LRTD and of severe LRTD did not differ greatly between the immunocompromised and nonimmunocompromised patients (22% vs 26% [LRTD] and 15% vs 11% [severe LRTD], respectively); however, in a multivariable model, an immunocompromised state was associated with an increased likelihood of severe LRTD (adjusted odds ratio, 2.5 [95% confidence interval, 1.2–4.9]; P = .01). Younger age, having an underlying pulmonary disorder, and the presence of respiratory syncytial virus were also associated with LRTD or severe LRTD in multivariable models. The risks of LRTD or severe LRTD did not differ among the children with different HCoV strains. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a copathogen and host factors, including an immunocompromised state, were associated with increased risk for severe LRTD.

1295,Rhinovirus in Febrile Infants and Risk of Bacterial Infection,"BACKGROUND: Febrile infants with viral respiratory infections have a reduced risk of bacterial infection compared with virus-negative infants. The risk of concomitant bacterial infection in febrile infants positive for human rhinovirus (HRV) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is unknown. METHODS: Infants 1–90 days old managed using the care process model for well-appearing febrile infants and with respiratory viral testing by PCR (RVPCR) in the emergency department or inpatient setting of 22 hospitals in the Intermountain Healthcare system from 2007-2016 were identified. Relative risk (RR) of bacterial infection was calculated for infants with HRV, non-HRV viruses, or no virus detected. RESULTS: Of 10 964 febrile infants identified, 4037 (37%) had RVPCR. Of these, 2212 (55%) were positive for a respiratory virus; 1392 (35%) for HRV alone. Bacterial infection was identified in 9.5%. Febrile infants with HRV detected were more likely to have bacterial infection than those with non-HRV viruses (7.8% vs 3.7%; P < .001; RR 2.12 [95% CI 1.43–3.15]). Risk of urinary tract infection was not significantly different for HRV-positive infants at any age, nor was risk of invasive bacterial infection (IBI; bacteremia and/or meningitis) meaningfully different for infants 1–28 day olds. Infants 29–90 days old with HRV had a decreased likelihood of IBI (RR 0.52 [95% CI 0.34–0.80]). CONCLUSIONS: HRV is common in febrile infants. Detection did not alter risk of concomitant urinary tract infection at any age or risk of IBI in infants 1–28 days old. HRV detection may be relevant in considering risk of IBI for infants 29–90 days of age.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.13955948599999998,-0.08694764599999999,-0.050916916,-0.06742079200000001,0.002722973,-0.072371497,0.059755773,-0.013705087,0.024138637,-0.004474354,0.0178245,-0.029230956000000002,-0.06361744700000001,-0.042943667000000005,0.059651425,0.076109212,0.017209182,-0.073757787,0.109105429,-0.053656443,-0.074201275,-0.13225199099999999,-0.109044881,0.08561394800000001,-0.011392952,0.054262435,-0.045689823,-0.043188330999999996,0.073571083,0.1585822
1299,"Dynamics of Bacterial Colonization With Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis During Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Viral Upper Respiratory Tract Infection","BACKGROUND: Virus is detected in about 80% of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in children and is also detectable in the nasopharynx of 30% of asymptomatic children. The effect of asymptomatic viral infection on the dynamics of bacterial density and colonization of the nasopharynx has not been reported. The current study was performed to assess the presence and density of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis in the nasopharynx of 4–7-year-old children during URTI and when well. METHODS: Nasal samples were obtained during 4 surveillance periods when children were asymptomatic and whenever they had symptoms of URTI. Respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens were identified and quantified using polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The proportion of children colonized with all 3 bacteria was higher during visits for acute URTI than during asymptomatic surveillance visits. Mean bacterial densities were significantly higher at all visits for all 3 pathogens when a virus was detected. The differences between the means were 1.0, 0.4, and 0.7 log(10) colony-forming unit equivalents per milliliter for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis, respectively, compared with visits in which virus was not detected. The percentage of children colonized and density were also higher at asymptomatic visits in which virus was detected than at visits in which virus was not detected. CONCLUSION: The density and frequency of colonization with S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis in nasal wash samples increase during periods of both symptomatic and asymptomatic viral infection. Increases in bacterial colonization observed during asymptomatic viral infection were nearly the same magnitude as when children were symptomatic.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.139172242,-0.102084618,-0.04773513,-0.037059998,0.017731836,-0.086615291,0.077732393,-0.043856969,0.022282333999999997,0.032975261,0.006133579,-0.056207032000000004,-0.027758612999999998,-0.066066499,0.037472223,0.004135036,-0.032966119,-0.08668382,0.032154342999999995,-0.04103241,-0.074072354,0.101374004,0.064312539,0.050638095999999994,0.027223868,0.07731735,-0.006096824,0.01768917,0.088284037,-0.016247168
1300,Human Washington University Polyomavirus in Patients with Respiratory Tract Infection in Kuwait,"OBJECTIVE: To determine Washington University (WU) polyomavirus strains circulating among hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections (RTI) in Kuwait. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples from 459 hospitalized children and adult RTI patients were screened for respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction from April 2013 to April 2016. The VP2 gene from WU virus (WUV)-positive samples was sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Of the 459 hospitalized RTI patients, 18 (3.9$) patients were positive for WUV infection. WUV infection was common among children aged ≤11 years (9 patients, 50$). Among the 18 WUV-infected hospitalized patients, viral co-infection was detected in 9 patients (50$). The most common viruses associated with mixed infection were respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus (2 patients, 11.1$ each). Of the 18 WUV-infected patients, 4 were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. The circulating strains belong to type Ia and IIIb. CONCLUSION: This study enabled us to detect WUV among hospitalized RTI patients. Co-infection with other respiratory viruses was notable. Two circulating WUV genotypes (Ia and IIIb) were identified among hospitalized RTI patients in Kuwait.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.18328239699999999,-0.061960272000000004,-0.09227396,-0.079280612,0.042614238,-0.073819497,-0.034505239,0.040443346,-0.07507035599999999,0.054412367999999996,-0.026533837999999997,0.052758621,0.009051078,0.10050263599999999,-0.016903783000000002,-0.028884472999999997,0.028547865,0.035277993,0.017534533,0.054267732,0.088623323,-0.018605886000000002,-0.019688238,0.035633622999999996,-0.037351228,0.0023984220000000003,-0.05824794,0.00041413800000000004,-0.054395106,0.037193473
1302,Detection of Respiratory Viruses from ARTI Patients by xTAG RVP Fast v2 Assay and Conventional Methods,"INTRODUCTION: Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in paediatric patients. Therefore, early detection of the viral aetiologies of ARTIs is essential for patient management and infection control. In this study, we evaluated the performance of a new multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel [RVP] Fast v2) in the detection of respiratory viruses by comparing it with that of viral culture and direct immunofluorescence (IF) staining. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swab and aspirate samples were collected prospectively from 199 patients who presented with ARTIs at the University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia during a 10-month period. The PCR assay was conducted in parallel with conventional culture and direct IF staining methods. RESULTS: The positive rate of the xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay (78.4%) in detecting respiratory viruses was higher than that of the viral isolation (7.5%) and direct IF (23.1%) methods. Using the xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay, human enterovirus/human rhinovirus (HEV/HRV) was the most frequently detected (46.2%). The xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay revealed mixed infection caused by two or three respiratory viruses in 40 specimens, and these were undetected by the viral isolation and direct IF methods. CONCLUSION: The xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay was superior to conventional methods in the identification of common respiratory viruses, with higher sensitivity and shorter turnaround times for laboratory results.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.136580649,-0.006862551999999999,0.048284640999999996,0.045189245,-0.02642823,-0.07638483900000001,0.042978605,0.001937466,-0.006919685,0.049392205999999994,-0.016276584,-0.019514857,0.019337828999999997,0.041272228,0.030519145,-0.043105147999999996,0.04543641599999999,-0.022035262000000003,0.048707460999999994,-0.001341305,0.043056366,-0.043641482,-0.006428205,-0.002376993,-0.047469573,0.036299579,-0.037130535,-0.024684115,-0.006332556,-0.033514212
1305,Impact of Respiratory Viral Panel Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay Turnaround Time on Length of Stay and Antibiotic Use in Patients With Respiratory Viral Illnesses,"Background: Respiratory viral illnesses account for many hospitalizations and inappropriate antibiotic use. Respiratory viral panels by polymerase chain reaction (RVP-PCR) provide a reliable means of diagnosis. In 2015, the RVP-PCR assay at our institution was switched from respiratory viral panel (RVP) to rapid respiratory panel (rapid RP), which has a faster turnaround time (24 hours vs 12 hours, respectively). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of RVP-PCR tests on duration of antibiotic use and length of stay (LOS) in hospitalized patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who had a RVP-PCR ordered within a 1-year time period before and after the assay switch. Patients who were pregnant, had received antibiotics within 30 days prior to admission, were not discharged, or had not completed antibiotics by end of study period were excluded. Results: Data were obtained from a total of 140 patients (70 in each group). Of these, 25 (35.7%) in the RVP group and 28 (40.0%) in the rapid RP group had a positive result. The median LOS was 4.5 days (IQR, 3-9 days) in the RVP group and 5 days (IQR, 3-9 days) in the rapid RP group (P = .78). The median duration of antibiotic use was 4 days (IQR, 2-7 days) in the RVP group and 5 days (IQR, 1-7 days) in the rapid RP group (P = .8). Conclusion: Despite faster turnaround time, there was no significant difference in duration of antibiotic use, or LOS between the RVP and rapid RP groups.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.115150007,-0.006906814,0.008682978000000001,-0.06630587,-0.048614872,-0.049627405,-0.015620872,0.057555132,-0.07790335799999999,0.010780475,-0.017414816,-0.006143936,-0.031399216,0.0241078,-0.00046314800000000003,0.025305095,0.061946300999999995,0.048308412,0.018594523,0.000720472,0.021092126,-0.088412423,-0.032355645,-0.09140180099999999,-0.06367742400000001,-0.019957298000000002,0.00676498,-0.083560349,-0.034760656,-0.010404598000000001
1312,Human Bocavirus Capsid Messenger RNA Detection in Children With Pneumonia,"BACKGROUND: The role of human bocavirus (HBoV) in respiratory illness is uncertain. HBoV genomic DNA is frequently detected in both ill and healthy children. We hypothesized that spliced viral capsid messenger RNA (mRNA) produced during active replication might be a better marker for acute infection. METHODS: As part of the Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community (EPIC) study, children aged <18 years who were hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and children asymptomatic at the time of elective outpatient surgery (controls) were enrolled. Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal specimens were tested for HBoV mRNA and genomic DNA by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: HBoV DNA was detected in 10.4% of 1295 patients with CAP and 7.5% of 721 controls (odds ratio [OR], 1.4 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.0–2.0]); HBoV mRNA was detected in 2.1% and 0.4%, respectively (OR, 5.1 [95% CI, 1.6–26]). When adjusted for age, enrollment month, and detection of other respiratory viruses, HBoV mRNA detection (adjusted OR, 7.6 [95% CI, 1.5–38.4]) but not DNA (adjusted OR, 1.2 [95% CI, .6–2.4]) was associated with CAP. Among children with no other pathogens detected, HBoV mRNA (OR, 9.6 [95% CI, 1.9–82]) was strongly associated with CAP. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of HBoV mRNA but not DNA was associated with CAP, supporting a pathogenic role for HBoV in CAP. HBoV mRNA could be a useful target for diagnostic testing.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.120229476,-0.10216172400000001,-0.054083959,-0.057049500999999996,-0.028238712000000003,-0.113104132,0.025838838,-0.014580191999999999,-0.064261928,-0.039235577,-0.06532874400000001,0.0025487879999999997,-0.015506155,-0.046009217000000005,-0.121644727,0.05711070099999999,-0.12145874699999999,-0.111355454,-0.014125496999999999,0.026436294,-0.133707032,0.20545753,0.16147835300000002,0.12681888300000002,-0.010417429,-0.11176624199999999,-0.12611747,-0.068948009,0.078128001,0.056403721
1319,Density of Upper Respiratory Colonization With Streptococcus pneumoniae and Its Role in the Diagnosis of Pneumococcal Pneumonia Among Children Aged <5 Years in the PERCH Study,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggested an association between upper airway pneumococcal colonization density and pneumococcal pneumonia, but data in children are limited. Using data from the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study, we assessed this potential association. METHODS: PERCH is a case-control study in 7 countries: Bangladesh, The Gambia, Kenya, Mali, South Africa, Thailand, and Zambia. Cases were children aged 1–59 months hospitalized with World Health Organization–defined severe or very severe pneumonia. Controls were randomly selected from the community. Microbiologically confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia (MCPP) was confirmed by detection of pneumococcus in a relevant normally sterile body fluid. Colonization density was calculated with quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal specimens. RESULTS: Median colonization density among 56 cases with MCPP (MCPP cases; 17.28 × 10(6) copies/mL) exceeded that of cases without MCPP (non-MCPP cases; 0.75 × 10(6)) and controls (0.60 × 10(6)) (each P < .001). The optimal density for discriminating MCPP cases from controls using the Youden index was >6.9 log(10) copies/mL; overall, the sensitivity was 64% and the specificity 92%, with variable performance by site. The threshold was lower (≥4.4 log(10) copies/mL) when MCPP cases were distinguished from controls who received antibiotics before specimen collection. Among the 4035 non-MCPP cases, 500 (12%) had pneumococcal colonization density >6.9 log(10) copies/mL; above this cutoff was associated with alveolar consolidation at chest radiography, very severe pneumonia, oxygen saturation <92%, C-reactive protein ≥40 mg/L, and lack of antibiotic pretreatment (all P< .001). CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococcal colonization density >6.9 log(10) copies/mL was strongly associated with MCPP and could be used to improve estimates of pneumococcal pneumonia prevalence in childhood pneumonia studies.

1320,Epidemiology and Clinical Features of Human Coronaviruses in the Pediatric Population,"BACKGROUND: The epidemiology and clinical features of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) in children are not fully characterized. METHODS: A retrospective study of children with HCoV detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed for a community cohort and a children’s hospital in the same community from January 2013 to December 2014. The RT-PCR assay detected HCoV 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43 in nasal swabs from symptomatic children ≤18 years. Factors associated with increased severity of illness in hospitalized children were assessed by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Human coronavirus was detected in 261 children, 49 and 212 from the community and hospital, respectively. The distribution of HCoV types and seasonal trends were similar in the community and hospital. Community cases were older than hospitalized cases (median age, 4.4 versus 1.7 years, respectively; P < .01), and a minority of community cases (26.5%) sought medical attention. Among the hospitalized children with HCoV detected, 39 (18.4%) received respiratory support and 24 (11.3%) were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Age <2 years (odds ratio [OR] = 5.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9–13.1) and cardiovascular (OR = 3.9; 95% CI, 1.6–9.5), genetic/congenital (OR = 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1–7.0), and respiratory chronic complex conditions ([CCCs] OR = 4.5; 95% CI, 1.7–12.0) were associated with receiving respiratory support. Genetic/congenital (OR = 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1–7.4) CCCs were associated with PICU admission. Severity of illness was similar among hospitalized children with different HCoV types. CONCLUSIONS: Children in the community with HCoV detected generally had mild illness as demonstrated by few medically attended cases. In hospitalized children, young age and CCCs, but not HCoV type, were associated with increased severity of illness.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.26746386899999997,-0.11478453599999999,-0.11856455800000001,-0.0210746,0.132100535,-0.151557157,0.062457701,-0.091473371,0.119837536,-0.164951773,-0.004514504,0.292084096,0.092785689,0.027502121,-0.07647063700000001,0.158273628,-0.12020645,-0.084438704,-0.033972751,-0.009818818,-0.189651293,0.158740535,0.058945124,0.036396177,-0.017392938,0.021536482000000003,0.03888504,-0.134545244,0.000485675,0.025102275
1321,Burden and Seasonality of Viral Acute Respiratory Tract Infections among Outpatients in Southern Sri Lanka,"In tropical and subtropical settings, the epidemiology of viral acute respiratory tract infections varies widely between countries. We determined the etiology, seasonality, and clinical presentation of viral acute respiratory tract infections among outpatients in southern Sri Lanka. From March 2013 to January 2015, we enrolled outpatients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI). Nasal/nasopharyngeal samples were tested in duplicate using antigen-based rapid influenza testing and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for respiratory viruses. Monthly proportion positive was calculated for each virus. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify associations between sociodemographic/clinical information and viral detection. Of 571 subjects, most (470, 82.3%) were ≥ 5 years of age and 53.1% were male. A respiratory virus was detected by PCR in 63.6% (N = 363). Common viral etiologies included influenza (223, 39%), human enterovirus/rhinovirus (HEV/HRV, 14.5%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 4.2%), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV, 3.9%). Both ILI and influenza showed clear seasonal variation, with peaks from March to June each year. RSV and hMPV activity peaked from May to July, whereas HEV/HRV was seen year-round. Patients with respiratory viruses detected were more likely to report pain with breathing (odds ratio [OR] = 2.60, P = 0.003), anorexia (OR = 2.29, P < 0.001), and fatigue (OR = 2.00, P = 0.002) compared with patients with no respiratory viruses detected. ILI showed clear seasonal variation in southern Sri Lanka, with most activity during March to June; peak activity was largely due to influenza.

1323,Respiratory Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction: An Important Diagnostic Tool in Immunocompromised Patients,"BACKGROUND: Viruses and atypical pathogens can cause significant respiratory illness in immunocompromised patients. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MPCR) has improved the diagnostic yield of pathogens, and it is easier to identify the co-infections also. The present study was done to evaluate the performance of MPCR on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples in immunocompromised patients. METHODS: Atotal of 177 BAL specimens collected over a 19 months period from immunocompromised patients with respiratory illness were analyzed with the MPCR and aerobic culture. Patients were divided into four according to the pathogens. Category V (only viral), Category NV (nonviral, i.e., bacteria and atypical), Category M (mixed, i.e., both viral and nonviral pathogen), and Category UK (unknown etiology). RESULTS: MPCR identified the causative pathogen in 59.3% of patients while culture could identify only in 37.8% of patients. Most frequent etiological agent was Klebsiella pneumoniae (32%), followed by cytomegalovirus (21%), and Pneumocystis jirovecii (10%). Numbers of patients in each category were Category V (9.6%), Category NV (43.5%), Category M (19.8%), and Category UK (27.1%). Mortality was significantly higher in patients of Category M having mixed infections. CONCLUSION: MPCR is highly sensitive and rapid tool which can be considered in the routine diagnostic algorithm of respiratory illness in immunocompromised patients.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.12485656099999999,-0.033262613999999996,-0.039540604,-0.080770186,-0.053366229,-0.053212392000000004,-0.01040551,0.065832091,-0.111326143,0.075355695,-0.04387226,0.013054518999999999,0.016637104,0.031534029,-0.013376138999999999,-0.027372265,0.023135472,0.031164908999999998,-0.003271735,0.01337446,0.056156899999999996,-0.03669467,0.009039239000000001,-0.020909188000000002,0.019173461,-0.017745976,-0.016891681000000002,-0.00397043,-0.012955689,-0.015641076
1328,Clinical Significance of Human Coronavirus in Bronchoalveolar Lavage Samples From Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients and Patients With Hematologic Malignancies,"BACKGROUND. The possible role of human coronavirus (HCoV) in lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients and patients with hematologic malignancies (HM) has not been well studied. METHODS. We conducted a retrospective review of HCT/HM patients with HCoV detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). HCoV strains were identified in BAL samples using strain-specific polymerase chain reaction. Mortality rates were compared among HCT recipients with LRTD caused by HCoV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, or parainfluenza virus (PIV) by multivariable Cox regression analysis. RESULTS. We identified 35 patients (37 episodes) with HCoV LRTD. Among 23 available BAL samples, 48% were strain OC43, 22% were NL63, 17% were 229E, and 13% were HKU1. Overall, 21 patients (60%) required oxygen therapy at diagnosis and 19 (54%) died within 90 days of diagnosis. Respiratory copathogens were detected in 21 episodes (57%), including viruses (n = 12), fungi (n = 10), and bacteria (n = 8). Mortality rates were not different between patients with and without copathogens (P = .65). In multivariable models, mortality associated with HCoV LRTD was similar to that seen with RSV, influenza, and PIV LRTD in HCT recipients (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.34 [95% confidence interval, .66–2.71], P = .41 vs RSV, adjusted for cell source, cytopenia, copathogens, oxygen use, and steroid use). CONCLUSIONS. HCoV LRTD in patients with HCT or HM is associated with high rates of oxygen use and mortality. Mortality associated with HCoV LRTD in HCT recipients appears to be similar to that seen with RSV, influenza virus, and PIV.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.155364282,-0.083276452,-0.08465331599999999,-0.03435888,0.064907344,-0.027809149,-6.48e-06,-0.017248992,0.036810367999999996,-0.067029965,-0.038772072000000005,0.25154032,0.14672224,0.131375105,-0.051301148,0.057083344,-0.056164383,-0.0041078420000000004,-0.03462279,0.04770433599999999,0.012662691,-0.099864251,0.034337981000000004,-0.033179817,0.041579936,-0.111678921,0.124051008,-0.008370325,-0.07735845200000001,0.05800054599999999
1330,Viral aetiology of wheezing in children under five,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Wheezing is a common problem in children under five with acute respiratory infections (ARIs). Viruses are known to be responsible for a considerable proportion of ARIs in children. This study was undertaken to know the viral aetiology of wheezing among the children less than five years of age, admitted to a tertiary care hospital in eastern India. METHODS: Seventy five children, under the age of five years admitted with wheezing, were included in the study. Throat and nasal swabs were collected, and real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used to screen for influenza 1 and 2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1, 2, 3 and 4, rhinovirus, human meta-pneumovirus, bocavirus (HBoV), Coronavirus, adenovirus, Enterovirus and Parechovirus. RESULTS: The total viral detection rate was 28.57 per cent. Viral RNA markers were detected from children diagnosed to be having pneumonia (3 cases), bronchiolitis (9 cases), episodic wheeze (2 cases) and multitrigger wheeze (6 cases). RSV was the most common virus (35%) followed by PIV1, 2 and 3 (20%), HBoV (10%) and rhinovirus (5%). However, mixed infection was observed in 30 per cent of cases. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The study reported the presence of respiratory viral agents in 28.57 per cent of children with wheezing; RSV and PIV were most common, accounting to 55 per cent of the total cases. Mixed infection was reported in 30 per cent of cases. Seasonal variation in the occurrence of these viruses was also noted.

1333,"Viruses causing severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in children ≤5 years of age at a tertiary care hospital in Rajasthan, India","BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) is one of the leading causes of death among children worldwide. As different respiratory viruses exhibit similar symptoms, simultaneous detection of these viruses in a single reaction mixture can save time and cost. The present study was done in a tertiary care children's hospital for rapid identification of viruses causing SARI among children less than or equal to five years of age using multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit. METHODS: A total of 155 throat swabs were collected from equal number of children suspected to have SARI and processed for extraction of nucleic acids using automated extraction system. Multiplex real-time RT-PCR was done to identify the viruses in the samples. RESULTS: The overall positivity for viruses in the study was found to be 72.9 per cent with a co-infection rate of 19.5 per cent. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) was the predominant virus detected in 25.7 per cent children followed by influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, human rhinovirus (HRV) and human adenovirus (HAdV) in 19.9, 11.0 and 8.8 per cent children, respectively. The HMPV was at its peak in February 2013, HAdV showed two peaks in March-April, 2012 and November 2012-March 2013 while HRV was detected throughout the year. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex real-time PCR helped in rapid identification of viruses. Seventeen viruses were detected in SARI cases with overall positivity of 72.9 per cent. HMPV was the most predominant virus. However, for better clinico-virological correlation, studies are required with complete work up of all the aetiological agents, clinical profile of patients and treatment outcome.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.24502618899999998,-0.076020321,0.013498433,0.12085871699999999,0.06837805,-0.085919046,0.040776505,-0.065518233,0.07213566,-0.030642354,0.0018312439999999999,-0.016967535,-0.033792472000000004,0.006322549,-0.004513649000000001,-0.033391749,-0.021823095,0.036245598999999996,-0.034785834,-0.058370871,0.048806780999999994,0.165558096,-0.034572561,0.014110055,-0.15687182800000002,0.15322774,-0.104170292,0.060349585,0.0051013809999999995,0.019551222
1335,Hospital admissions for lower respiratory tract infections among infants in the Canadian Arctic: a cohort study,"BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether this burden of disease of lower respiratory tract infections is comparable across the Canadian Arctic. The objectives of this surveillance study were to compare the rates of hospital admission for lower respiratory tract infection and the severity of infection across Arctic Canada, and to describe the responsible viruses. METHODS: We performed a prospective multicentre surveillance study of infants less than 1 year of age admitted in 2009 with lower respiratory tract infection to all hospitals (5 regional, 4 tertiary) in the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Nunavik to assess for regional differences. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were processed by means of a polymerase chain reaction respiratory viral panel, testing for 20 respiratory viruses and influenza A (H1N1). The role of coinfection was assessed by means of regression analysis for length of stay (short: < 7 d; long: > 14 d). Outcomes compared included rates of lower respiratory tract infection, respiratory syncytial virus infection, transfer to tertiary hospital and severe lower respiratory tract infection (respiratory failure, intubation and mechanical ventilation, and/or cardiopulmonary resuscitation). RESULTS: There were 348 admissions for lower respiratory tract infection in the population of interest in 2009. Rates of admission per 1000 live births varied significantly, from 39 in the Northwest Territories to 456 in Nunavik (p < 0.001). The rates of tertiary admissions and severe lower respiratory tract infection per 1000 live births in the Northwest Territories were 5.6 and 1.4, respectively, compared to 55.9 and 17.1, respectively, in Nunavut and 52.0 and 20.0, respectively, in Nunavik (p ≤ 0.001). Respiratory syncytial virus was the most common virus identified (124 cases [41.6% of those tested]), and coinfection was detected in 51 cases (41.1%) of infection with this virus. Longer length of stay was associated with coinfection (odds ratio [OR] 2.64) and underlying risk factors (OR 4.39). Length of stay decreased by 32.2% for every 30-day increase in age (OR 0.68). INTERPRETATION: Nunavut and Nunavik have very elevated rates of lower respiratory tract infection, with severe outcomes. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most common virus identified, and coinfection was associated with longer length of stay. Targeted public health interventions are required to reduce the burden of disease for infants residing in these Arctic regions.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.23887747399999998,-0.089880062,-0.132677681,0.030793486000000002,0.02166665,-0.050472206,-0.0064472259999999995,-0.002054468,0.06276724,0.024196067,0.01226314,-0.020673529,0.017790302,0.000992834,0.041198825,0.013605713,0.019251323,-0.046521623,0.035321967999999995,0.049283553,0.029964118999999997,-0.127124306,-0.052446522,-0.004292127,0.044645564000000006,-0.008044914,-0.027753378999999998,-0.017084038,-0.019574201,-0.07948904799999999
1348,The Effects of Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine on Nasopharyngeal Bacteria in Healthy 2 to 4 Year Olds. A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Rationale: Viral infections of the upper respiratory tract may influence the commensal nasopharyngeal bacteria. Changes in the bacterial niche could affect transmission dynamics. Attenuated vaccine viruses can be used to investigate this empirically in humans. Objectives: To study the effects of mild viral upper respiratory infections on nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization using live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) as a surrogate. Methods: We used trivalent LAIV to evaluate the effects of viral infection on bacterial carriage and density of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 151 healthy children were randomized 1:1 to receive the vaccine starting either at recruitment (n = 74) or 28 days later (n = 77) in a stepped wedge fashion, allowing comparisons between recipients and nonrecipients as well as whole-group comparisons pre- and postvaccination. Bacterial carriage and density were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 151 children were recruited, 77 in the LAIV group and 74 in the control group. LAIV recipients (n = 63 analyzed) showed an apparent transient increase in H. influenzae carriage but no further significant differences in carriage prevalence of the four bacterial species compared with controls (n = 72 analyzed). S. pneumoniae density was substantially higher in vaccine recipients (16,687 vs. 1935 gene copies per milliliter) 28 days after the first dose (P < 0.001). Whole-group multivariable analysis (prevaccine, after one dose, and after two doses) also showed increases in density of other species and H. influenzae carriage prevalence. Conclusions: In the absence of any safety signals despite widespread use of the vaccine, these findings suggest that bacterial density, and thus transmission rates among children and to people in other age groups, may rise following attenuated influenza infections without associated clinical disease. LAIV could therefore be used as an experimental tool to elucidate the dynamics of transmission of nasopharyngeal bacteria.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.096120549,-0.081300384,-0.043962914000000006,-0.05832317099999999,0.003663804,0.017428679,0.045078868,-0.009153864,-0.027743312000000003,0.025874419,-0.015099816,-0.022571185,-0.0426218,-0.043908575,-0.010905471000000002,0.0017957510000000002,-0.04633107400000001,-0.046469174,-0.014242952,-0.008990156,-0.03570341,0.036883215,0.064929771,0.05841159,0.008524641999999999,0.016387971,-0.005988338,-0.036640455,0.054750586,-0.00033268699999999997
1353,"Diversity and Evolutionary Histories of Human Coronaviruses NL63 and 229E Associated with Acute Upper Respiratory Tract Symptoms in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","The human alphacoronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E are commonly associated with upper respiratory tract infections (URTI). Information on their molecular epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics in the tropical region of southeast Asia however is limited. Here, we analyzed the phylogenetic, temporal distribution, population history, and clinical manifestations among patients infected with HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 2,060 consenting adults presented with acute URTI symptoms in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, between 2012 and 2013. The presence of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E was detected using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The spike glycoprotein, nucleocapsid, and 1a genes were sequenced for phylogenetic reconstruction and Bayesian coalescent inference. A total of 68/2,060 (3.3%) subjects were positive for human alphacoronavirus; HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E were detected in 45 (2.2%) and 23 (1.1%) patients, respectively. A peak in the number of HCoV-NL63 infections was recorded between June and October 2012. Phylogenetic inference revealed that 62.8% of HCoV-NL63 infections belonged to genotype B, 37.2% was genotype C, while all HCoV-229E sequences were clustered within group 4. Molecular dating analysis indicated that the origin of HCoV-NL63 was dated to 1921, before it diverged into genotype A (1975), genotype B (1996), and genotype C (2003). The root of the HCoV-229E tree was dated to 1955, before it diverged into groups 1–4 between the 1970s and 1990s.

1354,Human Metapneumovirus Infections Following Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: Factors Associated With Disease Progression,"Background. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a newly identified pulmonary pathogen that can cause fatal lower respiratory tract disease (LRD) in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients. Little is known about progression rates from upper respiratory tract infection (URI) to LRD and risk factors associated with progression. Methods. A total of 118 HCT recipients receiving transplantation between 2004 and 2014 who had HMPV detected in nasopharyngeal, bronchoalveolar lavage, or lung biopsy samples by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were retrospectively analyzed. Results. More than 90% of the cases were identified between December and May. Among the 118 HCT patients, 88 and 30 had URI alone and LRD, respectively. Among 30 patients with LRD, 17 patients progressed from URI to LRD after a median of 7 days (range, 2–63 days). The probability of progression to LRD within 40 days after URI was 16%. In Cox regression analysis, steroid use ≥1 mg/kg prior to URI diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR], 5.10; P = .004), low lymphocyte count (HR, 3.43; P = .011), and early onset of HMPV infection after HCT (before day 30 after HCT; HR, 3.54; P = .013) were associated with higher progression to LRD. The median viral load in nasal wash samples was 1.1 × 10(6) copies/mL (range, 3.3 × 10(2)–1.7 × 10(9)) with no correlation between the viral load and progression. Conclusions. Progression from URI to LRD occurred in up to 60% of HCT recipients with risk factors such as systemic corticosteroid use or low lymphocyte counts. Further studies are needed to define the role of viral load in the pathogenesis of progressive disease.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.08520074,-0.036103107,-0.028095544,-0.079621238,-0.033891384,-0.051808779000000006,0.028051542000000002,-0.00703076,-0.002655763,-0.016589312,-0.0005950069999999999,0.002729766,-0.044248315,0.028135187000000002,-0.028139499999999998,0.005043957,-0.0260767,0.048661885,-0.024673811,0.017674546,0.03883922,-0.025909388,-0.044813131,-0.036602533,-0.037611151,-0.039622013,-0.033874851,-0.06363261,-0.05062119599999999,-0.016216631000000002
1356,Human coronavirus and severe acute respiratory infection in Southern Brazil,"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are an important cause of respiratory tract infection and are responsible for causing the common cold in the general population. Thus, adequate surveillance of HCoV is essential. This study aimed to analyze the impact of HCoV infections and their relation to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in a hospitalized population in Southern Brazil. A cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital, and assessed inpatients under investigation for SARI by the hospital epidemiology department, and all patients who had nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from January 2012 to December 2013 to detect respiratory viruses (RVs). Viral infection was detected by multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), with primers specific to the subtypes HCoV-229E/NL63 and OC43/HKU1. The overall positivity rate was 58.8% (444/755), and HCoVs were detected in 7.6% (n = 34) of positive samples. Children below two years of age were most frequently affected (62%). Comorbidities were more likely to be associated with HCoVs than with other RVs. Immunosuppression was an independent risk factor for HCoV infection (OR = 3.5, 95% CI 1.6–7.6). Dyspnea was less frequently associated with HCoV infection (p < 0.001), and HCoV accounted for 6% of the SARI cases. Three patients infected with HCoV (9%) died from respiratory infection. HCoVs are important respiratory pathogens, especially in hospitalized children under 2 years of age and in immunosuppressed patients. They may account for a small proportion of SARI diagnoses, increased need for mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, and death.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.24120918600000002,-0.072226511,-0.119281803,-0.019439445,0.130051762,-0.10492039199999999,0.047807006,-0.025686652999999997,0.09652654,-0.083596581,-0.029830476,0.354740275,0.253307444,0.186651194,-0.017406463,0.096581565,-0.05317279900000001,-0.05784138900000001,-0.050372217000000004,0.0580476,-0.052192500999999995,0.018523533999999998,0.011965448,-0.037389423,0.021506205,-0.012179236000000001,0.01587871,-0.005686445,-0.010492075,0.023817995
1358,Impact of viral infection on acute exacerbation of asthma in out-patient clinics: a prospective study,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of viral infection triggering asthma exacerbation and its impact on the symptoms and duration of exacerbation are unclear. METHODS: Asthma and healthy control subjects were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University between February 2012 and February 2013. Nasal swabs were collected, and respiratory viruses were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All patients completed questionnaires and a lung function test. Some were followed up for 4 weeks, and symptom changes were evaluated via asthma diaries. RESULTS: In total, 70 patients with acute asthma exacerbations were recruited. Among them, 34 patients (48.6%) completed the 4-week follow-up study. Another 65 patients with stable asthma and 134 healthy volunteers were also included in this study. The rate of positive viral detection via PCR in acute asthma exacerbation patients was 34.2% (24/70), which is significantly higher than that of stable asthma (12/65; 18.5%; P=0.038) and normal control patients (18/134; 13.4%; P<0.001). Among the viral-positive subjects, the number of viral copies was significantly higher in acute asthma exacerbation patients [(5.00±4.63) ×10(7) copies/L] (mean ± SD) than those in stable asthma patients [(1.24±1.44) ×10(6) copies/L; P<0.001] or in healthy controls [(1.44±0.44) ×10(6) copies/L; P<0.001], whose viral loads were not significantly different from one another (P=0.774). During the 4-week follow-up period, the cough scores on days 1 and 3 were significantly higher in the viral-positive group than in the viral-negative group (day 1: P=0.016; day 3: P=0.004). However, there were no significant differences between these two groups for other tested symptoms, such as dyspnea and total recovery time (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses may be involved in acute asthma exacerbations, inducing more prominent and persistent cough symptoms.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.173035033,-0.044396048,-0.076461614,-0.11289446199999999,-0.050492490999999994,-0.09217802300000001,-0.01379337,0.042491876,-0.126853635,0.029051358,-0.021317741,-0.025008065,-0.058651575,0.084281154,-0.006863706999999999,0.004725942,0.045884465,-0.082748138,0.069376607,-0.019510913,-0.016697543000000002,-0.20239570699999998,-0.096285089,0.08824965,-0.078139025,0.092576878,-0.049651142,-0.040020726,0.064281888,0.174503286
1359,Postobstructive Pneumonia: An Underdescribed Syndrome,"Background. Postobstructive community-acquired pneumonia (PO-CAP) is relatively common in clinical practice. The clinical syndrome is poorly defined, and the role of infection as a cause of the infiltrate is uncertain. We prospectively studied patients with PO-CAP and compared them to a cohort of patients with bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (B-CAP). Methods. We prospectively studied patients hospitalized for CAP; 5.4% had PO-CAP, defined as a pulmonary infiltrate occurring distal to an obstructed bronchus. Sputum and blood cultures, viral polymerase chain reaction, urinary antigen tests, and serum procalcitonin (PCT) were done in nearly all cases. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with PO-CAP were compared to those of patients with B-CAP. Results. In a 2-year period, we identified 30 patients with PO-CAP. Compared to patients with B-CAP, patients with PO-CAP had longer duration of symptoms (median, 14 vs 5 days; P < .001). Weight loss and cavitary lesions were more common (P < .01 for both comparisons) and leukocytosis was less common (P < .01) in patients with PO-CAP. A bacterial pathogen was implicated in only 3 (10%) PO-CAP cases. PCT was <0.25 ng/mL in 19 (63.3%) patients. Although no differences were observed in disease severity or rates of intensive care unit admissions, 30-day mortality was significantly higher in PO-CAP vs B-CAP (40.0% vs 11.7%; P < .01). Conclusions. Although there is substantial overlap, PO-CAP is a clinical entity distinct from B-CAP; a bacterial cause was identified in only 10% of patients. Our study has important implications for the clinical recognition of patients with PO-CAP, the role of microorganisms as etiologic agents, and the use of antibiotic therapy.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.118997967,-0.051097395999999996,-0.083296133,-0.125918414,-0.085042249,-0.059974788,-0.044214588,0.11593418400000001,-0.21772277199999998,0.082202379,-0.083757569,0.011377598999999999,0.006269364,0.017060805,-0.11225828800000001,-0.044515998,0.006923129,0.038408775,-0.07311949,0.11992746800000001,0.019935062,0.076070264,0.18607842300000002,0.067098198,0.101288546,-0.10162384199999999,-0.00766746,0.066165659,0.13912249599999998,0.05990834
1360,Evaluation of epidemiological and clinical features of influenza and other respiratory viruses,"AIM: In our study, we aimed to clinically and epidemiologically evaluate respiratory tract infections the viral agents of which were detected by molecular methods and to compare influenza and other respiratory tract viruses in this context. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The records of 178 patients aged above 2 years who presented to pediatric emergency outpatient clinic with fever and respiratory tract infection findings between December 2013 and April 2014 were examined retrospectively. RESULTS: At least one respiratory tract pathogen was detected by polymerase chain reaction in 78.6% (n=140) of the patients: influenza A 33.5%, influenza B 16.4%, respiratory syncytial virus 9.2%, adenovirus 7.8%, rhinovirus 7.1%, coronavirus 7.1%, human metapneumovirus 5.7%, human bocavirus 5.7%, parainfluenza virus 3.5%, coinfection 2.8%. The mean age of the patients was 6.3±3.6 years. Sixty-nine patients (49.2%) were aged between 2 and 5 years. Seventy-one patients (50.7%) were aged 5 years and above. Upper respiratory tract infection was found with a rate of 65.7% and lower respiratory tract infection was found with a rate of 34.2%. It was observed that the distribution of respiratory tract viruses showed variance by age groups. Influenza A infection was observed with the highest rate in both age groups. Influenza B was the second leading agent (p=0.008) above the age of 5 years and respiratory syncytial virus was the second leading agent in the 2–5 year age group (p=0.003). Influenza viruses were detected in 55.9% of 118 patients who were found to be compatible with the definition of “influenza-like illness” specified in the Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and other viral agenst were detected in 44%. No difference could be found between the clinical pictures and radiological findings caused by influenza and other respiratory tract viruses.

1372,Community Surveillance of Respiratory Viruses Among Families in the Utah Better Identification of Germs-Longitudinal Viral Epidemiology (BIG-LoVE) Study,"Background. This study: (1) describes the viral etiology of respiratory illness by prospectively collecting weekly symptom diaries and nasal swabs from families for 1 year, (2) analyzed data by reported symptoms, virus, age, and family composition, and (3) evaluated the duration of virus detection. Methods. Twenty-six households (108 individuals) provided concurrent symptom and nasal swab data for 4166 person-weeks. The FilmArray polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform (BioFire Diagnostics, LLC) was used to detect 16 respiratory viruses. Viral illnesses were defined as ≥1 consecutive weeks with the same virus detected with symptoms reported in ≥1 week. Results. Participants reported symptoms in 23% and a virus was detected in 26% of person-weeks. Children younger than 5 years reported symptoms more often and were more likely to have a virus detected than older participants (odds ratio [OR] 2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.08–2.94 and OR 3.96, 95% CI, 3.35–4.70, respectively). Compared with single person households, individuals living with children experienced 3 additional weeks of virus detection. There were 783 viral detection episodes; 440 (56%) associated with symptoms. Coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, and influenza A detections were usually symptomatic; bocavirus and rhinovirus detections were often asymptomatic. The mean duration of PCR detection was ≤2 weeks for all viruses and detections of ≥3 weeks occurred in 16% of episodes. Younger children had longer durations of PCR detection. Conclusions. Viral detection is often asymptomatic and occasionally prolonged, especially for bocavirus and rhinovirus. In clinical settings, the interpretation of positive PCR tests, particularly in young children and those who live with them, may be confounded.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.205517284,-0.076043555,-0.01499164,0.060683996,0.037156072000000005,-0.06402026,0.035518293,-0.050887334000000006,0.030504318,-0.023193627999999997,0.028517859,-0.037079182,-0.020502136,-0.070656158,0.016923032,0.036523184,-0.047525377,-0.122662035,0.066939394,-0.07771446900000001,-0.134458704,0.032655806,-0.027215179,0.03761795,0.002576963,0.038154811000000004,0.019061268,-0.083433816,-0.014386801999999999,-0.020255592
1374,Respiratory Viral Detection in Children and Adults: Comparing Asymptomatic Controls and Patients With Community-Acquired Pneumonia,"Background. The clinical significance of viruses detected in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is often unclear. Methods. We conducted a prospective study to identify the prevalence of 13 viruses in the upper respiratory tract of patients with CAP and concurrently enrolled asymptomatic controls with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We compared age-stratified prevalence of each virus between patients with CAP and controls and used multivariable logistic regression to calculate attributable fractions (AFs). Results. We enrolled 1024 patients with CAP and 759 controls. Detections of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus were substantially more common in patients with CAP of all ages than in controls (AFs near 1.0). Parainfluenza and coronaviruses were also more common among patients with CAP (AF, 0.5–0.75). Rhinovirus was associated with CAP among adults (AF, 0.93) but not children (AF, 0.02). Adenovirus was associated with CAP only among children <2 years old (AF, 0.77). Conclusions. The probability that a virus detected with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in patients with CAP contributed to symptomatic disease varied by age group and specific virus. Detections of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus among patients with CAP of all ages probably indicate an etiologic role, whereas detections of parainfluenza, coronaviruses, rhinovirus, and adenovirus, especially in children, require further scrutiny.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.234044258,-0.106129158,-0.117728714,-0.004472403,-0.004461173,-0.069021622,-0.039668864,0.052032955,-0.15983051,0.060003737,-0.08173148599999999,-0.018752865,0.02656284,0.033651448,-0.10733815099999999,-0.048038075,0.009295504,-0.012275228999999999,-0.039775973,0.12376896,0.011077469,0.096190514,0.21940035100000002,0.112716845,0.084344711,-0.073804309,-0.042326812000000005,0.072000019,0.134283199,0.023751195

1380,Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome after hematopoietic cell transplantation: evidence of occult infectious etiologies,"Newer diagnostic methods may link more idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) cases to an infectious agent. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from 69 hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients with IPS diagnosed between 1992 and 2006 were tested for 28 pathogens (3 bacteria and 25 viruses) by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and for Aspergillus by galactomannan assay. Research BALs from 21 asymptomatic HCT patients served as controls. Among 69 HCT patients with IPS, 39 (56.5%) had a pathogen detected. The most frequent pathogens were human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) (N = 20 [29%]) followed by human rhinovirus (HRV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Aspergillus (N = 8 [12%] in each). HHV-6 and HRV were rarely detected in controls, whereas CMV and Aspergillus were occasionally detected with low pathogen load. Patients with pathogens had worse day-100 survival than those without (hazard ratio, 1.88; P = .03). Mortality in patients with only pathogens of “uncertain” significance in lung was similar to that in patients with pathogens of “established” significance. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing did not reveal additional significant pathogens. Our study demonstrated that approximately half of patients with IPS had pathogens detected in BAL, and pathogen detection was associated with increased mortality.

1381,Bordetella Pertussis is an Uncommon Pathogen in Children Hospitalized with Bronchiolitis During the Winter Season,"BACKGROUND: In the United States (U.S.), Bordetella pertussis incidence has increased. Cough and apnea are common findings in pertussis and also in bronchiolitis, the most common cause of hospitalization in U.S. infants. The objective was to determine the prevalence of B. pertussis infection in children hospitalized with bronchiolitis and to describe its clinical course. METHODS: Children hospitalized with bronchiolitis and age <2 years were eligible for a prospective, multicenter cohort study during three consecutive winter seasons (November to March) from 2007 to 2010. 16 sites in 12 states participated using a standardized enrollment protocol. Families were asked the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) pertussis classification questions. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained and tested by real time polymerase chain reaction for 16 viruses, Mycoplama pneumoniae and B. pertussis. RESULTS: 2068 (94%) of 2,207 children had one or more respiratory pathogens. B. pertussis was identified in 4 children (0.2%; 95% CI, 0.1–0.5%) with 3 having a viral co-infection. All 4 were younger than four months; 2 met the CDC definition of probable pertussis, and 3 had received at least one dose of an acellular pertussis vaccine. During the hospitalization, 2 had paroxysmal cough, 1 required ICU care, and the median length of stay was 13 days. CONCLUSION: Our data support that B. pertussis is an uncommon pathogen in U.S. children hospitalized with bronchiolitis in the winter. Making a diagnosis of pertussis can be challenging because the disease can be atypical, and may not meet the CDC definition of probable infection.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.12080732300000001,-0.084339,-0.05245782400000001,-0.061508772,0.0017766120000000001,-0.054913894000000005,0.037985023,-0.035109972,0.039810841,-0.038433642999999997,0.015139066999999999,0.010036314000000001,-0.067599754,-0.11794176,0.015736697,0.10352656199999999,-0.0015979520000000001,-0.010887553000000001,0.009977348,-0.015824816000000002,-0.057454849,0.063458259,0.011387713999999998,-0.029862855,0.009136748,-0.016263677,0.008538287,0.031032944,0.029431986,-0.046096444
1383,Surveillance of Acute Respiratory Infections Using Community-Submitted Symptoms and Specimens for Molecular Diagnostic Testing,"Participatory systems for surveillance of acute respiratory infection give real-time information about infections circulating in the community, yet to-date are limited to self-reported syndromic information only and lacking methods of linking symptom reports to infection types. We developed the GoViral platform to evaluate whether a cohort of lay volunteers could, and would find it useful to, contribute self-reported symptoms online and to compare specimen types for self-collected diagnostic information of sufficient quality for respiratory infection surveillance. Volunteers were recruited, given a kit (collection materials and customized instructions), instructed to report their symptoms weekly, and when sick with cold or flu-like symptoms, requested to collect specimens (saliva and nasal swab). We compared specimen types for respiratory virus detection sensitivity (via polymerase-chain-reaction) and ease of collection. Participants were surveyed to determine receptivity to participating when sick, to receiving information on the type of pathogen causing their infection and types circulating near them. Between December 1 2013 and March 1 2014, 295 participants enrolled in the study and received a kit. Of those who reported symptoms, half (71) collected and sent specimens for analysis. Participants submitted kits on average 2.30 days (95 CI: 1.65 to 2.96) after symptoms began. We found good concordance between nasal and saliva specimens for multiple pathogens, with few discrepancies. Individuals report that saliva collection is easiest and report that receiving information about what pathogen they, and those near them, have is valued and can shape public health behaviors.

1386,Clinical Outcomes Associated With Respiratory Virus Detection Before Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant,"Background. The management of respiratory virus infections prior to hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is difficult. We examined whether respiratory virus detection before HCT influenced the requirement for bronchoscopy, hospitalization, and overall survival following HCT. Methods. Pre-HCT and weekly post-HCT nasal washes were collected through day 100 from patients with and without symptoms. Samples were tested by multiplex polymerase chain reaction for respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses 1–4, influenza A and B, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and human rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and bocavirus. Results. Of 458 patients, 116 (25%) had respiratory viruses detected pre-HCT. Overall, patients with viruses detected pre-HCT had fewer days alive and out of the hospital and lower survival at day 100 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3–4.5; P = .007) than patients with negative samples; this risk was also present with rhinovirus alone (aHR for mortality, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2–5.5; P = .01). No difference in bronchoscopy incidence was seen in patients with and without respiratory viruses (aHR, 1.3; 95% CI, .8–2.0; P = .32). In symptomatic patients, those with respiratory viruses detected had increased overall mortality compared with patients without viruses detected (unadjusted HR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.0–12.1; P = .05); among asymptomatic patients, detection of respiratory viruses was not associated with increased mortality. Conclusions. These data support routine testing for respiratory viruses among symptomatic patients before HCT, and delay of transplant with virus detection when feasible, even for detection of rhinovirus alone. Further study is needed to address whether asymptomatic patients should undergo screening for respiratory virus detection before HCT.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.24393431100000001,-0.074633445,-0.082188207,0.003962394,0.007718922,-0.05612104,-0.022893226000000003,0.057149926,-0.10490752800000001,0.032436842,-0.033181842,0.036372417000000004,0.01030033,0.062217954000000006,-0.029809787,0.019073692,-0.013803156,-0.086051506,0.082171637,0.029742597000000003,-0.026603393,-0.090022793,0.000645645,0.087425751,0.011342823,-0.06297553,-0.027638906,-0.13068490300000002,-0.121188114,-0.097031867

1392,Clinical disease due to enterovirus D68 in adult hematologic malignancy patients and hematopoietic cell transplant recipients,"The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported over 1000 cases of severe respiratory disease in pediatric patients associated with enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) in the fall of 2014. We sought to identify and define the clinical burden of disease due to EV-D68 in adult patients with hematologic malignancy or undergoing hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for EV-D68 was performed on all respiratory samples positive for human rhinovirus (HRV) or negative for all respiratory viruses by a laboratory-developed respiratory viral PCR panel from August 11, 2014, to November 7, 2014. Presumptive cases were defined as those with an EV-D68 PCR cycle threshold (CT) at least 4 cycles lower than the HRV CT for HRV-positive samples or any EV-D68 CT value for HRV-negative samples. Sequencing of a 150-bp fragment of the 5′ noncoding region confirmed EV-D68 in 16 of 506 respiratory samples. Eight patients had a history of hematologic malignancy, and 6 of these had undergone HCT. Presentation ranged from mild upper respiratory symptoms to respiratory failure. EV-D68 can infect adult patients with hematologic malignancy and HCT recipients and may be associated with severe respiratory disease. Current commercial diagnostic assays cannot differentiate EV-D68 from other enteroviruses or HRV, and improved rapid diagnostic tools are needed.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.118703654,-0.009621864,-0.016498486,-0.043859441,-0.005698582,-0.042922972999999996,0.005675986,0.028191342,-0.004699236,0.034103784,0.0038938690000000003,0.019389417,0.008594349,0.030313617999999997,0.031421927999999995,-0.011331306999999999,0.004613029,0.005832868000000001,0.034534794,-0.041878935,0.039818737,-0.088887904,-0.08911151099999999,0.008991087,-0.041081764,0.058613989000000005,-0.069656648,-0.00871669,0.051815886,0.08227048099999999
1395,Surveillance of acute respiratory infections among outpatients: A pilot study in Isfahan city,"BACKGROUND: Considering that there was not any regional survey in Isfahan, Iran regarding the epidemiology of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) in different age groups of general population, the aim of this study was to determine the epidemiologic feature of ARTIs in Isfahan using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, patients aged <80 years with symptoms of ARTI were studied, during 2009-2010 Nasopharyngeal and dry throat swab specimens were collected and pathogens of ARTI was determined using multiplex real-time PCR. RESULTS: In this study, 455 cases with ARTI were studied. Mean age of studied population was 29.9 ± 18.5 (range: 0.2-80). Symptoms such as sore throat (86.3%), coryza (68.0%) and dry cough (54.3%) were the most common symptoms in all studied groups, whereas fever was the most clinical presentation of younger patients (<15 years old) and headache and skeletal pain were the most common symptoms of older patients (>15 years old). Rhinovirus was the most common cause of ARTI in patients aged <5 years and those aged >50 years. Influenza virus B was the most common cause of ARTI in patients aged 5-50 years. CONCLUSION: Our study provides baseline information on the epidemiologic and clinical feature of outpatients with ARTIs in Isfahan city.

1399,"Correlation Between Abnormal Platelet Count and Respiratory Viral Infection in Patients From Cheonan, Korea","BACKGROUND: In this study, the effects of viral infections on platelet (PLT) count have been reported. This study examined the correlation between PLT count and respiratory virus (RV) infections. METHODS: Patients who visited Dankook University Hospital between December 2006 and February 2014 with symptoms of suspected RV infection were recruited. Multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions identified the causative virus(es). PLT counts were analyzed with respect to virus, age and sex of the patient, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Of the 8,147 patients, 62.8% were RV‐positive, and 18.6% of RV‐positive patients had abnormal PLT counts. There were no differences in the rates of abnormal PLT counts between single‐infection and virus co‐infection cases. In RV infection patients, the incidence of abnormal PLT count increased with age and varied depending on the RV infection type. Patients with abnormal PLT count stayed in hospital longer than those with normal PLT count. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of thrombocytopenia was higher among the elderly; in younger patients, thrombocytosis was more prevalent than thrombocytopenia.

1402,Duration of Rhinovirus Shedding in the Upper Respiratory Tract in the First Year of Life,"BACKGROUND: Current molecular diagnostic methods have detected rhinovirus RNA in a high proportion of asymptomatic infants and children, raising the question of the clinical significance of these findings. This study investigates the prevalence of prolonged rhinovirus RNA presence in the upper respiratory tract of infants during the first year of life. METHODS: In a longitudinal study, infants were followed from birth up to 12 months. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected monthly (months 1–6 and month 9) and during an upper respiratory infection. Rhinoviruses were detected by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Presence of repeated rhinovirus RNA was evaluated by nucleotide sequence analysis. RESULTS: A total of 2153 specimens from 362 infants were studied; 341 distinct rhinovirus infections in 216 infants were identified. Follow-up specimens were available within 30 days for 179 infections, creating the sample set to assess prolonged rhinovirus presence. Of the 179 infections, 46 involved the detection of the same rhinovirus strain in repeated specimens, including 8 events of prolonged presence of the same strain (detected in specimens collected >30 days apart), representing 4.5% of the evaluable rhinovirus infections. There were 26 events in which a rhinovirus strain was replaced by a different strain within a 30-day interval, representing 14.5% of the 179 infections. CONCLUSIONS: Although rhinovirus infections are common in healthy infants, prolonged presence of rhinovirus RNA in the respiratory tract after an upper respiratory infection was uncommon (<5%). Detection of rhinovirus RNA in an infant most likely represents an infection within a 30-day period.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.12497581699999999,-0.082264485,-0.050591063,0.027283414,0.063212605,-0.134836931,0.051077673,-0.034050684,0.055867845,0.044134595,0.04828912,-0.03004089,0.015124013,-0.045908621,0.098430039,0.021093302999999997,0.018320448,-0.063229084,0.10100898300000001,-0.039823548,-0.023741871,-0.10738524699999999,-0.074667648,0.021662671,0.088517827,-0.011771963,-0.00646502,0.050452697000000005,0.033509127,-0.023022566
1403,Respiratory Syncytial Virus Genomic Load and Disease Severity Among Children Hospitalized With Bronchiolitis: Multicenter Cohort Studies in the United States and Finland,"Background. We investigated whether children with a higher respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) genomic load are at a higher risk of more-severe bronchiolitis. Methods. Two multicenter prospective cohort studies in the United States and Finland used the same protocol to enroll children aged <2 years hospitalized for bronchiolitis and collect nasopharyngeal aspirates. By using real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, patients were classified into 3 genomic load status groups: low, intermediate, and high. Outcome measures were a length of hospital stay (LOS) of ≥3 days and intensive care use, defined as admission to the intensive care unit or use of mechanical ventilation. Results. Of 2615 enrolled children, 1764 (67%) had RSV bronchiolitis. Children with a low genomic load had a higher unadjusted risk of having a length of stay of ≥3 days (52%), compared with children with intermediate and those with high genomic loads (42% and 51%, respectively). In a multivariable model, the risk of having a length of stay of ≥3 days remained significantly higher in the groups with intermediate (odds ratio [OR], 1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20–1.69) and high (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.29–1.94) genomic loads. Similarly, children with a high genomic load had a higher risk of intensive care use (20%, compared with 15% and 16% in the groups with low and intermediate genomic loads, respectively). In a multivariable model, the risk remained significantly higher in the group with a high genomic load (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.03–1.99). Conclusion. Children with a higher RSV genomic load had a higher risk for more-severe bronchiolitis.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.14479539800000002,-0.093147828,-0.070594143,-0.055783487,0.002255478,-0.108782006,0.021035855,-0.055786552,0.02139314,-0.089525316,0.008628071,-0.014297532,-0.12804042300000001,-0.101122085,-0.076763758,0.11688105300000001,-0.093281066,-0.00073697,0.000868981,-0.01981011,-0.135133071,0.040805388,0.013216886,0.03144512,-0.073547856,-0.077713133,0.09651955400000001,-0.14256386599999998,-0.09548718099999999,0.067834217
1405,Utilization of Viral Molecular Diagnostics Among Children Hospitalized With Community Acquired Pneumonia,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether results of a polymerase chain reaction–based respiratory viral panel (RVP) are associated with changes in antibiotic use or differential clinical outcomes among children hospitalized with pneumonia. METHODS: We retrospectively identified otherwise healthy children hospitalized over a 3-year period at a single institution with community-acquired pneumonia who had an RVP performed within 24 hours of admission. We examined associations between RVP results and clinical outcomes as well as management decisions including initiation and duration of intravenous antibiotics. RESULTS: Among 202 children, a positive RVP (n = 127, 63%) was associated with a more complicated clinical course, although this was due largely to more severe disease seen in younger children and those with respiratory syncytial virus (n = 38, 30% of positive detections). Detection of a virus did not influence antibiotic therapy. Included children were younger and had more severe illness than children hospitalized with pneumonia at the same institution without an RVP obtained. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, only respiratory syncytial virus was associated with a more severe clinical course compared with RVP-negative children. Regardless of the virus detected, RVP positivity did not influence antibiotic usage. However, RVP use focused primarily on children with severe pneumonia. Whether similar testing influences management decisions among children with less severe illness deserves further study.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.182704507,-0.08430907,-0.077943002,-0.021392837999999997,-0.012077417,-0.10767383800000001,0.040313083,-0.038743382,0.023673229,0.004023965,-0.004695821,-0.026477407,-0.029712362000000003,-0.067388955,-0.018086082,0.020796975,-0.027805157999999996,0.028366521000000002,-0.028577854,0.016056624,-0.03020827,0.112146527,0.028966979,-0.022789754,-0.03208934,0.054386443,-0.035409186,-0.046570270999999996,0.02000959,1.47e-06
1414,The Role of Multiplex PCR in Respiratory Tract Infections in Children,"BACKGROUND: Infants, toddlers, and children of primary-school age without any special risk factors generally have three to ten febrile respiratory infections per year. Most such infections are of viral origin and self-limiting, but viral infection is often hard to distinguish from bacterial infection. The use of a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect viruses in respiratory secretions is potentially beneficial, as it might help physicians avoid giving antibiotics unnecessarily. METHODS: This article is based on a selective review of the literature and on the findings of the authors‘ own investigations. RESULTS: Multiplex PCR is a highly sensitive, highly specific test for the detection of viral nucleic acids in respiratory secretions. If PCR reveals the presence of RNA derived from respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, or influenza virus, then an acute infection caused by the corresponding pathogen is probably present, and further treatment can be given accordingly. On the other hand, the nucleic acids of adeno-, boca-, rhino- or coronaviruses can be found in relatively trivial infections as well as in asymptomatic persons, probably reflecting either a prior infection or a current subclinical one. For children in particular, upper respiratory infections are so common in the winter months that acute and prior infections with these pathogens cannot be distinguished by multiplex PCR. The use of multiplex PCR in children has not been shown to shorten hospital stays or to lessen antibiotic consumption or overall cost. CONCLUSION: The detectability of viral nucleic acids is an important contribution to the diagnostic assessment of children with severe respiratory infection. For these highly sensitive diagnostic tests to be used optimally, primary viral infections must be distinguished from bacterial superinfections.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.23131534199999998,-0.074195274,-0.010130905,0.143904145,-0.011938998999999999,-0.096301949,0.08502000800000001,-0.053341972,0.078396078,0.130023787,-0.004412735,-0.116555806,0.12379278199999999,-0.06059448,0.06545757599999999,-0.053981484,0.021190226,-0.018055559,0.002922123,-0.02361285,-0.05741315599999999,0.000945373,0.004683535999999999,-0.045687479,0.036669165,0.026811282000000002,-0.016546576,-0.068569828,0.034628179,0.012963631000000002
1416,Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Respiratory Viral Infections in the First Year of Life: Association With Acute Otitis Media Development,"Background. Sensitive diagnostic assays have increased the detection of viruses in asymptomatic individuals. The clinical significance of asymptomatic respiratory viral infection in infants is unknown. Methods. High-throughput, quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect 13 common respiratory viruses from nasopharyngeal specimens collected during 2028 visits from 362 infants followed from near birth up to 12 months of age. Specimens were collected at monthly interval (months 1–6 and month 9) and during upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) episodes. Subjects were followed closely for acute otitis media (AOM) development. Results. Viruses were detected in 76% of 394 URTI specimens and 27% of asymptomatic monthly specimens. Rhinovirus was detected most often; multiple viruses were detected in 29% of the specimens. Generalized mixed-model analyses associated symptoms with increasing age and female sex; detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, and adenovirus was highly associated with symptoms. Increasing age was also associated with multiple virus detection. Overall, 403 asymptomatic viral infections in 237 infants were identified. Viral load was significantly higher in URTI specimens than asymptomatic specimens but did not differentiate cases of URTI with and without AOM complication. The rate of AOM complicating URTI was 27%; no AOM occurred following asymptomatic viral infections. AOM development was associated with increasing age and infection with RSV, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, and bocavirus. Conclusions. Compared to symptomatic infection, asymptomatic viral infection in infants is associated with young age, male sex, low viral load, specific viruses, and single virus detection.

1418,Association of Interleukin-8 and Neutrophils with Nasal Symptom Severity During Acute Respiratory Infection,"Using a large data set (n = 811), the relationship between acute respiratory infection illness severity and inflammatory biomarkers was investigated to determine whether certain symptoms are correlated more closely than others with the inflammatory biomarkers, interleukin-8 (IL-8) and nasal neutrophils. Participants with community acquired acute respiratory infection underwent nasal lavage for IL-8 and neutrophil testing, in addition to multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods for the detection and identification of respiratory viruses. Information about symptoms was obtained throughout the duration of the illness episode using the well-validated Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-21). Global symptom severity was calculated by the area under the curve (AUC) plotting duration versus WURSS total. Of the specimens tested, 56% were positively identified for one or more of nine different respiratory viruses. During acute respiratory infection illness, both IL-8 and neutrophils positively correlate with AUC (r(s) = 0.082, P = 0.022; r(s) = 0.080, P = 0.030). IL-8 and neutrophils correlate with nasal symptom severity: runny nose (r = 0.13, P = <0.00001; r = 0.18, P = <0.003), plugged nose (r = 0.045, P = 0.003; r = 0.14, P = 0.058), and sneezing (r = −0.02, P = <0.0001; r = −0.0055, P = 0.31). Neutrophils correlate with some quality of life measures such as sleeping well (r = 0.15, P = 0.026). Thus, the study demonstrates that IL-8 and neutrophils are correlated with severity of nasal symptoms during acute respiratory infection. Further research is necessary to determine if the concentration of these or other biomarkers can predict the overall duration and severity of acute respiratory infection illness.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.127852401,-0.036679353,-0.047818121,-0.047586979,-0.009321168000000001,-0.031273393,0.031782242,-0.025753189,0.048833317,-0.012053942,-0.006147653,-0.03140732,0.000104667,0.019406833999999998,0.021113461,0.006051351,-0.002404077,-0.08028578,0.036646897000000005,-0.064030719,0.015540818999999999,-0.11948332,-0.035878307000000005,-0.027463624,0.024370265,-0.004478234,-0.020370274,0.012087587,0.050515315,-0.081568698
1420,Severity of Rhinovirus Infection in Hospitalized Adults Is Unrelated to Genotype,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether rhinovirus (RV) species is associated with more severe clinical illness in adults. METHODS: Seventy-two RV-positive viral respiratory samples from adult patients were sequenced and analyzed phylogenetically after reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of the region spanning the VP4 gene and 5′ terminus of the VP2 gene. The clinical features and severity of illness associated with the different RV species were compared. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis identified three distinct clusters as RV-A (54%), B (11%), or C (35%) species. In an unadjusted model, patients with RV-B infection were significantly more likely to have the composite outcome variable of death or intensive care unit admission (P = .03), but this effect diminished when controlling for patient sex. A logistic model of the relationship between RV species and adverse outcomes produced nonsignificant odds ratios when controlling for patient sex. CONCLUSIONS: Infection with RV-A or RV-B was associated with greater severity of illness in our adult population; however, the association disappeared after controlling for confounders.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.07887308,-0.01933355,-0.052101769000000006,-0.099235827,0.031035736,-0.024342415,0.016223937,0.018428846999999998,-0.041645381,-0.017570524,-0.042358241,-0.007896233,-0.030411851,0.007067073,-0.034480956,0.013299193999999999,0.005590915,0.018736765,-0.016531584,0.001247052,0.0285043,-0.085153004,-0.040384918,0.041176644,0.009740538,-0.037631809,0.028306087,0.006235028,-0.048238917,0.08311413599999999
1421,Respiratory Syncytial Virus Increases the Virulence of Streptococcus pneumoniae by Binding to Penicillin Binding Protein 1a. A New Paradigm in Respiratory Infection,"Rationale: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Streptococcus pneumoniae are major respiratory pathogens. Coinfection with RSV and S. pneumoniae is associated with severe and often fatal pneumonia but the molecular basis for this remains unclear. Objectives: To determine if interaction between RSV and pneumococci enhances pneumococcal virulence. Methods: We used confocal microscopy and Western blot to identify the receptors involved in direct binding of RSV and pneumococci, the effects of which were studied in both in vivo and in vitro models of infection. Human ciliated respiratory epithelial cell cultures were infected with RSV for 72 hours and then challenged with pneumococci. Pneumococci were collected after 2 hours exposure and changes in gene expression determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Measurements and Main Results: Following incubation with RSV or purified G protein, pneumococci demonstrated a significant increase in the inflammatory response and bacterial adherence to human ciliated epithelial cultures and markedly increased virulence in a pneumonia model in mice. This was associated with extensive changes in the pneumococcal transcriptome and significant up-regulation in the expression of key pneumococcal virulence genes, including the gene for the pneumococcal toxin, pneumolysin. We show that mechanistically this is caused by RSV G glycoprotein binding penicillin binding protein 1a. Conclusions: The direct interaction between a respiratory virus protein and the pneumococcus resulting in increased bacterial virulence and worsening disease outcome is a new paradigm in respiratory infection.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.063765189,-0.092693756,-0.060956849,-0.030049358999999998,-0.046507434,-0.028775625,0.028156059,-0.084275987,0.10712660199999999,-0.029709757000000003,-0.055142374,-0.097371804,-0.08106118,-0.015185948999999999,-0.07855311799999999,-0.055120128,-0.005858405,-0.002707174,-0.037044826,-0.011457687,0.03667703,-0.053353155,0.108485422,-0.028761059,0.08415497400000001,-0.089873051,0.19107863600000002,0.092968096,-0.027285282,-0.011732441000000001
1423,Frequency of Acute Respiratory Illnesses and Circulation of Respiratory Viruses in Households With Children Over 3 Surveillance Seasons,"Background. The household has traditionally been the site for studying acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs). Most studies were conducted many years ago, and more broadly sensitive laboratory methods to determine ARI etiology are now available. Methods. We recruited and followed households with children over 3 annual surveillance periods and collected respiratory tract specimens from subjects with reported ARI. Virus etiology was determined by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Results. Individuals in larger households (defined as households with >4 members) and those in households with children aged <5 years had significantly higher ARI frequencies than others. ARI frequency generally declined with increasing age. Virus etiology was most likely to be determined in young children, who were also most likely to have virus coinfection. Overall, 16% of ARIs with 1 virus identified had ≥1 coinfecting virus. Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses were the most frequently identified agents of ARI in all age categories. Influenza virus and adenovirus were less frequently identified but were most likely to cause ARI that required medical attention. Conclusions. Longitudinal studies in families remain a valuable way to study respiratory infections. RT-PCR has increased the sensitivity of virus detection, including coinfecting viruses, and expanded our ability to detect viruses now known to cause ARI.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.162694956,-0.07813300299999999,-0.002562521,0.09468796,0.056732448,-0.035813295,0.02669028,-0.056183329000000004,0.04307146,-0.010770311999999999,0.015962397,-0.031579071,0.013918004,-0.034571611,0.033849379,0.002972186,0.001898371,-0.079914944,0.018268443,-0.04260492900000001,-0.061599922,0.034007766,-0.002517596,0.061690174,0.017051548,0.064302067,0.039512341,0.0046490459999999996,0.03793679,-0.065475706
1424,Severe Neutropenia in Dengue Patients: Prevalence and Significance,"Studies on severe neutropenia in dengue are scarce, and its clinical significance is uncertain. We analyzed a cohort of 1,921 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed adult dengue patients admitted to the Communicable Disease Center in Singapore between 2005 and 2008. Time trend analyses for daily absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) were done using Bayesian hierarchical and Markov models. We found that severe neutropenia, defined as ANC ≤ 0.5 × 10(9)/L, was found in 11.8% with a median duration of 1 day. ANC nadir occurred on illness day 5. Severe neutropenia was not predictive of more severe disease and not associated with secondary bacterial infections, prolonged hospital stay, prolonged fever, or fatal outcome.

1430,Lower Respiratory Tract Virus Findings in Mechanically Ventilated Patients With Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia,"Background. The role of viral infections in the etiology of severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) was prospectively evaluated from 2008 to 2012 at a university-level intensive care unit. Methods. Clinical data and microbiological tests were assessed: blood cultures, urine pneumococcal and legionella antigens, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae antibodies from paired serums, and respiratory virus detection by multiplex, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs and lower tracheal specimens via intubation tube. Results. Of 49 mechanically ventilated SCAP patients (21 men and 28 women; median age, 54 years), the etiology was identified in 45 cases (92%). There were 21 pure bacterial infections (43%), 5 probably pure viral infections (10%), and 19 mixed bacterial–viral infections (39%), resulting in viral etiology in 24 patients (49%). Of 26 viruses, 21 (81%) were detected from bronchial specimens and 5 (19%) from nasopharyngeal swabs. Rhinovirus (15 cases, 58%) and adenovirus (4 cases, 15%) were the most common viral findings. The bacterial–viral etiology group had the highest peak C-reactive protein levels (median, 356 [25th–75th percentiles, 294–416], P = .05), whereas patients with probably viral etiology had the lowest peak procalcitonin levels (1.7 [25th–75th percentiles, 1.6–1.7]). The clinical characteristics of pure bacterial and mixed bacterial–viral etiologies were comparable. Hospital stay was longest among the bacterial group (17 vs 14 days; P = .02). Conclusions. Viral findings were demonstrated in almost half of the SCAP patients. Clinical characteristics were similar between the pure bacterial and mixed bacterial–viral infections groups. The frequency of viral detection depends on the availability of PCR techniques and lower respiratory specimens.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.21274116199999998,-0.072425237,-0.069863357,-0.050959179,-0.06991226,-0.10701211199999999,0.00891731,0.059454315,-0.14355900900000002,0.12513517400000002,-0.038884427,-0.061354795999999996,0.027482692000000003,0.021265037,-0.012022043999999999,-0.06028980900000001,0.026914285,-0.008432636,0.006463467,0.017275876000000003,-0.053522198,0.076337997,0.034843651,0.008107109,0.031230868999999998,0.022016296,0.073080123,0.0012621330000000001,0.016657659,0.038423423
1431,Prevalence and Molecular Characterization of Human Metapneumovirus in Influenza A Negative Sample in Thailand,"BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) causes respiratory tract infection in influenza‐like illness. The role of hMPV infections in all age groups in Thailand has not yet been investigated. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine prevalence of hMPV infection in all age groups in Thailand during 2011. METHODS: A total of 1,184 nasopharyngeal washes were collected from hospitalized patients and sent to the Department of Microbiology, Siriraj Hospital, for influenza A virus detection. Real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect hMPV infection. Partially, F gene from hMPV positive samples were sequenced and used for genotyping by phylogenetic tree analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of hMPV for all age groups was 6.3%. The highest prevalence of hMPV infection was in children aged <2 years. Of 71 hMPV‐positive patients, three (4.2%) were coinfected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), two with rhinovirus (2.8%), one with coronavirus (1.4%), and one with RSV and adenovirus (1.4%). Phylogenetic analysis of F gene revealed that 96.8% of hMPV detected was subgenotype B1, 1.6% was sublineage A2a, and 1.6% was A2b. Genetic variation of F gene was much conserved. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the prevalence of hMPV subgenotype B1 circulating in Thailand during 2011.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.202725509,-0.11236208,-0.052156877000000004,0.064553708,0.107163392,-0.085771099,0.0017686429999999999,-0.130063866,0.17322516,-0.11696928599999999,0.016064419,-0.06966639,-0.142489712,0.02837623,-0.16403083599999999,-0.075921638,-0.019340735,0.278080197,-0.183425266,0.078849966,0.22005777399999998,0.04697716,0.035959572999999995,-0.16033265800000002,-0.09292267400000001,-0.014094364,-0.219973222,-0.13551813599999998,-0.021457384,-0.019808156
1432,The Role of Influenza and Parainfluenza Infections in Nasopharyngeal Pneumococcal Acquisition Among Young Children,"Background. Animal models suggest that influenza infection favors nasopharyngeal acquisition of pneumococci. We assessed this relationship with influenza and other respiratory viruses in young children. Methods. A case-control study was nested within a prospective cohort study of acute respiratory illness (ARI) in Andean children <3 years of age (RESPIRA-PERU study). Weekly household visits were made to identify ARI and obtain nasal swabs for viral detection using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Monthly nasopharyngeal (NP) samples were obtained to assess pneumococcal colonization. We determined whether specific respiratory viral ARI episodes occurring within the interval between NP samples increased the risk of NP acquisition of new pneumococcal serotypes. Results. A total of 729 children contributed 2128 episodes of observation, including 681 pneumococcal acquisition episodes (new serotype, not detected in prior sample), 1029 nonacquisition episodes (no colonization or persistent colonization with the same serotype as the prior sample), and 418 indeterminate episodes. The risk of pneumococcal acquisition increased following influenza-ARI (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02–4.69) and parainfluenza-ARI (AOR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.15–3.01), when compared with episodes without ARI. Other viral infections (respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, and adenovirus) were not associated with acquisition. Conclusions. Influenza and parainfluenza ARIs appeared to facilitate pneumococcal acquisition among young children. As acquisition increases the risk of pneumococcal diseases, these observations are pivotal in our attempts to prevent pneumococcal disease.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.160574137,-0.104571684,-0.049615537,0.035796954,0.016524616000000002,0.015399866000000002,0.014805678999999999,-0.054092140999999996,0.045670845,-0.060117501,0.009263235,-0.005322927,-0.040857836,-0.071758775,0.0037844909999999996,0.052581927,-0.054922143,-0.102694988,0.044685259000000005,-0.055068980999999996,-0.120096828,0.034239228999999996,-0.008152313000000001,0.05048156,0.022864328,0.014815028000000001,-0.001938775,-0.070462222,0.004843246,-0.044193450999999995
1433,Comparison of Viral Load in Individuals with and without Asthma during Infections with Rhinovirus,"Rationale: Most virus-induced attacks of asthma are caused by rhinoviruses (RVs). Objectives: To determine whether people with asthma are susceptible to an increased viral load during RV infection. Methods: Seventy-four children (4–18 yr old) were enrolled; 28 with wheezing, 32 with acute rhinitis, and 14 without respiratory tract symptoms. Nasal washes were evaluated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction for RV to judge viral load along with gene sequencing to identify strains of RV. Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, IFN-λ(1), and eosinophil cationic protein in nasal washes, along with blood eosinophil counts and total and allergen-specific IgE in sera, were also evaluated. Similar assessments were done in 24 young adults (16 with asthma, 8 without) who participated in an experimental challenge with RV (serotype 16). Measurements and Main Results: Fifty-seven percent of wheezing children and 56% with acute rhinitis had nasal washes testing positive for RV. The geometric mean of viral loads by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in washes from wheezing children was 2.8-fold lower, but did not differ significantly from children with rhinitis (7,718 and 21,612 copies of viral RNA per microliter nasal wash, respectively; P = 0.48). The odds for wheezing were increased if children who tested positive for RV were sensitized to one or more allergens (odds ratio, 3.9; P = 0.02). Similarly, neither peak nor cumulative viral loads differed significantly in washes from adults with asthma compared with those without asthma during the experimental RV challenge. Conclusions: During acute symptoms, children infected with RV enrolled for wheezing or acute rhinitis had similar viral loads in their nasal washes, as did adults with and without asthma infected with RV-16 experimentally.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.093386915,-0.074693281,-0.050959017,-0.059985654000000006,-0.013442963999999998,-0.086761385,0.04670446,-0.064414284,0.032705654,-0.018415751,-0.002769744,-0.044997069,-0.065439705,-0.010870353000000001,-6.69e-05,0.017208853,-0.003493632,-0.060986581,0.016076968,-0.03485672,-0.044487729000000004,-0.055189968,-0.02890248,0.075417561,-0.023175145,0.057276002,0.0033048609999999996,-0.020935864,0.013102835,0.122780269
1434,Incidence and Etiology of Acute Lower Respiratory Tract Infections in Hospitalized Children Younger Than 5 Years in Rural Thailand,"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia remains a leading cause of under-five morbidity and mortality globally. Comprehensive incidence, epidemiologic and etiologic data are needed to update prevention and control strategies. METHODS: We conducted active, population-based surveillance for hospitalized cases of acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI) among children <5 years of age in rural thailand. ALRI cases were systematically sampled for an etiology study that tested nasopharyngeal specimens by polymerase chain reaction; children without ALRI were enrolled as controls from outpatient clinics. RESULTS: We identified 28,543 hospitalized ALRI cases from 2005 to 2010. Among the 49% with chest radiographs, 63% had findings consistent with pneumonia as identified by 2 study radiologists. The hospitalized ALRI incidence rate was 5772 per 100,000 child-years (95% confidence interval: 5707, 5837) and was higher in boys versus girls (incidence rate ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval: 1.35–1.41) and in children 6–23 months of age versus other age groups (incidence rate ratio 1.76, 95% confidence interval: 1.69–1.84). Viruses most commonly detected in ALRI cases were respiratory syncytial virus (19.5%), rhinoviruses (18.7%), bocavirus (12.8%) and influenza viruses (8%). Compared with controls, ALRI cases were more likely to test positive for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3 (P ≤ 0.01 for all). Bloodstream infections, most commonly Streptococcus pneumoniae and nontyphoidal Salmonella, accounted for 1.8% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the high burden of hospitalization for ALRI and the importance of viral pathogens among children in Thailand. Interventions targeting viral pathogens coupled with improved diagnostic approaches, especially for bacteria, are critical for better understanding of ALRI etiology, prevention and control.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.18758313899999998,-0.106358223,-0.081438184,0.00875762,0.015247416000000001,-0.01546118,0.015116087,-0.01426708,-0.000523362,-0.031671839,0.0030542390000000003,0.016717785,-0.041615897,-0.093574216,-0.024933412999999998,0.037142199,-0.052773754000000006,-0.038628422999999995,0.0027099990000000003,-0.010549291,-0.095911266,0.111047688,0.032045622999999995,0.038205567,0.013730813,0.040045687999999996,0.004062545999999999,-0.009385862,0.009898054,-0.048688212
1439,Apnea in Children Hospitalized With Bronchiolitis,"OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for inpatient apnea among children hospitalized with bronchiolitis. METHODS: We enrolled 2207 children, aged <2 years, hospitalized with bronchiolitis at 16 sites during the winters of 2007 to 2010. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were obtained on all subjects, and real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to test NPA samples for 16 viruses. Inpatient apnea was ascertained by daily chart review, with outcome data in 2156 children (98%). Age was corrected for birth <37 weeks. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify independent risk factors for inpatient apnea. RESULTS: Inpatient apnea was identified in 108 children (5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4%–6%). Statistically significant, independent predictors of inpatient apnea included: corrected ages of <2 weeks (odds ratio [OR] 9.67) and 2 to 8 weeks (OR 4.72), compared with age ≥6 months; birth weight <2.3 kg (5 pounds; OR 2.15), compared with ≥3.2 kg (7 pounds); caretaker report of previous apnea during this bronchiolitis episode (OR 3.63); preadmission respiratory rates of <30 (OR 4.05), 30 to 39 (OR 2.35) and >70 (OR 2.26), compared with 40 to 49; and having a preadmission room air oxygen saturation <90% (OR 1.60). Apnea risk was similar across the major viral pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective, multicenter study of children hospitalized with bronchiolitis, inpatient apnea was associated with younger corrected age, lower birth weight, history of apnea, and preadmission clinical factors including low or high respiratory rates and low room air oxygen saturation. Several bronchiolitis pathogens were associated with apnea, with similar apnea risk across the major viral pathogens.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.089513132,-0.072330866,-0.040840178,-0.058202671,0.000871479,-0.051756065,0.044797975999999996,-0.038161516,0.028514848,-0.043006111,0.006871045,0.01248285,-0.064818914,-0.077780378,-0.017858371,0.064881784,-0.033563814,-0.038080115,0.0053853469999999995,-0.023227602000000003,-0.07449267,0.052955945,0.000363292,0.022473305,-0.018226803,-0.0033440709999999997,0.0018644070000000002,-0.06620923,-0.001259612,-0.003853123
1440,Epidemiology and Clinical Presentation of Parainfluenza Type 4 in Children: A 3-Year Comparative Study to Parainfluenza Types 1–3,"Background. Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are among the most common causes of respiratory tract infections in children. Little is known about the epidemiology and clinical presentation of HPIV type 4. Methods. A retrospective chart review and comparison of patients positive for HPIV types 1–4 by multiplex polymerase chain reaction between 2009 and 2012 at Children's Hospital Colorado was performed. Patients who had only direct fluorescent antibody testing performed or concurrent viral infections were excluded. Results. Of 11 533 samples, 752 (6.5%) were positive for HPIV. After exclusion criteria, 316 samples were included in the study. HPIV-4 had year-round prevalence with biennial peaks in odd-numbered years. HPIV-4 and HPIV-3 had similar clinical presentations. 50.8% and 51.5% of patients with HPIV-3–4 had hypoxia compared to 20.3% and 33.3% of patients with HPIV-1–2 (P < .01). HPIV-1 (23.6%) and HPIV-2 (24.2%) were more associated with stridor than HPIV-3 (6.6%) and HPIV-4 (0%) (P < .01). No patients with HPIV-4 had croup. Patients with HPIV-4 had similar lengths of stay and mortality as those with HPIV-1–3. Conclusions. This is the first large-scale analysis of HPIV-4 clinical and epidemiologic features. HPIV-4 was most similar to HPIV-3 in clinical presentation. HPIV-4 had year-round prevalence with peaks in the autumn of odd-numbered years. HPIV-4 is a common respiratory pathogen capable of causing significant morbidity in children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.080484707,-0.047019835,-0.037990077000000004,-0.06565513099999999,-0.013466536000000001,-0.031015844,0.010565693999999999,0.013796802,-0.01633247,-0.004665717,-0.013941858,0.028214221,-0.017332088,-0.013725363,-0.004644613,0.012272473999999998,-0.003182552,0.018498207,-0.009978736,0.010190534000000001,0.022960237,0.002284521,-0.017178061,-0.006260984,-0.01279343,0.013003258,-0.050399272,0.007421398,-0.0061285590000000004,-0.011300836000000002
1441,Role of Human Bocavirus in Upper Respiratory Tract Infections and Acute Otitis Media,"BACKGROUND: Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a newly described parvovirus. HBoV1 has been associated with respiratory infections, including acute otitis media (AOM), but the knowledge on the significance of HBoV1 in upper respiratory tract infections (URI) and AOM in relation to other respiratory viruses is limited. The objective of this study was to compare the rate of detection of HBoV1 to that of other respiratory viruses in specimens from children with URI, with and without AOM complication. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) were collected during URI from healthy children (6–35 months) followed prospectively for 1 year; specimens have been previously analyzed for broad spectrum of respiratory viruses. Archived NPS were analyzed for HBoV1 using a high-throughput, quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. RESULTS: Seven hundred and seven NPS samples collected during URI episodes from 201 children were studied for HBoV1. A total of 94 (47%) children tested positive for HBoV1 DNA during 172 (24%) URI episodes; HBoV1 was present as the only virus in 44 (6%) URI episodes. Overall, 37% of URI episodes were complicated by AOM. Of URI associated with single virus (n = 303), the rate of AOM complicating URI associated with HBoV1 only was 52% (23 of 44); this was a higher AOM rate, compared to that of other respiratory viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Among URI associated with single respiratory virus, HBoV1-URI was commonly associated with AOM complication. The important role of HBoV1 on AOM pathogenesis needs to be studied further.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.086012923,-0.065834536,-0.024252201,-0.023557707999999997,0.023751516,-0.056500293,0.074421614,-0.044509375,0.04656381,0.009024800999999999,0.005355249,-0.016296021,-0.00944143,-0.052700594,0.039500328,0.006241986999999999,-0.024229563,-0.072558863,0.030296879,-0.043610287000000005,-0.026162711,0.020638546,-0.023900654,0.033027672,-0.009568095,0.028820448,-0.042343887000000004,-0.008061601,0.025027946000000002,-0.054528615
1443,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus Lower Respiratory Disease in Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients: Viral RNA Detection in Blood, Antiviral Treatment, and Clinical Outcomes","Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is associated with severe morbidity. Although RSV RNA has been detected in serum from patients with RSV lower respiratory disease (LRD) after HCT, the association with clinical outcomes has not been well established in multivariable models. Additionally, the role of antiviral treatment in HCT recipients has not been previously analyzed in multivariable models. Methods. We retrospectively identified HCT recipients with virologically confirmed RSV LRD and tested stored plasma/serum samples by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for RSV RNA. Risk factors for RSV RNA detection and the impact of RSV RNA in serum and antiviral therapy on outcomes were analyzed using multivariable Cox models. Results. RSV RNA was detected in plasma or serum from 28 of 92 (30%) patients at a median of 24.5 days following HCT and 2 days following LRD. In multivariable models, neutropenia, monocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and mechanical ventilation increased the risk of plasma/serum RSV RNA detection; lymphopenia and steroid use did not. RSV RNA detection increased the risk of overall mortality in multivariable models (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.09 [P = .02]), whereas treatment with aerosolized ribavirin decreased the risk of overall mortality and pulmonary death (aHR, 0.33 [P = .001] and aHR 0.31 [P = .003], respectively). Conclusions. RSV RNA detection in plasma or serum may be a marker for lung injury and poor outcomes in HCT recipients with RSV LRD. Treatment with aerosolized ribavirin appeared to be protective against overall and pulmonary mortality.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.077469895,-0.07977775299999999,-0.06448859400000001,0.017671476999999998,-0.042357035,-0.087602549,0.024304962000000003,-0.0235274,0.034915543,-0.051868162999999995,0.045339578,-0.048327949,-0.131142055,-0.002514232,-0.08535062800000001,0.016850393,-0.052074608,0.08936656400000001,-0.000916567,-0.005192177,0.005820025,-0.147658032,0.009593381,-0.065339399,0.07891627799999999,-0.203642693,0.222859088,0.041589228,-0.097022205,0.068495106
1445,Clinical Impact of Human Coronaviruses 229E and OC43 Infection in Diverse Adult Populations,"Background. The incidence and clinical impact of coronavirus (CoV) infection in elderly persons and those with underlying cardiopulmonary disease over a long duration is not well described. We determined the incidence and clinical impact of 229E and OC43 CoV in this population during 4 consecutive winters, and compared illnesses to influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus. Methods. CoV 229E and OC43 were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and serology in 4 adult populations under surveillance for acute respiratory illness during the winters of 1999–2003. Cohorts included healthy young adults, healthy elderly adults, high-risk adults with underlying cardiopulmonary disease, and a hospitalized group. Results. Three hundred ninety-eight CoV infections were identified, with annual infection rates ranging from 2.8% to 26% in prospective cohorts, and prevalence ranging from 3.3% to 11.1% in the hospitalized cohort. The incidence of infections with each strain was similar, although asymptomatic infection and viral coinfection was significantly more common with 229E than OC43 infection. Although the incidence and clinical manifestations were similar for each strain, OC43-infected subjects tended to seek more medical care, as OC43 was twice as common as 229E among the hospitalized cohort. Conclusions. CoV infections in the elderly are frequent, likely causing substantial medical disease burden.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.15086356,0.062866424,-0.13948986300000002,-0.000603934,0.065663502,-0.005899916,0.020605418,0.005474604,0.140547659,-0.034703776,0.000542319,0.070000233,0.09246231699999999,-0.004750955,-0.005949806,0.017543224,-0.015136966000000002,0.012697901000000001,0.001229167,0.0294368,0.012205188999999998,-0.08121595,0.031387688,0.034804791,0.068349098,-0.057548577000000004,-0.009330598,0.037459174,0.001256244,0.048863564000000005
1450,Home Self-Collection of Nasal Swabs for Diagnosis of Acute Respiratory Virus Infections in Children With Cystic Fibrosis,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the importance of respiratory viruses in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) has been limited because of challenges using clinic- or hospital-based diagnostic testing. We conducted a pilot study to assess feasibility of home self- (or parent-) collection of nasal swabs (NS). METHODS: Cystic fibrosis patients aged 6–18 years with new respiratory illness participated. In clinic, a deep nasal flocked swab was collected by research staff and compared with an anterior foam NS obtained after instillation of saline spray. At home, up to 2 self-collections of paired foam NS (with and without saline) were collected and mailed for real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. RESULTS: Paired swabs were collected from 28 patients: 18 sets in clinic (deep nasal vs saline foam NS) and 43 sets at home (saline vs dry foam NS) with 9 (50%) and 35 (81%) virus detections, respectively. Home-collected NS were obtained closer to illness onset, with a mean difference in symptom days of −2.3 between home and clinic collections (95% confidence interval [CI] −3.5, −1.2; P < .001). Rhinovirus comprised 73% of virus detections; the difference in mean PCR cycle threshold values for rhinovirus between swabs collected at home versus clinic was −3.8 (95% CI −6.8, −0.9; P = .014), indicating significantly higher viral load for home-collected swabs. CONCLUSIONS: Home-collected foam NS had a higher positivity rate compared with clinic-collected swabs, likely because collection was closer to illness onset. Home self-collection is feasible and well tolerated for timely respiratory virus diagnosis and provides a novel approach for clinical diagnostics and surveillance of respiratory virus infections among CF patients.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.126085805,-0.03791274,-0.024139867000000002,-0.040380404,-0.004270344000000001,-0.018993654,-0.009808672,0.01066032,-0.038451866,-0.01148886,0.006620877,0.018796103999999998,-0.03643641,-0.021291273,0.010358404,0.032355084,-0.021316626,-0.067531907,0.061679305999999996,-0.072299218,-0.065542037,-0.036104472,-0.03410557,-0.018315331,0.025572429,0.022481171,-0.010019823,-0.055829273,-0.027715211,-0.051475485
1453,Low Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Level and Risk of Upper Respiratory Tract Infection in Children and Adolescents,"Background. Vitamin D may be important for immune function. Studies to date have shown an inconsistent association between vitamin D and infection with respiratory viruses. The purpose of this study was to determine if serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) was associated with laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children. Methods. Serum 25(OH)D levels were measured at baseline and children from Canadian Hutterite communities were followed prospectively during the respiratory virus season. Nasopharyngeal specimens were obtained if symptoms developed and infections were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction. The association between serum 25(OH)D and time to laboratory-confirmed viral RTI was evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results. Seven hundred forty-three children aged 3–15 years were followed between 22 December 2008 and 23 June 2009. The median serum 25(OH)D level was 62.0 nmol/L (interquartile range, 51.0–74.0). A total of 229 participants (31%) developed at least 1 laboratory-confirmed viral RTI. Younger age and lower serum 25(OH)D levels were associated with increased risk of viral RTI. Serum 25(OH)D levels <75 nmol/L increased the risk of viral RTI by 50% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10–2.07, P = .011) and levels <50 nmol/L increased the risk by 70% (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.16–2.40, P = .006). Conclusions. Lower serum 25(OH)D levels were associated with increased risk of laboratory-confirmed viral RTI in children from Canadian Hutterite communities. Interventional studies evaluating the role of vitamin D supplementation to reduce the burden of viral RTIs are warranted.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.108838861,-0.069055023,-0.05380898,-0.062496917,-0.028714271,-0.041534967,0.036483956,-0.028850295,0.023168141,-0.04067679,0.011932338999999998,0.005194046,-0.050819055999999994,-0.013098993,-0.025367795,0.044948675,-0.040883882999999996,-0.053833164,0.014761325,-0.033341573,-0.08416584099999999,0.039139275,-0.001054918,0.033251817,-0.040950093,-0.002068408,0.001877982,-0.116890964,-0.029759815,-0.008699799999999999
1456,Evaluation of the FilmArray(®) Respiratory Panel for Clinical Use in a Large Children's Hospital,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory pathogens are a leading cause of hospital admission and traditional detection methods are time consuming and insensitive. Multiplex molecular detection methods have recently been investigated in hope of replacing these traditional techniques with rapid panel‐based testing. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the FilmArray(®) Respiratory Panel ([FARP], Idaho Technology Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) as a replacement for direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing in a pediatric hospital. METHODS: Eleven of the 21 FARP analytes (Adenovirus, Bordetella pertussis, human Metapneumovirus, Influenza A, Influenza A H1N1 2009, Influenza B, Parainfluenza [1, 2, & 3], Respiratory Syncytial Virus, and rhinovirus) were evaluated using nasopharyngeal specimens. Positive samples were pooled in groups of 5. Samples identified by reference methods as positive for respiratory pathogens were used for the majority of positive samples. DFA was the reference method for ten analytes; Luminex(TM) xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) was the reference method for rhinovirus. Discrepant results were resolved by positive culture and fluorescent antibody stain and/or laboratory‐developed real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays (LDT). RESULTS: The agreement for most analytes was in concordance with the established reference methods with the exception of Adenovirus. Additionally, the FARP detected several pathogens not previously detected by DFA, and most were confirmed by LDT. Several DFA‐positive analytes were confirmed as true‐negatives by the FARP and LDT. CONCLUSION: FARP overall performed better than DFA with the exception of Adenovirus, making the FARP an attractive alternative to laboratories looking to replace DFA with a rapid, user‐friendly, multiplex molecular assay.

1461,Comparison of the Etiology of Viral Respiratory Illnesses in Inner-City and Suburban Infants,"Background. The risk of developing childhood asthma has been linked to the severity and etiology of viral respiratory illnesses in early childhood. Since inner-city infants have unique environmental exposures, we hypothesized that patterns of respiratory viral infections would also be distinct. Methods. We compared the viral etiology of respiratory illnesses in 2 groups: a cohort of 515 infants from 4 inner-city areas and a cohort of 285 infants from mainly suburban Madison, Wisconsin. Nasal secretions were sampled during periods of respiratory illness and at 1 year of age and were analyzed for viral pathogens by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Results. Overall, inner-city infants had lower rates of viral detection. Considering specific viruses, sick urban infants had lower rates of detectable rhinovirus or respiratory syncytial virus infection and higher rates of adenovirus infection. Every urban site had a higher proportion of adenovirus-positive samples associated with illnesses (10%–21%), compared with Madison (6%). Conclusions. These findings provide evidence that inner-city babies have different patterns of viral respiratory illnesses than babies who grow up in a more suburban location. These findings raise important questions about the etiology of virus-negative illnesses in urban infants and the possibility of long-term consequences of early life infections with adenovirus in this population.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.12955234300000001,-0.08361117700000001,-0.056384632999999997,0.005035436,0.010213556,-0.061932924,0.072928573,-0.029750858999999998,0.036190513,0.035342655,0.012909241,-0.050780541,0.006204526,-0.032336847,0.073572494,0.012006228,0.016917259,-0.077876949,0.054538725,-0.010835553000000001,-0.031246127999999998,-0.08662343900000001,-0.079124156,0.030437400000000003,0.061126467999999996,-0.02340207,0.015161599,0.021000408999999998,-0.002037985,-0.040677767000000004
1465,Prospective Multicenter Study of Children With Bronchiolitis Requiring Mechanical Ventilation,"OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and/or intubation for children with bronchiolitis. METHODS: We performed a 16-center, prospective cohort study of hospitalized children aged <2 years with bronchiolitis. For 3 consecutive years from November 1 until March 31, beginning in 2007, researchers collected clinical data and a nasopharyngeal aspirate from study participants. We oversampled children from the ICU. Samples of nasopharyngeal aspirate were tested by polymerase chain reaction for 18 pathogens. RESULTS: There were 161 children who required CPAP and/or intubation. The median age of the overall cohort was 4 months; 59% were male; 61% white, 24% black, and 36% Hispanic. In the multivariable model predicting CPAP/intubation, the significant factors were: age <2 months (odds ratio [OR] 4.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7–11.5), maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1–1.9), birth weight <5 pounds (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.0–2.6), breathing difficulty began <1 day before admission (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2–2.1), presence of apnea (OR 4.8; 95% CI 2.5–8.5), inadequate oral intake (OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.3–4.3), severe retractions (OR 11.1; 95% CI 2.4–33.0), and room air oxygen saturation <85% (OR 3.3; 95% CI 2.0–4.8). The optimism-corrected c-statistic for the final model was 0.80. CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter study of children hospitalized with bronchiolitis, we identified several demographic, historical, and clinical factors that predicted the use of CPAP and/or intubation, including children born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy. We also identified a novel subgroup of children who required mechanical respiratory support <1 day after respiratory symptoms began.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.192559884,-0.11096470900000001,-0.097923909,-0.075875975,0.026051901000000002,-0.086398929,0.022209825,-0.072065042,0.020199622,-0.13839131699999999,0.016325145,0.07496994400000001,-0.13281432699999998,-0.131658358,-0.09750393,0.16293931,-0.117091079,-0.102492098,0.05541839900000001,-0.048673608,-0.260555128,0.16967705800000002,0.043039182,0.087696598,-0.025694254,-0.029519224,-0.015060292,-0.28555868,-0.069476035,-0.034074438
1467,"Respiratory virus laboratory pandemic planning and surveillance in central Viet Nam, 2008–2010","INTRODUCTION: Laboratory capacity is needed in central Viet Nam to provide early warning to public health authorities of respiratory outbreaks of importance to human health, for example the outbreak of influenza A(H1N1) pandemic in 2009. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedures established as part of a capacity-building process were used to conduct prospective respiratory surveillance in a region where few previous studies have been undertaken. METHODS: Between October 2008 and September 2010, nose and throat swabs from adults and children (approximately 20 per week) presenting with an acute respiratory illness to the Ninh Hoa General Hospital were collected. Same-day PCR testing and result reporting for 13 respiratory viruses were carried out by locally trained scientists. RESULTS: Of 2144 surveillance samples tested, 1235 (57.6%) were positive for at least one virus. The most common were influenza A strains (17.9%), with pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 and seasonal H3N2 strain accounting for 52% and 43% of these, respectively. Other virus detections included: rhinovirus (12.4%), enterovirus (8.9%), influenza B (8.3%), adenovirus (5.3%), parainfluenza (4.7%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (3.9%), human coronavirus (3.0%) and human metapneumovirus (0.3%). The detection rate was greatest in the 0–5 year age group. Viral co-infections were identified in 148 (6.9%) cases. DISCUSSION: The outbreak in 2009 of the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic strain provided a practical test of the laboratory’s pandemic plan. This study shows that the availability of appropriate equipment and molecular-based testing can contribute to important individual and public health outcomes in geographical locations susceptible to emerging infections.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.244929019,-0.08586092,-0.039792962,0.20643109899999998,0.050610758,0.210645732,-0.115024464,-0.008673891,0.019277487,-0.052657639000000006,0.014807876999999999,0.00233951,0.039609377,-0.06398278,0.048338365,-0.031830604,-0.008093386,-0.013235196000000001,-0.006446305,-0.059812199,0.029665986000000002,-0.024749935,-0.04210565,-0.053002678,-0.014122688999999999,0.041780693,-0.020127031,0.081222752,0.00359982,0.021865137000000003
1474,"Clinical Features and Outcome of 65 Laboratory Confirmed Cases of H1N1 in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman","OBJECTIVES: Responding to Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) virus alert in 2009, Ministry of Health (MoH), Sultanate Of Oman arranged task force to deal with the emergency. MOH published articles in newspapers, prepared guidelines and hospitals were assigned to admit patients of H1N1. All the patients suspected of H1N1 were admitted and isolated as per the guidelines. This report describes clinical features and outcomes of 65 laboratory confirmed cases of H1N1 in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. METHODS: From July to October 2009, 101 cases suspected of suffering from Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) virus were admitted and isolated in Al Nahdha Hospital in Muscat. All the patients on admission were tested for H1N1, by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Immediately on admission, all of them were treated with Oseltamivir and antibiotics. RESULTS: Of the 65 confirmed cases of H1N1, 53.84% were males. Age of patients varied from 14 to 60 years, while 53.7% were aged between 31 to 55 years. Results showed that 70.8% had underlying co-morbidity; among which diabetes mellitus and respiratory illness were common. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (95%) and cough (94%). Also, 20% of the patients had leucopenia and 10.8% leucocytosis. Deranged LFT was observed in 26 (42.6%) of cases while 14 (21.5%) had hypokalemia. One patient (0.01%) with underlying severe co-morbidity died. Two patients (3.1%) had ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome); both recovered. Radiological infiltration was documented in 84.6% of cases, with lower zone involvement as the common finding. Hospital stay was between 1 to 12 days, 49.2% of patients were discharged within 3 days. CONCLUSION: Mainly adult population was affected during this epidemic. H1N1 infection can lead to severe illness. Incidence of H1N1 was higher in patients with underlying co-morbidity.

1475,A Preliminary Study of Pneumonia Etiology Among Hospitalized Children in Kenya,"Background. Pneumonia is the leading cause of childhood death in the developing world. Higher-quality etiological data are required to reduce this mortality burden. Methods. We conducted a case-control study of pneumonia etiology among children aged 1–59 months in rural Kenya. Case patients were hospitalized with World Health Organization–defined severe pneumonia (SP) or very severe pneumonia (VSP); controls were outpatient children without pneumonia. We collected blood for culture, induced sputum for culture and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and obtained oropharyngeal swab specimens for multiplex PCR from case patients, and serum for serology and nasopharyngeal swab specimens for multiplex PCR from case patients and controls. Results. Of 984 eligible case patients, 810 (84%) were enrolled in the study; 232 (29%) had VSP. Blood cultures were positive in 52 of 749 case patients (7%). A predominant potential pathogen was identified in sputum culture in 70 of 417 case patients (17%). A respiratory virus was detected by PCR from nasopharyngeal swab specimens in 486 of 805 case patients (60%) and 172 of 369 controls (47%). Only respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) showed a statistically significant association between virus detection in the nasopharynx and pneumonia hospitalization (odds ratio, 12.5; 95% confidence interval, 3.1–51.5). Among 257 case patients in whom all specimens (excluding serum specimens) were collected, bacteria were identified in 24 (9%), viruses in 137 (53%), mixed viral and bacterial infection in 39 (15%), and no pathogen in 57 (22%); bacterial causes outnumbered viral causes when the results of the case-control analysis were considered. Conclusions. A potential etiology was detected in >75% of children admitted with SP or VSP. Except for RSV, the case-control analysis did not detect an association between viral detection in the nasopharynx and hospitalization for pneumonia.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.277579512,-0.053640698,-0.08656478199999999,-0.064466678,-0.038271171,-0.106897295,-0.057098995,0.070398278,-0.1381854,0.04645295,-0.015476405,-0.024353719,-0.03356803,0.024327482,-0.072866227,-0.026209422000000003,-0.00306773,0.023347724,-0.029170098,-0.004688409,-0.041035235,0.1220172,0.09030359800000001,-0.012589467,0.017605536,0.018109661000000003,0.072190018,-0.014641063000000001,-0.045654749,-0.015386491

1498,Viral Infection in Acute Exacerbation of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,"Rationale: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive, uniformly fatal interstitial lung disease. An acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is an episode of acute respiratory worsening without an identifiable etiology. Occult viral infection has been proposed as a possible cause of acute exacerbation. Objectives: To use unbiased genomics-based discovery methods to define the role of viruses in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Methods: Bronchoalveolar lavage and serum from patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, stable disease, and acute lung injury were tested for viral nucleic acid using multiplex polymerase chain reaction, pan-viral microarray, and high-throughput cDNA sequencing. Measurements and Main Results: Four of forty-three patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis had evidence of common respiratory viral infection (parainfluenza [n = 1], rhinovirus [n = 2], coronavirus [n = 1]); no viruses were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage from stable patients. Pan-viral microarrays revealed additional evidence of viral infection (herpes simplex virus [n = 1], Epstein-Barr virus [n = 2], and torque teno virus [TTV] [n = 12]) in patients with acute exacerbation. TTV infection was significantly more common in patients with acute exacerbation than stable controls (P = 0.0003), but present in a similar percentage of acute lung injury controls. Deep sequencing of a subset of acute exacerbation cases confirmed the presence of TTV but did not identify additional viruses. Conclusions: Viral infection was not detected in most cases of acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. TTV was present in a significant minority of cases, and cases of acute lung injury; the clinical significance of this finding remains to be determined.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.094580555,-0.027126683,-0.071357013,-0.077202896,-0.047668429000000005,-0.02897016,0.013835136000000001,0.017521185,-0.068321219,0.066387504,-0.031490661,-0.030237291,0.041867075,0.027064535,0.019482555,-0.009936193000000001,0.016192938,-0.025723221,-0.0037136540000000003,0.018895883999999998,0.035430621,-0.08674951300000001,-0.064416745,0.035328561,-0.008428563,0.040363025,-0.043270317,0.011427989,-8.7e-05,0.04271642

This study investigated whether virus–virus or virus–Bordetella co-infections are more frequent or more severe than previously recognized. METHODS: This is a 3-year prospective study of children younger than 24 months hospitalized with a febrile respiratory illness. Viral pathogens were detected using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunoassays, and/or viral cultures from nasopharyngeal samples. Bordetella infections were detected by PCR. RESULTS: A total of 201 patients were enrolled. Respiratory viruses were detected in 187 (93%) patients, with 52 (28%) multipathogen infections. The most common viruses detected were respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus/enterovirus.

Patients presenting with malaria-like symptoms within 4 days of fever onset were enrolled in the study. Plasmodium parasitemia was determined by blood smear microscopy. Nasal swabs were screened for a panel of respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction. Influenza A, rhinoviruses, and other respiratory viruses were detected in 18%, 26%, and 12% of 197 specimens, respectively. Four of 36 patients with influenza A had a positive malaria blood slide, compared with 20 of 52 patients with rhinovirus.

1512,Persistence of Adenovirus Nucleic Acids in Nasopharyngeal Secretions: A Diagnostic Conundrum,"BACKGROUND: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays increase the rate of viral detection in clinical specimens, compared with conventional virologic methods. Studies suggest that PCR may detect virus nucleic acid (NA) that persists in the respiratory tract. METHODS: We analyzed virologic data from children having frequent upper respiratory infections (URI) who were followed in a longitudinal study. Nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) were collected at URI onset and when acute otitis media (AOM) was diagnosed; virus studies were performed using conventional diagnostics and PCR. Repeated presence of adenovirus by PCR was further studied by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Of 581 URI episodes in 76 children, 510 viruses were detected. Of the viruses detected by PCR, 15% were those detected previously; repeated positives occurred most frequently with adenovirus. Sequencing results were available in 13 children with repeated adenovirus detection; four patterns of infection were identified (16 instances): 1) adenovirus of the same serotype and strain detected continuously (n=8 instances), 2) adenovirus of different serotypes detected during sequential URI episodes (n=3), 3) adenovirus of the same serotype but different strains detected during sequential URI episodes (n=3) and 4) adenovirus of the same serotype and strain detected intermittently (n=2). CONCLUSIONS: Among children with frequent URIs, repeated positive PCR results for adenovirus NA may represent a new serotype/strain, or persistence of viral NA.

1519,Viral shedding and clinical illness in naturally acquired influenza virus infections,"BACKGROUND: Volunteer challenge studies have provided detailed data on viral shedding from the respiratory tract before and through the course of experimental influenza virus infection. There are no comparable quantitative data on naturally-acquired infections. METHODS: In a community-based study in Hong Kong in 2008, we followed up initially well individuals to quantify trends in viral shedding based on culture and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) through the course of illness associated with seasonal influenza A and B virus infection. RESULTS: Trends in symptom scores more closely matched changes in molecular viral loads measured by RT-PCR for influenza A than influenza B. For influenza A virus infections, replicating viral loads measured by culture declined to undetectable levels earlier after illness onset than molecular viral loads. Most viral shedding occurred during the first 2–3 days after illness onset and we estimated that 1–8% of infectiousness occurs prior to illness onset. Only 14% of infections with detectable shedding by RT-PCR were asymptomatic, and viral shedding was low in these cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that ‘silent spreaders’ (i.e. individuals who are infectious while asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic) may be less important in the spread of influenza epidemics than previously thought.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.137479499,-0.050449553,0.005883648000000001,0.121108396,-0.044021579000000005,0.14656457,-0.063803837,-0.021378069,-0.006446161999999999,-0.046489372,0.06946311200000001,-0.060617881,0.039525071,0.05033223,0.006839106,-0.009293193,0.007774407,-0.01292904,-0.042187925999999994,-0.026149025,-0.051354899,0.008205255,-0.062283929,0.018915776000000002,-0.001839261,-0.00104011,0.051321717999999995,-0.049732824,0.04565235,0.052042245
1521,"Effects of oseltamivir treatment on duration of clinical illness and viral shedding, and household transmission of influenza virus","BACKGROUND: Large clinical trials have demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of oseltamivir against influenza. Here we assessed its indirect effectiveness in reducing household secondary transmission in an incident cohort of influenza index cases and their household members. METHODS: We recruited index outpatients whose rapid tests for influenza were positive in 2007 and 2008. Household contacts were followed for 7–10 days during 3–4 home visits to monitor symptoms. Nose and throat swabs were collected and tested for influenza by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or viral culture. RESULTS: We followed 384 index cases and their household contacts. Index cases who took oseltamivir within 24 hours of symptom onset halved the time to symptom alleviation (adjusted acceleration factor (AF) 0.56; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.76). Oseltamivir treatment was not associated with statistically significant reduction in the duration of viral shedding. Household contacts of index cases who had taken oseltamivir within 24 hours of onset had a non-statistically significant lower risk of developing laboratory-confirmed infection (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.54; 95% CI: 0.11, 2.57) and a marginally statistically significant lower risk of clinical illness (adjusted OR 0.52; 95% CI: 0.25, 1.08) compared to contacts of index cases who did not take oseltamivir. CONCLUSIONS: Oseltamivir treatment is effective in reducing the duration of symptoms but evidence for household reduction in transmission of influenza virus was inconclusive.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.118929812,-0.039735942,-0.037124334,-0.00462805,-0.048969967,0.135255256,-0.078149485,0.048463375999999996,-0.025711007,-0.114035046,0.037448849,0.047296307999999995,-0.059894472000000004,-0.035009931,-0.025802539,0.07963566700000001,-0.055900837,-0.028430156,0.017460065,-0.045665217,-0.116793491,0.037229354,-0.06388774900000001,0.0047426429999999995,-0.026156124,0.004983077,0.011951025,-0.107216295,-0.029165697,0.014344353
1522,The Diagnosis of Viral Respiratory Disease in Older Adults,"Viral respiratory disease in older adults has been increasingly recognized as a significant cause of hospitalizations and death. Unfortunately, the recognition and diagnosis of infection due to many viral respiratory pathogens in older adults can be elusive due to atypical clinical presentations and the insensitivity of current laboratory diagnostic tests in this population. For influenza diagnosis, rapid antigen tests followed by viral culture if negative, can be useful in older adults as long as clinicians are mindful of test limitations. Although specific, rapid antigen tests are insensitive in this population. Erroneous negative results may lead to delays in timely administration of antiviral treatment and institution of appropriate isolation precautions. The increasing availability of new rapid and sensitive molecular diagnostics such as polymerase chain reaction testing, should provide more accurate and timely diagnoses of viral respiratory infections in older adults in the near future.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.11368303199999999,-0.022093931,0.020740803999999998,0.045524477,-0.09212904400000001,0.039964319,0.032287017,0.025275966,0.014696764,0.066112079,-0.015183918999999999,-0.017336136000000002,0.095466779,-0.06324597700000001,0.01595338,-0.016151213,-0.026594846000000002,0.047544315,-0.057123493,-0.000525389,-0.013196601,-0.062563297,0.004639962,-0.088154421,0.036278796,-0.025467782999999997,-0.010372662,-0.053392040999999994,0.008479696,0.04495789
1535,Detection of Four Human Coronaviruses in Respiratory Infections in Children: A One-Year Study in Colorado,"Lower respiratory tract infections are the leading cause of death in children worldwide. Studies on the epidemiology and clinical associations of the four human non-SARS human coronaviruses (HCoVs) using sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are needed to evaluate the clinical significance of HCoV infections worldwide. Pediatric respiratory specimens (1,683) submitted to a diagnostic virology laboratory over a 1-year period (December 2004–November 2005) that were negative for seven respiratory viruses by conventional methods were tested for RNA of four HCoVs using sensitive RT-PCR assays. Coronavirus RNAs were detected in 84 (5.0%) specimens: HCoV-NL63 in 37 specimens, HCoV-OC43 in 34, HCoV-229E in 11, and HCoV-HKU1 in 2. The majority of HCoV infections occurred during winter months, and over 62% were in previously healthy children. Twenty-six (41%) coronavirus positive patients had evidence of a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), 17 (26%) presented with vomiting and/or diarrhea, and 5 (8%) presented with meningoencephalitis or seizures. Respiratory specimens from one immunocompromised patient were persistently positive for HCoV-229E RNA for 3 months. HCoV-NL63-positive patients were nearly twice as likely to be hospitalized (P = 0.02) and to have a LRTI (P = 0.04) than HCoV-OC43-positive patients. HCoVs are associated with a small, but significant number (at least 2.4% of total samples submitted), of both upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses in children in Colorado. Our data raise the possibility that HCoV may play a role in gastrointestinal and CNS disease. Additional studies are needed to investigate the potential roles of HCoVs in these diseases.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.196367034,-0.015264892,-0.090679072,0.023160486,0.16275333,-0.165348184,0.081128281,-0.072372552,0.134273364,-0.07590992,-0.020248354,0.423507649,0.365514049,0.229737544,0.029479027,0.069837176,-0.054838245,-0.028858005,-0.069912579,0.012767368000000001,-0.031100285,-0.020710103,0.028040133,-0.101565542,0.008311022,-0.020971818,0.047976258,-0.030008128,0.046059916,0.035014747
1544,Another Piece of the Puzzle: Human Metapneumovirus Infections in Adults,"BACKGROUND: Each winter respiratory viruses account for a significant proportion of serious respiratory illness, including hospitalization, in older adults and those with underlying medical conditions. We describe the incidence and clinical impact of human Metapneumovirus (hMPV), a newly identified virus, in adults. METHODS: hMPV infection was identified in three prospectively enrolled adult cohorts (young persons age 19-40, healthy adults ≥ 65 years, and high-risk adults) and a hospitalized cohort over 4 consecutive winters. The incidence and clinical impact was compared to influenza A and Respiratory Syncytial Virus infection in the same groups. RESULTS: Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serology hMPV infection was identified in 2.2-10.5% of the three prospectively followed outpatient cohorts annually. Asymptomatic infection was common, accounting for at least 40% of infections in each of the cohorts. Symptoms, when they did occur, were typical of an upper respiratory illness although a few high-risk persons required hospitalization. Among 1386 hospitalized subjects, hMPV was identified in 8.5%, ranging from 4.3% to 13.2% depending upon the year. Dual viral infection was identified in 22.9%. Wheezing was frequent (80%) and more common than with influenza. Twelve percent required intensive care unit admission and 11% ventilatory support, rates similar to influenza and RSV infection. CONCLUSION: hMPV is a common infection in adults of all ages, and although often asymptomatic, can result in serious infection requiring hospitalization. Like influenza A and RSV, hMPV is also a major contributor to the burden of winter-time respiratory illnesses in older adults.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.257706387,-0.129027532,-0.09937904199999999,0.104302559,0.025401017,-0.017587151999999998,-0.014636581000000001,-0.075907028,0.143377555,-0.10157037199999999,0.025198373,-0.05532077,-0.089259991,0.0005294340000000001,-0.114219776,-0.029128027999999997,-0.01227071,0.18180600100000002,-0.12364489,0.079326185,0.11981074900000001,-0.043439094000000004,-0.01370603,-0.093339966,0.00352413,-0.040249133,-0.10335159699999999,-0.057766609000000003,0.009580995,0.009692217

Routine culture tests were inconclusive, however, pneumococcal infection was suspected and the putative outbreak was investigated using non-culture methods. Clinical samples from ten patients were tested by pneumococcal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), or Binax NOW(®) pneumococcal urine antigen test and serotype-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Lung samples from the deceased patients were PCR positive and yielded different MLST types. Two patients in one family group were serotype 1 pneumococcal antigen positive. Two further patients were serotype 1 antigen positive, and one serotype 4 positive. Two antigen-positive cases were also serum PCR positive. Non-culture methods confirmed the disease aetiology in six cases.

1585,Surveillance of respiratory virus infections in adult hospital admissions using rapid methods,"Both influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cause epidemics of respiratory illness of variable severity during the winter season. Influenza in particular has been blamed for hospital winter bed pressures, although it is thought that RSV may also play a role. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a new respiratory virus reported to be important in children; only a limited number of studies are available for adult populations. We aimed to determine initially the burden of virologically confirmed infections, i.e. influenza, RSV and hMPV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology and, in addition, to assess the feasibility of this approach as a surveillance tool for these respiratory viruses. Adult patients admitted to hospital in the previous 24 hours with onset of acute respiratory symptoms in the last 14 days were asked to participate. Informed written consent was obtained and nose and throat swabs taken. Multiplex PCR for influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), influenza B and RSV A and B were carried out together with a separate PCR for hMPV. A total of 219 patients in 2001–2002 and 216 in 2002–2003 were tested and the combined results for both seasons were: 8 positive for influenza A/H1N1, 14 for influenza A/H3N2, 2 for influenza B, 14 for RSV A and 6 for RSV B. Most patients (261/435) were >65 years and most positives (30/44) were found within this age group. A number of patients aged >65 years who were positive for influenza (12/15) reported having had vaccine. In total, 373 samples were tested for hMPV and 20 were found positive across all age groups except the 45–54 years age group. As influenza activity was low during the study period the impact of infection on admissions could not be assessed. Nevertheless the viruses studied accounted for 15% of hospital admissions for respiratory infection. Most patients were aged >65 years, as expected. In the two years studied RSV and hMPV were each responsible for as many hospitalized cases of respiratory infection as influenza. Influenza infection must be considered even in those who give a history of vaccination. The molecular methods used in this study showed that surveillance of these respiratory viruses can be conducted and may help in the management of patients.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.382029739,-0.173753233,-0.142197629,0.242221009,0.037393146,0.143269635,-0.152603806,-0.062957369,0.046567863,-0.151742665,0.039240284,-0.051010288,-0.125152206,0.035063292,-0.12975446699999998,-0.045456171,0.018320358999999998,0.152735412,-0.076594467,0.035896238999999996,0.115206675,-0.090989847,0.021695727999999997,-0.14236178300000002,-0.005722911999999999,-0.095335073,-0.020616227,0.012401282,-0.035358312,0.03627658

1590,Aetiological role of viral and bacterial infections in acute adult lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are a common reason for consulting general practitioners (GPs). In most cases the aetiology is unknown, yet most result in an antibiotic prescription. The aetiology of LRTI was investigated in a prospective controlled study. METHODS: Eighty adults presenting to GPs with acute LRTI were recruited together with 49 controls over 12 months. Throat swabs, nasal aspirates (patients and controls), and sputum (patients) were obtained and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) assays were used to detect Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, influenza viruses (AH1, AH3 and B), parainfluenza viruses 1–3, coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, and enteroviruses. Standard sputum bacteriology was also performed. Outcome was recorded at a follow up visit. RESULTS: Potential pathogens were identified in 55 patients with LRTI (69%) and seven controls (14%; p<0.0001). The identification rate was 63% (viruses) and 26% (bacteria) for patients and 12% (p<0.0001) and 6% (p = 0.013), respectively, for controls. The most common organisms identified in the patients were rhinoviruses (33%), influenza viruses (24%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (19%) compared with 2% (p<0.001), 6% (p = 0.013), and 4% (p = 0.034), respectively, in controls. Multiple pathogens were identified in 18 of the 80 LRTI patients (22.5%) and in two of the 49 controls (4%; p = 0.011). Atypical organisms were rarely identified. Cases with bacterial aetiology were clinically indistinguishable from those with viral aetiology. CONCLUSION: Patients presenting to GPs with acute adult LRTI predominantly have a viral illness which is most commonly caused by rhinoviruses and influenza viruses.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.22373426899999999,-0.072033609,-0.073797297,-0.0050866999999999996,-0.021274665,-0.02727343,-0.044918652999999996,0.0574307,-0.16114973300000002,0.064368127,-0.040911447999999996,-0.02523921,0.009419921,0.022094392999999997,-0.039546486,-0.042330147,0.032539571,-0.022697286,0.009887672,-0.009441394,0.0038777729999999997,0.033607755,0.08388379900000001,0.053873205,0.018571503,0.037418164,0.013969917,0.023022234,0.059991727,-0.021406029
1595,Human Metapneumovirus: An Important Cause of Respiratory Disease in Children and Adults,"Human metapneumovirus is a paramyxovirus that was discovered in 2001 in the Netherlands. Epidemiologic studies have shown it to be a major cause of acute respiratory tract disease in normal infants and children worldwide, with a seasonal occurrence and spectrum of clinical illness most similar to the closely related respiratory syncytial virus. The greatest prevalence of severe disease requiring hospitalization in otherwise healthy children appears to be in those aged between 6 and 12 months, older than the peak age of hospitalizations for respiratory syncytial virus. Human metapneumovirus is also a significant cause of acute respiratory disease in adults, particularly the elderly and those with comorbid conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and cancer. Because there is no rapid diagnostic assay, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction is most widely used.

1603,Quantitation of Adenovirus Genome During Acute Infection in Normal Children,"BACKGROUND: Adenovirus infection causes a wide range of clinical illness in normal children. New molecular techniques allow quantitation of viral genome to study the natural history of adenovirus infection and viral load in normal children. METHODS: Clinical samples were collected from 38 previously healthy, febrile children, and viral cultures were performed. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect adenovirus genome and to determine viral load. Adenovirus isolates were genotyped with a PCR-based assay. RESULTS: Adenovirus culture was positive in 6 children who were diagnosed with acute adenovirus infection. Throat swabs contained high copy numbers of adenovirus genome (1.6 × 10(6)–6 × 10(7) copies/swab) from 4 of 4 adenovirus culture-positive children. Only 2 of 32 adenovirus culture-negative children had detectable adenovirus genome from throat swabs, but with a lower copy number (8 × 10(2) copies/swab). Adenovirus genome was not detected in blood samples from 5 of 6 adenovirus culture-positive children with uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection and from all adenovirus culture-negative children. High level viremia (1.8 × 10(8)/ml) was detected in an adenovirus culture-positive 6-month-old infant with fever, pneumonia, conjunctivitis and hepatitis. Subsequent reduction in viral load paralleled her clinical recovery. Adenovirus viruria (1 × 10(9) copies/ml) with normal urinanalysis was detected in another adenovirus culture-positive child. All 6 adenovirus isolates were genotyped as adenovirus type 7h. CONCLUSION: Viral load assessment in clinical samples determined by quantitative PCR can be useful in the diagnosis of adenovirus infection in immunocompetent, febrile children.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.145797948,-0.063450861,0.012124903999999999,-0.018116136,0.034906593,-0.113740533,0.062019727999999996,-0.061308915,0.022400622999999998,0.009238317,0.013287741,-0.069084804,-0.021137647000000002,-0.026136066,0.048267977000000004,-0.043816432999999995,-0.055789237,-0.02266475,0.025743817999999998,-0.09620332300000001,-0.027878893999999998,0.202488358,0.027065167999999997,0.005631335,-0.11928300900000001,0.048373387000000004,0.00832079,0.049262726,-0.06632799,0.019460073
1625,Interferon-gamma levels in nasopharyngeal secretions of infants with respiratory syncytial virus and other respiratory viral infections,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, one of the most common causes of hospitalization of children in developed countries, has been implicated as a cause of asthma. We aimed to characterize the cytokine profile in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) taken from infants during upper respiratory tract infection to investigate whether RSV induced a unique immune response as compared with other viruses. Additionally, we sought to determine whether this profile was influenced by the infants' atopic status. A prospective birth cohort of babies at high risk of atopy was recruited. Ratios of a T-helper 1 (Th1) cytokine, interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and a T-helper 2 (Th2)-like cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL-10), in NPAs were determined during episodes of respiratory tract infections in the first year. The viral aetiology of the respiratory tract infections was determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture and immunofluorescence. Atopic status was ascertained at 1 year of age using skin prick tests. Participants were recruited antenatally and subsequently followed in the community. Sixty babies with one or both parents atopic were enrolled into the study. IFN-γ : IL-10 ratios in NPAs during upper respiratory tract infections and their correlation with viral aetiology and atopic status were the main outcome measures. The mean IFN-γ : IL-10 ratio was significantly lower (due to lower IFN-γ) during RSV infections than during infections with other viruses (P = 0·035). The cytokine ratio, however, did not differ between infants with or without wheeze during URTIs (P = 0·44), or between infants who were atopic or non-atopic (P = 0·49). This study suggests that RSV is associated with lower IFN-γ production in young babies, regardless of their atopic status, compared to upper respiratory tract infections where either another virus is detected or where no viral identification is made.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.136605855,-0.104598765,-0.059358997000000004,-0.027322508,-0.02009604,-0.067403447,0.077416178,-0.076933618,0.120811518,-0.026857772999999998,0.013920904,-0.08050496900000001,-0.041118393999999996,0.0017512379999999998,0.002773652,0.021132696,0.0009289410000000001,-0.044759213,0.040516386,-0.018438585,-0.001796487,-0.14470563,-0.005531971,0.014785423,0.041758956,-0.08400439900000001,0.095003665,0.008196700999999999,0.024307956000000002,-0.025409522
1631,Synergism between allergens and viruses and risk of hospital admission with asthma: case-control study,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the importance of sensitisation and exposure to allergens and viral infection in precipitating acute asthma in adults resulting in admission to hospital. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Large district general hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 60 patients aged 17-50 admitted to hospital over a year with acute asthma, matched with two controls: patients with stable asthma recruited from the outpatient department and patients admitted to hospital with non-respiratory conditions (inpatient controls). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Atopic status (skin testing and total and specific IgE), presence of common respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria (polymerase chain reaction), dust samples from homes, and exposure to allergens (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA): Der p 1, Fel d 1, Can f 1, and Bla g 2). RESULTS: Viruses were detected in 31 of 177 patients. The difference in the frequency of viruses detected between the groups was significant (admitted with asthma 26%, stable asthma 18%, inpatient controls 9%; P=0.04). A significantly higher proportion of patients admitted with asthma (66%) were sensitised and exposed to either mite, cat, or dog allergen than patients with stable asthma (37%) and inpatient controls (15%; P<0.001). Being sensitised and exposed to allergens was an independent associate of the group admitted to hospital (odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 5.4; P=0.05), whereas the combination of sensitisation, high exposure to one or more allergens, and viral detection considerably increased the risk of being admitted with asthma (8.4, 2.1 to 32.8; P=0.002).

1636,Clinical diagnosis of influenza virus infection: evaluation of diagnostic tools in general practice.,"BACKGROUND: With the development of new antiviral agents for influenza, the urge for rapid and reliable diagnosis of influenza becomes increasingly important. Respiratory virus infections are difficult to distinguish on clinical grounds. General practitioners (GPs) however, still depend on their clinical judgement. AIM: To evaluate the importance of clinical symptoms in the diagnosis of influenza virus infection. DESIGN OF STUDY: A multicentre questionnaire study. SETTING: Eighty-one patients from 14 general practices. METHOD: Patients with fever and at least one constitutional symptom and one respiratory symptom were included. A questionnaire with the medical history and clinical symptoms was completed and a combined nose-throat swab was taken. Virus culture, rapid culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification were performed on each specimen. Multivariate analysis was used to obtain the best predictive model. RESULTS: By using PCR, an increase was seen in the detection of the viral pathogens compared with the results of culture. In 42 out of 81 patients PCR was positive for influenza. A positive predictive value (PPV) of 75% was observed for the combination of headache at onset, feverishness at onset, cough, and vaccination status during the period of increase influenza activity. Criteria used by the ICHPPC-2 resulted in a PPV of 54%. The PPV for diagnosis made by the GP was 76%. CONCLUSION: Although influenza is difficult to diagnose on clinical grounds, the GPs in this study were able to diagnose influenza as such more accurately on their judgement than by the other criteria.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.212495568,-0.044607825,0.017111733,0.136242102,-0.082299289,0.18582073300000002,-0.132921021,0.038585004,-0.092975117,0.002156406,-0.0018508420000000001,-0.012451735,0.055001379,0.015714644,-0.004373981,-0.007038261,0.032510982,0.027104779,0.014756574,-0.041379624,0.018243166,-0.052192019000000006,0.013926893999999999,-0.074855219,-0.002077525,0.002665704,-0.023164007,-0.03469406,-0.009077619,0.034275118
1672,Prospective case-control study of role of infection in patients who reconsult after initial antibiotic treatment for lower respiratory tract infection in primary care.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess direct and indirect evidence of active infection which may benefit from further antibiotics in adults who reconsult within 4 weeks of initial antibiotic management of acute lower respiratory tract infection in primary care. DESIGN: Observational study with a nested case-control group. SETTING: Two suburban general practices in Arnold, Nottingham, over 7 winter months. SUBJECTS: 367 adults aged 16 years and over fulfilling a definition of lower respiratory tract infection and treated with antibiotics. 74 (20%) patients who reconsulted within 4 weeks for the same symptoms and 82 ""control"" patients who did not were investigated in detail at fallow up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Direct and indirect evidence of active infection at the time of the reconsultation or the follow up visit with the research nurse for the controls. Investigations performed included sputum culture, pneumococcal antigen detection, serial serology for viral and atypical pathogens and C reactive protein, throat swabs for detecting viral and atypical pathogens by culture and polymerase chain reaction, and chest radiographs. RESULTS: Demographic and clinical features of the groups were similar. Two thirds of the 74 patients who reconsulted received another antibiotic because the general practitioner suspected continuing infection. Any evidence of infection warranting antibiotic treatment was uncommon at reconsultation. The findings for the two groups were similar for the occurrence of identified pathogens; chest x ray changes of infection (present in 13%); and C reactive protein concentrations, which had nearly all fallen towards normal. Only three patients in the reconsultation group had concentrations > or = 40 mg/l. Pathogens identified at follow up in the 156 patients in both groups included ampicillin sensitive bacteria in six. Atypical infections diagnosed in 27 (Chlamydia pneumoniae in 22) and viral infections in 54 had probably been present at the initial presentation. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that active infection, which may benefit from further antibiotics, is uncommon in patients who reconsult after a lower respiratory tract infection, and a repeat antibiotic prescription should be the exception rather than the rule. Other factors, such as patients' perception of their illness, may be more important than disease and infection in their decision to reconsult.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.20105480399999998,-0.041163562,-0.11086705300000001,-0.108916048,-0.075527149,-0.07279948900000001,-0.016944518999999998,0.07276115,-0.092634569,0.081731548,-0.037310681,-0.021155852000000003,0.021306769,0.049398200999999996,-0.035413011,-0.04125197,0.029983411,0.039473204,0.005210569,0.057305377000000005,0.027634203,-0.069966611,-0.018538338,-0.049233259,0.038652941,0.013210531000000001,-0.003353821,-0.021798562999999996,-0.007522295,0.004483512
1689,Community study of role of viral infections in exacerbations of asthma in 9-11 year old children.,"OBJECTIVE--To study the association between upper and lower respiratory viral infections and acute exacerbations of asthma in schoolchildren in the community. DESIGN--Community based 13 month longitudinal study using diary card respiratory symptom and peak expiratory flow monitoring to allow early sampling for viruses. SUBJECTS--108 Children aged 9-11 years who had reported wheeze or cough, or both, in a questionnaire. SETTING--Southampton and surrounding community. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Upper and lower respiratory viral infections detected by polymerase chain reaction or conventional methods, reported exacerbations of asthma, computer identified episodes of respiratory tract symptoms or peak flow reductions. RESULTS--Viruses were detected in 80% of reported episodes of reduced peak expiratory flow, 80% of reported episodes of wheeze, and in 85% of reported episodes of upper respiratory symptoms, cough, wheeze, and a fall in peak expiratory flow. The median duration of reported falls in peak expiratory flow was 14 days, and the median maximum fall in peak expiratory flow was 81 l/min. The most commonly identified virus type was rhinovirus.

1757,FilmArray Respiratory Panel Integrated in a field Point Of Care dispositive for the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections in rural areas in Senegal,"The development of molecular syndrome-based kits for the diagnosis of respiratory infections offers rapid and sensitive detection of common respiratory pathogens and will have a significant impact on the care of patients. In this study, we present the results obtained after the introduction of the FilmArray respiratory panel in a field Point of care (POC) for the diagnosis of virus and bacteria responsible of respiratory tract infections in Senegal rural area. From February to August 2017, we collected nasal swabs from febrile patients that presented symptoms of respiratory tract infections in three health posts located in Niakhar. Specimens were tested on site by multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), using the FilmArray respiratory panel(R) that targets 20 pathogens, including 17 virus and 3 bacteria (bioMerieux). Nasal swabs were collected from 113 patients. The median age was 4 years (ranging from 4 months to 60 years) and 51 (45%) were males. The prevalence of respiratory pathogens was 37.5% (12/32) during the dry season and 54.3% (44/81) in the rainy season (p=0.16). The prevalence of respiratory pathogen carriage was higher in children under 5 years of age (38/55, 69.1%). The most prevalent micro-organisms detected were influenza B virus (16/113, 14%), human rhinovirus/enterovirus (10/113, 9%), parainfluenzae virus (9/113, 8%), respiratory syncytial virus (8/113, 7%), adenovirus (5/113, 4%), human metapneumovirus (3/113, 3%), Chlamydia pneumoniae (2/113, 2%) and Coronavirus (2/113, 2%). The study has demonstrated that the integration of the FilmArray respiratory panel into a field POC could significantly improve the management of respiratory tract infections in rural areas.\n\nAuthor summaryRespiratory tract infections are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Populations in underdeveloped countries are the most affected, especially children under 5 years of age. Among the pathogens responsible for these infections, bacteria and viruses are the most identified. In poor countries, laboratory diagnosis can only be done in urban areas. They are generally based on bacteriological, immunological or molecular biology techniques. The concept of POC is not developed in underdeveloped countries. Its existence would have made it possible to carry out RDTs to confirm the clinicians diagnosis and allow rapid management of the patient. In the current situation, the time required to achieve results is often very long for patients. In this study, we sought to demonstrate the significant contribution of the FilmArray respiratory panel in the management of respiratory tract infections in rural areas. We also wanted to reduce the time it takes to deliver results in order to improve patient care. This dispositif was integrated in a field POC which was implemented in Niakhar since 2015, in order to improve the management of emerging diseases. The FilmArray respiratory panel gave us the opportunity to investigate the causes of respiratory tract infections in this area. For each patient, we systematically target 20 pathogens, including 17 viruses and 3 bacteria, with a single multiplex PCR. One of the main results of this study is that children under 5 years of age are the most affected by respiratory tract infections. Then we noted a lack of consultation among adults that could be explained by the banalization of respiratory problems or a preference for traditional care. The fact that children under 5 years of age are the most affected could also serve as a basis for implementing vaccination programmes directly targeting the most vulnerable age groups. It should be noted that for 51% of patients, the result of the diagnosis was negative. It would appear that some pathogens responsible for respiratory tract infections are not targeted by the multiplex PCR. Thus, it would be necessary to screen these pathogens in order to integrate them into a panel that would cover the most pathogens in circulation in this area.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.27367418,-0.072696291,-0.047706105,0.06264604900000001,0.010783491999999999,-0.08443024,0.040688449,0.004159309,0.029705129,0.10102258900000001,-0.021420724,-0.023553822000000002,0.084954468,-0.058808902999999996,0.045839923,-0.036578654,0.007729764,-0.033092773,0.049166372,0.011010226000000001,0.005799659,-0.060685153,0.03101463,-0.055321662,0.060212334000000006,0.019912712,-0.05709865,0.00338388,0.047207489000000005,-0.09143332300000001
1781,Clinical characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in China,"Background: Since December 2019, acute respiratory disease (ARD) due to 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. We sought to delineate the clinical characteristics of these cases. Methods: We extracted the data on 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/provincial municipalities through January 29th, 2020. Results: The median age was 47.0 years, and 41.90% were females. Only 1.18% of patients had a direct contact with wildlife, whereas 31.30% had been to Wuhan and 71.80% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%) were the most common symptoms. Diarrhea is uncommon. The median incubation period was 3.0 days (range, 0 to 24.0 days). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (50.00%). Significantly more severe cases were diagnosed by symptoms plus reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction without abnormal radiological findings than non-severe cases (23.87% vs. 5.20%, P<0.001). Lymphopenia was observed in 82.1% of patients. 55 patients (5.00%) were admitted to intensive care unit and 15 (1.36%) succumbed. Severe pneumonia was independently associated with either the admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death in multivariate competing-risk model (sub-distribution hazards ratio, 9.80; 95% confidence interval, 4.06 to 23.67). Conclusions: The 2019-nCoV epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Normal radiologic findings are present among some patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The disease severity (including oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count and chest X-ray/CT manifestations) predict poor clinical outcomes.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.16818900399999998,0.031796656,-0.10596993699999999,-0.148633882,-0.070264943,-0.019965001,-0.063334158,0.108134416,-0.11306622599999999,0.002298144,-0.000122957,0.074277308,-0.039554396,-0.0022026710000000002,-0.026479256,0.039167137000000005,-0.047959694000000004,0.138876771,-0.04004993,0.002428093,-0.052894625,0.043550919,-0.223004512,-0.09406775699999999,0.014419203,0.123983477,0.15613008,0.020429363,-0.004083486,-0.100670489
1789,"The Role of Human Coronaviruses in Children Hospitalized for Acute Bronchiolitis, Acute Gastroenteritis, and Febrile Seizures: A 2-Year Prospective Study","Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are associated with a variety of clinical presentations in children, but their role in disease remains uncertain. The objective of our prospective study was to investigate HCoVs associations with various clinical presentations in hospitalized children up to 6 years of age. Children hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis (AB), acute gastroenteritis (AGE), or febrile seizures (FS), and children admitted for elective surgical procedures (healthy controls) were included in the study. In patients with AB, AGE, and FS, a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and blood sample were obtained upon admission and the follow-up visit 14 days later, whereas in children with AGE a stool sample was also acquired upon admission; in healthy controls a NP swab and stool sample were taken upon admission. Amplification of polymerase 1b gene was used to detect HCoVs in the specimens. HCoVs-positive specimens were also examined for the presence of several other viruses. HCoVs were most often detected in children with FS (19/192, 9.9%, 95% CI: 6–15%), followed by children with AGE (19/218, 8.7%, 95% CI: 5.3–13.3%) and AB (20/308, 6.5%, 95% CI: 4.0–9.8%). The presence of other viruses was a common finding, most frequent in the group of children with AB (19/20, 95%, 95% CI: 75.1–99.8%), followed by FS (10/19, 52.6%, 95% CI: 28.9–75.6%) and AGE (7/19, 36.8%, 95% CI: 16.3–61.6%). In healthy control children HCoVs were detected in 3/156 (1.9%, 95% CI: 0.4–5.5%) NP swabs and 1/150 (0.7%, 95% CI: 0.02–3.3%) stool samples. It seems that an etiological role of HCoVs is most likely in children with FS, considering that they had a higher proportion of positive HCoVs results than patients with AB and those with AGE, and had the highest viral load; however, the co-detection of other viruses was 52.6%.

1791,Diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy of lung infiltrates in febrile neutropenic patients (allogeneic SCT excluded): updated guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Working Party (AGIHO) of the German Society of Hematology and Medical Oncology (DGHO)(†),"Up to 25% of patients with profound neutropenia lasting for >10 days develop lung infiltrates, which frequently do not respond to broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. While a causative pathogen remains undetected in the majority of cases, Aspergillus spp., Pneumocystis jirovecii, multi-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, mycobacteria or respiratory viruses may be involved. In at-risk patients who have received trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) prophylaxis, filamentous fungal pathogens appear to be predominant, yet commonly not proven at the time of treatment initiation. Pathogens isolated from blood cultures, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or respiratory secretions are not always relevant for the etiology of pulmonary infiltrates and should therefore be interpreted critically. Laboratory tests for detecting Aspergillus galactomannan, β-d-glucan or DNA from blood, BAL or tissue samples may facilitate the diagnosis; however, most polymerase chain reaction assays are not yet standardized and validated. Apart from infectious agents, pulmonary side-effects from cytotoxic drugs, radiotherapy or pulmonary involvement by the underlying malignancy should be included into differential diagnosis and eventually be clarified by invasive diagnostic procedures. Pre-emptive treatment with mold-active systemic antifungal agents improves clinical outcome, while other microorganisms are preferably treated only when microbiologically documented. High-dose TMP/SMX is first choice for treatment of Pneumocystis pneumonia, while cytomegalovirus pneumonia is treated primarily with ganciclovir or foscarnet in most patients. In a considerable number of patients, clinical outcome may be favorable despite respiratory failure, so that intensive care should be unrestrictedly provided in patients whose prognosis is not desperate due to other reasons.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.148993533,-0.010633644,-0.04288067,-0.104033529,-0.118241629,-0.018146227,-0.0044001809999999995,0.11279199699999999,-0.118686125,0.10609688099999999,-0.026104329,0.008418001999999999,0.058120245,0.022464152,-0.016780911000000003,-0.028201876,-0.005074187,0.086832787,0.006753473,0.036456151,0.055690815,-0.036164606,0.0007351339999999999,-0.044301060999999996,0.024045251,-0.031063788,-0.01720223,-0.008045059,-0.010966776000000001,-0.034783804
1809,Population-Based Pertussis Incidence and Risk Factors in Infants Less Than 6 Months in Nepal,"BACKGROUND: Pertussis is estimated to cause 2 percent of childhood deaths globally and is a growing public health problem in developed countries despite high vaccination coverage. Infants are at greatest risk of morbidity and mortality. Maternal vaccination during pregnancy may be effective to prevent pertussis in young infants, but population-based estimates of disease burden in infants are lacking, particularly in low-income countries. The objective of this study was to estimate the incidence of pertussis in infants less than 6 months of age in Sarlahi District, Nepal. METHODS: Nested within a population-based randomized controlled trial of influenza vaccination during pregnancy, infants were visited weekly from birth through 6 months to assess respiratory illness in the prior week. If any respiratory symptoms had occurred, a nasal swab was collected and tested with a multitarget pertussis polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The prospective cohort study includes infants observed between May 2011 and August 2014. RESULTS: The incidence of PCR-confirmed Bordetella pertussis was 13.3 cases per 1000 infant-years (95% confidence interval, 7.7–21.3) in a cohort of 3483 infants with at least 1 day of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based active home surveillance for respiratory illness, a low risk for pertussis was estimated among infants in rural Nepal. Nepal’s immunization program, which includes a childhood whole cell pertussis vaccine, may be effective in controlling pertussis in infants.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.105575158,-0.055125923,-0.021684158999999998,-0.03889988,-0.00439235,0.01422782,0.021739837999999997,-0.017829503,0.053469921,-0.041526755,0.030484578999999998,0.020574548,-0.064892895,-0.120858475,0.054301679000000005,0.115453271,0.021417147,-0.044812265,0.067204458,-0.050741499,-0.063017318,-0.076467126,-0.048371279,-0.039811621,0.11164586300000001,-0.070683564,0.049517755999999996,0.037522577,0.029154477999999998,-0.099906218
1811,Seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness against laboratory-confirmed influenza in 2015–2016: a hospital-based test-negative case–control study in Lithuania,"OBJECTIVE: A case–control study was conducted to assess seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness (SIVE) during the 2015–2016 influenza season. METHODS: A study was performed in three departments in Lithuania between 1 December 2015 and 1 May 2016. Data on demographic and clinical characteristics including influenza vaccination status were collected from the patients recommended to receive the seasonal influenza vaccine. Influenza virus infection was confirmed by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Ninety-one (56.4%) of the 163 included subjects were ≥65 years old. Fifteen (9.2%) subjects were vaccinated against influenza at least 2 weeks before the onset of influenza symptoms, 12 of them were ≥65 years old. Of the 72 (44.2%) influenza virus positive cases, 65 (39.9%) were confirmed with influenza A (including 50 cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09), eight (4.9%) were confirmed with influenza B and one was a co-infection. Unadjusted SIVE against any influenza, influenza type A and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was 57% (95% CI −41% to 87%), 52% (95% CI −57% to 85%) and 70% (95% CI −43% to 94%) respectively.

1814,Examining the relationship between household air pollution and infant microbial nasal carriage in a Ghanaian cohort,"Abstract Background Pneumonia, a leading cause of childhood mortality, is associated with household air pollution (HAP) exposure. Mechanisms between HAP and pneumonia are poorly understood, but studies suggest that HAP may increase the likelihood of bacterial, instead of viral, pneumonia. We assessed the relationship between HAP and infant microbial nasal carriage among 260 infants participating in the Ghana Randomized Air Pollution and Health Study (GRAPHS). Methods Data are from GRAPHS, a cluster-randomized controlled trial of cookstove interventions (improved biomass or LPG) versus the 3-stone (baseline) cookstove. Infants were surveyed for pneumonia during the first year of life and had routine personal exposure assessments. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from pneumonia cases (n = 130) and healthy controls (n = 130) were analyzed for presence of 22 common respiratory microbes by MassTag polymerase chain reaction. Data analyses included intention-to-treat (ITT) comparisons of microbial species presence by study arm, and exposure-response relationships. Results In ITT analyses, 3-stone arm participants had a higher mean number of microbial species than the LPG (LPG: 2.71, 3-stone: 3.34, p < 0.0001, n = 260). This difference was driven by increased bacterial (p < 0.0001) rather than viral species presence (non-significant). Results were pronounced in pneumonia cases and attenuated in healthy controls. Higher prevalence bacterial species were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Exposure-response relationships did not yield significant associations between measured CO and nasal microbial carriage. Conclusions Our intention-to-treat findings are consistent with a link between HAP and bacterial nasal carriage. No relationships were found for viral carriage. Given the null results in exposure-response analysis, it is likely that a pollutant besides CO is driving these differences.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.068934658,-0.057432187999999995,-0.050973252999999996,-0.100602355,-0.017498097,0.0037856920000000002,0.056069065,0.045612399000000005,-0.080262874,0.025912307000000002,-0.023829495,-0.016200535,-0.032152243999999996,-0.052108535,-0.014727961999999999,0.026201366,-0.039037947999999996,-0.033127791000000004,-0.01870411,-0.017915248999999998,-0.056469332000000004,0.067392923,0.036755078999999996,0.028211887,0.046009035,0.017039186,0.026292951000000002,0.011624443,0.040186797,-0.041809869
1819,The Effect of Steroid Use in Hospitalized Adults With Respiratory Syncytial Virus-Related Illness,"Rationale Systemic glucocorticosteroids (steroids) are commonly prescribed for patients with exacerbations of COPD during acute viral infections such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The effects of short-term high-dose steroid treatment on viral load and adaptive immunity to RSV have not been examined in adults. Objectives The objectives of this study were to measure peak viral load and duration of viral shedding, serum and nasal cytokines, RSV-specific antibody response, and lymphocyte subsets in patients admitted to the hospital with RSV infection and to compare patients treated with steroids to patients untreated with steroids. Methods Hospitalized adults who tested positive for RSV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on admission had respiratory samples collected for quantitative RT-PCR and cytokine analysis. Serum and nasal secretions were tested for RSV antibody and lymphocyte subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry at 2 days, 2 weeks, and 1 month. Main Results Thirty-three of 50 (66%) patients hospitalized with RSV received systemic steroids for a mean duration of 11 days. Those who received steroids more frequently wheezed and were less often febrile. There were no serious adverse events related to steroids and no significant differences in peak viral load, duration of RSV shedding, nasal cytokines, or lymphocyte subsets in patients treated with steroids and patients untreated with steroids. Antibody responses to RSV were slightly blunted in the steroid-treated group. Conclusions Short courses of systemic steroids in patients hospitalized with RSV infection did not affect viral load or shedding. Humoral immunity may be mildly diminished, and thus potential benefits of systemic steroids must be balanced against potential risks.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.15179379099999998,-0.059391016,-0.057506756,-0.052100852999999996,-0.04516486,-0.073924563,0.004571184,-0.026331552,0.0019787760000000002,-0.046833639,0.027988775,-0.06604191,-0.09925983199999999,0.055146102999999995,-0.083444818,-0.020247386000000003,0.0046479220000000005,0.07530146,-0.020725129,-0.002590147,0.016640913,-0.143220835,-0.040902536,-0.036153969,0.049193482999999996,-0.128995896,0.22207008,0.040139082,-0.06333986400000001,0.110225495
1831,Antibiotic Discontinuation Rates Associated with Positive Respiratory Viral Panel and Low Procalcitonin Results in Proven or Suspected Respiratory Infections,"INTRODUCTION: The differentiation of viral from bacterial pneumonia is important in determining whether antibiotics are appropriate for treatment of these infections. Advances in diagnostic technologies such as respiratory panels (RP) utilizing polymerase chain reactions to detect viruses and determination of procalcitonin (PCT) concentrations may aid in this differentiation. However, some studies have shown limited impact for this purpose and thus continuation of antibiotics despite results suggesting viral infection. Our objective was to characterize clinician-prescribing behavior at our institution once RP and/or PCT results were known and suggestive of a viral respiratory infection. METHODS: This retrospective analysis was based upon records of hospitalized patients in whom proven or possible respiratory infections as indicated by RP testing, respiratory bacterial culture or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 9th revision codes for acute infectious respiratory illness was documented. Patients evaluated were required to have a RP or PCT within the first 72 h of presentation. Drug orders were evaluated for discontinuation of antibiotic therapy within 48 h of a procalcitonin of <0.25 μg/mL, a positive viral RP result, or both. RESULTS: Of 4869 patients with PCT and/or RP results, 2031 were included. PCT and RP testing were obtained in 503 and 1823 patients, respectively, with 295 patients having both. Results of these tests suggested 789 patients were potential candidates for antibiotic avoidance. These included 219 with a PCT <0.25 μg/mL, 601 with a positive viral RP result, and 31 with both. Antibiotics were administered to 307 patients (39%) within the first 72 h. In these, antibiotics were discontinued within 48 h of laboratory results availability. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that positive viral RP and low PCT results are infrequently associated with discontinuation of antibiotic therapy in proven or possible respiratory infections at our institution. Direct interventions with clinicians are likely needed to correct this behavior and decrease unnecessary antibiotic use.

1836,Detection of respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens causing pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in Beijing using real-time PCR,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the etiology and prevalence of pediatric CAP in Beijing using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. METHODS: Between February 15, 2011 and January 18, 2012, 371 pediatric patients with CAP were enrolled at Beijing Children's Hospital. Sixteen respiratory viruses and two bacteria were detected from tracheal aspirate specimens using commercially available multiplex real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) kits. RESULTS: A single viral pathogen was detected in 35.3% of enrolled patients, multiple viruses in 11.6%, and virus/bacteria coinfection in 17.8%. In contrast, only 6.5% of patients had a single bacterial pathogen and 2.2% were infected with multiple bacteria. The etiological agent was unknown for 26.7% of patients. The most common viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (43.9%), rhinovirus (14.8%), parainﬂuenza virus (9.4%), and adenovirus (8.6%). In patients under three years of age, RSV (44.6%), rhinovirus (12.8%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.9%) were the most frequent pathogens. In children aged 3–7 years, S. pneumoniae (38.9%), RSV (30.6%), Haemophilus inﬂuenzae (19.4%), and adenovirus (19.4%) were most prevalent. Finally in children over seven years, RSV (47.3%), S. pneumoniae (41.9%), and rhinovirus (21.5%) infections were most frequent. CONCLUSIONS: Viral pathogens, specifically RSV, were responsible for the majority of CAP in pediatric patients. However, both S. pneumoniae and H. inﬂuenzae contributed as major causes of disease.

1839,The impact of rapid molecular diagnostic testing for respiratory viruses on outcomes for emergency department patients,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) in emergency departments (EDs) is associated with better patient and laboratory outcomes than standard multiplex PCR testing. DESIGN, SETTING: A before‐and‐after study in four metropolitan EDs in New South Wales. PARTICIPANTS: 1491 consecutive patients tested by standard multiplex PCR during July–December 2016, and 2250 tested by rapid PCR during July–December 2017. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital admissions; ED length of stay (LOS); test turnaround time; patient receiving test result before leaving the ED; ordering of other laboratory tests. RESULTS: Compared with those tested by standard PCR, fewer patients tested by rapid PCR were admitted to hospital (73.3% v 77.7%; P < 0.001) and more received their test results before leaving the ED (67.4% v 1.3%; P < 0.001); the median test turnaround time was also shorter (2.4 h [IQR, 1.6–3.9 h] v 26.7 h [IQR, 21.2–37.8 h]). The proportion of patients admitted to hospital was also lower in the rapid PCR group for both children under 18 (50.6% v 66.6%; P < 0.001) and patients over 60 years of age (84.3% v 91.8%; P < 0.001). Significantly fewer blood culture, blood gas, sputum culture, and respiratory bacterial and viral serology tests were ordered for patients tested by rapid PCR. ED LOS was similar for the rapid (7.4 h; IQR, 5.0–12.9 h) and standard PCR groups (6.5 h; IQR, 4.2–11.9 h; P = 0.27). CONCLUSION: Rapid PCR testing of ED patients for influenza virus and RSV was associated with better outcomes on a range of indicators, suggesting benefits for patients and the health care system.

1848,Self-Swabbing for Virological Confirmation of Influenza-Like Illness Among an Internet-Based Cohort in the UK During the 2014-2015 Flu Season: Pilot Study,"BACKGROUND: Routine influenza surveillance, based on laboratory confirmation of viral infection, often fails to estimate the true burden of influenza-like illness (ILI) in the community because those with ILI often manage their own symptoms without visiting a health professional. Internet-based surveillance can complement this traditional surveillance by measuring symptoms and health behavior of a population with minimal time delay. Flusurvey, the UK’s largest crowd-sourced platform for surveillance of influenza, collects routine data on more than 6000 voluntary participants and offers real-time estimates of ILI circulation. However, one criticism of this method of surveillance is that it is only able to assess ILI, rather than virologically confirmed influenza. OBJECTIVE: We designed a pilot study to see if it was feasible to ask individuals from the Flusurvey platform to perform a self-swabbing task and to assess whether they were able to collect samples with a suitable viral content to detect an influenza virus in the laboratory. METHODS: Virological swabbing kits were sent to pilot study participants, who then monitored their ILI symptoms over the influenza season (2014-2015) through the Flusurvey platform. If they reported ILI, they were asked to undertake self-swabbing and return the swabs to a Public Health England laboratory for multiplex respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction testing. RESULTS: A total of 700 swab kits were distributed at the start of the study; from these, 66 participants met the definition for ILI and were asked to return samples. In all, 51 samples were received in the laboratory, 18 of which tested positive for a viral cause of ILI (35%). CONCLUSIONS: This demonstrated proof of concept that it is possible to apply self-swabbing for virological laboratory testing to an online cohort study. This pilot does not have significant numbers to validate whether Flusurvey surveillance accurately reflects influenza infection in the community, but highlights that the methodology is feasible. Self-swabbing could be expanded to larger online surveillance activities, such as during the initial stages of a pandemic, to understand community transmission or to better assess interseasonal activity.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.113063182,-0.056392890999999994,-0.001515149,0.10598933599999999,-0.006660554,0.18769928800000002,-0.078631015,0.010340835999999999,-0.008014732,-0.079132135,0.016032137,-0.003020685,-0.00443122,-0.051472036,0.023601016000000002,0.009438044,-0.014762218,-0.074706232,0.030488196000000002,-0.070428642,-0.024455587,-0.051762318,-0.02000633,-0.074683258,0.042365670999999994,-0.0063031730000000005,-0.018173296999999998,0.06658024900000001,0.025253852,-0.027218199
1853,Asthmatics with exacerbation during acute respiratory illness exhibit unique transcriptional signatures within the nasal mucosa,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory illness is the leading cause of asthma exacerbations yet the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. To address the deficiencies in our understanding of the molecular events characterizing acute respiratory illness-induced asthma exacerbations, we undertook a transcriptional profiling study of the nasal mucosa over the course of acute respiratory illness amongst individuals with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis and no underlying respiratory disease. METHODS: Transcriptional profiling experiments were performed using the Agilent Whole Human Genome 4X44K array platform. Time point-based microarray and principal component analyses were conducted to identify and distinguish acute respiratory illness-associated transcriptional profiles over the course of our study. Gene enrichment analysis was conducted to identify biological processes over-represented within each acute respiratory illness-associated profile, and gene expression was subsequently confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: We found that acute respiratory illness is characterized by dynamic, time-specific transcriptional profiles whose magnitudes of expression are influenced by underlying respiratory disease and the mucosal repair signature evoked during acute respiratory illness. Most strikingly, we report that people with asthma who experience acute respiratory illness-induced exacerbations are characterized by a reduced but prolonged inflammatory immune response, inadequate activation of mucosal repair, and the expression of a newly described exacerbation-specific transcriptional signature. CONCLUSION: Findings from our study represent a significant contribution towards clarifying the complex molecular interactions that typify acute respiratory illness-induced asthma exacerbations.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.111319719,-0.033977724,-0.069959026,-0.046120885,-0.024890302000000003,-0.03658086,0.038682532,-0.06468679299999999,0.073281937,0.019485383999999998,-0.064053071,-0.056462009,0.022605912000000002,0.019890506000000002,0.017325498,-0.002224173,0.00884403,-0.12985612300000002,0.014255752,-0.056102275,0.037328417,-0.205488604,-0.076025992,0.026051644,-0.009554535,0.040102176,-0.10223276699999999,0.022785327,0.13064361800000002,0.009592526
1858,Effectiveness of Patient-Collected Swabs for Influenza Testing,"Abstract Objective To compare the effectiveness of self-collected and health care worker (HCW)–collected nasal swabs for detection of influenza viruses and determine the patients' preference for type of collection. Patients and Methods We enrolled adult patients presenting with influenzalike illness to the Emergency Department at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, from January 28, 2011, through April 30, 2011. Patients self-collected a midturbinate nasal flocked swab from their right nostril following written instructions. A second swab was then collected by an HCW from the left nostril. Swabs were tested for influenza A and B viruses by real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, and percent concordance between collection methods was determined. Results Of the 72 paired specimens analyzed, 25 were positive for influenza A or B RNA by at least one of the collection methods (34.7% positivity rate). When the 14 patients who had prior health care training were excluded, the qualitative agreement between collection methods was 94.8% (55 of 58). Two of the 58 specimens (3.4%) from patients without health care training were positive only by HCW collection, and 1 of 58 (1.7%) was positive only by patient self-collection. A total of 53.4% of patients (31 of 58) preferred the self-collection method over the HCW collection, and 25.9% (15 of 58) had no preference. Conclusion Self-collected midturbinate nasal swabs provide a reliable alternative to HCW collection for influenza A and B virus real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.16239642699999998,-0.02379925,-0.022990862,0.010642123,-0.023237453999999998,0.050851095,-0.11150387,0.076980113,-0.126464195,-0.027435022000000003,0.002566298,0.03855467,-0.01985179,0.038664246,0.006487353,0.0020649379999999997,0.011494251,-0.04249262,0.053449508,-0.05719859099999999,0.004657573,-0.050638325,-0.030070981,-0.063656475,0.0031157690000000004,0.005893373,-0.013952891,0.024850005,-0.040538594,-0.046780137
1866,A Retrospective Study Investigating Risks of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Mortality Following Human Metapneumovirus Infection in Hospitalized Adults,"BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a relatively recently identified respiratory virus that induces respiratory symptoms similar to those of respiratory syncytial virus infection in children. The characteristics of hMPV-infected adults are unclear because few cases have been reported. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of hospitalized adult patients with a positive multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay result from 2012 to 2016 at a single tertiary referral hospital in South Korea. We analyzed clinical characteristics of the enrolled patients and divided patients into an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) group and a non-ARDS group. RESULTS: In total, 110 adults were reviewed in this study. Their mean age was 61.4 years, and the majority (n = 105, 95.5%) had comorbidities or were immunocompromised. Most of the patients had pneumonia on chest X-ray (n = 88, 93.6%), 22 (20.0%) had ARDS, and 12 (10.9%) expired during hospitalization. The mortality rate for patients with ARDS was higher than that of the other patients (36.4% vs. 5.7%, P = 0.001). The risk factor for hMPV-associated ARDS was heart failure (odds ratio, 5.24; P = 0.044) and laboratory values were increased blood urea nitrogen and increased C-reactive protein. The acquisition site of infection was divided into community vs. nosocomial; 43 patients (39.1%) had a nosocomial infection. The risk factors for nosocomial infection were an immunocompromised state, malignancy and immunosuppressive treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that hMPV is one of the important respiratory pathogens important respiratory pathogen that causes pneumonia/ARDS in elderly, immunocompromised individuals and that it may be transmitted via the nosocomial route.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.24174733399999998,-0.062236729000000005,-0.132316023,-0.063223447,-0.030077313999999997,-0.105852141,-0.031231518,0.045246557,-0.028511112999999998,-0.007253165,-0.032624609,0.001208225,-0.059246463,0.067886008,-0.114738325,-0.03274599,0.006512405,0.131362364,-0.065314337,0.109643658,0.101261634,-0.023353868,-0.007478218000000001,-0.06351373,-0.043331082,0.00434646,-0.120586309,-0.103047313,-0.05557245,-0.056400355

1882,"Severity of Pneumonia in Under 5-Year-Old Children from Developing Countries: A Multicenter, Prospective, Observational Study","Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children. The objectives were to evaluate the microbiological agents linked with hypoxemia in hospitalized children with pneumonia from developing countries, to identify predictors of hypoxemia, and to characterize factors associated with in-hospital mortality. A multicenter, observational study was conducted in five hospitals, from India (Lucknow, Vadu), Madagascar (Antananarivo), Mali (Bamako), and Paraguay (San Lorenzo). Children aged 2–60 months with radiologically confirmed pneumonia were enrolled prospectively. Respiratory and whole blood specimens were collected, identifying viruses and bacteria by real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Microbiological agents linked with hypoxemia at admission (oxygen saturation < 90%) were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression, and factors associated with 14-day in-hospital mortality were assessed by bivariate Cox regression. Overall, 405 pneumonia cases (3,338 hospitalization days) were analyzed; 13 patients died within 14 days of hospitalization. Hypoxemia prevalence was 17.3%. Detection of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in respiratory samples was independently associated with increased risk of hypoxemia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.4, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.0–5.8 and aOR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1–5.3, respectively). Lower chest indrawing and cyanosis were predictive of hypoxemia (positive likelihood ratios = 2.3 and 2.4, respectively). Predictors of death were Streptococcus pneumoniae detection by blood PCR (crude hazard ratio [cHR] = 4.6, 95% CI = 1.5–14.0), procalcitonin ≥ 50 ng/mL (cHR = 22.4, 95% CI = 7.3–68.5) and hypoxemia (cHR = 4.8, 95% CI = 1.6–14.4). These findings were consistent on bivariate analysis. hMPV and RSV in respiratory samples were linked with hypoxemia, and S. pneumoniae in blood was associated with increased risk of death among hospitalized children with pneumonia in developing countries.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.209492065,-0.08858853800000001,-0.066027833,-0.055317665,-0.00081195,-0.081251061,0.005922770999999999,-0.026491737,-0.015713512,-0.08448682699999999,0.010709576,0.029563548999999998,-0.11792506,-0.068124457,-0.11316201199999999,0.073426884,-0.08453656300000001,-0.001798944,-0.013322829,-0.005158092,-0.131425859,0.154726348,0.09640716,0.036320108,0.011006598999999999,-0.044243223,-0.008860851,-0.20084356,-0.059106202000000004,-0.064051156
1883,Limited Utility of Polymerase Chain Reaction in Induced Sputum Specimens for Determining the Causes of Childhood Pneumonia in Resource-Poor Settings: Findings From the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) Study,"BACKGROUND. Sputum examination can be useful in diagnosing the cause of pneumonia in adults but is less well established in children. We sought to assess the diagnostic utility of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of respiratory viruses and bacteria in induced sputum (IS) specimens from children hospitalized with severe or very severe pneumonia. METHODS. Among children aged 1–59 months, we compared organism detection by multiplex PCR in IS and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens. To assess whether organism presence or density in IS specimens was associated with chest radiographic evidence of pneumonia (radiographic pneumonia), we compared prevalence and density in IS specimens from children with radiographic pneumonia and children with suspected pneumonia but without chest radiographic changes or clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of pneumonia (nonpneumonia group). RESULTS. Among 4232 cases with World Health Organization–defined severe or very severe pneumonia, we identified 1935 (45.7%) with radiographic pneumonia and 573 (13.5%) with nonpneumonia. The organism detection yield was marginally improved with IS specimens (96.2% vs 92.4% for NP/OP specimens for all viruses combined [P = .41]; 96.9% vs 93.3% for all bacteria combined [P = .01]). After accounting for presence in NP/OP specimens, no organism was detected more frequently in the IS specimens from the radiographic pneumonia compared with the nonpneumonia cases. Among high-quality IS specimens, there were no statistically significant differences in organism density, except with cytomegalovirus, for which there was a higher quantity in the IS specimens from cases with radiographic pneumonia compared with the nonpneumonia cases (median cycle threshold value, 27.9 vs 28.5, respectively; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS. Using advanced molecular methods with IS specimens provided little additional diagnostic information beyond that obtained with NP/OP swab specimens.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.15906987,-0.032371098,-0.025853604,-0.04848311,-0.019563122,-0.06443990200000001,0.003173268,0.016050659,-0.06913045599999999,0.013075159,-0.023782479,0.015139328999999998,-0.026665077000000002,-0.057350255,-0.041291822,0.008226717,-0.051957634,0.011461374,-0.045540635999999995,-0.035815812,-0.067563583,0.162006164,0.066087372,-0.014565703999999999,0.016540936000000003,0.06305388,0.02581015,-0.004927525,-0.009282564,-0.051219855999999994
1890,Respiratory viruses from hospitalized children with severe pneumonia in the Philippines,"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia remains a leading cause of child death in developing countries. The viruses in severe pneumonia remain poorly defined. METHODS: The study was conducted at the Eastern Visayas Regional Medical Center in Tacloban City, Philippines from May 2008 to May 2009. Patients aged 8 days to 13 years old who were admitted to the Department of Pediatrics with severe pneumonia were enrolled for the study. Upon admission, polymerase chain reaction was performed using nasopharyngeal swabs and blood cultures to detect respiratory viruses and bacteria, respectively. RESULT: Among the 819 patients enrolled, at least one virus was detected in 501 cases (61.2%). In addition, 423 cases were positive for a single virus while bacteria were detected in the blood culture sample of 31 cases. The most commonly detected viruses were human rhinoviruses (n = 189), including types A (n = 103), B (n = 17), and C (n = 69), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n = 165). Novel viruses such as human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus NL63, human bocavirus, and human polyomaviruses WU and KI were also detected. There were 70 deaths, and one or more viruses were detected in 35 (50%) of these cases. Positivity only for influenza A virus (OR = 4.3, 95% CI = 1.3-14.6) was significantly associated with fatal outcome. From the blood culture, Burkholderia cepacia group (n = 9), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 4), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 4), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 1), and Salmonella C1 (n = 1) were also isolated. CONCLUSION: Viruses were commonly detected in children with severe pneumonia in the Philippines. Hence, viral etiologies should be considered while developing better effective strategies to reduce child pneumonia-related deaths in developing countries.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.236739184,-0.097768854,-0.108969891,0.01451259,0.030831769,-0.013525441000000001,0.006868929,0.025985971,-0.08744291,0.034500464,-0.015181866,-0.010519013,0.00730816,-0.016933676,-0.027066307,-0.019741535,-0.046465499,-0.005777819,-0.003516651,0.059086470999999995,-0.03830451,0.15148587300000002,0.066700462,0.0908279,0.000322325,0.042362523,0.030840426,0.043065333,-0.044379197999999995,-0.10037841900000001
1898,A case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis following Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection,"We report a case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) secondary to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection that failed to improve with methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG); who responded with plasmapheresis. A 21- year- old female with an unremarkable medical history, initially presented to an outside hospital with fever and an influenza-like illness and was subsequently intubated for worsening sensorium. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was suggestive of ADEM or vasculitis for which she received five days of pulse steroids and IVIG. She showed no signs of improvement and was transferred to our hospital for plasmapheresis. Her work up revealed an elevated IgM antibody and positive sputum for Mycoplasma pneumonia by polymerase chain reaction, suggesting the pathogen as the culprit for her ADEM. Intravenous azithromycin and daily plasmapheresis were initiated for seven consecutive days. Following commencement of her treatment, the patient experienced good recovery and was subsequently extubated. She continued to improve with physical therapy and gained mobility, with the help of a walker. Patients commonly present with ADEM following viral infection or vaccination and less frequently post bacterial infection. The current treatment of ADEM due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae is based on limited case reports. Our patient poorly responded to pulse steroids and IVIG, while she markedly improved on azithromycin and plasmapheresis.

1902,Current and future antiviral therapy of severe seasonal and avian influenza,"Abstract The currently circulating H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes of influenza A virus cause a transient, febrile upper respiratory illness in most adults and children (“seasonal influenza”), but infants, the elderly, immunodeficient and chronically ill persons may develop life-threatening primary viral pneumonia or complications such as bacterial pneumonia. By contrast, avian influenza viruses such as the H5N1 virus that recently emerged in Southeast Asia can cause severe disease when transferred from domestic poultry to previously healthy people (“avian influenza”). Most H5N1 patients present with fever, cough and shortness of breath that progress rapidly to adult respiratory distress syndrome. In seasonal influenza, viral replication remains confined to the respiratory tract, but limited studies indicate that H5N1 infections are characterized by systemic viral dissemination, high cytokine levels and multiorgan failure. Gastrointestinal infection and encephalitis also occur. The licensed anti-influenza drugs (the M2 ion channel blockers, amantadine and rimantadine, and the neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir) are beneficial for uncomplicated seasonal influenza, but appropriate dosing regimens for severe seasonal or H5N1 viral infections have not been defined. Treatment options may be limited by the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viruses. Ribavirin has also been used to a limited extent to treat influenza. This article reviews licensed drugs and treatments under development, including high-dose oseltamivir; parenterally administered neuraminidase inhibitors, peramivir and zanamivir; dimeric forms of zanamivir; the RNA polymerase inhibitor T-705; a ribavirin prodrug, viramidine; polyvalent and monoclonal antibodies; and combination therapies.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.11262631599999999,-0.108663337,-0.08962538099999999,0.169918404,-0.083205424,0.29080285100000003,-0.059651922,0.003210007,-0.002704186,0.001831084,0.018079684,0.009035289,0.055122683,-0.004542568,-0.009359343000000001,-0.0010924,-0.033999624,0.085458084,0.0040985959999999995,0.059504999999999995,0.006730728,0.012802416,-0.04670832,0.059705699,0.011950191,-0.010088221,-0.010202522,-0.032734448,0.095127349,0.022714147999999997
1908,Molecular epidemiology of human rhinovirus infections in the pediatric emergency department,"Abstract Background Human rhinovirus (HRV) infections are highly prevalent, genetically diverse, and associated with both mild upper respiratory tract and more severe lower tract illnesses (LRTI). Objective To characterize the molecular epidemiology of HRV infections in young children seeking acute medical care. Study design Nasal swabs collected from symptomatic children <3 years of age receiving care in the Emergency and Urgent Care Departments at Seattle Children's Hospital were analyzed by a rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system (FilmArray®) for multiple viruses including HRV/enterovirus. HRV-positive results were confirmed by laboratory-developed real-time reverse transcription PCR (LD-PCR). Clinical data were collected by chart review. A subset of samples was selected for sequencing using the 5′ noncoding region. Associations between LRTI and HRV species and genotypes were estimated using logistic regression analysis. Results Of 595 samples with HRV/enterovirus detected by FilmArray, 474 (80%) were confirmed as HRV by LD-PCR. 211 (96%) of 218 selected samples were sequenced; HRV species A, B, and C were identified in 133 (63%), 6 (3%), and 72 (34%), respectively. LRTI was more common in HRV-C than HRV-A illness episodes (adjusted OR [95% CI] 2.35[1.03–5.35). Specific HRV-A and HRV-C genotypes detected in multiple patients were associated with a greater proportion of LRTI episodes. In 18 patients with >1 HRV-positive illness episodes, a distinct genotype was detected in each. Conclusion Diverse HRV genotypes circulated among symptomatic children during the study period. We found an association between HRV-C infections and LRTI in this patient population and evidence of association between specific HRV genotypes and LRTI.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.152374768,-0.065014549,-0.02363592,-0.045172784,0.060450654000000006,-0.09872608599999999,0.06823525700000001,-0.041699032999999996,0.028556647999999997,-0.008533281,0.003463465,-0.001888637,-0.051125292999999995,-0.001125668,0.023965469,0.023818811000000002,-0.013886393,-0.043505342,0.089724615,-0.11518087,-0.014494466000000001,-0.104881369,-0.115773146,0.135754059,-0.14730286,0.174965272,-0.132034712,-0.035276834,0.16912036100000002,0.347142584
1909,Impact of Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction Testing for Respiratory Pathogens on Healthcare Resource Utilization for Pediatric Inpatients,"Objective To assess whether multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) vs non-mPCR testing impacts the use of antibiotics, chest radiographs, and isolation precautions. Study design We retrospectively compared use of antibiotics, chest radiographs, and isolation precautions for patients <18 years old (excluding neonates) hospitalized at a tertiary referral center tested for respiratory pathogens in the emergency department or during the first 2 hospital days, during 2 periods: June 2010-June 2012 (non-mPCR group) vs October 2012-May 2014 (mPCR group). Results Subjects (n = 2430) in the mPCR group were older, had more complex chronic conditions, and were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit more often compared with the non-mPCR (n = 2349) group. Subjects in the mPCR group had more positive tests (42.4% vs 14.4%, P < .01), received fewer days of antibiotics (4 vs 5 median antibiotic days, P < .01), fewer chest radiographs performed, (59% vs 78%, P < .01), and were placed in isolation longer (20 vs 0 median isolation-hours, P < .01) compared with the non-mPCR group. In multivariable regression, patients tested with mPCR were less likely to receive antibiotics for ≥2 days (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.5-0.6), chest radiographs at admission (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.4), and more likely to be in isolation for ≥2 days (OR 2.4, 95% CI 2.1-2.8) compared with the non-mPCR group. Conclusions Use of mPCR testing for respiratory viruses among hospitalized patients was significantly associated with decreased healthcare resource utilization, including decreased use of antibiotics and chest radiographs, and increased use of isolation precautions.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.09348365900000001,-0.035288101,-0.045884855,-0.116422756,-0.028783721,-0.013952286000000001,-0.019237874,0.052328853,-0.08915051,-0.02757248,-0.008014361,0.044950883,-0.0621965,-0.019382366,-0.045912693,0.050944272,-0.024897917999999998,-0.008923598,0.017789946,0.000601153,-0.06181836,-0.039881846,-0.032448749,-0.017159268000000002,0.00158564,-0.02544948,-0.016654174,-0.112004595,-0.050992768,-0.02521996
1924,Increased Detection of Viruses in Children with Respiratory Tract Infection Using PCR,"Respiratory viruses are a common cause of respiratory tract infection (RTI), particularly in neonates and children. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral infections could improve clinical outcomes and reduce the use of antibiotics and treatment sessions. Advances in diagnostic technology contribute to the accurate detection of viruses. We performed a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to investigate the viral etiology in pediatric patients and compared the detection rates with those determined using traditional antigen tests and virus cultures. Fifteen respiratory viruses were included in our investigation: respiratory syncytial virus A/B (RSV), influenza virus A (FluA) and influenza virus B (FluB), human metapneumovirus (MPV), enterovirus (EV), human parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1–4, human rhinovirus (RV), human coronavirus OC43, NL63, and 229E, human adenovirus (ADV), and human bocavirus (Boca). In total, 474 specimens were collected and tested. Respiratory viruses were detected more frequently by PCR (357, 75.3%) than they were by traditional tests (229, 49.3%). The leading pathogens were RSV (113, 23.8%), RV (72, 15.2%), PIV3 (53, 11.2%), FluA (51, 10.8%), and ADV (48, 10.1%). For children younger than 5 years, RSV and RV were most prevalent; for children older than 5 years, FluA and ADV were the most frequently detected. Of the specimens, 25.8% (92/357) were coinfected with two or more viruses. RV, Boca, PIV2, FluB, and PIV4 had higher rates of coinfection; MPV and PIV1 had the lowest rates of coinfection (9.1% and 5.3%). To conclude, the detection power of PCR was better than that of traditional antigen tests and virus cultures when considering the detection of respiratory viruses. RSV and RV were the leading viral pathogens identified in the respiratory specimens. One-quarter of the positive specimens were coinfected with two or more viruses. In the future, further application of PCR may contribute to the rapid and accurate diagnosis of respiratory viruses and could improve patient outcomes.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.30145668800000003,-0.11033553800000001,-0.016526099,0.19349994,0.057459672,-0.090212666,0.065263671,-0.066931863,0.070954245,0.052813146,-0.018823298000000002,-0.074509947,0.060454018,0.0060654969999999996,0.022859018,-0.077868464,0.01723646,-0.027675861,0.019988363999999998,-0.011140188999999998,0.043015066,-0.051671815,0.068385778,0.019091552,0.009693015,-0.051568399,0.103157265,0.061355812999999995,-0.076593948,-0.026268115
1925,"Clinical Features, Virus Identification, and Sinusitis as a Complication of Upper Respiratory Tract Illness in Children Ages 4-7 Years","Objective To determine the rate of sinusitis complicating upper respiratory tract illnesses (URIs) in children. We prospectively identified the clinical, virologic, and epidemiologic characteristics of URIs in a population of 4- to 7-year-old children followed for 1 year. Study design This was an observational cohort study in 2 primary care pediatric practices in Madison, Wisconsin. Nasal samples were obtained during 4 asymptomatic surveillance visits and during symptomatic URIs. A polymerase chain reaction-based assay for 9 respiratory viruses was performed on nasal samples. A diagnosis of sinusitis was based on published criteria. Results Two hundred thirty-six children ages 48-96 months were enrolled. A total of 327 URIs were characterized. The mean number of URIs per child was 1.3 (range 0-9) per year. Viruses were detected in 81% of URIs; rhinovirus (RV) was most common. Seventy-two percent of URIs were resolved clinically by the 10th day. RV-A and RV-C were detected more frequently at URI visits; RV-B was detected at the same rate for both asymptomatic surveillance visits and URI visits. Sinusitis was diagnosed in 8.8% of symptomatic URIs. Viruses were detected frequently (33%) in samples from asymptomatic children. Conclusions Sinusitis occurred in 8.8% of symptomatic URIs in our study. The virus most frequently detected with URIs in children was RV; RV-A and RV-C detection but not RV-B detection were associated with illness. Viruses, especially RV, are detected frequently in asymptomatic children. Most URIs have improved or resolved by the 10th day after onset. Children experienced a mean of 1.3 URIs per year, which was lower than expected.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.09914793699999999,-0.06130904400000001,-0.015808647,-0.033533369,0.02947674,-0.056531818,0.056300765,-0.038179536,0.038953196,-0.017990244,0.008945340999999999,-0.010317299,-0.040095069,-0.057802357,0.027184779,0.01825815,-0.007928142,-0.04805318099999999,0.015906156,-0.042023844000000005,-0.021296677000000003,0.008840604,-0.013019073999999999,0.035496991,0.008016647,0.033842209,-0.007237284,0.024834314,0.006700458,-0.006126372
1927,A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster,"Summary Background An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date. Methods In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done. Findings From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged >60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats. Interpretation Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.

1929,Viral etiologies of lower respiratory tract infections among Egyptian children under five years of age,"BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are responsible for a considerable number of deaths among children, particularly in developing countries. In Egypt and the Middle East region, there is a lack of data regarding the viral causes of LRTI. In this study, we aimed to identify the relative prevalence of various respiratory viruses that contribute to LRTIs in young children. Although, nucleic acid-based methods have gained importance as a sensitive tool to determine the viral infections, their use is limited because of their prohibitive cost in low-income countries. Therefore, we applied three different laboratory methods, and presented the different virus prevalence patterns detected by each method. METHODS: We collected nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, demographic data and, clinical data from 450 children under five years of age who presented with LRTI at Abou El Reesh hospital in Cairo during a one-year period. To identify the viral causes of the LRTI we used direct fluorescence assay, real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-RT-PCR), and shell vial culture. We tested for eight major respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-nine patients (59.9%) had a viral infection, among which 10.8% had a co-infection with two or more viruses. By all three methods, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most predominant, and parainfluenza virus type 2 (HPIV-2), influenza B virus (FLUBV) were the least predominant. Other viral prevalence patterns differed according to the detection method used. The distribution of various viruses among different age groups and seasonal distribution of the viruses were also determined. CONCLUSIONS: RSV and human adenovirus were the most common respiratory viruses detected by rt-RT-PCR. Co-infections were found to be frequent among children and the vast majority of co-infections were detected by nucleic acid-based detection assays.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.27277708,-0.07856381700000001,0.040545622999999996,0.186188963,0.050673539000000004,-0.10867888,0.079971936,-0.072444019,0.08607315199999999,0.048679982000000004,0.007133972,-0.074469964,0.013908331000000001,-0.0035811090000000003,0.012884373999999999,-0.047377551,0.018400226000000002,-0.010571276000000001,-0.014302843999999999,0.016074794,-0.014626036,0.035550277000000005,-0.008838018000000001,0.06843311099999999,-0.009024358,-0.005554406,0.079104265,0.011883945,-0.016217551,0.014358596000000001
1930,What is the Role of Respiratory Viruses in Community-Acquired Pneumonia? What is the Best Therapy for Influenza and Other Viral Causes of Community-Acquired Pneumonia?,"Respiratory viruses including influenza have long been appreciated as a cause of community acquired pneumonia (CAP), particularly among children, people with serious medical co-morbidities and military recruits. They are increasingly recognized as a cause of CAP among adults, particularly older adults. Polymerase chain reaction-based testing has allowed detection of newer agents (e.g. human metapneumovirus, coronavirus HKU1 and NL63) as well as improved the ability to detect “old” viral infections such as influenza virus and rhinovirus. When PCR is used, viruses have been detected in 45–75% of children and 15–54% of adults with CAP. Co-infection with viruses and bacteria is common and it remains challenging to determine which patients have only viral infection as the cause of CAP. Treatment for influenza with neuraminidase inhibitors should be started promptly for patients with CAP when influenza is suspected or documented, regardless of evidence of bacterial co-infection. Better ways to diagnose viral CAP and to integrate detection into management are urgently needed, as well as better treatment options for non-influenza respiratory viral infections.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.219246683,-0.131695313,-0.09134184599999999,0.13003405099999998,-0.049403248,0.094534696,-0.037842929,0.04845726400000001,-0.11410983699999999,0.07377421599999999,-0.063814763,-0.023608122000000002,0.10274947599999999,0.001715159,-0.06447241299999999,-0.064327806,-0.007023906999999999,0.012805077,-0.072622701,0.12681841900000002,-0.01234783,0.130619627,0.181333628,0.091835674,0.109573231,-0.089948025,-0.021471417000000003,0.04310090900000001,0.19085014,0.078583504
1933,Viral Respiratory Infections in Preterm Infants during and after Hospitalization,"Objective To determine the burden of viral respiratory infections in preterm infants both during and subsequent to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) hospitalization and to compare this with term infants living in the community. Study design From March 2013 through March 2015, we enrolled 189 newborns (96 term and 93 preterm) into a prospective, longitudinal study obtaining nose/throat swabs within 7 days of birth, weekly while hospitalized and then monthly to 4 months after hospital discharge. Taqman array cards were used to identify 16 viral respiratory pathogens by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were gathered from electronic medical records, and parent interview while hospitalized with interval histories collected at monthly visits. The hospital course of all preterm infants who underwent late-onset sepsis evaluations was reviewed. Results Over 119 weeks, we collected 618 nose/throat swabs from at risk preterm infants in our level IV regional NICU. Only 4 infants had viral respiratory infections, all less than 28 weeks gestation at birth. Two infants were symptomatic with the infections recognized by the clinical team. The daily risk of acquiring a respiratory viral infection in preterm infants in the NICU was significantly lower than in the full term cohort living in the community. Once discharged from the hospital, viral respiratory infections were common in all infants. Conclusions Viral respiratory infections are infrequent in a NICU with strict infection prevention strategies and do not appear to cause unrecognized illness. Both preterm and term infants living in the community quickly acquire respiratory viral infections.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.148292471,-0.072537702,-0.07654093299999999,-0.025818967,-0.023206859,-0.059850663,0.051423122,-0.012063263999999999,0.048135245,0.017775406,0.021364913,-0.031365527000000004,-0.014227719,-0.059304614000000005,0.07667218,0.057948405999999994,0.032346075,-0.041888022999999996,0.067378071,-0.004024338,-0.052759325,-0.095451371,-0.119712455,-0.022982116,0.091748261,-0.044733925,0.028712223999999998,-0.002954876,0.031171654,-0.050269402000000005
1937,Unrecognized Viral Respiratory Tract Infections in Premature Infants during their Birth Hospitalization: A Prospective Surveillance Study in Two Neonatal Intensive Care Units,"Objective To determine the frequency and effects of nosocomial respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in premature neonates, including those who may be asymptomatic. Study design We performed a year-long surveillance for RVIs in infants <33 weeks gestational age admitted to 2 Syracuse neonatal intensive care units. Infants were enrolled within 3 days of neonatal intensive care unit admission and were sampled for RVIs until discharge using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay capable of detecting 17 different respiratory viruses or subtypes. Results Twenty-six of 50 prematurely born infants (52%) tested positive for a respiratory virus at least once during their birth hospitalization. Testing positive for a respiratory virus was significantly associated with longer length of stay (70 days vs 35 days, P = .002) and prolonged ventilatory support (51 vs 13 days, P = .002). Infants who tested positive for a respiratory virus during their birth hospitalization had more than twice the rate of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (P < .05). Conclusion Nosocomial RVIs were frequent in our study population, despite the absence of clinical indicators of illness. Length of hospital stay was significantly longer and a diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was more common in infants who had respiratory viruses detected.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.180284713,-0.067742599,-0.065064489,-0.010123051999999999,0.010149968,-0.064375515,0.01403094,0.006364489,0.016937939,0.004169201,0.027330705,-0.018036187,-0.037712775,-0.020699767,0.069984461,0.041766632000000005,0.035850053,-0.045575739000000004,0.083846895,0.001799825,-0.038537132,-0.134035707,-0.100870426,-0.025017754,0.048816886,-0.022592865,0.019212359,0.000289848,-0.009958945,-0.09673719800000001
1940,Utility of DNA Microarrays for Detection of Viruses in Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in Children,"Objective To assess the utility of a panviral DNA microarray platform (Virochip) in the detection of viruses associated with pediatric respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Study design The Virochip was compared with conventional direct fluorescent antibody (DFA)- and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing for the detection of respiratory viruses in 278 consecutive nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from 222 children. Results The Virochip was superior in performance to DFA, showing a 19% increase in the detection of 7 respiratory viruses included in standard DFA panels, and was similar to virus-specific PCR (sensitivity, 85% to 90%; specificity, ≥99%; positive predictive value, 94% to 96%; negative predictive value, 97% to 98%) in the detection of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A, and rhinoviruses/enteroviruses. The Virochip also detected viruses not routinely tested for or missed by DFA and PCR, as well as double infections and infections in critically ill patients that DFA failed to detect. Conclusions Given its favorable sensitivity and specificity profile and expanded spectrum for detection, microarray-based viral testing holds promise for clinical diagnosis of pediatric RTIs.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.157517589,-0.020087523,0.08766554800000001,0.089081471,-0.011103726000000001,-0.038980658,0.025314188999999997,-0.00830722,-0.008879039,0.045411203,-0.007395205,-0.029134752000000003,0.04561115599999999,-0.020462973,0.040283886,-0.030813236,0.015563618999999999,-0.058355574,0.033534773,-0.071867351,-0.0031632809999999996,-0.025428952999999997,0.024983464,-0.013089667,0.015134756999999999,-0.00284096,-0.039127439,-0.040196304,-0.016938806,-0.039497643
1941,Viral Respiratory Tract Infection During the First Postoperative Year Is a Risk Factor for Chronic Rejection After Lung Transplantation,"BACKGROUND: Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is the major limiting factor for long-term survival in lung transplant recipients. Viral respiratory tract infection (VRTI) has been previously associated with CLAD development. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of VRTI during the first year after lung transplantation in relation to CLAD development. METHOD: Ninety-eight patients undergoing lung transplantation were prospectively enrolled between 2009 and 2012. They were monitored for infections with predefined intervals and on extra visits during the first year, the total follow-up period ranged between 5 and 8 years. Nasopharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were analyzed using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction panel for respiratory pathogens. Data regarding clinical characteristics and infectious events were recorded. RESULTS: Viral respiratory tract infection during the first year was identified as a risk factor for long-term CLAD development (P = 0.041, hazard ratio 1.94 [1.03-3.66]) in a time-dependent multivariate Cox regression analysis. We also found that coronavirus in particular was associated with increased risk for CLAD development. Other identified risk factors were acute rejection and cyclosporine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that VRTI during the first year after lung transplantation is associated with long-term CLAD development and that coronavirus infections in particular might be a risk factor.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.090517068,-0.032119009,-0.056117495,-0.066885126,-0.032292711,-0.011172411,0.037602224,0.00668048,0.011913311999999999,0.022691459,-0.0099051,-0.0072963459999999996,0.023137769,0.005237983,0.00946696,0.005940733,-0.008141579,-0.012850981000000001,0.004028593,0.006605781,-0.00014154,-0.058191957999999995,-0.063599488,0.008423752,0.030804191,-0.037736727000000005,-0.028167986000000002,-0.044506917,0.013600536000000002,-0.029924267999999997
