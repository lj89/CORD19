## Reuseable pipelines
### Reuse the pipeline built in Part 4 to answer different questions


to validate the question answering system and also demo how to resuse the pipeline created.
Data:

Therapeut3775 subset generated on april 1 in part 3 notebook


then validate the results use pipeline in Part 5



------------------------------------

I also compared using full abstract and keyword WINDOW generated for question answering. 

asked more questions:

Question1=['What are clinical effective therapeutics or drugs for COVID-19?']

Question2=['What are the therapeutic target genes for COVID-19 or coronavirus?']

Question3=['What are the therapeutic targets for COVID-19 or coronavirus ?']


from validation results, ask questions1,2 on WINDOW did not yield good results.



Like to use Question2 to evualate since it has reference answer from Benchsci dataset.

Question3 is the question I really want answer since therapeutic is not limited to gene related methods.


## Results

#### Question2=['What are the therapeutic target genes for COVID-19 or coronavirus?']

#### for WINDOW method (see code on my github) although answers are kind of related. but not detail enough.
#### so WINDOW is not very useful to dig deep, judging from Q2. did not mention many genes in benchsci data.


### for Q1 
have not got the chance to validate. but i think
at least should mention hiv drug effective to be a good answer


code for using full abstract (go to the end for the question answring code):
