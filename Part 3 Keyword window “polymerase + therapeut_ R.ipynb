    "Use Keyword Window method we retrieved 3775 windows mentioned \"therapeut\", 2560 windows mentioned \"polymerase\", and 181 windows mentioned both “polymerase + therapeut\".

    "### What can we learn from the keyword window “polymerase + therapeut”?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the keyword window method stated in last post, 2,391 windows (from 1,941 papers) mentioned “polymerase” were selected from the 33k CORD19 abstracts. Here is a result plot of clustering these 1,941 papers (I tried several ways to vectorize the abstracts to high dimensional matrix and this method seemed cluster better). can do a topic modeling for each group to give each of them a label.\n",

    "keyword window search this subset with “therapeut” yielded 113 windows with window size of 30.\n",
    "I think there could be machine learning method to extract knowledge from this result but I couldn’t help reading the output. reading 3k words is manageable comparing with reading 33k papers.\n",

    "#### Pros\n",
    "This method is highly efficient with finding signals in the noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "The downside is you have to manually decide the keyword based on your domain knowledge. (luckily I have the domain knowledge from my years of biomedical research experience.) For example, you have to have the basic idea why “polyermase” can be connected with “therapeutic”. Or you would not randomly put these two words together. You have to have ideas what you are looking for. Or you need to consult the domain expert before you start the search. \n",

    "Full Abstract:”RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is essential to viral replication and is therefore one of the primary targets of countermeasures against these dangerous infectious agents. Development of broad-spectrum therapeutics targeting polymerases has been hampered by the extreme sequence variability of these sequences. RdRps range in length from 400â€“800 residues, yet contain only âˆ¼20 residues that are conserved in most species. In this study, we made structure-based comparisons that are independent of sequence composition using a recently developed algorithm. We identified residue-to-residue correspondences of multiple protein structures and created (two-dimensional) structure-based alignment maps of 37 polymerase structures that provide both sequence and structure details. Using these maps, we determined that âˆ¼75% of each polymerase species consists of seven protein segments, each of which has high structural similarity to segments in other species, though they are widely divergent in sequence composition and order. We define each of these segments as a â€˜homomorphâ€™, and each includes (though most are much larger than) the well-known conserved polymerase motifs. All homomorphs contact the template tunnel or nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) entry tunnel and the exterior of the protein, suggesting they constitute a structural and functional skeleton common among the polymerases.”\n",

    "“Recent history is punctuated by the emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS- and MERS-CoV into human circulation. Upon infecting host cells, coronaviruses assemble a multi-subunit RNA-synthesis complex of viral non-structural proteins (NSP) responsible for the replication and transcription of the viral genome. Here, we present the 3.1 [A] resolution structure of the SARS-CoV NSP12 polymerase bound to its essential co-factors, NSP7 and NSP8, using single particle cryo-electron microscopy. NSP12 possesses an architecture common to all viral polymerases as well as a large N-terminal extension containing a kinase-like fold and is unexpectedly bound by two NSP8 co-factors. This structure illuminates the assembly of the coronavirus core RNA-synthesis machinery, provides key insights into NSP12 polymerase catalysis and fidelity and acts as a template for the design of novel antiviral therapeutics.”\n",

What is known, however, is that the interface between humans and animals is of paramount importance in the process. This review will discuss the importance of the human-animal interface to the disease emergence process. We also provide an overview of factors that are believed to contribute to the origin and global spread of emerging infectious diseases and offer suggestions that may serve as future prevention strategies, such as social mobilization, public health education, behavioral change and communication strategies. Since there exists no comprehensive global surveillance system to monitor zoonotic disease emergence, the intervention measures discussed herein may prove effective temporary alternatives.”\n",
